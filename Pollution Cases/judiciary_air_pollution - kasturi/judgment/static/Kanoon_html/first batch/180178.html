:COMMON ORDER

</pre><p id="p_7">	Since, the facts and circumstances and the issues arising for the
consideration of this Court are similar in nature, in both the writ petitions, a
common order is passed.
</p><p id="p_8">	2. It has been stated that the petitioner company is a Private Limited
Company, registered with the Registrar of Companies, in No.181-3077 of 1991.
The petitioner company has been in the business of establishing and running of
poultry farms and manufacturing of poultry feeds.  It had purchased nearly 75
acres of land, by way of registered sale deeds, with a view to establish a
poultry farm and a feed manufacturing mill at Kodanthur Village (South) in Karur
District.  Thereafter, the petitioner company had made an application, before
the second respondent Panchayat, for the grant of building permission, for the
construction of the feed manufacturing mill, at Survey No.696, Kodanthur
Village, Aravakurichi Taluk, Karur District.  The second respondent had granted
the building permission, as requested by the petitioner company, in his
proceedings MuMu.No.2/2010-2011, dated 05.04.2010, for a period of one year,
commencing from 05.04.2010 and ending on 04.04.2011, with certain conditions.
</p><p id="p_9">	3. It has been further stated that the petitioner company had approached
the Commissioner, Karur Paramathi Panchayat Union, for obtaining an appropriate
planning approval.  The Panchayat Union had passed a resolution, dated
16.04.2010, giving its consent for the establishment of a poultry farm and a
feed manufacturing mill.  Based on the said resolution, the Commissioner of the
Panchayat Union had granted the required permission, by his proceedings, dated
28.04.2010, in Na.Ka.A6/1037/2010.  Thereafter, the petitioner company had made
an application to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board for its approval.  The
Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board was pleased to grant the consent order for
the establishment of the poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill, by its
proceedings, dated 31.03.2010, under the relevant provisions of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.  Thereafter, the petitioner company had
approached the Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, which had
also granted the permission for the fixing of the machineries, in its
proceedings, dated 08.05.2010.  The Fire and Rescue Department had also granted
the 'No Objection Certificate', for the establishment of the poultry farm and
the feed manufacturing mill.
</p><p id="p_10">	4. It has also been stated that, based on the permissions, the approvals
and the 'No Objection Certificate', granted by the various authorities
concerned, the Indian Overseas Bank, Erode, had sanctioned a sum of Rs.2.5
crores, in favour of the petitioner company.  The petitioner company had also
invested huge sums of money in purchasing the necessary machineries, fabrication
of the cages, purling, the levelling of land, etc., to the tune of Rs.3 crores.
While so, a rival business group had filed a suit, in O.S.No.225 of 2010, on the
file of the District Munsif Court, Karur, for a decree of declaration and
permanent injunction, to declare the erection and running of the poultry farm in
the suit property, by the defendants therein, as objectionable as it would cause
a lot of nuisance to the inhabitants of the area concerned.  It had also been
prayed that the defendants in the suit should be restrained from putting up any
further construction in the suit property, for the establishment and running of
the poultry farm.  However, no interim order had been granted in the said suit.
However, due to the influence of the rival business group, the Karur Paramathi
Panchayat Union Council had passed a resolution, dated 01.07.2010, in resolution
No.565, cancelling the permission granted to the petitioner company for the
setting up of the poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill.  On the basis of
the said resolution, the Commissioner of Karur Paramathi Panchayat had passed an
order, dated 05.07.2010, bearing proceedings Na.Ka.A6/1037/2010, cancelling the
licence and the building permission granted in favour of the petitioner company.
Aggrieved by the order of the Commissioner, Karur Paramathi Panchayat Union,
dated 05.07.2010, the petitioner company had filed a Writ Petition, in
W.P.(MD)No.8812 of 2010, before this Court.  By an order, dated 28.07.2010, this
Court had quashed the impugned order.
</p><p id="p_11">	5. It has been further stated that, by the proceedings of the Tahsildar,
Aravakurichi Taluk, Karur District, in Na.Ka.No.5261/2010, dated 28.09.2010, the
petitioner company had been directed to appear before him, on 04.10.2010, for a
peace committee meeting, on the basis of the representation, dated 04.10.2010,
made by the second respondent.  In the meanwhile, the first respondent had
passed an order, dated 11.10.2010, in her proceedings, in Na.Ka.A6/4207/2010,
cancelling the plan/building permission granted by the second respondent,
stating that no resolution had been passed by the Kodanthur Village Panchayat
and that the second respondent had granted the building permission violating the
Government norms.  Aggrieved by the order passed by the first respondent, dated
11.10.2010, the petitioner company had filed a Writ Petition before this Court,
in W.P.(MD)No.12948 of 2010, wherein, this Court had granted an order of interim
stay of the order passed by the first respondent, dated 11.10.2010, in M.P.(MD)
No.1 of 2010, in W.P.(MD).No.12948 of 2010.
</p><p id="p_12">	6. It has been further stated that, in the meanwhile, the third respondent
had passed the impugned order in his proceedings, in Na.Ka.No.1, dated
04.10.2010, cancelling the building plan issued by the President of Kodanthur
Village Panchayat, for the setting up of the poultry farm and the feed
manufacturing mill, stating that it would cause pollution in the surrounding
areas and that, due to the growth of mosquitoes and flies, various diseases
would be spread in the nearby areas.  By the impugned order of the third
respondent, dated 04.10.2010, the petitioner company had been instructed to stop
construction works.  It had also been warned that appropriate action would be
taken under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994.
</p><p id="p_13">	7. It has also been stated that in the order passed by this Court, in the
writ petition, in W.P.(MD)No.8812 of 2010, it has been held that it is only the
Pollution Control Board, which has got the exclusive jurisdiction and authority
to say as to whether the poultry farm in question would cause water or air
pollution.  The local authority is not a scientific or expert body to come to
the conclusion that the poultry farm or the feed manufacturing mill would cause
pollution.  Thus, it is clear that the local body is not the appropriate
authority to give a final opinion on matters relating to pollution.
</p><p id="p_14">	8. It has also been stated that the reason assigned in the impugned order
that the establishment of the poultry farm and the setting up of the feed
manufacturing mill would result in the growth of mosquitoes and flies, which
would spread various diseases, cannot be held to be valid, as the petitioner
company had obtained the necessary permission from the Department of Public
Health and Preventive Medicine.  Further, the second and the third respondents
cannot be said to be well-versed in the subjects of pollution and health.
Further, the impugned order is not within the jurisdiction assigned to them,
under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994.
</p><p id="p_15">	9. It has also been submitted that the building permission can be granted
by the second respondent, without raising it before the Council of the Village
Panchayat.  The third respondent had passed the impugned order, without
affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner company.  Hence, the
impugned order of the third respondent, dated 04.10.2010, is liable to be set
aside, as null and void.
</p><p id="p_16">	10. It has also been submitted that after obtaining the necessary licence
and the building permission, the petitioner company had started construction
works and had made huge investments in the project.  Some rival business groups
have been making futile attempts to stop the construction works, in one way or
the other, in spite of the fact that an order had been passed by this Court, in
favour of the petitioner company, on 28.07.2010, in W.P.(MD)No.8812 of 2010.
</p><p id="p_17">	11.  In the Writ Petition, in W.P.(MD) No.12948 of 2010, the petitioner
company had challenged the order passed by the District Collector-cum-Inspector
of Panchayats, Karur District, the first respondent herein, dated 11.10.2010, in
Na.Ka.A6/4207/2010.  It has been stated that the impugned order passed by the
first respondent, cancelling the plan/building permission granted by the second
respondent, is illegal, as it is in violation of the principles of natural
justice.  It has also been stated that even in the absence of a plan/building
permission, the petitioner company is entitled to proceed with the setting up of
the poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill, on the basis of the licence
granted by the Karur Paramathi Panchayat Union.
</p><p id="p_18">	12. It has also been stated that Section 160 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats
Act, 1994, deals with the obtaining of the permission for the construction of
the feed manufacturing mill and for the installation of the machineries therein.
Under the scheme contemplated by the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, it would
be sufficient for obtaining a licence and the building plan from the Panchayat
Union concerned.  There is no provision requiring the petitioner company to
obtain a building permission, separately, from the executive authority of the
Village Panchayat, forming a part of the Panchayat Union.  It is only by way of
abundant caution that the petitioner company had obtained the plan/building
permission from the second respondent, in his proceedings, dated 05.04.2010.
Further, under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Building Rules, 1997, the power to
grant plan/building permission is vested with the executive authority of the
Village Panchayat, namely, the President.  Therefore, there is no requirement to
place the application, for the grant of building permission, before the
Panchayat Council, prior to the approval of the same by the executive authority,
under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Building Rules, 1997.  Therefore, the reason
assigned for the passing of the impugned order, dated 11.10.2010, by the first
respondent, is not supported by the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act,
1994 and the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Building Rules, 1997.  As such, the impugned
order of the Vice-President, Kodanthur Village Panchayat, Aravakurichi Taluk,
Karur District, dated 04.10.2010 has been challenged in the writ petition, in
W.P.No.13105 of 2010 and the impugned order of the District Collector-cum-
Inspector of Panchayats, Karur District, dated 11.10.2010, has been challenged
by the petitioner company, in the Writ Petition, in W.P.(MD)No.12948 of 2010, as
they are illegal and invalid in the eye of law.
</p><p id="p_19">	13. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner company had
submitted that the impugned order of the third respondent, in his proceedings
Na.Ka.No.1, dated 04.10.2010, challenged in W.P.(MD) No.13105 of 2010 and the
impugned order of the first respondent, in her proceedings, in
Na.Ka.A6/4207/2010, dated 11.10.2010, are illegal, without jurisdiction and in
violation of the principles of natural justice and therefore, they are liable to
be set aside.
</p><p id="p_20">	14. It has also been stated that the impugned orders have been passed
without affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner company.  There is
no legal requirement, for the granting of the plan/building permission, by the
executive authority of the Village Panchayat, only after placing the matter
before the Panchayat Council.
</p><p id="p_21">	15. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner company had
also submitted that the third respondent is not vested with any power, under the
Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, to cancel the order passed by the President of
the said Panchayat.  The reasons assigned in the impugned order, dated
04.10.2010, for cancelling the building permission are not tenable, as the issue
had already been settled by this Court, in its order, dated 28.07.2010, made in
W.P.(MD)No.8812 of 2010.
</p><p id="p_22">	16. It had also been submitted that the impugned orders are motivated and
suffers due to the mala fide action of the rival business groups.  It had also
been submitted that the petitioner company had invested huge sums of money for
setting up the poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill, by obtaining a bank
loan.  Hence, the petitioner company has been under a legitimate expectation
that it would be permitted to set up the poultry farm and the feed manufacturing
mill, without hindrance.  It has also been submitted that, as per the provisions
of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, the power to grant permission, for the
construction of factories and for the installation of machineries, is vested
with the Panchayat Union Council and not with the Village Panchayat.  Even in
the absence of the permission from the second respondent, the petitioner company
is entitled to proceed with the setting up of the poultry farm.  The first
respondent is not vested with the power to issue the impugned proceedings, dated
11.10.2010, under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994,
cancelling the order passed by the second respondent, granting the necessary
permission to the petitioner company to establish the poultry farm and the feed
manufacturing mill.
</p><p id="p_23">	17. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner company had also
submitted that the consent order required for establishment of the poultry farm
and the feed manufacturing mill had been obtained from the Tamil Nadu Pollution
Control Board, on 24.03.2010,.  The necessary consent orders had also been
obtained from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to establish the poultry
farm and the feed manufacturing mill, under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">Section 25</a> of the Water (Prevention
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, as well as under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_7">Section 21</a> of the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p><p id="p_24">	18. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner had
submitted that the impugned order of the District Collector-cum-Inspector of
Panchayats, Karur District, dated 11.10.2010, and the order of the Vice
President of Kodanthur Village Panchayat, Karur District, dated 4.10.2010, are
illegal and void, as they had been passed deliberately to subvert the interim
orders passed by this Court, dated 21.10.2010, in M.P.(MD).No.1 of 2010, in
W.P(MD).No.12948 of 2010 and in M.P.(MD).No.1 of 2010, in W.P(MD).No.13105 of
2010. The said orders would amount to colourable exercise of power as they had
been passed contrary to the procedures established by law.
</p><p id="p_25">	19. It has also been stated that the impugned orders had been passed
without giving a reasonable opportunity of hearing to the petitioner Company,
under Clause 2 of Section 202 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act,1994. The said
orders are also inconsistent with <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Section 160</a> of the Act, as it is clear that
even without the permission of the Village Panchayat, the poultry farm and the
feed manufacturing mill could be established.  Both the impugned orders had been
passed on wrong presumptions of the facts and the law.
</p><p id="p_26">			20. It has also been submitted that the building plan granted
in favour of the Petitioner Company cannot be cancelled, by any authority or
body, on the ground that the establishment of the poultry farm and the feed
manufacturing mill would cause pollution.  In the present case, both the
District Collector, Karur District, as well as the Vice-President of Kodanthur
Village Panchayat, had been swayed by the public opinion, even though, the Tamil
Nadu Pollution Control Board, which is an expert body had given the green signal
to the Petitioner Company to go ahead with the establishment of the poultry
farm, as well as the feed manufacturing mill.
</p><p id="p_27">	21. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner company had
submitted that once the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had issued a consent
order for the establishment of a poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill,
the other authorities and the local bodies, including the respondents in the
present writ petitions, cannot have an objection against the establishment of
the poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill, stating that they would be
causing pollution.  The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board is the final
authority, with regard to the matters relating to pollution, in spite of the
fact that the petitioner company had obtained all necessary orders from the
Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, as well as the building permission from the
President of the Kodanthur Village Panchayat, on 05.04.2010.  The Vice-President
of the said Panchayat had passed the impugned proceedings, dated 04.10.2010,
stating that the building permission had been granted by the President of the
Kodanthur Village Panchayat in favour of the petitioner company, for the
establishment of the poultry farm, arbitrarily, without following the procedures
established by law.  In the said impugned order, it had also been stated that
the matter relating to the granting of building permission to the petitioner
company had not been placed before the Panchayat council before the President
had granted the said permission, on 05.04.2010.  It had also been stated in the
said proceedings that the establishment of the poultry farm would result in the
degradation of ecology, resulting in unhygienic conditions prevailing in the
area concerned.  Therefore, the permission granted by the President of the
Village Panchayat, on 05.04.2010, has been cancelled.
</p><p id="p_28">	22. It had also been submitted that the permission granted in favour of
the Petitioner Company to establish the poultry farm and the feed manufacturing
mill is only a preliminary step.  Thereafter, it would be open to the
authorities concerned to go into the issues relating to pollution, if it is
found to be necessary.  Neither the District Collector, who is the Inspector of
Panchayats, nor the Executive of the Village Panchayat would have the power to
prevent the Petitioner Company from taking steps to establish the poultry farm,
as well as the feed manufacturing mill, at the initial stage itself.
</p><p id="p_29">	23. In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the second and the third
respondents, it has been stated that the President of Kodanthur Village
Panchayat was on leave, from 13.10.2010, due to illness.  Therefore, he had
delegated the functions to the Vice-President, as per Section 48 of the Tamil
Nadu Panchayats Act,1994, and in consonance with the Tamil Nadu Village
Panchayats (devolution and delegation of President's Functions) Rules, 1999.
The other averments and the allegations made by the Petitioner Company in the
affidavits filed in support of the Writ Petitions had been denied.
</p>
	
<p id="p_30">	 24. It had also been stated that the impugned orders had been passed
after considering the public interest of the people, who are living in the
nearby villages.  In fact, more than seven Panchayats have passed resolutions
opposing the establishment of poultry farms.  The permission obtained by the
Petitioner Company through the order, dated 05.04.2010, is contrary to the
provisions of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats (building) Rules.  The approval granted
in favour of the Petitioner Company is against the resolution of the Panchayat,
dated 27.03.2010, and against the interests of the people at large, who are the
residents of the nearby villages.  Since, the proposed poultry farm would cause
pollution, adversely affecting the health of the general public, due to the
breeding of mosquitoes and flies, leading to the spreading of diseases, the
second respondent had cancelled the order, dated 05.04.2010, by a resolution of
the Village Panchayat, dated 01.10.2010.  The impugned order passed by the Vice-
President, dated 04.10.2010, is only a consequential order, and it was
communicated to the Petitioner Company and to the other officials concerned, on
21.10.2010.
</p><p id="p_31">	25. In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the second and the third
respondents, in W.P.(MD) No.13105 of 2010, it has been stated that the second
respondent Village Panchayat consists of 16 hamlets.  The petitioner company had
purchased nearly 75 acres of land, at Udaiyanpalayam, in Kodanthur Village
(South) which is located in the mist of the other villages coming under the
Kodanthur Village Panchayat.  Even though the lands in question had been
purchased by the petitioner company for the purpose of carrying on agricultural
activities, the petitioner company has proposed to establish a poultry farm and
a feed manufacturing mill therein.  All the 16 hamlets are coming under the
Kodanthur Village Panchayat, situated within 1 to 3 kilometers from the proposed
poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill.  The starting of the poultry farm
would cause serious problems of pollution and it would induce the breeding of
mosquitoes and flies,  due to which, a number of diseases would be spread
amongst the inhabitants of the area concerned.  Thus, the establishment of the
poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill would pose serious health hazards,
not only to the people of the area, but also to the animals in the locality.
The establishment of the poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill in the
locality concerned would also cause nuisance to the villagers due to the foul
smell emanating from the farm and the mill. It would also lead to environmental
degradation in the said area due to air and water pollution.
</p><p id="p_32">	26. It has also been stated that more than 2000 people are residing in the
villages coming under the Kodanthur Village Panchayat.  The petitioner company
is proposing to establish a poultry farm with more than ten lakhs birds and
therefore, it would cause serious harm to the ecological balance prevailing in
the nearby villages.  Knowing about the serious damages that could be caused by
the establishment of a poultry farm, more than seven Panchayats in and around
the Kodanthur Village Panchayat had passed resolutions opposing the
establishment of a poultry farm in the areas coming under their jurisdiction.
More over, in the meeting held, on 02.10.2010, at the Grama Sabha Panchayat, all
the residents of the Village Panchayat had participated and had raised their
objections against the establishment of the poultry farm, at Udaiyanpalayam.
</p><p id="p_33">		27. Further, the petitioner company had admitted, during the peace
committee meeting, held on 04.10.2010, that they are going to sink massive bore
wells by drilling for more than a thousand feet.  If such borewells are allowed
to be sunk, it would lead to the drying up of the available water resources in
and around the Kodanthur Village, resulting in water scarcity, even for drinking
purposes.  It would also seriously affect the agricultural activities in the
area concerned, including the rearing of cattle.  Further, the establishment of
the poultry farm and the  feed manufacturing mill, at Udaiyanpalayam, would
cause serious water pollution in the Amaravathi river, which is running within a
distance of one kilometer from the area in question, at Moolathurai.
</p><p id="p_34">	28. It has also been stated that the Kodanthur Village Panchayat has the
power and the authority to refuse the grant of building plan. Even if such
approval had been granted, it could be cancelled by the Village Panchayat
concerned, if sufficient reasons are existing for such cancellation.
</p><p id="p_35">	29. It has also been stated that a Writ Appeal had already been filed
against the order passed by this Court, on 05.07.2010, in W.P.No.8812 of 2010.
No notice had been issued to the petitioner company before the cancellation of
the earlier order granted in its favour, as it was an illegal order.  Further,
the first respondent is empowered to suspend or cancel any resolution passed,
order issued or licence or permission granted under Section 202 of the Tamil
Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994.  In such circumstances, the writ petition filed by
the petitioner company, in W.P.No.13105 of 2010, is devoid of merits and
therefore, it is liable to be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_36">	30. In view of the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the petitioner, as well as the learned counsels appearing on behalf of
the respondents and in view of the records available before this Court and on
considering the decisions cited, this Court is of the considered view that the
petitioner has not shown sufficient cause or reason to grant the reliefs, as
prayed for by the petitioner, in the present writ petition.  Even though the
Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had granted its consent in view of the
relevant provisions of the  Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1974 and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, the Village
Panchayat concerned has to grant its approval for the establishment of the
poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill, especially, when it involves the
issues relating to the health and well-being of the residents of the nearby
areas.  Even though the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board have given its
consent for the establishment of the poultry farm, as well as the feed
manufacturing mill, the local Village Panchayat would have the authority to
consider the aspects relating to the nuisance, that could be caused by the
establishment of such a farm or a mill, and the issues relating to the health
hazards that may be caused to the people at large, as well as to the animals and
the degradation of the environment, in general.  Even though the petitioner
company may have the Fundamental Right to establish the poultry farm and the
feed manufacturing mill, to carry on its business, it could be curtailed by
certain reasonable restrictions enforced by the State.  Even though the Karur-
Paramathi Panchayat Union had given its consent through its resolution, dated
16.04.2010, permitting the petitioner company to set up the poultry farm and the
feed manufacturing mill, it would be necessary for the petitioner company to
obtain the consent of the local Village Panchayat, as provided under the Tamil
Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994 and the Rules framed thereunder.
</p><p id="p_37">	31. It is also noted that no resolution had been passed in the Kodanthur
Village Panchayat, approving the building plan and the granting of the
permission to establish the poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill.  Even
though the President of the Kodanthur Village Panchayat had granted his
approval, by his  proceedings, dated 05.04.2010, the said proceedings had been
cancelled, by the resolution of the said Panchayat, dated 01.10.2010.  The said
resolution had not been challenged in the manner known to law.  Thereafter, the
Vice-President of the Kodanthur Village Panchayat had issued an order, dated
04.10.2010, acting on behalf of the Village Panchayat, in the absence of the
President, as per the provisions of Section 48 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act,
1994 and the relevant provisions of the Tamil Nadu Village Panchayats
(Devolution and Delegation of the President's Functions) Rules, 1999.
</p><p id="p_38">	32. From the records available before this Court, it is noted that a peace
committee meeting had been held, on 04.10.2010, wherein the adverse consequences
that may arise following the establishment of the poultry farm, as well as the
feed manufacturing mill, had been enumerated.  The petitioner company seems to
have agreed to stop the constructions, till 25.10.2010.
</p><p id="p_39">	33. It is also noted that the resolutions had been passed by seven Village
Panchayats close to Kodanthur Village, to deny the permission to establish the
poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill in their areas.  As per Section 160
of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, the necessary permission has to be
obtained from the Panchayat Union Council concerned to construct or establish
any factory, workshop or work place, in which, it is proposed to enjoy steam
power, water power or other mechanical power or electrical power or for
installing, in any such premises, any machinery or manufacturing plant.  Thus,
it is clear that the consent granted by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board,
for the establishment of the poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill, is
not final. The provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, should be
read in consonance with the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994.
When the Village Panchayat had passed a resolution, on 27.03.2010, refusing to
grant permission for the establishment of the poultry farm and the feed
manufacturing mill, it cannot be rescinded by the President.
</p><p id="p_40">	34. It is also seen that Section 202 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act,
1994, empowers the District Collector, who is the Inspector of Panchayats, to
suspend or cancel any resolution passed, the order issued, or licence or
permission granted or to prohibit the doing of any act, if a resolution passed,
or an order, licence or permission granted had not been legally done.  It also
empowers the District Collector to prohibit the doing of any act, which is about
to be done or which is being done pursuant to such a resolution or order,
licence or permission if the execution of which is likely to cause danger to
human life, health or safety.  Therefore, it is clear that the Tamil Nadu
Pollution Control Board is not the sole repository of power, with regard to all
matters relating to pollution.  If the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board is the
final authority relating to matters of pollution and its effects on people and
the environment, Section 160 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, would be
rendered redundant or otiose.  Even though it had been claimed that no notice
had been issued to the petitioner company before the impugned order had been
passed, it would be appropriate for the petitioner company to avail the
alternative remedy available, under the relevant provisions of the Tamil Nadu
Panchayats Act, 1994, including the remedy of revision provided under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Section
219</a> of the said Act.
</p><p id="p_41">	35. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the second respondent had
relied on the following decisions in support of his contentions:
</p>
	
<p id="p_42">	36. 1. <a href="/doc/1314958/" id="a_15"><a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">In Act</a>ion Council, Poovathode and Others v. Benny Abraham and
Others</a> (2002) 9 Supreme Court Cases 493, it had been held as follows:
	"3. It is no doubt true that the entrepreneur had obtained the necessary
"no-objection certificate" from the environmental authorities.  But the
Panchayat, on consideration of the matter, was of the opinion that the decision
not to grant permission to instal the metal crusher machine would be in the
interest of the public and it ascribed 4 reasons as to why the Panchayat comes
to the conclusion that it would not be in the public interest to grant such
licence.  All those reasons, to our mind, are germane to the issue and cannot be
held to be arbitrary or fictitious."
</p>
<p id="p_43">	37. 2. <a href="/doc/1713853/" id="a_17">In Kings India Chemicals Corporation Limited v. The District
Collector</a> cum Inspector of Panchayats, 2010 (1) CWC 319, it had been held that,
under Section 160 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, and the relevant rules
made under the said Act, the Village Panchayat is empowered to reconsider the
resolution passed earlier.
</p><p id="p_44">	38. 3. In Manjapara Grama Panchayat v. State of Kerala, CDJ 1996 Kerala
High Court 222, it had been held as follows:
</p><p id="p_45">	"It is evident from <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Section 166(1)</a> of the Act it is the mandatory duty of
every village Panchayat to control unauthorised building construction and land
utilisation.  Therefore, the Revenue Divisional Officer has a duty to consult
the Panchayat. Therefore, the mere fact that Revenue Divisional Officer has
given permission does not mean that Panchayat has no legal right to object to
the conversion of paddy field."
</p>
<p id="p_46">	39. It had also been noted that the District Collector had passed the
impugned proceedings, dated 11.10.2010, stating that on inspection of the
records of the Kodanthur Village Panchayat, it had been found that no resolution
had been passed in the Kodanthur Village Panchayat, in favour of the petitioner
company for the establishment of the poultry farm and the feed manufacturing
mill.  It had also been stated that the approval of the building plan for the
construction of the building had not been granted in accordance with Government
rules framed for the said purpose.  As such, the first respondent had rejected
the permission granted to the petitioner company for the establishment of the
poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill to be established, at
Udaiyanpalayam, in Karur District.
</p><p id="p_47">	40. From the records available before this Court, it is seen that the
impugned orders had been passed taking into consideration the public interest of
those who are residing in the vicinity of the area concerned and carrying on the
agricultural activities.  Only based on the representations made by the
villagers belonging to the villages in the area concerned, the first and the
third respondents, in W.P.(MD) No.13105 of 2010, had passed the impugned orders
rejecting the building plan and the permission granted in favour of the
petitioner company for the construction of the buildings.
</p><p id="p_48">	41. It is also seen that the petitioner company is not in a position to
show that the apprehensions of the people of the villages concerned are ill-
founded.  Even though an order, dated 11.10.2010, had been passed by the first
respondent and an order had been passed by the third respondent, on 04.10.2010,
without issuing any notice, such orders need not be set aside, in view of the
fact that the building permission had been granted by the President of the
Kodanthur Village Panchayat, arbitrarily, without following the procedures
established by law.
</p><p id="p_49">	42. As seen from the provisions of Section 202 of the Tamil Nadu
Panchayats Act, 1994, the District Collector, Karur District, who is the
Inspector of Panchayats, has the power to suspend or cancel any resolution
passed, order issued or licence or permission granted, if such   resolution,
order or licence has not been legally passed, issued or granted, or if it is
found that it is not in exercise of powers conferred by the Act or any other
law, or an abuse of such powers or if it is considered to be otherwise
undesirable, or if it would cause danger to the human life or health or safety.
In such circumstances, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the impugned
order of the first respondent, dated 11.10.2010 and the impugned order of the
third respondent in the writ petition, in W.P.No.13105 of 2010, dated
04.10.2010. Therefore, the writ petitions stand dismissed. No costs. However, in
view of the fact that no notice had been issued to the petitioner company before
the impugned order had been passed and no opportunity had been given to the
petitioner company to put forth its views, it would be appropriate for the first
respondent to hold an enquiry, after giving sufficient notice to the petitioner
company and to such other persons, authorities and local bodies as the first
respondent may consider to be necessary, and pass appropriate orders thereon, on
merits and in accordance with law, within a period of eight weeks from the date
of receipt of a copy of this order.  If the petitioner company is in a position
to  convince the first respondent that no pollution or health hazard or
ecological imbalance or degradation of the environment would be caused, due to
the establishment of the poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill,  the
petitioner company may be permitted to establish the poultry farm and the feed
manufacturing mill, at Udaiyanpalayam, as already proposed by the petitioner
company.
