ACT:
     Constitution  of India, 1950-Articles 32, 51-A-  Public
Interest Litigation-Environment Pollution-Control-Measures.
     <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986-Section, 3-  Problem
of Vehicular pollution in Delhi- Committee set up by Court.



HEADNOTE:
     The  petitioner,  an  Advocate  and  Chairman  of	 the
Environmental  Protection  Cell	 filed	the  petition  under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2">Article 32</a> asking the Court to issue directions for  closing
down   of  hazardous  industries  located  in  the   densely
populated  areas  of  Delhi,  and  for	regulation  of	 air
pollution  caused  by automobiles operating in the  area  as
also  the  thermal  units generating  power  for  the  Delhi
Electric Supply Undertaking.
     Making an interim order, and keeping the writ  petition
pending for the purpose of monitoring, the Court.
     HELD: 1. The incorporation of protection of environment
as  an obligation of the State in the  Directive  Principles
and  the mandate in <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_3">Article 51-A</a> to the	 citizens  of  India
as   part  of  fundamental  duty  are  indications  of	 the
Constitutional	recognition of importance of environment  of
life-both the flora and the fauna. [870 A-B]
     2. Law alone also cannot help in restoring a balance in
the biospheric disturbance. Nor can funds help	effectively.
The   situation	 requires  a  perception   and	 imaginative
planning.  It  also  requires sustained	 effort	 and  result
oriented  strategic action. Campaign for  general  awakening
of the people using automobiles of different  classification
and   among  the  people  inhabiting  the  Capital   is	  an
indispensable preliminary. [871E-G]
     3.	 All  persons using automobiles should have  a	fair
knowledge  of the baneful effect on the community  including
those who use such vehicles on account of the emission	from
such  vehicles. Until that is done in an effective  way	 the
appropriate  attitude would not develop and cooperation	 for
reducing pollution would not emerge. [871 F-H]
						       867
     4. A Committee is set up by this court to look into the
problem	 of  vehicular pollution in Delhi and  for  devising
methods of solution of the problem. [ 872 H-873 A].
     5.	 A retired Judge of this court to act  as  Chairman,
the  petitioner	 and the Chairman of the  Central  Pollution
Control Board and the person representing the Association of
Indian Automobiles Manufacturers could be the members of the
Committee. The Committee would also have the power to co-opt
experts	 not exceeding three for its efficient working	from
time  to  time.	 The  Joint Secretary  in  the	Ministry  of
Environment  and Forests shall be the Convenor-Secretary  of
the Committee. [873A-D]
     6.	 The Committee may be constituted with	effect	from
18th  March, 1991, under an appropriate Notification of	 the
Union Government. [873D]
     7.	 The Committee shall furnish a report to this  Court
once in two months as to the steps taken in the matter.	 The
Union  Government and the Delhi Administration are  directed
to   effectively  cooperate  with  the	Committee  for	 its
successful operation. [874B]



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">     ORIGINAL JURISDICTION:Write Petition No. 13029 of 1985.
     (Under Articles 32 of the Constitution of India).
     Petitioner in person.
</p><p id="p_2">     Altaf Ahmed, Additional Solicitor General , Sri  Narain
Mathur,	 R.  Mohan, Ms. Anil Katiyar, Ms.  Sushma  Suri,  K.
Swamy, R.K. Maheshwari and S.M. Ashri for the Respondents.
</p><p id="p_3">     The Judgement of the Court was delivered by.
     RANGANATH	MISRA,	CJ.  This is  an  application  under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_4">Article	 32</a>  of	 the Constitution  in  the  public  interest
litigation sector. A practising advocate who is the Chairman
of the Environment Protection Cell operating at Delhi is the
petioner. This Court has been asked to issue directions	 for
closing down of hazardous industries located in the  densely
populated areas of Delhi and for regulation of air pollution
caused	by  automobiles operating in the area  as  also	 the
thermal units generating power for the Delhi Electric Supply
Undertaking, (here after referred to as `DESU').
</p><p id="p_4">     The Union Territory of Delhi has a total population  of
about 96
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">						       868</span>
lakhs, out of which the urban area consisting of old  Delhi,
New  Delhi and the Cantonment has a population of around  90
lakhs.	By 1947 when the country became	 independent,  Delhi
had  a population of a little over 5 lakhs. In these  little
more  than  two scores of years the  population	 has,  thus,
multiplied  by 18 times. Though it is a spread-out city,  in
some  pockets,	the density of population is very  high	 and
these have become congested.
</p><p id="p_5">     The  problem of environmental pollution is global in  a
increasingly   small  world  and  concerns   all   countries
irrespective   of  their  size,	 level	of  development	  or
ideology.  Notwithstanding political division of  the  world
into national units, the oceanic world in an inter-connected
whole; the winds that blow over the countries are also	one.
Pollution is capable of moving from continent to  continent.
If  USSR  carries out a nuclear test, the  fall-out  may  be
carried by the winds to any part of the world and such fall-
out  or irresponsible disposal of radio-active waste from  a
remote	energy	plant in one country may turn  out  to	have
greater	 adverse effect on the neighbouring  countries	that
the  danger  of full-fledged war. Informed  public  mind  is
already	 agitated over the polluting effect of the Gulf	 War
and  the  common concern of the entire	homosapien  race  is
obsessed  by the apprehension of acid rain, toxic effect  on
the seas and even on the atmosphere.
</p><p id="p_6">     The   awareness   of  interaction	of  man	  with	 his
environment  is	 of recent origin. The	Declaration  of	 the
United	Nations Conference on the Human Environment held  in
Stockholm in June, 1972 stated:
</p><p id="p_7">	 "Man	is   both  creature  and  moulder   of	 his
	 environment which gives him physical sustenance and
	 affords  him  the  opportunity	 for   intellectual,
	 moral, social and spiritual growth. In the long and
	 tortuous evolution of the human race on this planet
	 a  stage  has	been  reached  when,  through  rapid
	 acceleration  of  science and technology,  man	 has
	 acquired the power to transform his environment  in
	 countless ways and on an unprecedented scale.	Both
	 aspects  of man's environment, the natural and	 the
	 man-made,  are essential to his well-being  and  to
	 the  enjoyment of basic human rights-even  of	life
	 itself."
</p><p id="p_8">     Principle No. 1 of the same Declaration went on to say:
	  "Man	 has  the  fundamental	right  to   freedom,
	  equality  and adequate conditions of life,  in  an
	  environment of a quality
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">						      869</span>
	  that permits a life of dignity and well-being, and
	  he  bears  solemn responsibility  to	protect	 and
	  improve  the	environment for present	 and  future
	  generations...".
</p><p id="p_9">     The  closeness of the undeveloped	and  under-developed
communities  to nature is not found in the  developed  ones.
Our ancestors had realised the importance of the tie between
man  and  his environment. The Samaveda note that  Flute  of
Divine love by saying:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "Listen to the melodious music of the divine poet.
	  He plays upon the flute of love, the notes soar to
	  high heaven and reach the  distant stars and dance
	  on the raging waves of the sea."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  The  earth,  the seas, the sky, the stars  are  all
	  woven	 together by the soft strains of the  divine
	  music. Its vibrants echo through the corridors  of
	  time in the endless canopy of the sky."</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">     Norman  Myers  quoted in Sir Edmond  Hillary's  Ecology
2,000' has rightly observed:
</p><p id="p_11">"	 The fate of African environments is thus determined
	 not only by local circumstances. It is	 influenced,
	 in  part  at  least,  by  the	lifestyles  of	 the
	 developed world. These economic-ecological linkages
	 between  different  members  of  the  international
	 community  are little recognized to date, but	they
	 represent   a	significant  factor   for   land-use
	 patterns in Africa's Savannahs".
</p><p id="p_12">     Our   Constitution	  by  the   Forty-Second   Amendment
introduced  <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_5">Article  48A</a>  as  also  <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_6">Article  51A</a>  into	 the
Constitution. these Articles provide:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  "48A.	 The  State shall endeavour  to	 protect  and
	  improve  the	environment  and  to  safeguard	 the
	  forests  and	wild life of the  country.""
	  51A.	It  shall be the duty of  every	 citizen  of
	  India:
</blockquote><p id="p_13">	 (g) to protect and improve the natural environment
	  including  forests, rivers and wild life,  and  to
	  have compassion for living creatures."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">						       870</span>
<p id="p_14">The  incorporation  of	protection  of	environment  as	  an
obligation of the State in the Directive Principles and	 the
mandate in <a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_7">Article 51</a> A to the citizens of India as part  of
fundamental  duty  are	indications  of	 the  Constitutional
recognition  of importance of environment on  life-both	 the
flora and the fauna.
</p><p id="p_15">     Ours is a great country- territorywise, from the stand-
point of population as also legacy-wise. Though	 politically
divided	 into many States throughout the ages  it  has	been
bound by a common culture short-lived empires have grown  up
and  Delhi became the capital of such empires of the  north.
Delhi was the capital of the Mughals too but the  Britishers
had  in the initial period Calcutta as their capital and  it
was only 1911 that the Indian capital of the British  empire
was shifted from Calcutta to Delhi.
</p><p id="p_16">     With  the	growth	of  importance	of  Delhi,  on	 the
outskirts  of the then city gradually industries  developed.
Lack of vision and inadequate statesmanship allowed many  of
these	industries  to	grow  perilously  close	  to   human
habitation and in the process of expansion of the city	with
the  growth of population and activity, the industrial	belt
became	a part of the city. Hindustan Insecticides  Limited,
which  is  respondent  no.  6 before  us,  is  one  of	such
industries, DESU has three generating units-One known as the
indraprastha  Power  Station,  the other  as  the  GT  Power
Stations  and the third as the RPR Power Station. These	 too
are  located  within the densely populated area.  The  Delhi
Transport  Corporation	(hereafter DTC) which  provides	 the
public transport facility to the residents of Delhi operates
thousands of buses has been impleaded as respondent no. 5 on
the  allegation	 that it is one of the	notorious  polluting
agencies.
</p><p id="p_17">     A	monitoring  Committee  on  ambient  and	  automotive
emission  levels  was  set up for examining  the  impact  of
surface	 transport  on	air  environment  of  Delhi  at	 the
instance of the Director of Transport, Delhi Administration.
The facts and figures available from the report may  briefly
be indicated. As on March 31, 1982. Delhi had a total number
of  5,92,584 vehicles of which 65% were	 two-wheelers,	3.5%
were  three-wheelers, 25% cars, jeeps and other medium	size
vehicles and 1.5% were buses and the remaining 7% were goods
carriers. The affidavit of the Deputy Director of  Transport
of  the	 Delhi Administration indicates that  the  vehicular
population  of	1990 is 13.5 lakhs. This means	that  within
about  8 years there has been an increase of about  8  lakhs
of vehicles in Delhi which would work out to an addition of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">						       871</span>
about 1 lakh every year. The proportion of the two  wheelers
has perhaps not been seriously disturbed. Though the  Deputy
director  of  Transport has indicated that  the	 automobiles
contribute  about  50%	of the	polluting  factor  there  is
material  to  suggest that the proportion is  still  higher.
Two-wheelers   and  three-wheelers  contribute	over   sixty
percent	 of the total emission of carbon monoxide and  about
eighty	percent	 of  the total	hydrocarbons.  To  meet	 the
challenging task of  controlling pollution, Air	 (Prevention
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 has been enacted.
</p><p id="p_18">     Respondent 3 is the Central Board set up under the Act.
The  statute authorise Government in consultation  with	 the
Board  to instruct the Transport Authorities for  developing
expertise by taking vehicular pollution survey covering	 all
ramifications.	The Union Territory of Delhi was  chosen  on
selective  basis  because it maintains the  highest  traffic
volume.
</p><p id="p_19">     <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_9">Under the Motor Vehicles Act</a> of 1989 certain  provision
have   been  made  for	regulating  emission  resulting	  in
pollution.     Transport    Authorities	  of	the    Delhi
Administration	had  placed facts and  figures	relating  to
steps taken under the Act for regulating pollution. Emission
checking.  prosecution	as  also  steps	 for  canceling	  of
registration  are said to be the normal steps taken  by	 the
Administration	in  this  behalf. We  were  ,  however,	 not
satisfied that the action taken in this behalf was  adequate
and  the challenging task of pollution control could not  be
successfully dealt with that way.
</p><p id="p_20">     Law  alone also cannot help in restoring a	 balance  in
the biospheric disturbance. Nor can funds help	effectively.
The  situation requires a clear perception  and	 imaginative
planning.  It  also  requires sustained	 effort	 and  result
oriented  strategic  action. Campaign for general  awakening
of the people using automobiles of different classifications
and   among   the   people   inhabiting	  the	capital	  is
indispensable  preliminary.  All persons  using	 automobiles
should	have a fair  knowledge of the baneful effect on	 the
community  including those who use such vehicles on  account
of the emission from such vehicles. Until that is done in an
effective way the appropriate attitude would not develop and
cooperation for reducing pollution would not emerge.
</p><p id="p_21">     A brief extract from the journal entitled `Environmetal
Policy &amp; law'  vol. 13 nos. 1-2 Spring 1983) published	from
North-Holland describes the problem thus:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">						       872</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">	  "It  became clear that all these measures are	 not
	  themselves  sufficient to come to grips  with	 the
	  problem  of air pollution caused by road  traffic.
	  In every one of the towns and cities, the  problem
	  of  air pollution from motor vehicle traffic is  a
	  considerable	 one,  and  it	was  more  or	less
	  generally  apparent that present norms  for  motor
	  vehicle exhausts are not adequate so as to achieve
	  the necessary reductions in a rapid space of time.
	  In fact, the problem is, in part, on the increase.
	  This is not only true of private cars,  especially
	  diesel-powered  vehicles, but also  of  commercial
	  vehicles ..."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	      "Despite	the  legal and	other  restrictions
	  mentioned above, which hamper the towns and cities
	  involved  in pursuing effective policies aimed  at
	  limiting motor vehicle exhausts, some	 interesting
	  strategies have been thought	up which have either
	  led  to  improvements in themselves  or  at  least
	  stimulated	attitudes   towards    environmental
	  policies.   For  example,  in	 formulating   their
	  regulations in the event of smog, both Munich	 and
	  Berlin offered positive stimulus for the  purchase
	  of  vehicles fitted with catalytic converters.  As
	  far  as city-owned motor vehicles  are  concerned,
	  some authorities have pursued a deliberate  policy
	  of  purchasing  those automobiles   with  improved
	  exhaust systems."</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">     In	 course of the hearing of this matter we had  called
upon  counsel  to look at the problem not  as  an  adversial
litigation but to come forward with useful deliberations  so
that something concreate could finally emerge for easing the
situation.  We were shown some literature and  even  gadgets
which  might  help reduction of pollution. The	question  of
eliminating  use of motor spirit and replacement of  battery
operated  two-wheelers was also mooted. The  Association  of
Indian	Automobile Manufacturers had made an application for
intervention  and was present in Court. Some of the  aspects
which  came  up	 for  discussion  were	indeed	sufficiently
technical. Some other aspects require laboratory testing and
probe  into efficacy. Therefore, the question of setting  up
of a high-powered committee was also mooted. We are happy to
find  that the deliberations in course of the  hearing	have
taken  a concreate shape and the Ministry of  Environment  &amp;
Forests	 has  ultimately  instructed  the  learned  Attorney
General	 in  writing  (copy placed on  the  record)  that  a
Committee  could  be set up by the Court to  look  into	 the
problem of vehicular pollution in Delhi
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">						       873</span>
and  for  devising methods of solution of the  problem.	 The
Ministry has agreed that a retired Judge of this Court could
act as Chairman and has suggested that Shri M.C. Mehta,	 the
petitioner  herein  and Shri. N.S. Tiwana,  Chairman  of  he
Central	 Pollution Control Board may be made the Members  of
the  Committee.	 We  find this suggestion  of  the  Ministry
acceptable subject to certain modification. We are  inclined
to  take  the  view  that  Shri	 Sudhakar  Girdharlal	Shah
representing   the   Association   of	Indian	  Automobile
Manufacturers  could be taken as a member of  the  Committee
and  the  Committee  would also have  the  power  to  co-opt
experts	 not exceeding three for its efficient working	from
time  to  time. Shri Justice K.N. Saikia  who  has  recently
retired	 as  a	Judge  of this Court  is  appointed  as	 the
Chairman  of the Committee with Shri N.S. Tiwana, Shri	M.C.
Mehta  and  Shri. S.G. Shah as Members. The Joint  Secretary
in  the	 Ministry of Environment and Forests  shall  be	 the
convenor  Secretary  of the Committee. Shri  Justice  Saikia
shall  be  entitled to all the benefits to which  a  retired
Judge of this Court while called back to duty is entitled.

March, 1991, under an appropriate Notification of the  Union
