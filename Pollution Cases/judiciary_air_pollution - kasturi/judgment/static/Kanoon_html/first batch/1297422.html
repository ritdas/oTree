:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">(Order of the Court was made by R.BANUMATHI, J.)  
        This   Writ   Petition   has  been  filed  for  issuance  of  Writ  of
Certiorarified Mandamus, calling for the records of the Second  Respondent  in
Consent  Order  No.007 dated 30.01.2002 and to quash the same and forebear the 
Respondents 1 to 4 from according any approval to  the  Sixth  Respondent  for
running  a  manufacturing  unit in R.S.Nos.10,11 and 13 in Melamathur Village,
Madurai.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.  The Petitioner is the Executive Director of a Three Star  Hotel  
Germanus  Days  Inn,  which  is  situated  in  the  outskirts  of Madurai City
surrounded by Nagamalai Hills, about 6 K.Ms away from Madurai.  The Petitioner
has constructed Hotel in that area only on account of the scenic  surrounding.
The  Fifth  Respondent  owns  about  Three  acres  of land comprised in Survey
Nos.10,11 and 13 in Melamattur Village,  which  is  one  of  the  villages  in
Revenue village  Pulluttu.    Pulluttu  also  attracts  lot  of local tourists
because of the natural spring  Nagar Theertham.  The Sixth Respondent / Meron
Biopolymers being a Company having its office at Cochin is  manufacturing  the
products from  Sea  Weeds.  The Fifth Respondent has entered into an agreement 
with the Sixth Respondent for a small portion.    Later,  the  Petitioner  has
found  that the Sixth Respondent has put up a big manufacturing unit, which is
to be processed from out of the Sea Weeds to be used for  the  manufacture  of
Pharmaceuticals.  The Unit requires about 50,000 litres of Water.  Consumption
of  such  huge  quantity  of  Water would cause diminution of the Ground Water
table.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.  The Petitioner contends that the Industry now sought to be set  up
by the Sixth Respondent is a Chemical Unit which generates polluted effluents,
falling   within   G.O.Ms.No.213  Environment  and  Forests  (  EC-1  )  dated
30.03.1989, which prohibits establishments of Industries as listed in Annexure
I within 1 K.M from the embankments of the water sources mentioned in Annexure 
2 of the Notification.  The Fifth  Respondent  has  not  permitted  the  Sixth
Respondent  to construct such a huge factory as they had only executed a lease
in respect of a small shed and  residential  unit  in  S.No.11  of  Melamattur
Village.  The Second Respondent has issued the Consent Order dated 30.01.2002,  
on  the basis of which, the Sixth Respondent appears to be proceeding with the
construction.  The Consent Order issued by  the  Second  Respondent  has  been 
granted only under Sec.21 of the AIR (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>
1981  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  AIR (P &amp; CP)Act) and not under the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974 ( hereinafter  referred  to  as
Water (P&amp;CP)Act).    On  the  facts  and  circumstances, the Second Respondent 
cannot give the Consent Order to the Sixth  Respondent  for  putting  up  such
Industry  as  it  is within 2 K.Ms from the River  Vaigai, thereby attracting
the Prohibition under G.O.Ms.    213  Environment  and  Forests  (EC-1)  dated
30.03.1989  and G.O.Ms.No.127 Environment and Forests (EC-3) dated 08.05.1998.   
The Petitioner prays for issuance of a Writ  contending  that  the  Industrial
Unit put up by the Sixth Respondent and the effluents would be great intensity
affecting  the  Ground  Water and the Air in and around the area would also be
polluted.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.  The Fourth Respondent / Joint Director of  Agriculture  has  filed
the Counter  denying the averments in the Petition.  He has stated that so far
no letter has been received from the Petitioner by the  Respondent.    He  has
further  stated  that  no Consent Order has been passed or given by the Second
Respondent and hence, the question of cancellation of  Consent  Order  by  the
Second Respondent does not arise.  
</p>


<p id="p_5">        5.   We  have  heard  the  submissions  of the learned counsel for the
Petitioner.  Contending that the issuance  of  Consent  Order  by  the  Second
Respondent  / Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board is not in accordance with the
provisions of G.O.Ms.No.213 Environment and Forests (EC-1)  dated  30.03.1989, 
learned   counsel   urged  that  the  putting  up  of  the  factory  with  its
manufacturing unit at Melamattur village in S.Nos.10  ,11  and  13  is  to  be
restrained.  The main contention urged is that the factory set up by the Sixth
Respondent   would  fall  within  the  Industries  listed  in  Annexure  I  of
G.O.Ms.No.213 Environment and Forests (EC-1) dated 30.03.1989, which prohibits  
establishment of Industries  within  1  K.M  from  embankments  of  the  water
sources.  Subsequently,  by  G.O.    Ms.No.127  Environment and Forests (EC-3) 
dated  08.05.1998,  the  distance  of  1  K.M  stipulated   in   G.O.Ms.No.123
Environment  and  Forests  (EC-1)  dated  30.03.1989  has  been  extended to a
distance of 5 K.M.  Drawing our attention  to  the  above  Government  Orders,
learned  counsel for the Petitioner urged that the factory sought to be set up
by the Sixth Respondent is to be prohibited.  The next contention urged by the
Petitioner is that from the reply of the Fifth Respondent, the Petitioner  has
learnt  that  the  Sixth  Respondent  has  put  up  the  manufacturing unit in
S.Nos.10.11 and 13 in violation of the Lease Agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6.  We have  carefully  considered  the  averments  in  the  petition,
submissions  of  the  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the Petitioner and the
Respondents and the materials on record.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7.  From the records, it is seen that the Second Respondent has issued
Order  (Consent  Order  No.007  Dated  30.01.2002)  in  favour  of  the  Sixth
Respondent  for  construction  of the Unit in S.Nos.10,11 and 13 of Melamathur
Village.  The permission granted is valid for two years.    The  said  Consent
Order was issued under AIR (P &amp; CP) Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">        8.   As  per  Water (P &amp; CP) Act, prior concurrence of the Agriculture
Department is to be obtained.  From the Counter Statement filed by the  Fourth
Respondent, it is seen that the following guidelines are given:-
i.In  G.O.Ms.No.559,  Agriculture  (AP.I)  Department  dated  09.10.1991,  the
Government directed the Planning Authorities of the State  to  get  the  prior
concurrence of the Agriculture Department that the wet lands concerned are not
fit  for  cultivation before according approval to House Sites building plans,
whenever the private wet lands are involved.
</p><p id="p_9">ii.In  G.O.Ms.No.605  Agriculture  (API)  Department  dated  11.11.1991,   the
Government  has  issued  the following guide lines for regulating the issue of
concurrence by the Joint Directors.
</p><p id="p_10">Further guidelines are given that while granting such consent order, the Joint
Directors of Agriculture Department should ensure that the wet lands  involved
are not  fit for cultivation.  While granting concurrence of the Department to
the  Planning  Authorities  for  converting  the  same  for  non  agricultural
purposes,  the  Joint  Directors  are  empowered  to  grant the concurrence in
respect of Building Applications only.  The  Joint  Directors  of  Agriculture
Department  are  empowered  to  grant  concurrence  in  respect  of individual
building applications only.  In  the  case  of  layouts  for  building  sites,
application  for  cluster  of  building,  private  group  houses,  apartments,
Factories and building coming under  non-residential  purposes  like  shopping
complex,  play  grounds,  parks,  cinema  houses, Kalyan Mandaps etc, only the
Government in Agriculture Department  is  the  competent  authority  to  grant
concurrence for  conversion  of  wet  lands.    The  same  has been amended in
Government  Letter  No.4913/AP.I/92-2  dated  01.04.1992  of  the  Agriculture
Department, Madras  9, which is as follows:
</p><p id="p_11">        In  cases  where the Master Plan / Detailed Development plan has been
prepared and consented under the Town and Country  Planning  Act  and  if  the
proposals  of  the  applicant  conforms  to  the approved land use in the said
plans, the No Objection Certificates from the Agriculture  Department  is  not
necessary.   The onus of deciding the need to refer such cases or not to refer
such cases will rest with the Planning Authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        9.  The above Amendment relates only to the  Master  Plan  /  Detailed
Development Plan.  Thus, in cases of Factories presently, only the Agriculture
Department  /  the  Fourth Respondent is competent to issue the consent letter
regarding conversion of Agricultural  land  into  Non  Agricultural  land  and
construction  of  factory  (Vide  Counter filed by the Fourth Respondent) Act.
The Sixth Respondent has not at all made any requisition  to  the  Agriculture
Department for  issuing  concurrence  Letter.    In the Counter Statement, the
Fourth Respondent has denied receipt of  any  petition  from  the  Petitioner.
Further,  the Fourth Respondent has asserted no consent order has been passed 
or given by the second respondent to  the  Sixth  Respondent  and  hence,  the
question of  cancellation  of  Consent  Order  does  not  arise.   Further, no
proposal requesting to issue concurrence for the construction  of  factory  by
the Sixth Respondent has been sent to the Government by the fourth respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        10.   The  main  point  urged  onbehalf  of the Petitioner is that the
proposed Factory by the Sixth Respondent would require the minimum qunatity of 
50,000 litres of Water and if the Sixth Respondent is permitted to  draw  such
huge  quantity  of  Water, it would result in the level of reduction of Ground
Water Table, ultimately affecting the entire Agricultural  activities  in  and
around the  area.    Further contention of the Petitioner is that the Industry
now sought to be set up is a Chemical Unit which generates polluted effluents.
Learned counsel for the  Petitioner  drawn  the  attention  of  the  Court  to
G.O.Ms.No.213 Environment and Forests (EC-1) dated 30.03.1989, which prohibits  
establishments  of  Industries  as  listed in Annexure I within 1 K.M from the
embankments of the water sources mentioned in Annexure 2 of the  Notification.
Now,  by  G.O.Ms.No.127  Environment  and Forests (EC-3) dated 08.05.1998, the  
distance of 1 K.M stipulated in G.O.Ms.No.123 Environment and  Forests  (EC-1)
dated 30.03.1989  has  been  extended  to  a  distance  of 5 K.M.  Whether the
Factory that is sought to be set up by the Sixth Respondent is falling  within
the  prohibited  distance  or not is the matter of Investigation that is to be
undertaken by the Appropriate Authority.
</p><p id="p_14">        11.  From the Counter Statement filed by the Sixth Respondent,  it  is
clear  that  the Sixth Respondent has not obtained the Consent Letter from the
Agricultural Department, who is competent to  issue  the  Consent  Letter  for
starting the  Factory.   The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has issued the
Consent Order No.007 Dated 30.01.2002 in favour of the Sixth  Respondent  only
AIR (P  &amp;  CP)  Act.    It  was  informed by the Second Respondent / Pollution
Control Board that Consent Letter has been issued under the Water  (P&amp;CP)  Act
also.  Despite several adjournments, no Letter or definite materials have been
produced  before  this Court that the Consent Letter was also issued under the
Water (P&amp;CP) Act.  
</p>
<p id="p_15">        12.  When the matter  was  heard  on  several  occasions,  the  Second
Respondent  /  Tamil  Nadu  Pollution  Control Board has only filed the Report
informing the  Court  that  the  Sixth  Respondent    Meron  Biopolymers  was
inspected  on  04.11.2004  and that the Unit was found to be not in operation.
It is further stated that the Chief Executive of the Unit  vide  letter  dated
24.01.2004  has  informed that the proposal for establishing the Unit has been
dropped.  The representative of the Fifth Respondent, who is the owner of  the
land  leased  to  the Sixth Respondent has also informed the Second Respondent 
during the Inspection that the Unit was not in operation.
</p><p id="p_16">        13.  Learned counsel for the Petitioner has also  informed  the  Court
that after the filing of the Writ Petition, the Unit is not in operation.  The
Statement  of  the  Second  Respondent  that  the  Unit is not in operation is
recorded.  In view of  the  above,  the  Second  and  Fourth  Respondents  are
directed not to permit the Sixth Respondent to run the Factory in future.
</p>
<p id="p_17">        14.  This Writ Petition is ordered accordingly.  No costs.
        The connected W.P.M.P.No.53298 of 2002 is closed.
