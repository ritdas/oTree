<div class="doc_title">Madhu Mangal Shukla vs Union Of India Thru. Secr. ... on 21 January, 2010</div><pre id="pre_1">Court No. - 9

Respondent Counsel :- A.S.G.I.,C.S.C. (2010/2052),D.S. Chauhan

Hon'ble Vijay Manohar Sahai,J.
</pre><p id="p_1">Hon'ble Virendra Kumar Dixit,J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">Statement has been made by Sri A. Chaturvedi learned counsel for the
petitioner that Shri G.N. Verma Senior Counsel has withdrawn from this case
and he will not appear as Counsel in this writ petition. Sri A. Chaturvedi with
Sri Amit Verma will only appear as Counsel for the petitioner in view of the
statement made by him.
</p>
<p id="p_3">We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner, Dr. A.K. Nigam, Additional
Solicitor General of India assisted by Mr. Irfan Ali for respondent no. 1, 2, 3
and 10, Standing Counsel appearing for respondents no. 4, 5 and 6, Sri Rajesh
Mishra appearing for respondent no. 7 and Sri D.S. Chauhan for respondent
no. 8.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Counter affidavit may be filed within three weeks thereafter rejoinder
affidavit may be filed within one week. The petitioner shall take steps to serve
notice by Registered Post as well as Dasti notice within a week.
</p>
<p id="p_5">It has been argued by learned counsel for the petitioner that Vrindavan has its
religious importance and along the river Yamuna there is Panchkosi
Parikrama Marg which passes through the Ghats situated on the banks of river
Yamuna. The pilgrims do parikrama on their feet as well as by crawling on
the Parikrama Marg to worship Lord Krishna. That some persons in collusion
with the authorities had encroached the bank of river Yamuna by raising
construction and making their houses, ashrams, hotels etc. between the Ghat
and river Yamuna along the Parikrama Marg in the flood plain area. That the
land over which these illegal constructions have been raised, in fact is a nazul
land. That the drains and sewerage of the aforesaid area falls in river Yamuna
making the river unfit for drinking, washing and bathing purposes. It is further
submitted that the garbage of the city also being dumped in the aforesaid
ghats. That allowing the constructions which is being raised on the ground
that the same is in the interest of public, question still remains whether
interest of ecology and environment and right to the citizens guaranteed under
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1">article 21</a> of Constitution of India would have priority over the interest of
public. It is also submitted that the respondents had started construction of
bridge along the river Yamuna which starts from Shringarvat and ends in
Badikunj (Keshi Ghat). The aforesaid constructions have been started without
obtaining No Objection Certificate from the Ministry of Environment for the
construction of bridge over river Yamuna that too not across the river but
along the river bank. That Vrindavan comes under the Taj Trapezium Zone
and the authorities had also not obtained No Objection Certificate from the
Hon'ble Apex Court before starting construction. That due to construction of
aforesaid bridge not only Gahats will perish but the flow of the river which
 has been diverted from construction of bridge will also leave only ghats from
where at present river flows.
</p>
<p id="p_6">Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the office of the
respondent no. 8 had admitted that Vrindavan Samagra Vikas Pariyojana,
Tourism Master Plan of Vraj Region is yet not sanctioned and the fund for the
aforesaid construction has been sanctioned by Tourism Department. That the
construction work of the bridge is against the rules of the the Indian
Archaeological Act and the same was stopped by District Magistrate, Mathura
but the same has again started and work on the bridge is being carried out
without obtaining the necessary permission from the concerned departments.
It is also submitted that to permit constructions along with river amounts to
breach of the statutory provision of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, the
Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974, the Air (Prevention
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>. Learned counsel for the Mahtura Vrindavan
Development Authority urged that the authorities have given notice to the
persons who are raising illegal constructions. Prima facie, it appears that no
firm action has been taken by the concerned authorities to stop the illegal
constructions raised between the ghats and river by local citizens. Dumping of
garbage in the ghats of river Yamuna, illegal encroachments constructions on
the side of bank of river, permitting raising construction of bridge along river
Yamuna without being any permission from the Hon'ble the Apex Court
which comes under the Taj Trapezium Zone is a serious matter. On all these
aspects of the matter, a detailed counter affidavit shall be filed by the
respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_7">List for further hearing on 23.2.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_8">Until further order of the Court, the respondents are directed to stop further
constructions over the bridge which is being constructed along side river
Yamuna and other illegal constructions on the land which falls between the
ghats and river Yamuna on both the sides and to stop dumping of garbage in
river Yamuna or its bank. Respondents are further directed to ensure that no
constructions are raised in the aforesaid area by any person.
