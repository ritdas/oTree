R.R. Prasad, J.   This writ application is directed against that part of order dated 21.8.206

          passed by learned Chief Judicial Maigstrate, Chaibasa in Misc. Case No. 18 of 2006

          (arising out of Noamundi P.S Case No. 15 of 2006), whereby learned Chief Judicial

          Magistrate, Chaibasa was pleased to pass order for confiscating the trucks bearing

          Registration Nos. PB-10 BH-4287 and PB-13L-7987, belonging to petitioner no. 1-

          Avatar Singh, and PB-10 AS-9565, belonging to petitioner no. 2- Mohinder Singh.

</p><p id="p_2">          2.      The facts giving rise this application are that on 23.2.2006 a team,

          consisting of District Mining Officer, Chaibasa and others constituted for the

          purpose of stopping illegal mining transportation etc., raided a place known as

          Jojo Camp situated at Noamundi and found huge quantity of fine iron ore stored

          on a vacant piece of land which was being loaded on several trucks including the

          trucks in question with the help of dumper and J.C.B. On seizure of the challan

          and other documents, it could be known that the iron ore was to be transported

          from Orissa to Haldia Port under the transit permit issued by the Government of

          Orissa, but the transporters instead of taking the trucks to its destination brought

          it at Jojo Camp so that the iron ores, illegally mined and stored, be loaded on those

          trucks before proceeding to its destination. From the documents, it could be also

          known that one Manish Khemka of Calcutta was the person who had indulged
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                       2</span>


himself in the illegal activities in connivance with the transporter- S.M. Carrier

Private Ltd. and thereby 8 trucks, one dumper and one J.C.B. were seized.

</p><p id="p_3">3.      On the basis of the said complaint, an F.I.R. was instituted as Noamundi

P.S Case No. 15 of 2006 under <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_1">Sections 447</a>, <a href="/doc/1208971/" id="a_2">353</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_3">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_4">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_5">120B</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_6">34</a> of the Indian

Penal Code as well as under <a href="/doc/1195854/" id="a_7">Sections 4</a>/<a href="/doc/112147/" id="a_8">21</a> of the Mines and Minerals

(Development &amp; <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_9">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 and also under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_10">Section 21</a> of the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. Subsequently, on a report (Ext. 3),

submitted by the Officer In-charge, Noamundi P.S. to Chief Judicial Magistrate,

Chaibasa, a confiscation proceeding was initiated vide Misc. Case No. 18 of 2006

for confiscating the vehicles seized in connection with the aforesaid case. On being

noticed, petitioner no. 1- Avatar Singh, owner of two trucks bearing Registration

Nos. PB-10 BH-4287 and PB-13L-7987, and petitioner no. 2- Mohinder Singh,

owner of the truck bearing Registration No. PB-10 AS-9565, filed their show-

causes, wherein they stated that the vehicles had been engaged by North Eastern

Carrier Corporation Limited for transportation of iron ores (fines) from Jajangar,

Orissa to Haldia Port and on the way, the said vehicles have been seized, though

neither the drivers nor the owners of the vehicles have been made accused for

committing any offence under the Mines and Minerals (Development &amp;

<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_12">Regulation) Act</a>, rather whatever allegation of commission of offence under the

Mines and Minerals (Development &amp; <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_13">Regulation) Act</a> has been made, that has

been made against Manish Khemka as well as transport S.M. Carrier Private Ltd.

and, therefore, the vehicles in question be released in favour of the petitioners.

</p><p id="p_4">4.      Upon it, the matter was taken up for inquiry, wherein Diwakar Prasad

Singh (A.W.-1), Mines Inspector, Ashim Kispotta (A.W.-2), Circle Officer,

Noamundi and the informant-Raghavnandan Prasad (A.W.-3), District Mining

Officer, Chaibasa have been examined who stated before the court that when the

iron ores were being loaded on the trucks, it were seized, as they did not have any

documents relating to transportation of the same in terms of the provisions of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>


Jharkhand State Minerals Transportation Rules, 2005, rather the documents

relating to transportation were there which had been issued by the Government of

Orissa, but it were forged. The petitioners also examined themselves as O.P. W. 2

&amp; O.P. W. 4, whereby they produced challans, issued by North Eastern Carrier

Corporation Ltd., which were marked as Ext. B, E, and F, whereas transit permits

were marked as X/2, X/3, X/4, X/5, X/6, X/7, X/8, X/9 and X/10 for

identification. Learned court after considering the oral and documentary

evidences did find the challans, issued by the North Eastern Carrier Corporation

Ltd., and also transit permits, issued by the Government of Orissa, to be forged, as

according to the court, writing of the numbers of the vehicles in the challans as

well as in the transit permits were of different inks and on that ground alone, the

vehicles were ordered to be confiscated.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        Being aggrieved with that order, this writ application has been filed.

</p><p id="p_6">5.      Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that simply for the

reasons that the writing of the numbers of the vehicles in the challans, issued by

the North Eastern Carrier Corporation Ltd., and also the transit permits, issued by

the Mining Authority of Government of Orissa, were of different inks, the

documents were considered to be forged, though the prosecuting agency has

never verified it from the concerned Authority who had issued those documents

and in absence of any inquiry being made from the concerned person, any finding

with respect to the documents being forged would be illegal and any such finding

in such circumstances is an outcome of conjecture and surmises.

</p><p id="p_7">6.      However, learned counsel appearing for the State submits that it is true

that no inquiry was made by the prosecuting agency about the genuinity of the

documents from the concerned person who had issued it, but still the court has

found those documents to be forged, as the writings were of different inks.

</p><p id="p_8">7.      Having heard learned counsel appearing for the parties, I do not find any

substance in the submission advanced on behalf of the State, simply for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     4</span>


reasons that if some documents have been written in two different inks that would

never mean that those documents would always be forged, as there could have

been so many reasons for having two writings over the same documents. When

the prosecuting agency considered those documents, such as challans, issued by

the North Eastern Carrier Corporation Ltd., and the transit permits, issued by the

Mining Officer, Government of Orissa, to be forged, it should have easily inquired

into the matter over the genuinity of the documents from the maker of the

documents, but the prosecuting agency never seems to have taken any pain to get

the documents verified from the maker of the documents and in absence of such

inquiry, it cannot be said conclusively about the documents being forged simply

for the reasons that the documents do have writing in two different inks.

Therefore, any finding, given by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Chaibasa

about the documents, being forged, certainly appears to be bad.

</p><p id="p_9">8.      It has been stated in the FIR that the iron ores (fine) were being carried to

Haldia Port from Orissa but the trucks got stopped at Jojo Camp for getting the

illegal iron ores loaded, but no such evidence was produced by the prosecuting

agency. Moreover, the prosecuting agency seems to have been admitted at least

that the iron ores were being transported under transit permit, issued by the

Mining Authority, Government of Orissa. However, it is the stand of the

prosecuting agency that iron ore was never being carried under the permit issued

by the State of Jharkhand in terms of the provisions of the Mines and Minerals

(Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_14">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 and also Jharkhand Mineral Transit

Challan Regulations, 2005. It would appear from reading of the relevant provision

of the Regulation that the transit permit is required to be issued at the place from

where iron ores are dispatched and since admittedly iron ores had been

dispatched from Orissa, the transporter was not required to have any permit

under the Jharkhand Mineral Transit Challan Regulations, 2005.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      5</span>


</p><p id="p_10">9.       Under these circumstances, the petitioners can never be said to have

committed any offence whatsoever under the Mines and Minerals (Development

and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_15">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957. In this respect, Sub Section (4) of <a href="/doc/112147/" id="a_16">Section 21</a> of the

Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_17">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957, prescribing

penalties for contravention of the provisions of the Act or Rules needs to be taken

note of, reads as follows :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                    " (4) Whenever any person raises, transports or causes to be
                    raised or transported, without any lawful authority, any
                    mineral from any land, and, for that purpose, uses any tool,
                    equipment, vehicle or any other thing, such mineral tool,
                    equipment, vehicle or any other thing shall be liable to be
                    seized by an officer of authority specially empowered in this
                    behalf. "
</blockquote><p id="p_11">10.      Keeping in view the facts and circumstances, as indicated above, and also

coming to the finding that the prosecuting agency failed to establish that the

documents, under which iron ores were being carried, were forged, the petitioners

can never be said to have committed any offence in terms of <a href="/doc/36867/" id="a_18">Section 21</a> (4) of the

Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_19">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957.

</p><p id="p_12">11.      In this view of the matter, that part of order dated 21.8.206 passed by

learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Chaibasa in Misc. Case No. 18 of 2006 (arising

out of Noamundi P.S Case No. 15 of 2006), whereby two trucks bearing nos. PB-10

BH-4287 and PB-13L-7987, belonging to petitioner no. 1- Avatar Singh, and the

truck bearing no. PB-10 AS-9565, belonging to petitioner no. 2- Mohinder Singh,

were ordered to be confiscated, is hereby quashed. Consequently, the respondent

no. 2 (District Mining Officer, Chaibasa) is directed to release the aforesaid trucks

forthwith in favour of the petitioners on executing bond of Rs. three lakhs each

with one surety each.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.      Accordingly, this writ application is allowed.

</p><p id="p_15">      13.     Before parting with this order, it be observed that any finding given is

      confined to this case only and hence it would not be prejudicial so far the main

      case is concerned.
