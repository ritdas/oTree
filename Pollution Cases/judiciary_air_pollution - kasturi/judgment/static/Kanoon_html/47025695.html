Coram: Hon'ble Rajiv Sharma , J.
</pre><p id="p_1">       Hon'ble Sudhanshu Dhulia, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">Per: Hon'ble Rajiv Sharma , J.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             The present petition has been filed by the
petitioner society pro bono publico. The Society i.e. 'Shri
Sai Nath Seva Mandal' is registered under the provisions
of the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_1">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860. It is involved in
espousing social causes.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.           Petitioner has made a startling revelation in
the petition that the municipal waste generated in
Kashipur city is being dumped directly in Dhela river
near the Sai Temple situated on the Moradabad Road in
Kashipur town.        It also emanates foul gases which are
detrimental to the health of the people residing in the
vicinity of the river.         The society has made several
representations to the respondent no.5 i.e. Nagar Palika
Parishad, Kashipur. However, respondent no.5 is remiss
in discharge of its statutory duties.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              2</span>




<p id="p_5">3.          According to the petitioner, the respondents
have violated the various provisions of the Environmental
and Municipal Laws. The State Government has also, as
per the averments made in the petition, sanctioned a
sum of Rs.35 lakhs to the respondent no.5 under the
Thirteenth Five Year Plan but the same has not been
utilized by the respondent no.5. Petitioner has sought a
direction to the respondent no.5 to stop dumping of
municipal waste in Dhela River and also to remove the
same.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.          This Court took cognizance of the matter and
directed the respondent no.5 to take all remedial
measures.      The Court also arrayed the Secretary,
Department of Irrigation, Government of Uttarakhand,
Dehradun as well as the Executive Engineer, Department
of Irrigation, Kashipur Division, District U.S. Nagar, as
respondent    nos.9   and   10   respectively.   Since   the
municipal waste was dumped near the bridge and also
directly into the river, the National Highways Authority of
India, through its Project Director, was added as
respondent no.11.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.          Respondent nos.9 and 10, in their affidavits,
have stated that the steps were being taken to remove the
garbage.    It is stated that the stone pitching work was
undertaken including construction of spurs.       A sum of
Rs.16.04 lakh was spent, however, the petitioner has
brought to the notice of this Court that the pitching work
washed away within a period of one year.         This Court
took a serious view of the matter and directed the
respondent nos.9 and 10 to do the needful. Respondent
nos.9 and 10 have undertaken to restore the work and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               3</span>




not to make any payment for the restoration work to the
contractor.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.          Dumping of municipal waste near the bridge
has also resulted in weakness of bridge.        Respondent
no.5, in the affidavit, has stated that further dumping of
municipal waste was stopped in the river and a new site
was chosen for dumping. In the month of October, 2013,
the Department of Irrigation had prepared the project for
flood protection and anti-erosion work along both banks
of Dhela river and Phika river (Tributary of Ram Ganga
River) in Ramnagar, Kashipur and Jaspur Blocks of
Districts Nainital and U.S. Nagar. It was sent to Ganga
Flood Control Commission, Ministry of Water Resources,
Government      of   India.   The   Ganga   Flood   Control
Commission on 18.9.2012 raised some objections in the
project which was removed by the Irrigation Department
on 10.12.2013 and 4.1.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.          Respondent no.5 has filed its detailed affidavit
stating therein that the proposal for Solid Waste
Management was sent to the State Government for its
approval and allotment of land.      The Nagar Palika had
also sent a proposal to respondent no.2 for allotment of
an alternative land out of the ceiling limits of Escort
Farms at Kashipur.       The Palika had also submitted a
proposal for modernization of the Solid Waste Treatment
Plant and allowed grant of money in order to undertake
the solid waste management effectively.       However, the
same is pending with respondent no.2.
</p>
<p id="p_10">8.          Now, as far as the spending the amount of
Rs.35 lakh by the Palika is concerned, a very vague and
sketchy reply has been filed, by stating, that the Nagar
Palika has utilized the money by buying equipments
relating to the waste management and material for street
lighting.

sum of Rs.10.01 crore was sanctioned by the State
Government for 29 cities of the State. Since the land is
not available at some places out of the aforesaid 29 cities,
therefore, the said Scheme could not be implemented in
toto.   It   is   further   stated   that   on    the   basis   of
recommendations        of   13th/14th   Finance    Commission,

create public awareness among the citizens of the State.
Under Rule 16 of the Rules, the duties of State Pollution
Control Board or Pollution Control Committee have been
prescribed. There is a separate rule i.e. Rule 20 dealing
with the criteria and actions to be taken for solid waste
management in hilly areas.
</p>
<p id="p_106">70.   However, the fact of the matter is that despite the
notification of these Rules on 8.4.2016, nothing concrete
has been undertaken by the State agencies including the
Panchayati Raj institutions.       The garbage is thrown all
over the public places. The garbage is neither segregated
nor stored as per the provisions of these Rules at the
source. However, it is made clear that when the petition
was instituted, the Municipal Solid Waste (Management
&amp; Handling) Rules, 2000 were in vogue but later on,
these were superseded by the Solid Waste Management
Rules, 2016 notified on 8.4.2016.

waste is discharged in open or dumped in rivers/rivulets.
</p>
<p id="p_109">72.          The Central Government has framed the Rules
called as Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016
(hereinafter to be referred as the 'Rules of 2016'). These
Rules have come into force w.e.f. 28.3.2016. Rule 3 of
the Rules is the dictionary clause. The duties of operator
of a common bio-medical waste treatment and disposal
facility are provided under Rule 5 of the Rules of 2016.
The duties of authorities are provided under Rule 6.

concerned, the land has been purchased by the Nagar
Palika and the garbage dumped in River Dhela has been
retrieved.      The bye-laws have been framed and sent to
the State Government for its notification by few local
bodies.
</p>
<p id="p_132">76.          The Municipal bodies/Nagar Panchayats are
required to dispose all the waste garbage in a scientific
method to avoid contamination of all rivers and seepage
of harmful chemicals in the underground water.                           The
non-scientific        disposal      of        garbage   also   causes    air
pollution which degrades the quality of air and public
health.      Every citizen has a fundamental right to get
clean and fresh air under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_6">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of
India. The statutory authorities are remiss in discharge
of their duties.        The municipal laws require scientific
disposal of garbage.             The garbage is required to be
collected,      stored,     segregated           and    transported     and
disposed of in a scientific manner in landfills. It is the
responsibility of the respondent no.6 also to ensure that
the provisions of Environmental Protection Act, 1986 and
the Rules, framed thereunder, are followed in letter and
spirit. It is the duty of the Secretary, Executive Officers,
Municipality/Panchyati Raj Institutions to ensure that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                  44</span>




the   Solid     Waste    Management       Rules,     2016   are
implemented in letter and spirit.
</p>
<p id="p_133">77.        The Uttar Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1916
provides for disposal of solid waste. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_7">Sections 267</a> to <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_8">286</a>
of the said Act deal with sanitation and prevention of
disease.      <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_9">Section 30</a> of the Act empowers the State
Government       to   dissolve    a   municipality    and   the
consequences of dissolution are provided under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_10">Section
31-A</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_134">78.        Similarly,    the     Uttar   Pradesh     Municipal
Corporation Act, 1959, under Chapter XV, provides for
the Sanitary Provisions. Under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_11">Section 385</a> of the said
Act, the duties of the Municipal Commissioner have been
provided for cleansing of all streets and the removal of
sweeping therefrom. The Municipal Commissioner can
also issue the directions under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_12">Section 386</a> to regular the
disposal of rubbish removed through a private agency.
The State Government is empowered under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_13">Section 538</a>
of the Act of 1959 to dissolve a Corporation in case of
incompetency, persistent default or excess or abuse of
power.
</p>
<p id="p_135">79.        Under the Uttarakhand Panchayat Raj Act,
2016, it is the duty of the Gram Panchayats under
<a href="/doc/47804736/" id="a_14">Section 23</a> to maintain cleanliness. Similar duty is also
cast upon the Zila Panchayats under the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_136">80.        According to the Status Report on Municipal
Solid Waste Management, as per the Survey conducted
by the Central Pollution Control Board between the years
2009-2012, 1,27,486 TPD (Tons per day) municipal solid
waste is generated in the country during 2011-12, out of
which, 89,334 TPD (70%) of MSW has been collected and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                45</span>




15,881 TPD (12.45%) is processed or treated. We have
also gone through the report and papers available on
record that in Dehradun, 220 tonnes of municipal solid
waste is generated.     The State Pollution Control Board
has also not supplied certain information as per the
Annexure "C" of the Status Report to Central Pollution
Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_137">81.        According to the norms laid down by the
Municipal Solid Waste Management Manual published by
the Ministry of Urban Development, it is essential to
segregate the wastes into wet waste (kitchen waste) and
dry waste (recyclable waste and others).        It is also
provided therein that the street cleaning is a fundamental
service ensuring clean and hygienic urban conditions.
The workers undertaking cleaning of municipal waste
should be provided with uniforms, shoes, gloves and
other implements etc. for their safe and easy working.
Planning for street cleaning should be evolved according
to the norms. The character of street and frequency of
sweeping is as follows: -
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">Class   Character of Street          Frequency       of
                                     Sweeping
A.      City centre- shopping areas  Daily/twice,
                                     depending on need
B.      Market areas                 Daily
C.      Minor streets                Daily
D.      Sub-urban shopping streets   Daily
E.      Residential streets          Daily
F.      Roads and streets having no Once a week
        households/establishments on
        either sides

</pre><p id="p_138">82.        The workers who are sweeping the roads at
nights should be provided with adequate protection
equipments.     Proper uniforms which have reflectors be
provided with ID cards.       They should also be provided
with the brooms with sufficiently long handle and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                 46</span>




length of the broom should be 80-85 cms. and the weight
of the broom should not be more than 1 kilogram. There
should be proper disposal of solid waste in landfills. The
municipal solid waste is also required to be treated by
composting or by incineration and/or by deploying the
Bio-methanation       process        as   well   as   Pyrolysis
methodology.
</p>
<p id="p_139">83.         Their Lordships of Hon. Supreme Court in
(1996) 2 SCC Page 594 in the case of '<a href="/doc/1980462/" id="a_15">Dr. B.L. Wadehra v.
Union of India &amp; others</a>' have held that the residences
have constitutional as well as statutory right to live in a
clean city. The authorities concerned have a mandatory
duty to collect and dispose of the garbage/waste
generated from various sources in the city.               Non-
availability of funds, inadequacy or inefficiency of staff,
insufficiency of machinery etc. cannot be pleaded as
grounds for non-performance of the statutory obligations.
</p>
<p id="p_140">84.         The essential objective of all provisions relating
to waste disposal must be the protection of human health
and the environment against harmful effects caused by
the collection, transport, treatment, storage and tipping
of waste.
</p>
<p id="p_141">85.         The zenith of civilization can only be gauged
how clean the cities and towns are. Every citizen has a
fundamental as well as human right to clean and
hygienic environment.     Every citizen, at the same time,
has a fundamental duty to maintain the cleanliness in
and around his abode. There are more persons indulging
in littering, dumping of garbage at public places vis-à-vis
the persons employed to clean up the mess.            We must
keep and maintain the dignity of the workers employed to
clean the cities and towns. The Court can take judicial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                   47</span>




notice of the fact that the government/public properties,
walls, religious places, educational institutions, offices,
sign     boards,   signage,       are   disfigured/defaced     by
unscrupulous persons by pasting the posters/pamphlets
on them. Pasting of posters/pamphlets destroys the
aesthetic values of cities and towns.           Stringent law is
required to be made to prohibit the persons from
defacing/disfiguring      the public     property(s)     including
government or private place or building, monument,
statue, post, wall, fence, tree or contrivance visible to a
person being in, or passing along, any public place.
</p>
<p id="p_142">86.          An endeavour should be made to protect the
natural environment and protect the health and safety of
people and also remove aesthetical unpleasant sight and
smell related to solid waste management.
</p>
<p id="p_143">87.          The municipal governance has failed to provide
green and clean environment to its citizens. According to
Brookings Institution, India's per capita spending of $17
on urban infrastructure is just 14% of China's $116,
according to the 2010 McKinsey Global Institute report.
The local bodies are required to improve municipal
governance      and      ensure    efficient   service   delivery.
According to the 14th Finance Commission report, the
municipal revenue accounted for a little more than 1% of
the GDP in India in 2012-13.             It is much less than
emerging economics such as Brazil and South Africa,
where it was 5% and 6%.
</p>
<p id="p_144">88.          Every citizen has a legitimate expectation and
right to sue the elected representatives, officers/officials
of     the   Municipal    Corporation,     Municipalities     and
Panchayati Raj Institutions, individually and by way of
