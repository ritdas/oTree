                              -2-


     THESE PETITIONS COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS DAY,
THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-

                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Learned counsel Sri. Gururaj Joshi has filed

power on behalf of respondent No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      The matter is taken up for final disposal at this

stage itself, with the consent of the learned counsel

appearing for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      2.    The petitioner has challenged the order

dated 21.05.2019 of respondent No.1 as per Annexure -

J to the writ petitions, inter alia, seeking a direction to

respondent No.1 to restore electric connection to the

premises in question i.e., Sy.No.72/1 of Kasavanahalli,

Varthur Hobli, Bengaluru East Taluk, Bengaluru Urban

District.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      3.    The petitioner claims to be the full and

absolute    owner   of   the   land   bearing   Sy.No.72/1

land. It is submitted that a building is existing in the

property in question and the petitioner has paid the

assessment to the Corporation to the said property.


</p><p id="p_8">     4.     It is contended that respondent No.2 advised

respondent No.1 to disconnect the electric connection

available to the premise of the petitioner in respect of

Sy.No.72/1 on the ground that the said premises is

within the prohibited area of buffer zone. But the said

property No.Sy.No.72/1 is not found either in the copy

of the order of respondent No.2 at Annexure - E or the

notice issued by respondent No.1 at Annexure - J. The

said property in Sy.No.72/1 is neither the subject

matter of any of the proceedings nor any order has been

passed against the petitioner relating to the said

property.    Respondent No.1 has disconnected the

electricity connection to the property in question merely

based on the directions of respondent No.2 sans issuing

any notice to the petitioner.

the    impugned        action    of    respondent          No.1   in

disconnecting the electricity connection to the property

in    Sy.No.72/1    is    arbitrary,     illegal     and    without

application of mind.

regarding unit of petitioner along with documents.


</p><p id="p_13">       7.     The order of the National Green Tribunal

Application    No.281/2019        dated        11.03.2019     would

is well settled law that this Court exercising the writ

jurisdiction    under     Articles        226   and      227    of   the

Constitution    would       not     be     appropriate.        At    this

juncture, it is beneficial to refer to the judgment of the

     law in paragraph 36 thereof, the High Court
     has not only entertained a writ petition but
     granted blanket stay of proceedings before the
     National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench, New
