</p><p id="p_2">1.       Petitioners have filed this petition for invoking the inherent powers

envisaged under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C., and pray to set aside the order

Board also filed a documents along with complaint.

</p><p id="p_4">3.    The fact alleged in the complaint in short are that the applicant

No.1 Ms. Baderiya Dairy Farm situated at village Imaliya, Katni Road,

Jabalpur and dealing with the dairy products and applicant No.2 is the

Director of that unit to look after all functions and business and being a

Director having control over the unit. When respondent was informed

that in the unit of applicant No.1 a polluted water was not treating

properly and there is no arrangement for treating the polluted effluent

water, then the respondent send show cause notice to the applicants. The

applicants replied that notice and stated that there is no question of

treatment of polluted water and there is no need for treatment of that

water. The complainant send a notice to close the unit and made

arrangement for treatment of polluted effluent and inspected the

premises on 28.10.2017 and prepared the sample of effluent and it was

send for chemical analysis. After receiving the report of chemical

analysis, send the report to the applicants. During inspection, it was

found that in the unit of applicant No.1 effluent water was polluted.

There was no sewage treatment plant and the polluted effluent is mixed

in the water of the river. The respondent send a notice under <a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_11">Section 33</a>

(A) of the Act of 1974 to close the unit immediately. The respondent

no.2 who is looking after the function of the Unit was equally

responsible for that act, then the complainant filed a complaint against
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>




both the applicants. The complainant stated therein that the applicants

have not complied Sections 24, 25, 26 and 33 (A) of the aforesaid Act

1974 and pray to punish the applicants under <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_12">Sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_13">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1330791/" id="a_14">41</a> of

the Act of 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.    Learned trial Court after hearing both the parties framed the

charges against the applicants vide order dated 12.12.2018 for the

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_15">Sections 44</a> and <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_16">43</a> of the Act of 1974 and

recorded the plea of applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.    Being aggrieved by that order, the applicants filed this petition on

the ground that the whole inspection proceedings conducted before

Sharad Kumar Baderiya and all sample proceeding conducted in

presence of Sharad Kumar Baderiya, he is not representative of the

applicant No.1. The real representative is Mr. Sunil Baderiya, who was

not present at the time of inspection. He neither signed any documents

nor any sample was taken in his presence. The applicant No.2 has

wrongly been implicated as an accused. Mr. Sharad Kumar Baderiya, is

not the representative of the applicant No.1, but complaint was filed

against the representative of the applicant No.1 Mr. Sunil Baderiya. Mr.

Sharad Kumar Baderiya neither owner of the applicant No.1 nor

representative of diary plant. The whole inspection and sampling

conducted by the respondent is in contravention of the law as laid down

in the Act of 1974 and the rules thereto. Learned trial Court has not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     4</span>




paid any attention towards this fact. The applicant No.2 is liable to be

discharged but instead of discharging him, framed the charge against

him and pray for quashment of the charge framed against the applicants.

</p><p id="p_7">6.    Counsel appeared for the applicants submit that the applicants

have filed a written argument before the trial Court, but the learned trial

Court has not appreciated the arguments properly and pray to set aside

the impugned order and discharge the applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.    None present for the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.    After hearing the counsel of the applicant, perused the documents

filed along with this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.    It is not disputed that applicant No.1 M/s Baderiya Dairy Farm

situated at village Imaliya, Katni Road, Jabalpur, is arrayed as an

accused no.1. The question before this Court raised by the counsel for

the applicants that Mr. Sharad Baderia is no one to look after the affairs

of the applicant No.1. Neither he is representative nor he is owner of the

applicant No.1. The whole proceedings were conducted before Sharad

Kumar Baderiya       whereas Director of the applicant No.1 is Sunil

Baderiya    who is looking after of dairy farm. Nothing has been

conducted by the respondent before him and trial Court has not

considered this fact while framing the charge.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.   Perused the complaint dated 13.10.2017 (Annexure-P-2). In this

complaint it is alleged in para 7 that respondent send a notice dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5</span>




16.07.2014    and it was replied by letter dated 13.08.2014 by the

applicant No.1. Copy of the notice dated 16.07.2014 is annexed along

with this petition, perused. It was sent by the Regional Office, M.P.

Pollution Control Board addressed to M/s. Sunil Baderiya, Director. It is

received by both the applicants and both the applicants replied the

notice on 13.04.2014. Copy of that reply is annexed at page no.27.

These documents reflected that applicant No.1 is unit dealing with the

dairy products and when the Regional Office of respondent found that

there was no treatment of the effluent water, he sent notice to applicant

No.1 and he replied that notice. In the complaint, this fact is also

mentioned that after receiving the reply and assessment of the reply, the

respondent again sent a letter on 01.08.2016 to the applicant No.1 under

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_17">Section 33-A</a> of the Act of 1974 and thereafter, the team of respondent

conducted the inspection on 20.10.2017. This all reveals that there was

some effluent water which was polluted and the notice was sent to the

applicant No.1, but on the date of inspection i.e. on 28.10.2017 instead

of Mr. Sunil Baderiya one Mr. Sharad Kumar Baderiya was present in

the campus of the applicant No.1. No doubt, Mr. Sunil Baderiya, was

not present on the date of inspection i.e. on 28.10.2017, but another

person Mr. Sharad Kumar Baderiya was present and who is that person,

is to be explained by the applicant No.1 and not by the respondent

because Mr. Sharad Kumar Baderiya was present in the premises of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     6</span>




applicant No.1. No doubt, he was not the Director, but he signed on

behalf of applicant No.1 and sampling of polluted effluent conducted in

presence of Mr. Sharad Kumar Baderiya. When it was sent for the

chemical examination, it was found polluted. No doubt, there is prima

facie material available with the record to proceed against the applicant

No.1. Whether Mr. Sharad Kumar Baderiya is representative of the

applicant No.1 or not, it is to be decided during trial. This Court at the

time of invoking the inherent powers should not decide the trial on

merits

</p><p id="p_12">11.   Perused the written arguments filed along with this petition. This

written argument was filed by both the applicants before the Court of

JMFC. This argument is mainly based on that Sunil Baderiya applicant

No.2 is Director but all proceedings conducted before Sharad Kumar

Baderiya, who has not been arrayed as an accused and second part of

the argument is that Sharad Kumar Baderiya is neither representative of

the Company nor any person who look after the affairs of the Company

hence, Sunil Baderiya is not liable to be made party.

</p><p id="p_13">12.   Perused the complaint. Sunil Baderiya is made a party being

Director of the applicant No.1. Until and unless it is proved that being

Director he is not looking after affairs of the Company, the Director is

equally responsible for the act committed by the Company. Learned trial

Court vide order dated 12.12.2018 considered the whole allegations
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       7</span>




raised by the applicants before the trial Court and after considering all

the allegations and objections proceeded to frame charge against the

applicants. The powers envisaged under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_18">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C., for

invoking the inherent powers should be exercised sparingly in the

condition of rarest in rare case. There is sufficient prima facie material

available against the applicants. There is no need to quash the

complaint. Learned counsel for the applicants during arguments has

drawn the attention of this Court in the case of State of Haryana &amp;

Ors. Vs. Ch. Bhajanlal &amp; ors. [AIR 1992 SC 604] Apex Court has

culled out some important points for quashing of the FIR or complaint,

as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "108. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the
             various relevant provisions of the Code under
             Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated
             by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the
             exercise of the extraordinary power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_19">Article 226</a>
             or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code
             which we have extracted and reproduced above, we
             give the following categories of cases by way of
             illustration wherein such power could be exercised
             either to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or
             otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may
             not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly
             defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible
             guidelines or rigid formulae and to give              an
             exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such
             power should be exercise.
