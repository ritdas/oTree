<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "31. From the above authorities, it is clear that an appeal is
            a creature of statute and an appellate tribunal has to act
            strictly within the domain prescribed by statute. It is obvious
            that an appeal would lie from an order or decision of the
            appellate authority under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_4">Section 28</a> of the Water Act to the

     NGT only under <a href="/doc/170325745/" id="a_5">Section 33B(a)</a> of the Water Act read with
     Section 16(a) of the NGT Act. Similarly, an appeal would lie
     from an order or decision of the appellate authority under
     <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_6">Section 31</a> of the Air Act to the NGT only under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Section 31B</a>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     Obviously, since no order or decision had been made by the
     appellate authority under either the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Water Act</a> or the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">Air Act</a>,
     any direct appeal against an original order to the NGT would





     be incompetent. NGT's jurisdiction being strictly
     circumscribed by <a href="/doc/156852187/" id="a_11">Section 33B</a> of the Water Act, read with
     <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_12">Section 31B</a> of the Air Act, read with <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_13">Section 16(a)</a> and (f) of
     the NGT Act, would make it clear that it is only orders or
     decisions of the appellate authority that are appealable, and




     not original orders. On the facts of the present case, it is
     clear that an appeal was pending before the appellate
     authority when the NGT set aside the original order dated
     09.04.2018. This being the case, the NGT's order being

     clearly outside its statutory powers conferred by the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_14">Water
     Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_15">Air Act</a>, and the NGT Act, would be an order passed

     without jurisdiction.

     <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_17">Article 323A(2)(d</a>), the Administrative Tribunal so set up

             should be uniformly applied to all the streams irrespective of

             perenniality. As these areas are zones of water flow, any
             changes to or dumping of crusher waste is likely to badly

             impact the quality of water for the downstream reaches
             during monsoon season.

             exempted from the 100m distance norm, subject to having
             additional precautionary measures in place to tackle air





             pollution. Due to topography of the area, effluents may not
             enter the stream pre-empting water pollution of stream. The
             suggested additional precautionary measures in such cases





             are : i) the stone crusher units should be installed in the
             covered shed with proper air emission suppressing system ii)

             irrespective of location of Stone Crusher Units near perennial
             or non-perennial streams.
