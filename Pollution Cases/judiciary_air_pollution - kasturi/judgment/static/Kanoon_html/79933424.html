</pre><p id="p_1">Hon'ble Ramesh Ranganathan, C.J.
</p><p id="p_2">                 This application is filed under Sections 151 and 152 CPC read
with <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, on behalf of a mosque known
as 'Jama Masjid', situated at Bazpur of District Udham Singh Nagar, by the
applicant who claims to be a representative of all mutawallies of Waqfs of
all mosques in the entire State of Uttarakhand, as he was elected as a
member of the Waqf Board by the Mutawallies of all Waqfs in the State of
Uttarakhand, from the Mutawalli quota, under Section 14 of the Waqf Act,
vide Government Order dated 25.10.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.               The modification sought, by way of this application, is to the
order passed in Writ Petition (PIL) No.112 of 2015 dated 19.06.2018', and
a direction is also sought to the District Magistrate to permit use of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                       2</span>


loudspeakers in places of worships within the limits prescribed in the
'schedule' to the Noise Pollution (Regulations and Control) Rules, 2000
(for short the '2000 Rules'); and, if the noise level as a result of the use of
loudspeakers exceeds the limits specified in the 'schedule', for its relaxation
upto 10dB(A), or in a total upto 75 dB(A), whichever is less as provided in
Rule 5(4) of the Rules. The applicant is mainly aggrieved by mandatory
direction No. 'I', as detailed in Paragraph No.20 of the order of the Division
Bench in Writ Petition (PIL) No.112 of 2015 dated 19.06.2018, which reads
as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "(i). The State Government is directed to ensure that no
      loudspeaker or public address system shall be used by any person
      including religious bodies in Temples, Mosques and Gurudwaras
      without written permission of the authority even during day time, that
      too, by getting an undertaking that the noise level shall not exceed
      more than 5dB(A) peripheral noise level".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">3.           This application is opposed by the petitioner, in Writ Petition
(PIL) No.112 of 2015, contending that the applicant does not represent all
mutawallies of Waqfs of all mosques in the entire State of Uttarakhand; he
is only the mutawalli of a mosque known as 'Jama Masjid' situated at
Bazpur in District Udham Singh Nagar; the direction issued by the Division
Bench, in Writ Petition (PIL) No.112 of 2015 dated 19.06.2018 not to use
loudspeakers in religious places like temples, mosques and gurudwaras etc
without written permission of the authority, is for betterment of the
atmosphere, environment and ecology of the area; if loudspeakers are used,
the noise levels would be polluted according to the 2000 Rules; the
authorities were not permitting the Imams/Mutawallies of the mosque to
use loudspeakers beyond the limit of 5dB(A) peripheral noise level; the
authorities are bound by the judgment passed by this Court; 75dB(A) level
is for an industrial area, and not for a residential area; all mosques are
situated in residential areas; permission cannot, therefore, be granted to use
loudspeakers; the order of the Division Bench does not necessitate
modification as it would allow frequency of loudspeaker upto 75dB(A)
rendering the atmosphere noisy; and the applicant/respondent has no
fundamental right to use loudspeakers in places of worship.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.           In the counter-affidavit, filed on behalf of respondent nos.2
and 3, it is submitted that the applicant is not a party to the Writ Petition
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       3</span>


and cannot, therefore, move a modification application as it is not
maintainable; at the most he can move an application seeking review of the
order dated 19.06.2018; the modification application is filed after
considerable delay, and is liable to be dismissed on this ground also; if the
applicant has any grievance with regards the Government Order dated
04.02.2019, issued in compliance with the order of the Division Bench
dated 19.06.2018, he can challenge the same by filing a Writ Petition; the
Allahabad High Court had passed an order in Writ Petition (PIL) No.570 of
2020 dated 15.02.2020 which covers this issue; the authorities, under the
2000 Rules, are bound by the Schedule to the Rules, and by Rule 5 which
relates to restrictions on the use of loudspeakers/public address systems,
and sound producing instruments; the order of the Division Bench
addresses concerns regarding the use of loudspeakers or any sound
producing instrument; the Division Bench had opined that the Rules had not
been effectively enforced by the State Government; with regards use of
loudspeakers, in a public area or place, Rule 5(4), which applies to noise
levels, should be followed; similarly Rule 5(5) addresses concerns
regarding the peripheral noise level of a private sound system; and the
modification application is not maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.           As the present application is filed under Section 152 CPC, it is
necessary, at the outset, to take note of the scope and ambit of the said
provision. Section 152 CPC provides that "clerical or arithmetical mistakes
in judgments, decrees or orders or errors arising therein from any accidental
slip or omission may at any time be corrected by the Court either of its own
motion or on the application of any of the parties." Exercise of the power,
under Section 152 CPC, contemplates the correction of mistakes by the
Court and does not contemplate the passing of effective judicial orders after
judgment, as the Court becomes functus officio thereafter, and is not
entitled to vary the terms of the judgment passed earlier. (<a href="/doc/936196/" id="a_2">Dwaraka Das v.
State of M.P1</a>). Section 152 CPC cannot be invoked to modify, alter or add
to the terms of the original judgment so as to pass an effective judicial order
after judgment is pronounced in the case. (Dwaraka Das1; <a href="/doc/937834/" id="a_3">Jayalakshmi
Coelho v. Oswald Joseph Coelho2</a>). As correction is of the mistake or
omission, which is accidental and not intentional, the merits of the case
cannot be gone into. (Dwaraka Das1; Jayalakshmi Coelho2).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      4</span>


<p id="p_7">6.           The power of rectification of clerical or arithmetical errors or
an accidental slip does not empower the Court to reconsider the merits of
the case to come to a different conclusion. Exercise of power under Section
152 CPC should be confined to something initially intended but left out, or
added against such an intention. (Jayalakshmi Coelho2). Cases in which
the Court can interfere, after the passing and entering of the judgment, are:
(1) where there has been an accidental slip in the judgment as drawn up, in
which case the Court has the power to rectify it, and (2) where the Court
itself finds the judgment as drawn up does not correctly state what the Court
had actually decided and intended. (<a href="/doc/1071882/" id="a_4">R.M.K.R.M. Somasundaram Chetty
vs. M.R.M.V.L. Subramanian Chetty3</a>; Ainsworth v. Wilding4). If it be
once made out that the order passed does not express the order actually
made, the Court has ample jurisdiction to set that right, whether it arises
from a clerical slip or not. (In re Swire, Mellor v. Swire5; R.M.K.R.M.
Somasundaram Chetty3).
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.           The principle behind Section 152 CPC is that no one should
suffer due to the mistake of the Court and whatever is intended by the
Court, while passing the order, must be properly reflected therein, otherwise
it would only be destructive of the principle of advancing the cause of
justice. (Jayalakshmi Coelho2). The basis of this provision, in Section 152
CPC, is found on the maxim actus curiae neminemgravabit i.e. an act of the
Court shall prejudice no man. Hence, an unintentional mistake of the Court
which may prejudice the cause of any party must be rectified.
(Jayalakshmi Coelho2; <a href="/doc/920647/" id="a_5">Assam Tea Corpn. Ltd. v. Narayan Singh6</a>).
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.           There are two important principles on the basis of which
Section 152 CPC has been enacted. The first, as noted above, is the maxim
that an act of the Court shall prejudice no man. The other is that the Court
has a duty to ensure that its records are true, and they represent the correct
state of affairs. It is because these are considered to be some of the highest
duties of Courts that, in Section 152 C.P.C, it has been provided that, even
in the absence of any move on the part of the parties, the Court can, of its
own motion, make the correction. (<a href="/doc/1245139/" id="a_6">Puthan Veettil Sankaran Nair vs.
Poomulli Manakkal Moopil Sthanam Parameswaran Namboodiripad7</a>).
This is also the reason why the Court is given the power to correct the
records on its own motion, even if the parties to the litigation have not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      5</span>


moved the court for a correction. If the conditions laid down in Section 152
C.P.C. are satisfied, it is obligatory for the Court to order correction.
(<a href="/doc/1891926/" id="a_7">Kuruvilla Thomas, Maliakel, Kanjirappally&amp; others vs. State Bank of
Travancore8</a>; <a href="/doc/817894/" id="a_8">Chandra Kumar Mukhopadhya v. Sm. S.B. Debi9</a>;
Puthan Veettil Sankaran Nair7). The intention of the law is to make it
obligatory for the Court, whenever any mistake is discovered, to correct it,
and Section 152 merely emphasises that duty of the Court by saying that it
may be done at any time. (Chandra Kumar Mukhopadhya9; Puthan
Veettil Sankaran Nair7).
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.           It is true, as is contended on behalf of respondents 2 and 3, that
the applicant is not a party to the Writ Petition. Mr. Arvind Kumar Sharma,
learned counsel for the petitioner, would also contend that the applicant,
therefore, lacks locus standi to file the present Writ Petition. On the other
hand, Mr. T.A. Khan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the
applicant, would rely on Section 14(1)(b)(iv) of the Waqf Act, 1995 to
submit that the applicant was elected as a Member of the State Waqf Board
from an electoral college consisting of mutawallis of the auqaf having an
annual income of rupees one lakh and above; and, consequently, he is
entitled to move this application on behalf of the mutawalli of the Jama
Masjid situated at Bazpur in district Udham Singh Nagar.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.          The question of locus standi need not detain us, since the
power, under Section 152 CPC, inheres in the Court, which passed the
judgment, to correct a clerical mistake or an error arising from an accidental
slip or omission, and to vary its judgment so as to give effect to its meaning
and intention. (<a href="/doc/105132/" id="a_9">Samarendra Nath Sinha &amp; another vs. Krishna Kumar
Nag10</a>). Inherent powers are available to all Courts and authorities
irrespective of whether the provisions contained under Section 152 CPC
may or may not strictly apply to any particular proceeding. Where it is clear
that a mistake had accidently crept in something which the Court intended
to do, due to a clerical or arithmetical mistake, it would only advance ends
of justice to enable the court to rectify such a mistake. (Jayalakshmi
Coelho2). The Court, as a court of record, owes a duty to itself to ensure
that its record is free from any blemish or error. It retains the power to
correct obvious errors in its own record. (Jai Narain v. Chhedalal11;
Puthan Veettil Sankaran Nair7).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      6</span>


<p id="p_12">11.          If the Court finds that the order, as passed and entered,
contains an adjudication upon that which the Court in fact has never
adjudicated upon, then it has jurisdiction which it will, in a proper case,
exercise to correct its record so that it may be in accordance with the order
really pronounced. (In re. Swire, Mellor v. Swire5; R.M.K.R.M.
Somasundaram Chetty3; Puthan Veettil Sankaran Nair7). If it is made
out that the order, whether passed and entered or not, does not express the
order actually made, the Court has ample jurisdiction to set that right,
whether it arises from a clerical or accidental slip. (In re. Swire, Mellor v.
Swire5; Puthan Veettil Sankaran Nair7). An order, even when passed and
entered, may be amended by the Court so as to carry out its intention, and
express the meaning of the Court when the order was made (In re Sweire,
Mellor v. Swire5; Samarendra Nath Sinha10) as this power was always
possessed by Courts. (In re. Swire, Mellor v. Swire5; PuthanVeettil
Sankaran Nair7). As the inherent power, which the Court possesses, must
be exercised by it even in a case where none of the parties to the
proceedings have invoked its jurisdiction seeking such correction, we may
not be justified in refusing to correct an accidental slip or omission in the
order of the Division Bench, in Writ Petition (PIL) No. 112 of 2015 dated
19.06.2018, on this score.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.          In Section 152 CPC no time limit is fixed for making an
amendment in a judgment which has been occasioned by an accidental slip
or error. Such an amendment may be made at any time subject, of course, to
equities which may have arisen in favour of the party against whose interest
the amendment is to be made. (Jai Narain v. Chhedalal11; Puthan Veettil
Sankaran Nair7). An order may be amended by the Court so as to carry out
the intention, and express the meaning, of the Court at the time when the
order was made, provided the amendment be made without injustice or in
terms which preclude injustice. (In re Swire, Mellore v. Swire5;
R.M.K.R.M. Somasundaram Chetty3).
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.          Clerical or arithmetical mistakes in judgments, or errors arising
therein from any accidental slip or omission, may, at any time, be corrected
by the Court either on its own motion or on an application by any of the
parties. (<a href="/doc/823347/" id="a_10">L. Janakirama Iyer v. Nilakanta Iyer12</a>; Samarendra Nath
Sinha10). If any such error is brought to its notice in any manner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       7</span>


whatsoever, and at any time whatsoever, the Court has the power to correct
errors of a clerical nature. To hold otherwise would mean that the Court is
powerless even after discovering that a particular sentence in a judgment is
grammatically incorrect or absurd. The Court will, however, not make any
correction without hearing the parties whose interests are likely to be
affected. (Jai Narain11; Puthan Veettil Sankaran Nair7).
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.          The power of correction, under Section 152 CPC, can be
exercised at any time. The only limitation for its exercise is the scope of the
Section within which it functions. Before exercising or refusing to exercise
it, the Court should ensure that its records are true. These are two of the
important duties of all Courts. (Puthan Veettil Sankaran Nair7). As the
power to correct accidental omissions or slips, in the order passed earlier,
inheres in the Court and it is the obligation of the Court, when it comes to
know that such a mistake has occurred, to correct it, it matters little that its
attention, to the accidental slip or omission, has been drawn after a long
delay.
</p>
<p id="p_16">15.          It does appear that, in compliance with the order of the
Division Bench in Writ Petition (PIL) No. 112 of 2015 dated 19.06.2018,
the State Government had issued order on 04.02.2019. Errors arising from
an accidental slip can be corrected subsequently, even in a judgment
pronounced and signed by the Court. (L. Janakirama Iyer12; Samarendra
Nath Sinha10). The Court is not functus officio with respect to its power to
correct its judgment. The fact that the order has already been executed, and
is therefore dead, is of no consequence, and of no importance, so far as the
question whether the amendment asked for should be allowed or not. The
fact that the judgment has been implemented does not take away the
inherent power of the Court to allow the amendment asked for in its
judgment, if it is fit to be allowed in view of the provisions of Sections 151
and 152 of the Code. (Puthan Veettil Sankaran Nair7). Consequently, the
mere fact that an order was issued by the State Government, in compliance
with the earlier order of the Division Bench, would not disable this Court
from exercising its inherent powers under Section 152 CPC to correct an
accidental error or omission in the order of the Division Bench provided, of
course, it is satisfied that there has been an accidental slip or mistake in the
order necessitating its correction.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                       8</span>


<p id="p_17">16.          On the kind of orders which can be corrected, it must be borne
in mind that, while an arithmetical mistake is a mistake of calculation, a
clerical mistake is a mistake in writing or typing, whereas an error arising
out of or occurring from an accidental slip or omission is an error due to a
mistake on the part of the Court which is liable to be corrected. Such
omissions are attributable to the Court which may say something or omit to
say something which it did not intend to say or omit. (Master
Construction Co. (P) Ltd13; L. Janakirama Iyer12; Jayalakshmi
Coelho2). The accidental slip or omission by the Court may be attributed to
the Judge himself. He may say something or omit to say something which
he did not intend to say or omit. This is described as a slip or omission in
the judgment itself. The obvious instance is a slip or omission to embody in
the order something which the court in fact ordered to be done. (Master
Construction Co. Ltd13). The cause for such a slip or omission may be the
Judge's inadvertence or the advocate's mistake. (Master Construction Co.
(P) Ltd.13). The expression "accidental slip or omission" does not, however,
permit a party to raise new arguments which he has not advanced at the first
instance. (Master Construction Co. (P) Ltd.13; L. Janakirama Iyer12;
Jayalakshmi Coelho2).
</p>
<p id="p_18">17.          It must also be borne in mind that, before exercising its power
under Section 152 CPC, the Court must be legally satisfied, and arrive at a
valid finding, that the order contains or omits something which was
intended to be otherwise, that is to say, the Court must have in its mind that
the order should be passed in a particular manner, but that intention is not
translated into the order due to a clerical or arithmetical error or accidental
slip. The facts and circumstances may provide a clue to the fact intended by
the Court, but did not accidentally find mention in the judgment, or
something which was not intended to be there, stands added to it.

<p id="p_19">18.          Bearing the aforesaid principles in mind, let us now examine
whether the order of the Division Bench contains an accidental omission
warranting exercise of jurisdiction under Section 152 CPC. In its order in
Writ Petition (PIL) No.112 of 2015 date 19.06.2018, the Division Bench
noted that the petitioner had highlighted the adverse effect of discharge of
industrial effluents by the fourth respondent in a playground of a college; he
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                     9</span>


had contended that letting of untreated chemical/industrial waste/effluents
had degraded underground water causing air pollution; hazardous waste had
been dumped in the play fields without treatment; the photographs placed
on record showed the tremendous damage caused to the environment and
ecology of the area; students played in the playground; the District
administration could not have permitted this to happen; effluent water was
spread over in a larger area of the playground, as well as in the adjoining
areas; every citizen, living around the factory, had the fundament right to
have a pollution free environment; it was intriguing that no criminal
proceedings had been initiated, under the relevant provisions, against the
fourth respondent; and mere issuance of notices from time to time, under
<a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_11">Section 33</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974,
was not sufficient compliance.
</p>
<p id="p_20">19.         After referring to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_13">Environment
(Protection) Act</a>, 1986, the Division Bench observed that the third
respondent-Pollution Control Board had not taken sufficient measures to
check noise pollution emanating either from factories, or from
indiscriminate use of loudspeakers/amplifiers even by religious bodies, may
be by temples, mosques or gurudwaras. The Division Bench then referred in
detail to the provisions of the Noise Pollution (Regulations and Control)
Rules, 2000 framed by the Central Government, and noted that, 'according
to Rule 4, the noise level in any area/zone shall not exceed 10dB(A)
above the ambient noise standards specified in the schedule'.
</p>
<p id="p_21">20.         After extracting Rules 5 and 5(A) of the 2000 Rules, the
Division Bench opined that a loudspeaker or a public address system could
not be used except after obtaining written permission from the authority; no
loudspeaker or sound amplifier could be used at night time except in closed
premises, for communication within, like auditoria, conference rooms etc;
'the noise level at the boundary of the public place, where loudspeaker
or public address system or any other noise source was being used,
could not exceed 10dB(A) above the ambient noise standards'.
</p>
<p id="p_22">21.         After referring to the judgments of the Supreme Court, in
Indian Council for <a href="/doc/818256/" id="a_14">Enviro-legal Action and others vs. Union of India</a> &amp;
others14; <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_15">Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum vs. Union of India</a> &amp;

Union of India</a> &amp; another16, the Division Bench observed that, in Forum,
Prevention of Environment &amp; Sound Pollution16, the Supreme Court had
held that the right to life includes freedom from noise pollution; a polluter
cannot take shelter under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_17">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India;
freedom of speech and expression is not an absolute right; and awareness
should be created in childhood against use of fire crackers. The Division
Bench then held as under:-

Schedule to the 2000 Regulations, can be better explained by way of an
illustration. The noise limits for an industrial area during day time, as
prescribed in the Schedule to the 2000 Regulations, is 75dB(A). In terms of
Rule 5(4), the noise level cannot exceed 10dB(A) above 75dB(A) ie
85dB(A) or 75dB(A) whichever is lower. As 75dB(A) is lower, the noise
limits cannot exceed 75dB(A) in an industrial area during day time.
Likewise, the noise limits for a residential area during day time, as
prescribed in the Schedule to the 2000 Regulations, is 55dB(A). In terms of
Rule 5(5) the noise level cannot exceed by more than 5dB(A) the ambient
noise standards, ie by more than 60dB(A) in a residential area during day
time.

<p id="p_26">25.             From the observations of the Division Bench in its order in
Writ Petition (PIL) No.112 of 2015 dated 19.06.2018, made after
considering the 2000 Rules and the judgment of the Supreme Court in
Forum, Prevention of Environment &amp; Sound Pollution16, it is evident
that what was stipulated therein was that the noise level at the boundary of a
public place, where loudspeakers are used, shall not exceed 10dB(A) above
the ambient noise standards for the area or 75 dB(A) whichever is lower;
and the peripheral noise level of a privately owned sound system or a sound
producing instrument shall not, at the boundary of a private place, exceed
by more than 5 dB(A) the ambient noise standards specified for the area in
which it is used. In terms of the schedule and by use of words 'shall not
exceed 10dB(A) above the ambient noise standards for the area or
75dB(A) whichever is lower' and 'the peripheral noise level of a
privately owned sound system or a sound producing instrument shall
not, at the boundary of the private place, exceed by more than 5 dB(A)
the ambient noise standards specified for the area in which it is used',
the Division Bench intended that the peripheral noise level should not
exceed 10dB(A) or 5dB(A) above the ambient air quality standards, in
respect of noise as prescribed in the schedule, in public and private places
respectively.
</p>
<p id="p_27">26.             The Division Bench could not have intended that the noise
level in a public place should not exceed 5dB(A), since what has been
stipulated, both in the 2000 Rules and in the judgment of the Supreme
Court, in Forum, Prevention of Environment &amp; Sound Pollution16, is
that the peripheral noise level should not exceed 10dB(A)/5dB(A) above
the ambient noise standards for the area (as prescribed in the schedule). The
prescription, in Para 'i' of the order of the Division Bench, that the noise
level should not exceed more than 5dB(A) is not to be found in any of the
earlier parts of the said order of the Division Bench, or in the judgments of
the Supreme Court referred to therein or in the 2000 Regulations which was
relied upon by the Division Bench. It is evident, therefore, that the last
words of Paragraph 'i' that "the noise level should not exceed more than
5dB(A) peripheral noise level" is an accidental error not intended by the
Division Bench.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                         13</span>


<p id="p_28">27.             It is also evident that, in direction No. 'i', the words 'by'
between the words "exceed" and "more"; and the words "above the
ambient noise standards specified for the area in which it is used at the
boundary of the private place" after the words "5dB(A) peripheral noise
level" has been accidentally omitted. Since it is an accidental error which
the Court is required to correct on its own accord, Paragraph No. 'i' of the
mandatory directions shall stand corrected and, after its correction, shall
read as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">                 "i. The State Government is directed to ensure that no
          loudspeaker or public address system shall be used by any person
          including religious bodies in Temples, Mosques and Gurudwaras
          without written permission of the authority even during day time, that
          too, by getting an undertaking that the noise level shall not exceed by
          more than 5dB(A) peripheral noise level above the ambient noise
          standards specified for the area in which it is used at the boundaries
          of the private place".
</blockquote><p id="p_29">28.             The question whether or not the applicant can claim a
fundamental right for loudspeakers to be used at Mosques, whether the
order of the Allahabad High Court in Public Interest Litigation (PIL) No.
570 of 2020 dated 15.02.2020 covers the field, and the validity or otherwise
of the Government Order dated 04.02.2019 issued in compliance with the
earlier order of the Division Bench, are all matters which are extraneous to
proceedings under Section 152 CPC, as the only question, which the Court
is required to examine in such proceedings, is whether the order passed by
this Court earlier, in Writ Petition (PIL) No. 112 of 2015 dated 19.06.2018,
suffers from an accidental slip or omission necessitating its correction in
proceedings under Section 152 CPC, and nothing more. The validity of the
notice issued by the Station House Officer, Kaladhungi Police Station,
Nainital, dated 20.03.2020, and the direction sought to the District
Magistrate to permit use of loudspeakers in places of worship, are also
extraneous to a modification application under Section 152 CPC. These
contentions cannot, therefore, be examined in the present proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_30">29.             With the modification made to direction 'i' as extracted
hereinabove, the present application is disposed of.
