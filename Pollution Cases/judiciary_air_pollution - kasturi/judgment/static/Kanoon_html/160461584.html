                    (DELHI BENCH "B" DELHI)

          BEFORE SHRI A.D. JAIN AND SHRI K.D. RANJAN

                          ITA NO. 1552(Del)2010
                          Assessment year: 2005-06

Dy.Commissioner of Income Tax,    M/s. Climate Systems Pvt. Ltd.,
Circle 3(1), New Delhi.        V. Jeevan Prakash Bldg. KG Marg,
                                   New Delhi.

                  (Appellant)               (Respondent)

                  Appellant by: Ms. Y. Kakkar, Sr. DR
                Respondent by: Shri Neeraj Jain/Ms.Pinky Kapur,CA

                                  ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">PER A.D. JAIN, J.M.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      This is Department's appeal for the assessment year 2005-06, taking

the following grounds:-
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "1. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the ld. CIT(A) has
      erred in law and on facts by allowing the depreciation @ 60% on
      computer peripherals and accessories amounting to ` 1,52,896/-
      though the I.T. Rules allows 60% depreciation only on computer and
      computer software and not on computer peripherals and accessories.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      2. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the ld. CIT(A) has erred
      in law and on facts in deleting addition of ` 41,27,464/- made by the
      AO on account of disallowance of royalty expenses which was
      capitalized b the AO, ignoring the fact that the same was paid by the
      assessee under Technical Know-how Agreement for right to use
      technical know-how which undoubtedly is of capital nature.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                        2                    ITA 1552(Del)2010


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      3. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the ld. CIT(A) has erred
      in law and on facts by deleting addition of ` 6,41,250/- made by the
      AO on account of capitalization of 'Repair &amp; Maintenance Expenses'
      which included expenditure incurred on erection of 'Secure Land Fill
      Systems (SLFS), ignoring the fact that the expenditure allowed
      enduring benefit over a period of years to the assessee."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">2.    Apropos ground No.1, during the year,           the assessee claimed

depreciation @ 60% on computer accessories and peripherals, namely, UPS,

Scanner. Printers, etc. The AO held that only computer and software are

eligible for depreciation @ 60% and that computer accessories and printers

are not eligible for depreciation at this rate.   The AO thus restricted the

claim of the assessee for depreciation on computer peripherals @ 25% and

made a disallowance of ` 1,52,896/-.
</p>
<p id="p_6">3.    The learned CIT(A), by virtue of the impugned order, directed the AO

to allow depreciation @ 60% on computer accessories and peripherals.       It

was observed that in the assessee's case for assessment years 2003-04 and

2004-05, such claim of the assessee had been allowed, following Delhi

Bench of the Tribunal in the case of M/s. Expeditors International India Pvt.

Ltd. v. ACIT, 118 TTJ 652(Cal) and Calcutta ITAT decision in the case of

"<a href="/doc/193894/" id="a_1">ITO v. Samiran Majumdar</a>" 98 ITD 119.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.    The Tribunal, vide order dated 17.12.2009, passed in the case of the

assessee for assessment years 2003-04 and 2004-05, in ITA Nos. 1698, 1684

&amp; 2161(Del)09 (copy placed at pages 144 to 145 of the APB), remitted the
                                       3                     ITA 1552(Del)2010


matter to the file of the AO for examining the nature and character of the

computer peripherals, whether they could be used independently on the

computer.   The relevant para 19 of the said order is reproduced, for ready

reference, as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "19. We have heard both the parties and gone through the material
      available on record. From the order passed by the Assessing Officer,
      it is clear that he has not examined the nature and character of
      computer peripherals whether they could be used independently. We,
      therefore, set aside the matter to the file of the AO with the direction
      to examine the nature of each and every item. If they are independent
      of functioning, the depreciation will be allowable as in the case of any
      other plant and machinery. However, if they are integral part of the
      computer, the depreciation will be allowable @ 60%. The AO will
      keep in mind the decision of the ITAT in the case of 'Simaran
      Majumdar'(supra) and 'Expeditors International'(supra). Needless
      to say that the AO will provide the assessee of being heard before
      deciding the issue."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">5.    Before us, the ld. DR has contended that the ld. CIT(A) has erred in

allowing depreciation on computer peripherals and accessories @ 60%,

though the I.T. Rules allowing 60% depreciation only on computer and

computer software and not on computer peripherals and accessories.

</p><p id="p_10">6.    As opposed to this, the learned counsel for the assessee has contended

that all equipments/parts run with the help of the computer system have to be

treated as computers eligible for depreciation at the higher rate of 60%.

Reliance has been placed on the following case laws:-
</p><p id="p_11">                                         4                    ITA 1552(Del)2010

</p><p id="p_17">      6. <a href="/doc/453008/" id="a_7">CIT v. Karnataka Power Corporation</a> reported in 247 ITR 268;

</p><p id="p_21">7.    The facts remaining the same herein also, in keeping with the

aforesaid Tribunal order in the assessee's case for assessment years 2003-04

and 2004-05, this issue for the present year is also similarly remitted to the

file of the AO, to examine as to whether the computer peripherals could be

used independently or not and to decide the issue of depreciation, keeping in

mind the directions issued by the Tribunal, as aforesaid.

</p><p id="p_22">8.    Coming to ground No.2, the assessee company had debited `

55,03,285/- as royalty in its profit and loss account. Observing that it was in

the nature of technology transfer, the AO queried the assessee as to why this

royalty paid be not treated as capital in nature.
</p>
<p id="p_23">9.    The assessee contended that it had entered into a Technical

Collaboration Agreement (TCA) dated 25.5.98 with Visteon Global

Technology Inc. (VGTI), USA; that as per the Agreement VGTI would grant

the assessee a non-extensive right and licenses to manufacture, sell, repair

and service,     licensed product using the technical information and
                                      5                    ITA 1552(Del)2010


intellectual property rights furnished by VGTI.      The assessee was to

manufacture them        control atmosphere brazed (CAB) Aluminium Heat

Exchangers, viz. Radiators for Automobiles.    The assessee thereto had a

running royalty @ 3% on domestic sales and 5% on export sales of VGTI.

</p><p id="p_24">10.   The AO disallowed 75% of the royalty expenditure amounting to `

41,27,464/-, out of the royalty expenses of ` 55,03,385/-, holding it as

capital expenditure. That being so, the AO relied on the assessment orders

of the earlier years.
</p>
<p id="p_25">11.   The ld. CIT(A) directed the AO to allow the claim of the assessee,

following the decision of the Hon'ble High Court in the assessee's own case

for assessment year 2002-03, in "<a href="/doc/181778720/" id="a_10">Climate Systems India Limited v. CIT</a>"

319 ITR 113(Del), copy placed at pages 237 to 238 of the APB, wherein it

was held that the said payment of royalty which was a continuous process,

should have been treated as revenue expenditure.
</p>
<p id="p_26">12.   In this regard, the ld. DR has argued that the ld. CIT(A) has erred in

deleting the addition of ` 41,27,464/-, made by the AO on account of

disallowance in the royalty expenses which amount was rightly capitalized

by the AO; that the ld. CIT(A) erred in ignoring that the entry was under

Technical Know-how Agreement for right to use Technical Know-how

which, undoubtedly, is of capital nature. The ld. DR has placed reliance on
                                       6                     ITA 1552(Del)2010


'<a href="/doc/1982858/" id="a_11">Jonas Woodhead And Sons (India) Ltd. v. CIT</a>' 224 ITR 342(<a href="/doc/1901936/" id="a_12">SC) and 'CIT

v. Shriram Bearings Ltd</a>.' 251 ITR 155(Cal).
</p>
<p id="p_27">13.   The learned counsel for the assessee, on the other hand, has contended

that under the TC Agreement, the assessee only acquired right to use the

technology and other technical information for the purpose of production of

Radiators, using the CAB technology in India; that the TC Agreement was

valid for 7 years and was terminable at will by either parties; that on

termination of the agreement, the assessee was required to stop using the

technical know-how and was to return the technical information to VGTI;

that as per the agreement, the assessee was required to maintain secrecy of

the technical information, etc., and was not permitted to sub-licence the

rights under the agreement; that the agreement did not confer any

proprietory rights on the assessee concern with regard to technology to

VGTI; and that since under the agreement, the assessee merely acquired the

limited right to use the technical know-how/information and no title thereto,

the payment of technical know-how fee is allowable as a deduction. In this

regard, the learned counsel has placed reliance on the following case laws:-

<p id="p_28">It has been submitted that the issue has also been decided in favour of the

assessee by the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the assessee's own case for

assessment year 2002-03, vide order dated 21.11.08, in ITA No.

1547(Del)07 (copy at APB 56 to 67) and in the assessee's case for

assessment years 2003-04 and 2004-05 (supra). It has been contended that

further, the said Tribunal order for assessment year 2002-03 has also been

upheld by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court, in the assessee's case, reported at

319 ITR 113(Del)(supra).
</p>
<p id="p_29">14.   Apropos this issue, at the outset, it is seen that the Hon'ble

jurisdictional High Court has decided this issue in favour of the assessee,
                                      8                     ITA 1552(Del)2010


holding that under the Agreement, payments were to be made by the

assessee in two parts, i.e., a lumpsum fee for transfer of technology, which

the assessee had admitted as being of capital nature and royalty payment in

consideration of providing technology services; that the payment of royalty

depended on the quantum of domestic as well as export sales which would

decrease or increase every year, depending on the decrease or increase in the

sales; that this payment was not because of 'transfer' of technology, but for

providing 'technical services'; and that so, the payment of royalty, which

was a continuous process, should have been treated as a revenue

expenditure.

<p id="p_30">15.   The Department has not been able to bring anything on record

opposed to the above observations of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the

case of the assessee.

<p id="p_31">16.   <a href="/doc/1982858/" id="a_33">Apropos 'Jonas Woodhead And Sons (India) Ltd. v. CIT</a>' (supra), the

facts therein were entirely different from those of the assessee's case.

Therein, there was a composite payment for supply of technical know-how

and services for setting up plant and manufacturing of products. These are

not the facts herein. <a href="/doc/1982858/" id="a_34">Therefore, 'Jonas Woodhead And Sons (India) Ltd. v.

CIT</a>' (supra), is not applicable.

</p><p id="p_33">17.   <a href="/doc/1901936/" id="a_35">Regarding 'CIT v. Shriram Bearings Ltd</a>.' 251 ITR 155(Cal), firstly,

in view of the Delhi High Court decision (supra) in the case of the assessee

itself, 'Shriram Bearings Ltd.' is of no help to the Department. Secondly,

therein also, the facts were different. There was a Collaboration Agreement

between the assessee and a foreign company .         Payment was made for

supply of technical know-how. The assessee was allowed to use technical

know-how even after the period of agreement. It was in these facts that it

was held by the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court that there arose a benefit of

enduring nature to the assessee. Evidently, these are not the facts before us.

</p><p id="p_34">18.   In view of the above, respectfully following the decision of the

Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of the assessee (supra), ground No.2

raised by the Department is rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_35">19.   So far as regards ground No.3, the assessee debited an amount of `

36,79,722/- in its profit and loss account, on account of repairs and

maintenance (building). This included 'Secure Land Fill Systems (SLFS),

supplied by M/s. Techno Economic Services and erected by M/s. Sunrise

Erectors. The fencing had been provided by Ram Fabricators. Ploughing,

filling and levelling of the land was done by M/s. National Associates.

SLFS was constructed for storage of hazardous waste, which was effluent of

</pre><p id="p_37">20.     The AO was of the opinion that the above expenditure of ` 7,12,500/

was capital in nature. He, therefore, disallowed the same after allowing

depreciation @ 10%. The net addition worked out was of ` 6,41,250/-.

</p><p id="p_38">21.     The ld. CIT(A) deleted the addition, holding the expenditure to be an

allowable business expenditure.     The ld. CIT(A) followed '<a href="/doc/1799476/" id="a_36">CIT v. Sakhi

Textiles Ltd</a>.' 250 ITR 449(<a href="/doc/95507934/" id="a_37">Mad) and 'CIT v. Steel Complex Ltd</a>.' 238 ITR

1054(Ker).
</p>
<p id="p_39">22.     The ld. DR has contended that the expenditure provided an enduring

benefit over a period of years to the assessee which fact has wrongly been

over-looked by the ld. CIT(A) while wrongly deleting the addition correctly

made.
</p><p id="p_40">                                     11                    ITA 1552(Del)2010


</p><p id="p_41">23.   The learned counsel for the assessee, on the other hand, has supported

the action of the ld. CIT(A). It has been contended that the expenditure on

SLFS was incurred for storage of hazardous waste and to prevent pollution

of air, water and ground; that SLFS was a statutory requirement under the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_38">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and under the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_39">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, so as to make necessary

provision   for   disposal   of   hazardous    waste   (Management      and

Handling)Rules, 1989; that therefore, the expenditure was an incumbent

incurrence by the assessee to abide by the said laws; and that similar

expenditure incurred on Water Treatment Plant and Fume Extraction Plant

to ward off health hazardous, in compliance of statutory requirement, has

been held to be an allowable revenue expenditure. Reliance in this regard

has been placed on '<a href="/doc/1799476/" id="a_40">CIT v. Sakhi Textiles Ltd</a>.' 250 ITR 449(<a href="/doc/95507934/" id="a_41">Mad), 'CIT v.

Steel Complex Limited</a>', 238 ITR 1054(<a href="/doc/22724575/" id="a_42">Kerala), 'Hindustan Electro

Graphites Ltd. v. CIT</a>' 218 ITR 688(<a href="/doc/1220910/" id="a_43">MP-HC) and 'Zenith Steel Pipes

Limited v. CIT</a>' 185 ITR 126 (Bom-HC).
</p>
<p id="p_42">24.   The factum of the expenditure having been incurred by the assessee in

compliance of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_44">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, the

Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_45">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and the Hazardous

Waste (Management and Handling ) Rules, 1989, has nowhere been

disputed by the Department. Once the Hazardous Waste was an effluent/bye

product of the management process of the assessee, provision therefor was

of necessity to be made by the assessee . Else, it would have been well nigh

impossible for the assessee to carry on its business.

</p><p id="p_43">25.   In 'Sakhi Textiles Ltd.'(supra), relied on by the ld. CIT(A), it has been

held that protection of health of the workmen was the basis for installation of

carding machines, the expenditure incurred on installation of the carding

machine was to be treated as revenue expenditure for promoting the health

and welfare of the workmen.
</p>
<p id="p_44">26.   In 'Steel Complex Limited' (supra), relied on the CIT(A), it was held

that expenditure incurred for Water Treatment Plant and Fume Extraction

Plant was a revenue expenditure.
</p>
<p id="p_45">27.   In 'Hindustan Electro Graphites Ltd.' (supra), it was held that the

expenditure incurred in raising a plantation in factory premises, is an

expenditure intended to make the atmosphere pollution free and it is a

revenue expenditure.
</p>
<p id="p_46">28.   Though it has been contended that the expenditure brought an

enduring benefit to the assessee, this contention remains unsubstantiated.

</p><p id="p_47">29.   As such, in view of the nature of the expenditure, which remains,

undisputedly, a statutory requirement enabling the assessee to carry on its

business, keeping in view the case laws discussed, we find no error in the

order of the ld. CIT(A) in this regard also and the same is confirmed.

Ground No.3 stands rejected.

indicated.
