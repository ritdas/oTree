2015 rejecting the application filed by the appellant for review of the

said      order   dated   21st   April,    2015,    being   the   Miscellaneous

Application No.394 of 2015, but granting the appellant a further

period of sixty days for compliance of the order under review on

condition of the appellant making a deposit of Rs.25 crores with the

Registrar of the Tribunal within a week from the order dated 3 rd

August, 2015, by way of security for compliance with the order,

failing     which   the    security       deposit   would    be    utilized   for

environmental needs under the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_1">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010.



2 (1). On or about 21st July, 2003, the Respondents filed a Public

Interest Litigation (PIL) being Writ Petition No.1341 of 2003 before

the Indore Bench of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, seeking

directions on the appellant and other concerned authorities

impleaded as respondents, to take immediate steps to stop the

plying of motor vehicles which did not conform to pollution control

norms, on the roads of Indore, and other consequential orders.



(2)    By an order dated 3rd January, 2013 the High Court transferred

the aforesaid writ petition to the Principal Bench of the National

Green Tribunal, Delhi and the same was re-numbered as Original

Application No.73 of 2012.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                    3</span><p id="p_6">

(3)   Sometime in March 2013, the Principal Bench, National Green

Tribunal, Delhi transferred O.A. No.73 of 2012 to the Central Zonal

Bench of the National Green Tribunal at Bhopal and the same was

re-numbered    as   O.A.   No.1/2013.    The   Original    Application

No.01/2013 was taken up for hearing on 21st April, 2015.



</p><p id="p_7">      On the same day, that is, 21 st April, 2015.   National Green

Tribunal, Central Zonal Bench, Bhopal, hereinafter referred to as the

learned Tribunal, passed an order noting that the mandatory

requirement of Rule 115 read with Rule 116 of the Central Motor

Vehicles Rules, 1989 for motor vehicles to display a valid PUC

Certificate was not being implemented. The learned Tribunal did not

find the reasons given by the Appellant State for its inability to

effectively enforce Rule 115 read with Rule 116 of the Central Motor

Vehicles Rules satisfactory, including the reason that most of the

pollution checking centres were not in working order and more

centres authorized to issue PUC Certificates were required to be set

up.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

(4)   The learned Tribunal held that it was the responsibility of the

State and its Transport Department to ensure compliance of the

Rules and directed that the vehicles not complying with pollution

norms and not possessing a valid PUC Certificate would have to

suffer the consequence of suspension and/or revocation of the

Registration Certificate of the vehicle.   The learned Tribunal also

held that a vehicle not displaying a valid PUC Certificate could not

be provided with fuel by any dealer or petrol pump. The appellant

State Government was directed to take necessary steps in this

regard by issuing necessary orders, instructions and/or directions

within 31st July, 2015 and to give wide publicity to such orders,

instructions, and/or directions. The matter was directed to be listed

on 3rd August 2015 for reporting compliance.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">3.    As stated above, an application filed by the Appellant being

M.A. No. 394/2015, for review of the said order dated 21.4.2015 has

also been rejected by the order dated 3.8.2015, also under appeal

before this Court. The appellant had, by the aforesaid order dated

3.8.2015, been granted further 60 days for compliance with the

order under review, on condition of deposit, within a week from the

date of the said order, an amount of Rs.25 crores by way of security

for compliance with the said order, failing which the security deposit

would be utilised for environmental needs under the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_2">National Green

Tribunal Act</a>, 2010.

<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">4.    The main questions involved in this appeal are (a) whether the

learned   Tribunal    could   have   directed   the   appellant   State

Government to issue orders and/or instructions and/or directions to

petrol pumps or retail outlets or dealers not to supply fuel to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                          5</span>

vehicles not having a valid PUC; (b) whether motor vehicles not

complying with the requirement of displaying a valid PUC Certificate

can be debarred from being provided with fuel by any dealer/or

petrol pump or outlet; and (c) whether a Tribunal constituted under

the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_3">Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 could have passed orders directing the

State    Government     to      make   a   monetary   deposit   to   secure

compliance of an order, and that too in an application for review of

an order, which did not contain any such direction.



</p><p id="p_13">5.      Over the last several decades, there has been a growing

concern worldwide, over pollution and the consequential decline in

air quality. Increase in pollution has led to loss of vegetative cover

and     ecological/biological    diversity,   excessive   concentration   of

harmful chemicals in the ambient atmosphere, growing risks of

environmental accidents and has posed a threat to life support

systems.

</p><p id="p_15">6.      In the United Nations Conference on Human Environment held

at Stockholm in June, 1972 it was resolved to protect environment

environment.

 systems. The world community's resolve to protect and enhance
 the environmental quality found expression in the decisions taken
 at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held
 in Stockholm in June 1972. The Government of India participated
 in the Conference and strongly voiced the environmental
 concerns. While several measures have been taken for
 environmental protection both before and after the Conference,
 the need for a general legislation further to implement the
 decisions of the Conference has become increasingly evident.

</p><p id="p_51"> 2. Although there are existing laws dealing directly or indirectly with
 several environmental matters, it is necessary to have a general
 legislation for environmental protection. Existing laws generally focus on
 specific types of pollution or on specific categories of hazardous
 substances. Some major areas of environmental hazards are not
 covered. There also exist uncovered gaps in areas of major
 environmental hazards. There are inadequate linkages in handling
 matters of industrial and environmental safety. Control mechanisms to
 guard against slow, insidious build up of hazardous substances
 especially new chemicals in the environment, are weak. Because of a
 multiplicity of regulatory agencies, there is need for an authority which
 can assume the lead role for studying, planning and implementing long
 term requirements of environmental safety and to give direction to, and
 co-ordinate a system of speedy and adequate response to emergency
 situations threatening the environment.

</p><p id="p_53"> 3. In view of what has been stated above, there is urgent need for
 the enactment of a general legislation on environmental protection
 which inter alia, should enable co-ordination of activities of the
 various regulatory agencies, creation of an authority or authorities
 with adequate powers for environmental protection, regulation of
 discharge of environmental pollutants and handling of hazardous
 substances, speedy response in the event of accidents threatening
 environment and deterrent punishment to those who endanger hu-
 man environment, safety and health.
