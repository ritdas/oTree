                               Vide a general order dated 05.10.2012 (Annexure P4), on account of

            imposition of ban on extracting sand, stone, gravel etc., the running stone

            crushing units were ordered to be closed temporarily.

</p><p id="p_2">                               Petitioner came to this Court by stating that he be allowed to run his

            stone crushing unit by getting materials from the adjoining State of Himachal

            Pradesh and Jammu &amp; Kashmir etc.

                               Taking note of a fact that some crushing units are situated in river

            beds, this Court passed the following order on 22.04.2013:

</pre><p id="p_4">                                      A perusal of the affidavit reveals that 90 stone crushers
                               have been installed or are under installation in river beds/choes.
                               We are of the, prima facie, opinion that the stone crushers cannot
                               be installed in the bed or catchment area of river/choe, as it would
                               necessarily degrade the river bed/choe and the catchment area,
                               as to adversely affect the flow of water.
</p><p id="p_5">                                      Mr.Ashwani Talwar, Additional Advocate, General, Punjab,
                               states that all necessary approvals have been obtained by these
                               stone crushing units from the concerned department.
</p><p id="p_6">                                      The State of Punjab is directed to file an affidavit placing on
                               record relevant rules and regulations that permit installation of
                               stone crushers in river bed/choes or in their catchment areas."

                               Concern was shown by this Court that such like units will disrupt the

            free flow of water in rivers and may cause havoc in the adjoining areas. The

            State of Punjab was directed to ascertain whether necessary approval has been

            obtained from the concerned departments, by those stone crushing units or not.

            Thereafter, an affidavit was filed. Taking note of the same, on 02.05.2013,

            following order was passed by this Court:

                               beds, `choes' or their catchment areas. The citing parameters, in
                               our considered opinion, do not address significant advances in our

            rivers etc., citing parameters fixed in matter on 17.03.1998 was relied upon to

            show that. It was also said that if such like units are allowed to continue, it will

            amount to environmental degradation. The State authorities were directed to

            reconsider the citing parameters with particular reference to whether stone

            crushers shall be allowed to operate from river bed/choes etc. or not.

<p id="p_13">                               In the meantime, the State took-over an exercise to frame policy
