By Court- This Letters Patent Appeal is directed against the order

dated 4.12.2013 passed in W.P.(C) No. 7657 of        2012 , whereby

Eco Sensitive Zone. Stating that the appellant- brick kiln is a

polluting industry and is remitting hazardous solid waste in

terrestrial   area of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary as well as using

firewood in the process of baking bricks as well as damaging forest

environment which is ultimately consumed by the wild animals

and to ensure that the provisions of above Notification is complied

with, the Forester, Bhadudih, Jamshedpur issued a closure notice

to the appellant vide letter dated 5.11.2012, whereby the appellant

has been directed to close the brick kiln forthwith, otherwise action

would be taken against him under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1781078/" id="a_3">Wild Life

Protection Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_2">4.    Challenging the said notice, the appellant filed the writ

petition. In the writ petition, the appellant filed an Interlocutory

Application being I.A. No. 5232 of 2013, claiming for stay of the

impugned letter no.29 dated 5.11.2012 and the same was disposed

of on 4.12.2013 holding that any interim order passed would

tantamount to declaring the said order as bad and illegal at the

initial stage without hearing writ petition on merit.

</p><p id="p_3">5.   Being    aggrieved   by    the   dismissal   of   the   Interlocutory

Application, the appellant has filed this Letters Patent Appeal.

</p><p id="p_4">6.   When the Letters Patent Appeal came for hearing, the

appellant is represented by the        learned counsel-Mr.S.L.Agrawal

        dismissal of the Interlocutory Application. Admittedly, the main

        writ petition is pending before the learned Single Judge.

</p><p id="p_6">        8.   Since the main writ petition is pending, we are not inclined to

        go into the merits of the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        9.   The Letters Patent Appeal is disposed of giving liberty to the

        appellant to raise all the contentions before the learned Single

        Judge in the pending writ petition.

<p id="p_8">        10. We request the learned Single Judge to take up the writ

        petition at an early date.
