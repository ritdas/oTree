AND 227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, PRAYING TO
QUASH THE IMPUGNED ORDER PASSED BY THE 2ND
RESPONDENT DATED 27.06.2019 VIDE ANNEXURE-A AND

      THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY HEARING
THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                           ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The first order under challenge is dated 27th June 2019

by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (for short

'KSPCB') refusing to grant consent for operation under sub-

section (4) (b) of Section 25 read with sub-section (2) (b) of

<a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_1">Section 27</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 (For short 'the said Act of 1974') and there is also a

challenge to the subsequent action of disconnection of power

supply.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   -3-</span><p id="p_2">




</p><p id="p_3">      2.      The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner

submits that the decision of refusal of consent for operation is

not by the KSPCB.            He submits that the decision on the

application for grant of consent for operation has to be taken by

the Board and not by its officer.           He also submits that

notwithstanding the remedy available to file an appeal provided

under the said Act of 1974, a writ petition be entertained. He

further    submits    that   though there    is   no     direction   for

disconnection    of    power     supply,   the    same     has   been

disconnected.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3.      We have considered the submissions.                    The

impugned order dated 27th June 2019 itself records that a

power has been delegated by the Board of refusal of consent

to the RSEOs vide the office memorandum dated 24th June

2019. Thus, the impugned order is of the Board. Therefore, an

efficacious remedy of preferring an appeal under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_3">Section 28</a> of

the said Act of 1974 is available to the petitioner.


</p><p id="p_6">      4.      Insofar as the act of disconnection of power supply

is concerned, it is a consequential action taken on the basis of

the order dated 27th June 2019. The petitioner cannot run the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               -4-</span>



industry of manufacture of steam rice/raw rice without the

consent for operation and therefore, as a consequence of the

refusal of grant of consent for operation, the power supply to

the industry has been disconnected. If the petitioner succeeds

in the appeal and consent for operation is ordered to be

granted, the power supply is bound to be restored.


</p><p id="p_7">        5.   Accordingly, subject to what is observed above,

we dispose of the petition on the ground that an efficacious

remedy of preferring an appeal under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_4">Section 28</a> of the said

Act of 1974 is available. All contentions on merits are kept

open.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">        6.   Registry to return the original copies of Annexures-

A and B, if filed on record, to the learned counsel appearing for

the petitioner after taking certified copies of the same on

record.
