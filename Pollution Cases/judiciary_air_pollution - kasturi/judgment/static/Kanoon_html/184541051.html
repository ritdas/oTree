petitions namely W.P.(MD).No. 5915 of 2017 and  W.P(MD).No.11718 of 2014 are   
clubbed with the present appeal, as all of them pertain to the same subject
as in the present appeal and all the parties are common.

        2. The related W.P.(MD).No.5915 of 2017 is filed by Suriyur Vivasayigal
Pathukkappu Sangam for issue of Writ of Mandamus for directions to remove the 
unauthorized construction of the Factory of  M/s. LA Bottlers.

for directions to the concerned authorities to initiate action against  M/s.

        4. For the sake of convenience M/s.L A Bottlers Pvt.Ltd. will be called
as petitioner company and the other parties by their names.

        5. The petitioner Company, namely, L.A. Bottlers Private Ltd., is
incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_3">Companies Act</a>, 1956 and in order to set up a bottling
unit for Pepsico India Holding Private Limited., a factory was decided to be
constructed in Survey Nos.469/1A1 and 469/1B1 of Suriyur Village,
Thiruverumbur Taluk, Thiruchirappalli District, measuring 24 acres and the
said land was purchased by the first respondent through a registered sale
deed dated 04.10.2010, bearing Document No.8347 of 2010 on the file of the
Sub-Registrar, Thiruverumbur.  The said land was classified as ?Mixed
Residential Zone?.  Since the petitioner company had to construct a factory,
the land should be re-classified as ?Controlled Industrial Zone? and an
application dated 25.11.2010 requesting for change of classification of land
was submitted by the Managing Director of the petitioner Company to the
Secretary, Housing and Urban Development, Chennai, the Commissioner,   
Directorate of Town and Country Planning, Chennai and the Assistant Director,
Town and Country Planning Department, Thiruchirappalli and on receipt of the
said application, a notification was issued in daily newspapers both English
and Tamil, inviting the general public to file their objections, if any.

        6. According to the petitioner company, though there were no
objections, the Assistant Director of Town and Country Planning  sought
certain clarifications with the petitioner company for change of
classification of land. The petitioner company, accordingly, sent a

(xii) High Tension service connection from TANGEDCO, bearing Service No.209. 

        8. Since the petitioner company's industry has been classified as
?Orange Industry? by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, the petitioner
company applied to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, for necessary
approvals and obtained the consent for the operation of its new plant under
<a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_5">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and for
discharge of sewage under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_7">Section 25</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>.  All requirements in respect of registration with the Tamil
Nadu Commercial Taxes Department and the Central Excise Department were done     
and the certificates were obtained by the petitioner company from the said
departments. 

        9. The petitioner company also entered into an agreement dated
12.11.2010 with the Executive Engineer, Public Works Department, Ground Water  
Division, Tiruchirappalli, in order to facilitate their business of bottling
of Pepsi (soft drinks), drinking water, mineral water etc., by which the
petitioner company was permitted to draw 1.50 lakh litres of ground water per
day, which was subsequently enhanced to 2.40 lakh litres per day.  This
enhancement, according to the petitioner company, was done after taking into
account the hydro-geological status of the area where the factory was
intended to be constructed.  Apart from this, the petitioner company factory
was also granted permission to dig six borewells for drawal of more water.
Since, the petitioner company had obtained all necessary certificates and
permissions from the various departments, except the change of classification
of land, it commenced the operation of the bottling unit investing huge
amount of money during May 2011.  

        10. According to the petitioner company, the Pollution Control Board
has also been periodically taking samples of water to find out any  chemicals
declared as hazardous were present and after conducting various lab tests,
have stated that there are no complaints as far as ground water is concerned.
At this juncture, in the year 2012, the Suriyur Vivasayigal Pathukappu
Sangam, represented by its President, Mr.T.Ramaraj, filed a complaint, in
which they have stated that drawal of water from the ground for the business
of the first respondent would deplete the ground water source. Therefore, a
Peace Committee Meeting was convened, wherein the Revenue Divisional Officer, 
Tiruchirappalli, Block Development Officer, Thiruverumbur, members of public
and representatives of the Sangam participated.  According to the petitioner
company, it was resolved in the Peace Committee Meeting that the company  
should not draw water from three borewells out of six borewells dug by them
and that the petitioner company also agreed for the same.  This was followed
by the orders of the Revenue Divisional Officer, Tiruchirappalli, vide his
proceedings in Na.Ka.A1-522-2013 dated 25.04.2013 directing stoppage of 
drawal of water from the three borewells.  In fact, the Revenue Divisional
Officer, has cited the following reasons in his letter dated 25.04.2013.
(i)there is drought in the area of Suriyur Village and water must be provided
to the general public residing over there.
(ii) there would be a law and order problem if the petitioner company is
permitted to draw water from all the six borewells.

The Revenue Divisional Officer, in the above cited proceedings, has further
directed the Tahsildar, Thiruverumbur to cause inspection of the petitioner
company and find out as to whether they have stopped taking out water from
three of the six borewells.

        11. Subsequently, the Suriyur Panchayat ordered closure of the
petitioner company factory by invoking the provisions of Sec159 of the Tamil
Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, on the ground that there was no approval for the
factory. This order was challenged by the petitioner in W.P(MD).No.1198/2014
and an interim stay was granted by the High Court.  In the meanwhile, the
Assistant Director, Town and Country Planning Department returned the
petitioner company?s application for reclassification of land on 13.05.2014,
on the basis of complaints from the Suriyur Panchayat as well as the
complaints from general public. This was again challenged by the petitioner
company in W.P.(MD).No. 9632 of 2014 and this Court had directed the 
petitioner to resubmit the application for reclassification to The Assistant
Director, Town and Country Planning ,Trichirappalli, who was in turn directed
to forward the same to The State of Tamil Nadu, represented by its Secretary,
Housing and Urban Development Department to pass appropriate orders.  There 
was another peace committee meeting on 27.01.2015. The Revenue Officials  
issued the final notice dated 28.01.2015 to the petitioner company after the
meeting on 27.01.2015 asking the petitioner company  to submit the relevant
permissions and licenses for the factory. W.P.(MD) No.1334 of 2015 was filed
challenging this notice from the Block Development Officer, Thiruverumbur.

        12. Another W.P.(MD)No. 1156 of 2015 was filed by the petitioner
company seeking directions for removing the seals of the closed wells. Of the
six wells, three were closed after the first peace committee meeting in 2013
and the remaining after similar meeting in 2015. Since the orders regarding
the reclassification request was getting delayed even after specific
instructions in W.P.(MD).No.9632 of 2014, the petitioner company preferred a
contempt petition in Cont.P. (MD) 502 of 2016 and the same was listed for
hearing on 01.07.2016. This being so, the impugned order in G.O. (2D) No.91
of Housing and Urban Development, dated 30.06.2016 rejecting the application
for reclassification was received and hence the W.P(MD).No.19069 of 2016 and
consequently the present appeal against the orders of the Single Judge. The
order of the  learned Single Judge dated 26.04.2017 in W.P(MD).No.19069 of
2016 in remitting back the matter of reclassification to the Government of
Tamil Nadu, for fresh consideration after giving due opportunity to the
petitioner company and all related parties within a period of ten weeks and
also evaluating the public perception vis-a- vis the rule of law, is being
questioned in this writ appeal.

        13. This appeal along with the related writs, all in different
wordings, aim at only one aspect and that is the validity of the existence of
the factory/ bottling unit which is  not on a land classified as Industrial
Zone and also built without proper planning approval and permission. The main
grievance about the factory is the drawal of ground water in huge quantities
from giant borewells in an area where agriculture continues to exist and
consequent depletion of water table in an already drought stricken area
causing apprehensions in the minds of the general public.

        14. The learned Single Judge had accepted the contentions of the
learned counsel for the petitioner company in the W.P(MD).No.19069 of 2016
that the reason cited for the rejection of the application for
reclassification is the public resentment or unrest and this cannot be the
only decisive factor for the Government to reject the application for
reclassification. Mr.P.S.Raman, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner
company would contend that the company had provided job opportunities for the
local population, that they were ready to outsource the supply of water from
other outside sources thereby allaying the apprehensions of the villagers and
that since huge amount was invested in the factory, the disruption by a few
elements of the general public for vested interests should not come in the
way of the decision making process of the Government. It was also contended
that legal provisions were not  given due weightage by the Government of
Tamil Nadu while considering the petitioner company's application for
reclassification.

        15. The Learned Counsel for the petitioner company has also relied on
the verdict of Madurai bench of this Court in W.P.(MD).No.9930 of 2011 in
S.Muppidathi vs. Chief Engineer (NCES), TNEB, Chennai and others wherein it 
was held that,
        ?Once it is found that the erection of the windmill by the seventh
respondent was without the permission of the local body and once it is also
found that the payment of tax by the seventh respondent during the pendency
of the writ petition would not amount to the  grant of permission under
Section 160 of the Tamil Nadu  Panchayats Act, 1994, it follows automatically
that the petitioner is  entitled to succeed on this short ground. But it is
claimed both by  the seventh respondent and by the Tamil Nadu Electricity
Board,  whose officials are also parties to the proceedings, that the
installation of the windmill had already taken place. But it has not
commenced operations, in view of the interim orders. Therefore, taking into
account the above, the writ petition is  disposed of, permitting the seventh
respondent to apply to the  local body, which is not a party to the
proceedings. Within 2 weeks  of the seventh respondent submitting an
application for permission  under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Section 160</a>, the local body shall convene a
meeting and  take a decision in accordance with law.?

At this point it is relevant to point out that there have been a series of
litigations on this, with the petitioner company approaching the Court on
many occasions and equally those who have been resisting this factory. The
learned Single Judge had taken on record an undertaking by the petitioner
company that they would not draw water from the six borewells and instead get
their water supply from outside. It is pertinent to mention that the learned
Single Judge has not given a clear verdict either in favour of the petitioner
company or the others who have resisted the factory. The order of the Single
Judge puts back the clock by remitting the matter to the Government of
Tamilnadu for fresh consideration of the request for reclassification of the
land use. It would be a million dollar question whether an approval of the
land classification as requested by the petitioner company would regularize
the inherent infirmities as in the construction of the factory building
without any planning approval and operating the factory without running
license. In this context the counter affidavit filed by the Rural Development
Assistant Director (Panchayat), Trichy and the Block Development Officer,
Thiruverumbur Panchayat Union, who are the second respondents in W.P(MD)   
No.1334 of 2015, assumes significance.  The main aspects highlighted in the
counter affidavit are,
a) In the permission granted to the petitioner company for drawal of water
from six borewells which was valid till 30-06-2015 the Competent Authority
namely the Chief Engineer WRO(PWD). State Ground Surface Water Resource     
Chennai had imposed an additional condition for renewal of the water drawal
permission .The clause read as ? if there is any public protest for drawal of
ground water in the referred borewells,it will lead to cancellation of the
permission? 

b) The petitioner company had  constructed the factory building
unauthorizedly anticipating the approval for reclassification. The building
measured 66324 sq.ft.of built-up area. There is no building plan approval
from Competent Authority. The only building  plan approval on record is
signed by the President of Sooriyur Panchayat, who is not the Competent
Authority.

c) The Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board have not renewed their consent ?for
discharge of sewerage and trade effluent?u/s 25 of Water Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,1974. Similarly,the consent for ? discharge of
emission from the stacks? u/s 21 of Water Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>,1974,is also not renewed. Both the consents expired on
31.03.2014.

d) The petitioner company was issued a show cause notice on 18.11.2014 and no  
response has been received. 

e) The mandatory ? running license? has not been obtained from the
Thiruverumbur Panchayat Union, by the petitioner company as mandated in 
Sec.160 of Tamilnadu Panchayat Act.  

f) Finally after the peace committee meeting held on 27.01.2015, which was
attended by the representatives of the petitioner company also, a final
notice dated 28.01.2015 was issued to the petitioner company seeking the
explanation from the company for non-submission of the relevant
permission/license from the authorities concerned.

        16. In this context, a perusal of Sec 160 of Tamil Nadu Panchayat
Act,1994 reads as ?No person shall, without the permission of the Panchayat
Union Council in Panchayat villages and except in accordance with the
conditions specified in such permission,
a) Construct or establish any factory,workshop or work place in which it is
proposed to employ steam water, water power or other mechanical power or 
electrical power,or
b) install in any premises any machinery or manufacturing plant driven by any
power as aforesaid not being machinery or manufacturing plant exempted by the
rules.?

        17 . Besides these, the averments of the Government of Tamilnadu,
represented by Secretary of Housing and Urban Development   Department,  
Chennai, are
The Authority to allow conversion of land use i.e, reclassification is the
Government and not the Panchayat President, Therefore,the certificate of land
conversion issued by the Panchayat President,Sooriyur Panchayat is without
authority and void abinitio.
Building plan approval can be given by Village Panchayats only for buildings
up to 2000 sq.ft.of commercial space.Therefore, the building plan approval
issued by the President of Sooriyur Panchayat,is invalid.
Similarly. the NOC issued by the President, Sooriyur Panchayat, is also
without jurisdiction and authority.
The directions by the Honble Court in WP(MD) 9632 of 2014 was complied with 
in letter and spirit.This Court had ordered for fresh consideration of the
application for reclassification.
The invalid certificates like conversion of land use, building plan approval
and NOC which were issued by the President of Sooriyur Panchayat were used by  
the petitioner company to obtain other certificates from departments like
Fire services department,PWD for drawal of water etc thus making all the
certificates invalid.

        18. The learned counsel for the petitioner company would contend that
having obtained all the required permissions and approvals, except for the
reclassification of land, which was pending with the Government for disposal,
the rejection order of the first respondent was based only on the public
perception and protest by a section of the public, which cannot be construed
as a real expression of public sentiments. Actually, the paper publication
regarding the project evoked no objections from the public in writing.

        19.   On the other hand, the learned counsels for the appellant in the
present appeal and the petitioners in the Writ Petitions would contend that
the basic permissions obtained by the petitioner company were from
Authorities who were not the Competent Authorities and therefore the
construction of the factory on a land classified as Mixed Residential Zone,
that too without  proper plan approval by the Competent Authority, in itself,
was abinitio illegal.

        20. The G.O.Ms.No.1730 of Rural Development and Local Administration  
Department dated 24-07-1974 by the Government of TamilNadu has clearly spelt 
out the uses permitted in different zones. In Mixed Residential Zone the uses
permitted mentions only the cottage industries permissible in residential
areas. This clearly implies that the petitioner company's act of constructing
a factory and operating the same in a zone where it was not permitted is in
itself illegal. Even in the Controlled Industrial Zone the permitted uses
includes ? industries  using electric power not exceeding 130 HP but
excluding industries of obnoxious and hazardous nature by reason of odour,
liquid effluent, dust, smoke, gas, vibration etc. or otherwise likely to
cause danger or nuisance to public health or amenity.?

        21. Sections 83 and 84 of Tamilnadu Village Panchayat Act, 1994 reads
as,
?<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Section 83</a>: In the case of every village panchayat, there shall be appointed
by the Government a secretary, subject to such rules as may be prescribed, to
perform the functions of the executive authority.

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Section 84</a>:  The executive authority shall, (a) carry into effect the
resolutions of the village panchayat: Provided that where the president
considers that. a resolution has not been legally passed or is in excess of
the powers conferred by this Act or that, if carried out, it is likely to
endanger human life or health or the public safety, the executive authority
shall refer the matter to the Government for orders and their decision shall
be final; (b) control all the officers and servants of the village panchayat;
(c) discharge all the duties specifically imposed and exercise all the powers
conferred on the executive authority and subject to all restrictions and
conditions imposed, by or under this Act, exercise the executive power for
the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act and be directly
responsible for the due fulfilment of the purposes thereof?

        22. The learned Single judge has observed about the impugned order
dated 01.07.2016 that the ?rule of governance cannot be allowed to be stifled
or violated and the decision of the Statutory Authority cannot be governed by
mere objections from the public on the basis of street sentiments who may be
driven by vested interest or camouflaged as public interest, beneath lie a
personal agenda of some pressure groups.? 

        23. This Court feels that the above observation is based on  the
apprehensions of the petitioner company, which is again based on assumptions 
only. The crux of the issue to be decided in the appeal  is whether the
impugned order of the first respondent rejecting the application for
reclassification was as per provisions of law. The impugned order of the
Government of Tamilnadu has referred to all relevant authorities and their
correspondence mentioning whether petitioner company had complied with all 
the legal provisions to establish their bottling unit in the Suriyur village.

        24. The Government of Tamilnadu in the impugned order dated 01.07.2016 
has relied its decision on the correspondence with the other related
departments and one such vital correspondence is that of the Revenue
Divisional Officer, Trichirappalli.  The Revenue Divisional Officer,
Trichirappalli, in his letter A-1-S22-2014 dated 02.04.2016, has stated
?M/s.LA Bottlers have without proper permission dug huge deep borewells
depleting the water table and causing protests from different farmers?
organizations leading to the shutting down of the factory after finding that
there was no proper approval for the factory itself.?  This Court feels that
the reasoning by the Govt. of Tamil Nadu in the impugned order is adequate
and justified. There is no reason to believe that the Statutory Authorities
were influenced by ?mere objections from the public on the basis of street
sentiments who may be driven by vested interest or camouflaged as public
interest, beneath lie a personal agenda of some pressure groups.?


        25. In this context we may rely on the observations made by the Apex
Court in <a href="/doc/768764/" id="a_14">Ugar Sugar Works Ltd. vs. Delhi Administration</a>, reported in AIR 2001
SC 1447.  It is well settled that the Courts, in exercise of their power of
judicial review, do not ordinarily interfere with the policy decisions of the
executive unless the policy can be faulted on grounds of mala fide,
unreasonableness, arbitrariness or unfairness etc. Indeed, arbitrariness,
irrationality, perversity and mala fide will render the policy
unconstitutional. However, if the policy cannot be faulted on any of these
grounds, the mere fact that it would hurt business interests of a party, does
not justify invalidating the policy. In tax and economic regulation cases,
there are good reasons for judicial restraint, if not judicial deference, to
judgment of the executive. The Courts are not expected to express their
opinion as to whether at a particular point of time or in a particular
situation any such policy should have been adopted or not. It is best left to
the discretion of the State.?

        26. In  the matter of reclassification  of  land use, the G.O(M.S)
No.94 of Housing and Urban Development Department dated 12.06.2009 reads as   
under,

        ?The Government after careful examinations accept the suggestion of the
Commissioner of Town and Country Planning and order that the proposal for
reclassification may be received by the respective Member Secretary of
Composite Local Planning Authority or Regional Deputy Director in other areas
and on receipt of such proposal, these officers shall simultaneously call for
the remarks of respective local bodies and at the same time invite objections
and suggestions through the local newspapers from the public by giving thirty
days time and on due consideration and analysis of all these objections and
suggestions,the proposal should be forwarded to the Directorate with
resolution of Local Planning Authority, and these proposals will then be
scrutinised by the Directorate and forwarded with remarks for necessary
consideration by the Government for the issue of Government orders.?
G.O.(Ms).No.79 of Housing and Urban Development Department Dated: 04.05.2017    
regarding reclassification of land use  states as
        ?The Collector shall ensure that due to the proposed development, the
irrigation canals and distribution channels or the natural storm water drains
or channels are not obstructed or affected and shall not lead to depletion of
ground water level of the area or inundation of nearby areas.?


        27. This Court does not find the impugned order of the Government of
Tamil Nadu deviating from this laid down procedure. It is also pertinent to
mention that public perception has to be given much importance and cannot be
overlooked especially as in the instant case where the reclassification of
land use is not in tune with the interest of the public. As already mentioned
earlier, the impugned order in W.P. (MD) No.19069 of 2016 is not the sole
decision of the Government, but is based on the objections raised by several
other related departments, who basically have pointed out the major
deficiencies warranting only a rejection by the government.

        28. Water resource is without doubt, the most precious amenity
available and this resource is vital for the very existence of this factory.
Though the petitioner company had given an undertaking to the effect that
they would not draw water from the wells dug by them and they would depend on 
the water sourced from outside, it is in one form a tacit acknowledgment of
the bitter truth that the water table is indeed getting depleted due to their
usage and therefore the public perception on the same cannot be brushed aside
as ?street sentiments driven by vested interest camouflaged as public
interest?.  The industry as such being fully dependent on water, such an
undertaking may not help in the long run.

        29. Notwithstanding the fact that the petitioner company is very much
aware of the potential danger to the water table due to the huge drawal of
water, the crux of the issue zeroes in on the legality of the very existence
of the factory. The petitioner company has neither a land conversion approval
nor a valid building plan approval. No running license has been obtained by
them. This Court strongly feels that the petitioner company has all along
circumvented the basic statutory provisions to facilitate the construction
and installation of the factory and machinery respectively, without any valid
approval.  The request of the reclassification of the land being used by the
petitioner company is not for a public cause and is purely for a private
business venture.  Therefore, the order passed by the learned Single Judge in
W.P.(MD)No.19069 of 2016 dated 26.04.2017 warrants interference by this court
and the writ petitions are liable to be allowed.



        30. In the result,
       (i) Writ Appeal No.976 of 2017 is allowed and consequently, the order
passed by the learned Single Judge in W.P.(MD) No.19069 of 2016 is set aside.

        (ii) Writ Petiton (MD) Nos.11718 of 2017
        This Writ Petition is allowed and the respondents 1 to 9 are directed
to close and seal  the 11th respondent premises and stop all manufacturing
and other operations in the factory forthwith situate in Survey No.
No.469/1A1, 469/1A2, and 469/1b1 of Suriyoor Village, Thiruverumbur Taluk,
Trichy District.

        (iii) Writ Petiton (MD) Nos.5915 of 2017
        This Writ Petition is allowed and the respondents 1 to 4 are directed
to remove the unauthorized construction put up by the 5th respondent to an
extent of 8687.83 sq. metere (93000 sq.ft.) situate in Suvery No.469/1A1,
469/1A2, and 469/1b1 of Suriyur Village, Thiruverumbur Taluk, Trichy
District, in accordance with Section 56 of Tamil Nadu Town and Country
Planning Act 1971, within a period of one month. Consequently, connected
miscellaneous petitions in the above writ appeal and  the  writ petitions are
closed. No order as to costs.

<p id="p_7">        6. The first respondent/writ petitioner was incorporated on 01.10.2010

with the main object of establishing plants for manufacture and bottling of
soft drinks, concentrates, beverages, mineral water, drinking water etc., and
they propose to set up a plant/factory at Suriyur Village, Tiruchirappalli
District and after establishment, it was to function as a bottling unit for
Pepsico India Holdings Pvt. Ltd.   The proposed plant was to be constructed
at S.Nos.469/1A2 and 469/1B1 of Suriyur Village, spread over an extent of 24
acres and for that purpose, the said lands were purchased.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        7. The first respondent/writ petitioner would further aver that they

respondent dated 02.02.2011 for manufacture of soft drinks.  The first
respondent/writ petitioner also applied for planning permission from the
third respondent for construction of factory building and the application for
the same to be routed through the fourth respondent.  As the said land was
classified as ?Mixed Residential Zone?, it has to be reclassified as
?Controlled Industrial Zone? by the second respondent and necessary
application dated 25.11.2010 for change of land use was also submitted along
with necessary documents and  by paying the prescribed fees and it was also
forwarded by the fourth respondent to the second respondent for appropriate

certificates were obtained by the petitioner from the said Departments.
</p>

<p id="p_27">        10. It is also stated by the first respondent/writ petitioner that
necessary resolution was also passed by the sixth respondent on 08.08.2011 
and it was forwarded to the fourth respondent also.   The first
respondent/writ petitioner further stated that in order to meet the water
requirement for running the plant, the petitioner entered into an agreement
dated 12.11.2010 for ground water utilization with the Executive Engineer,
Public Works Department, Ground Water Division, Trichy and they were 
permitted to draw 1.50 lakh litres of ground water per day from three
borewells.
</p>
<p id="p_28">        11. The first respondent/writ petitioner would further state that based
on the above licences and clearances, the first respondent/writ petitioner
started to run it's plant and commenced production in May, 2011 and it
employed about 150 persons, 80 persons directly and 70 persons indirectly
from the local village residents.  It is also the claim of the first
respondent/writ petitioner that the Pollution Control Board has also took
samples of the water and also inspected the petitioner's factory periodically
and did not note any irregularity.  The first respondent/writ petitioner
subsequently entered into a revised agreement dated 19.07.2011 with the
Executive Engineer, Public Works Department, Ground Water Division, Trichy 
and the petitioner was granted permission to draw 2.40 lakh litres per day,
after taking into consideration the hydro-geological status of the area and
thereafter, the writ petitioner also obtained approval for total six
borewells, vide clearance dated 31.01.2012, for drawal of ground water for
Industries/Infrastructure projects from the Government of Tamil Nadu, Water
Resources Department, State Ground and Surface Water Resources Data Centre,

viz., till 30.01.2015. The fourth respondent also sent a communication dated
04.10.2011 to the first respondent/writ petitioner as to the process of the
application submitted for change of land use.
</p>
<p id="p_29">        12. The first respondent/writ petitioner would further aver that newly
elected seventh respondent developed evil towards them and since the Board of
Directors of the first respondent consists of three sons of former member of
Lok Sabha for Trichy constituency and the seventh respondent belonging to a
rival party, along with the officials of the sixth respondent, repeatedly
visited the writ petitioner's plant and demanded that the writ petitioner
should not draw any ground water on the pretext that the same was without
authorization.
</p>
<p id="p_30">        13. Suriyur Village Safety Union/appellant in W.A.(MD)No.976 of
2017/petitioner in W.P.(MD)No.5915 of 2017 also sent a representation dated
03.12.2012 to the Revenue Divisional Officer, Trichy objecting to the drawal
of water and in order to settle the dispute, a Peace Committee was also
constituted, wherein the first respondent/writ petitioner agreed to extract
water from only from 3 three bore wells instead of six and the Revenue
Divisional Offier, Trichy, vide proceedings dated Na.Ka.No.522/2013 dated
25.04.2013, had ordered closure of three bore wells out of total six bore
wells for which permission was accorded to draw ground water.  However, the
sixth respondent, without applying their mind to the relevant facts and
circumstances, issued an order dated 24.02.2014, ordering closure on the
ground that it is running its operations without any approval and one more
ground raised is that on account of establishment of factory, agricultural
operations are affected.
</p>
<p id="p_31">        14. The first respondent/writ petitioner made a challenge to the said
proceedings by filing W.P(MD).No.4498 of 2014 and it was entertained and an
order of interim stay was granted by this Court and it was also brought to
the knowledge of this Court about the objections received from the fifth

respondent was directed to resubmit the application to the fourth respondent,
who in-turn was directed to forward the same to the second respondent along
with the objections received and thereafter, the second respondent was
directed to consider the same after affording an opportunity of personal
hearing to the seventh respondent and pass appropriate orders. However,
nearly after 3+ years, the fourth respondent returned the application partly,
vide proceedings dated 13.05.2014 by referring to the objections received
from the sixth respondent as well as the complaint from the public and final
order dated 19.06.2014, this Court directed them to resubmit the application

</p>
<p id="p_32">        15. The first respondent/writ petitioner, immediately sent a
communication 11.07.2014 by drawing the attention to the above said order and
requested the fourth respondent to forward the application to the second
respondent and the third respondent, vide communication dated 12.11.2014, has
requested the second respondent to pass orders on the application seeking

directed them to produce the  building plan issued by the Director of Town
and Country Planning Act and licence from the Local Body and it was also
indicated that if they failed to respond to the notice, legal action would be
initiated.
</p>
<p id="p_33">        16. The first respondent/writ petitioner, in response to the said
communication, submitted their replies/responses dated 14.07.2014 and 
02.12.2014 and on receipt of the same, TNPCB called the petitioner for
personal hearing on 26.12.2014, vide letter dated 19.12.2014 and a

pending, DTCP would be processed only upon receipt of the same and in the 
interregnum, W.P(MD).No.11718 of 2014 came to be entertained.  
</p>
<p id="p_34">        17. It is also averred that the first respondent/writ petitioner has
also applied for ?Local Body running licence? before the Block Development
Officer (BDO), Thiruverambur on 23.06.2014 and certain details were called
for and it was also furnished, vide reply dated 04.09.2014 and they were also
called upon to produce the Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)
Certificate and other licences/clearances and those documents were also
submitted to by the writ petitioner on 27.11.2014.  However, the sixth
respondent has passed a resolution on 13.11.2014 by referring to the interim
order of stay dated 24.02.2014 for closure of the plant/factory and some of
the residents got impleaded themselves in W.P(MD).No.4498 of 2014 to show  
their support in running the factory.
</p>
<p id="p_35">        18. A Peace Committee meeting was also conducted by the jurisdictional 
Revenue Divisional Officer and the District Revenue Officer and the Revenue
Divisional Officer, Trichy along with police officials came to the factory
premises and closed three borewells functioning without any approval and
despite No Objection Certification, they refused the remove the seal.  In
this regard, the writ petitioner/first respondent herein filed
W.P.(MD).No.1156 of 2015 seeking for desealing the borewells and it was also
entertained.  The Block Development Officer, Tiruverumbur, vide proceedings
dated 28.01.2015, issued a notice under Sections 160 and 220 of the Tamil
Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, alleging that some documents sought for have not 
been furnished and also pointed out that no permission was granted for
running the factory and also called upon the first respondent/writ petitioner
to show cause as to why appropriate action should not be initiated and it was
put to challenge in W.P.(MD)No.1334 of 2015 and vide order dated 05.02.2015,
an undertaking given by them was recorded to the effect that till the
disposal of W.P(MD)Nos.1156 and 1334 of 2015, no further proceedings would 
take place.
</p>
<p id="p_36">        19. Since on the pretext of the administrative function of the factory
sought to be interfered with by preventing the workers entering into the
factory, Crl.O.P(MD).No.2956 of 2015 was filed, wherein police protection was
granted for running the writ petitioner's factory, but on account of
objections received from the residents and the sixth respondent, the factory
could not run.  Cont.P(MD).No.502 of 2016 was also filed alleging non-
compliance of the order dated 19.06.2014 and pendency of the same, the second 
respondent has issued the impugned Government Order in G.O.(2D)No.91 dated   
30.06.2016, rejecting the application submitted for land conversion and
challenging the same, W.P(MD).No.19069 of 2016 came to be filed.  The 
appellant herein has also filed a petition to implead themselves by filing
WMP(MD).No.4832 of 2017 alleging that the entire people of the village are
adversely affected by running the factory and continuous protest are also
taking place and also pointed out as to the pendency of W.P.(MD)Nos.4498 of
2014 and 11718 of 2014.                 
</p>
<p id="p_37">        20. Counter Affidavit was filed by the first respondent, wherein it is
averred that Land Use Conversion Certificate issued by the Local Body
President is without authority and jurisdiction and the same is void abinitio
and so also the Building Plan Approval for the reason that the Village
Panchayats have authority to grant permission only upto 2000 sq.ft of
commercial space and beyond the said area, Navalpattu New Town Development    
Authority is the competent authority and not the President of the Panchayat
and as such, Building Plan Approval has been accorded by the Local Body 
without jurisdiction and without approval of the DTCP.  It is further averred
in the counter affidavit that on account of the Building Plan Approval,
entire construction has been done illegal in an unauthorized manner and the
first respondent/writ petitioner had illegally obtained clearances from
incompetent authorities.  It is also averred that the local residents
objected for the reason that running the factory would lead to depletion of
ground water level, which in-turn will affect agricultural activities and a
fair decision has been taken to reclassify the land from ?Mixed Residential
Zone? to ?Controlled Industrial Zone? and therefore, the impugned order
cannot be faulted with.
</p>
<p id="p_38">        21. The learned Judge, after taking note of the rival submissions and
the materials, especially the contents of the counter affidavit of the second
respondent herein that there was little application of mind on the part of
the said official which discharging his statutory function and the
application submitted for change of land usage has not been considered with
reference to rules and regulations and the request made by the writ
petitioner company has been considered only on the basis of public perception
and complaints without any critical examination.  The learned Judge has taken
note of the fact that public interest is paramount while considering any
individual request, but at the same time rules of governance cannot be
allowed to be stifled or violated and the decision of the statutory authority
cannot be governed by mere objections from the public on the basis of street
sentiments who may driven by vested interest or camouflaged as public
interest beneath lie a personal agenda of some pressure groups. The learned
Judge, after taking note of the affidavit of undertaking filed by the first
respondent/writ petitioner that water would not be drawn from the subject
lands and they would also source the supply of water by other means, has
remanded the matter to the second respondent for fresh consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_39">W.P.(MD).No.11718 of 2014  
</p><p id="p_40">        22. This writ petition, styled as Public Interest Litigation, is filed
by the petitioner, who claims to be a native of Periya Suriyoor village and
also a farmer who owns agricultural lands in S.Nos.318/1A, 320/4, 320/2B and
320/5 and according to him, lands purchased by the eleventh respondent
herein/first respondent in W.A.(MD)No.976 of 2017 are classified as
agricultural lands and he has put up a massive gigantic construction of a
huge building to an extent of 80,000 Sq.ft. in the said lands and have
installed heavy machineries, cold storage units and other equipments in the
said building and for water needs of their industrial unit, they have dug
huge borewells and drawing huge amounts of ground water every day.  It is
further averred that the appellant herein/11th respondent has not obtained
necessary permission from the statutory authorities before construction and
such an act is also the subject matter of criticism by the Principal
Accountant General and upon placing the materials, the Local Body has woken 
up and issued the notices dated 19.02.2014 and 09.06.2014 calling upon them
to furnish explanation for establishing the factory and making construction
without permission and a resolution was also passed in Resolution No.38 dated
26.06.2014, resolving to recommend to the District Collector, Trichy/
Inspector of Panchayats to take action against unlicensed/unauthorized
factory.
</p><p id="p_41">        23. A stand has also been taken that the writ petitioner, since the
Village Panchayat is not competent to accord approval, the so called approval
obtained by the eleventh respondent/first respondent in W.A.(MD)No.976 of
2017 is of no use and therefore, in this regard, he has submitted a
representation to seal the factory premises and since it has not been
disposed of, came forward to file this writ petition.
W.P(MD).No.5915 of 2017  
</p><p id="p_42">        24. The appellant in W.A(MD).No.976 of 2017 has filed this writ
petition, styled as Public Interest Litigation, raising same objections/stand
taken by them in the writ appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_43">        25. Mr.T.Lajapathi Roy, learned counsel appearing for both the
appellant in W.A(MD)No.976 of 2017 and the petitioners in W.P(MD).Nos.5915 of 
2017 and 11718 of 2014, has invited the attention of this Court to the typed
set of documents filed in W.A(MD).No.976 of 2017 as well as the stand taken
by the second respondent in the counter affidavit and would submit that
admittedly the Local Body is not at all competent to accord necessary
approval/permission and the first respondent/writ petitioner has managed to
get clearances from various authorities and since necessary approval have not
been accorded by DTCP, the alleged permissions granted in favour of the first
respondent are of no use and that apart, for running a soft drinks bottling
plant requires usage of large quantity of water and even as per the admission
of the first respondent/writ petitioner, they have to necessarily draw 5.80
lakhs litres of water per day from six borewells dug by them, which would
definitely deplete the ground water level and in-turn agricultural operations
of the local villagers and taking into consideration the objections,
materials placed and also the relevant statutory provisions, the second
respondent has acted strictly in accordance with law by rejecting the
application for land use conversion.
</p>
<p id="p_44">        26. It is the further submission of the learned counsel appearing for
the appellant that since the application for planning permission/building
plan approval has been accorded by the Local Body, without getting approval
of the DTCP, those permissions are of no use and would not confer with the
first respondent any right to run the plant/factory and in the absence of
necessary permission/approval by competent authority, the constructions put
up by them are to be treated as unauthorized and that apart, when law
contemplates that No Objection Certificate was also issued by the Local Body
and the Local Body has taken note of the public sentiments and other factors,
the impugned order rejecting the application cannot be found fault with.  It
is also the argument of the learned counsel appearing for the appellant that
the learned Judge has failed to take note of the fact that the paramount
consideration is public interest and without properly adverting to the
materials placed, had remanded the matter for fresh adjudication and
therefore, prays for interference.  The learned counsel appearing for the
appellant, in support of his submissions, placed reliance upon the following
decisions:
</p><p id="p_45">(i)<a href="/doc/58962247/" id="a_19">Census Commissioner and Others v. R.Krishnamurthy</a> [(2015) 2 SCC 796]

Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, Chennai-600 002 and Others [(2012) 3 MLJ 6.
</p>
<p id="p_47">        27. Mr.A.K.Baskarapandian, learned Special Government Pleader appearing  
for the official respondents, apart from supporting the stand of the
appellant/writ petitioners, would submit that since the Local Body have not
been vested with the jurisdiction to accord permission/approval without
getting approval from the DTCP, the second respondent, on a thorough
consideration and appreciation of the materials and records, has rightly took
a decision not to accord permission for Land Use Conversion and it cannot be
faulted with.
</p>
<p id="p_48">        28. This Court has carefully considered the rival submissions and also
perused the materials placed as well as the decisions relied on by the
learned counsel appearing for the appellant/writ petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_49">        29. The first respondent/writ petitioner was issued with No Objection
Certificate dated 05.10.2010 for version of Punja lands admeasuring to an
extent of 24 acres in Suriyur Village S.Nos.469/1A and 469/1B for
factory/industrial purposes by the sixth respondent herein and the Commercial
Tax Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu, has also issued Certificate
of Registration to the first respondent.  The sixth respondent, vide

<p id="p_50">        30. The Director of Fire and Rescue Services has also issued No
Objection Certificate to the first respondent and so also the Tahsildar,
Thiruverumbur dated 24.11.2010, certifying that no Government Poromboke land 
has been encroached and no land acquisition proceedings were initiated.   The

Industrial Zone? and the fourth respondent has also issued a public notice in
?Dinamani? news daily on 26.11.2010 inviting objections and it was also
published in ?Indian Express? news daily on 26.11.2010.

favour of the Managing Director of the first respondent and the seventh
respondent/Local Body has also issued No Objection Certificate dated
02.02.2011 to manufacture soft drinks.  The first respondent/writ petitioner,

<p id="p_88">        34. Mrs.R.Saradha Devi, Executive Officer/President of Suriyur
Panchayat, Thiruverumbur, has sent a communication dated 24.02.2014 to the 
Managing Director of the first respondent stating that plant/factory is in
operation without any permission, causing hindrance to the public and since
the factory has been located on agricultural lands, agricultural activities
are affected and on account of heavy drawal of water, quality of sand also
get reduced and water level also getting depleted and further pointed out
that the factory is running without any licence and called upon them to close
the factory on 15.03.2014, failing which criminal prosecution will be
launched.
</p>
<p id="p_89">        35. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, vide renewal order dated
24.03.2014 had also gave consented for operation of the plant under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_21">Section
21</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_22">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and imposed 7
conditions and one of the conditions is that the unit shall furnish the
building plan approval obtained from the DTCP within two months.  Food Safety
and Standards Authority of India, Chennai-600 090, vide communication dated
25.04.2014, has accorded renewal of licence under Central Licencing -FSSAI,
2006 and also issued necessary licence. Insofar as the application submitted
by the first respondent/writ petitioner seeking promotion of land usage is
concerned, the fifth respondent herein sent a communication dated 13.05.2014
to the sixth respondent with a copy marked to the first respondent stating
that on account of objections received from Local Body and from public, the
file is kept pending and it is returned except the one part.  The first
respondent, in response to the same, sent a representation dated 30.05.2014
pointing out that the Local Body, represented by the earlier President had
accorded necessary permission/approval and simply because somebody succeeded     
to the said office, they cannot turn around and started making objections and
prayed for processing of the application submitted for reconversion.
</p>
<p id="p_90">        36. The Government of Tamil Nadu, Water Resources Department, State   
Ground &amp; Surface Water Resources Data Centre, Chennai-113 has also issued No   
Objection Certificate for drawal of ground water for
Industries/Infrastructure Projects pertain to Bore Well No.B1, B2, B4 and B6
and also indicated recycling of water for cleaning purposes by installing RO
Plant.  The first respondent has also drawn the attention of the fifth
respondent as to the order dated 19.06.2014 made in W.P.(MD).No.9632 of 2014  
and prayed for necessary orders for land conversion and also made a request
to the TNPCB pointing out that the necessary application for land conversion
is pending with DTCP and therefore, prayed for renewal of the licence for the
period 2014-15.
</p>
<p id="p_91">        37. The village people of Suriyur has also submitted a representation
dated 28.07.2014 to the Collector of Tiruchirapalli District, expressing
their support to run the plant as it generate employment. A Division Bench of
this Court, vide order dated 12.08.2014 made in W.P(MD)Nos.4498 and 11718 of 
2014, has also granted interim orders restraining the first respondent from
continuing any manufacturing or other operations in their factory situated in
the above said survey numbers.  The first respondent/writ petitioner, vide
reply dated 13.08.2014 to the fourth respondent, pointed out that as per the
check list, necessary payments have been effected also.
</p>
<p id="p_92">        38. The Block Development Officer of Thiruverumbur has sent a
communication dated 14.08.2014 to the first respondent/writ petitioner by
referring to their letter dated 23.06.2014 and the order dated 27.06.2014
made in M.P(MD)No.1 of 2014 in W.P(MD).No.4495 of 2014, pointing out that for
running the factory, Local Body permission is to be obtained and the Director
of Public Health permission is required and the permission accorded by DTCP
have not been enclosed and only when those documents are enclosed, the  
application for land conversion will be processed.  The first respondent has
submitted their reply dated 04.09.2014 by enclosing the documents required by
the Block Development Officer, Thiruverumbur Panchayat Union. 
</p>
<p id="p_93">        39. The Commissioner of Town and Country Planning, Chennai, vide 
communication dated 12.11.2014 addressed to the second respondent, did not  
make any recommendation for land use conversion and the sixth 
respondent/Local Body, in terms of the interim order passed in
W.P.(MD)No.4498 of 2014, has withdrawn the earlier resolution, vide
resolution dated 13.11.2014.  TNPCB has also sent a communication dated  
18.11.2014 pointing out that since one of the conditions namely approval of
DTCP has not been produced and that the factory has been running without the
licence, called upon them to show cause as to why the factory should not be
closed.  In response to the same, the first respondent/writ petitioner has
submitted a representation, pointing out the delay in disposal of the
representation for conversion and therefore, requested them to defer further
proceedings, till such consideration and an opportunity of personal hearing
was also accorded by TNPCB to the first respondent/writ petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_94">        40. The local residents once again submitted a representation dated
05.01.2015 to the Collector of Trichy, pointing out that they have no
objection for running the factory and only some real estate people, for
oblique reasons, instigating certain people to institute a complaint.  The
Tahsildar, Thiruverumbur also conducted Peace Committee Meeting on 27.01.2015  
and the persons, who participated in the said Peace Committee Meeting, left
in the midway and except the Government Officials, none of the other
participants had signed it.
</p>
<p id="p_95">        41.  The sixth respondent/Local Body also sent final notice dated
28.01.2015  pointing out that necessary permission has not been obtained from
the Local Body for running the factory and therefore, issued the show cause
notice calling upon them to respond to the impugned notice within 7 days,
failing which action would be taken under Sections 160 and 220 of the Tamil
Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994 and challenging the same, W.P(MD).No.1334 of 2015    
has been filed and based on the undertaking given by the learned Additional
Government Pleader that no further proceedings would take place, has
adjourned the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_96">        42. The first respondent/writ petitioner also filed Crl.O.P.(MD)No.2956
of 2015, seeking adequate police protection and it was disposed of, vide
order dated 31.03.2015, subject to certain conditions and the Explosives
Licence and Fire Services Licence granted in favour of the first respondent
has also been renewed/extended.  TNPCB, vide communication dated 18.08.2015,   
has once again informed the first respondent/writ petitioner to furnish the
building plan issued by the DTCP and the Local Body running licence
immediately and thereafter, the second respondent has passed the impugned 
order dated 30.06.2016, rejecting the request for land usage conversion.
</p>
<p id="p_97">        43. A perusal of the impugned order dated 30.06.2016 passed by the
second respondent would disclose that the fourth respondent has sent a
communication dated 04.04.2016 pointing out the closure of the plant/factory
on 28.01.2014 and in the event of running the said factory, the village
people started indulging in road roco, which in-turn leads to law and order
problem and therefore, recommended to continue the locking and sealing of the
factory.  The proceedings of the Revenue Divisional Officer, Tiruchirapalli
dated 02.04.2016 was also referred to in the impugned order, wherein it has
been indicated that the first respondent/writ petitioner without getting
permission, has put up giant borewells and started drawing water in excess
and on account of the same, farmers' association as well as local public
started agitations and an inspection was carried out in the factory along
with other officials on 28.01.2014 and having noted that it was functioning
without permission, has put up lock and seal on the premises. The impugned
order also referred to the resolution of the fifth respondent pointing out
that in the event of the factory being run, road roco, fasting would took
place which in-turn leads to law and order problem and recommended for
continuous locking and sealing of the factory and therefore, rejected the
request for land conversion.
</p>
<p id="p_98">        44. A reading of the impugned order in G.O.(2D)No.91, Housing and Urban
Development Department (Na.Va.4(1)] Department dated 30.06.2016 would   
disclose that on account of agitation/dharna/fasting undertaken by the
residents of Suriyur Villagers and Agricultural Associations and apprehending
law and order problem, the factory premises of the first respondent was
sealed as early as on 28.01.2014 and the second respondent/Government had  
chose to accept the said recommendation and therefore, rejected the request
for land conversion.  In the considered opinion of the Court, merely on
account of public agitation and law and order problem, a factory cannot be
sealed that too from 28.01.2014 and the only reason that weighed with the
mind of the Government/second respondent is law and order problem and public 
sentiments.
</p>
<p id="p_99">        45. This Court, in the earlier paragraphs, had taken note of the
various permissions/licences/approvals granted by concerned authorities and
therefore, it cannot be said that no licence/permission has been accorded by
concerned authorities.  A perusal of the counter affidavit of the second
respondent would disclose that Local Body is not vested with the jurisdiction
to accord such permission and therefore, a stand has been taken that the
factory of the first respondent has been run without prior permission.  It is
to be noted at this juncture that admittedly Local Body is acting as single
window agency and application has to be submitted to them for obtaining
necessary permission and it is for them to approach the DTCP to get necessary
permission/approval and admittedly, the Local Body has given No Objection
Certificate dated 05.10.2010 and also accorded planning permission on
25.10.2010 and the Revenue Divisional Officer, Tiruchirapalli and the
Tahsildar, Thiruverumbur had also ordered transfer of patta and once again,
the sixth respondent/Local Body has issued No Objection Certificate dated
02.02.2011 for running the factory for manufacturing soft drinks.
</p>
<p id="p_100">        46. The first respondent/writ petitioner is entitled to presume that
the Local Body/sixth respondent has got necessary clearance from the DTCP for 
the reason that it is for the Local Body to process the application submitted
to them and get necessary permission/approval and technically speaking, the
Doctrine of Indoor Management would also come into operation for the reason
that once the Local Body has granted necessary permission/approval, the first
respondent/writ petitioner is entitled to presume that the acts/things done
by the sixth respondent/Local Body were in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_101">        47. The primordial objection is to the putting up of giant borewells
and drawal of water and the apprehension expressed by the residents of
Suriyur Village as well as Agricultural Associations is that on account heavy
drawal of water, the ground water would get depleted and getting polluted.
It is very pertinent to point out at this juncture that Water Resources
Department, State Ground &amp; Surface Water Resources Data Centre, Chennai-113    
has granted Ground Water Availability Certificate/Clearance for drawal of
groundwater from Industries/Infrastructure projects dated 31.01.2012, in and
by which the first respondent/writ petitioner was permitted to put up six
borewells for drawal of 5.80 lakhs litres of water per day, subject to 13
conditions and the same has been reiterated in yet another
certificate/communication dated 23.06.2014 in Certificate No.TW/TAN,
permitting them to draw water of 5 lakhs litres per day from Bore Well
Nos.B1, B2 in Velayuthamkudi Village and Bore Well Nos.B2, B4 and B6 in  
Suriyur Village and it is not even the case of the official
respondents/private respondents that such licences/permissions have been
cancelled.  As already pointed out, the first respondent/writ petitioner have
got the licence issued by the Chief Controller of Explosives and Food Safety
and Standards Authority of India and other licences/permissions issued by
statutory authorities.
</p>

<p id="p_102">        48. The primordial submission made by the learned counsel appearing for
the private respondents as well as the writ petitioner is that for running an
industry, Local Body licence is required and infact, it has also been issued
by the sixth respondent/Local Body, vide NOC dated 02.02.2011 and other 
objection is that since necessary permission/approval have not been granted
by DTCP, the superstructure put up by the first respondent for running the
factory is wholly unauthorized and it should be under lock and seal.
</p>
<p id="p_103">        49. As already pointed out, it is a Single Window application and it is
not in dispute that necessary permission was also accorded by Local Body and 
even assuming that the Local Body has failed to obtain such permission, still
it is open to the Director of Town and Country Planning, through its
officials to cause inspection and depending upon the result of the same, may
accord post-facto approval also, subject to the fulfillment of relevant
norms/regulations/Government Orders. 
</p>
<p id="p_104">        50.  <a href="/doc/58962247/" id="a_23">In Census Commissioner and Others v. R.Krishnamurthy</a> [(2015) 2 SCC  
796], judicial review of policy decision came up for consideration and it is
held that ?it is not within the domain of the Court to legislate and the
Courts do interpret the law and in such interpretation, certain creative
process is involved.  The Courts have the jurisdiction to declare the law as
unconstitutional, that too, where it is called for.?   There cannot be any
difficulty in accepting the said proposition, as it is a well settled legal
principle.      
</p>
<p id="p_105">        51. In S.Muppidathi v. Chief Engineer, Non Conventional Energy Sources
(NCES), Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, Chennai-600 002 and Others [(2012) 3
MLJ 6], the matter in issue pertains to erection of windmills and it is held
that such a permission is granted from the Local Body under Section 160 of
the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act.  This Court has already pointed out that such
permission was accorded by the sixth respondent/Local Body. 
</p><p id="p_106">        52. It is also to be noted at this juncture that for want of permission
from DTCP, the request for land usage conversion is not acceded to and since
it is one of the conditions prescribed/insisted for giving consent of TNPCB.
In G.O.Ms.No.1730, Rural Development and Local Administration Department  
dated 24.07.1994, draft regulations submitted by DTCP has been approved.  It
is not in dispute that the plant/factory is located in Mixed Residential Zone
and the request is made to convert the same into Controlled Industrial Zone.
It is relevant to extract the regulations of the Mixed Residential Zone and
Controlled Industrial Use Zone :
</p><p id="p_107">USE ZONE 1(b) MIXED RESIDENTIAL USE ZONE

<p id="p_129">The only reason assigned in the impugned order, which was the subject matter
of challenge in W.P.(MD)No.19069 of 2016, is to the objections raised by the
villagers, agriculturists and apprehension of the law and order problem on
account of road roco, fasting and other agitations.
</p>

<p id="p_130">        53. In Bombay Dyeing and Mfg. Co. Ltd., and Bombay Environmental Action  
Group and Others [(2006) 3 SCC 434], ecological balance and maintenance and  
Articles 21, 48-A &amp; 51-A(g) and 32, 226 &amp; 136 of the Constitution of India
and in para 64, it is observed that ?the Courts, while entertaining a public
interest litigation with regard to environmental aspects, would have to take
into consideration a large number of factors, some of which may be found to
be competing with each other.  It may not be proper to give undue importance
to one at the cost of the other which may ultimately be found to be vital;
and give effect to the intent and purport for which the legislation was
made?.  The concept of sustainable development also came up for consideration
and in para 251, 252 and 256 and 272 of the said judgment, it is observed as
follows:
</p><p id="p_131">        ?251. It is often felt that in the process of encouraging development
the environment gets sidelined. However, with major threats to the
environment, such as climate change, depletion of natural resources, the
entrophication of water systems and biodiversity and global warming, the need
to protect the environment has become a priority. At the same time, it is
also necessary to promote development. The harmonization of the two needs has 
led to the concept of sustainable development, so much so that it has become
the most significant and focal point of environmental legislation and
judicial decisions relating to the same. Sustainable development, simply put,
is a process in which development can be sustained over generations.
Brundtland Report defines 'sustainable development' as development that meets
the needs of the present generations without compromising the ability of the
future generations to meet their own needs. Making the concept of sustainable
development operational for public policies raises important challenges that
involve complex synergies and trade offs.
</p><p id="p_132">        252. The Indian judiciary has time and again recognised this principle
as being a fundamental concept of Indian law.
</p><p id="p_133">....
</p><p id="p_134">        256.The MRTP Act does not exclude these principles. Unless they are so 
excluded, they are to be read in the statute both in the substantive
legislation as also delegated legislation.
</p><p id="p_135">.....
</p><p id="p_136">        272.These decisions do not lay down any law which is different from
what we have said herein. The development of the doctrine of sustainable
development indeed is a welcome feature but while emphasizing the need of
ecological impact, a delicate balance between it and the necessity for
development must be struck. Whereas it is not possible to ignore inter-
generational interest, it is also not possible to ignore the dire need which
the society urgently requires.? 
</p>
<p id="p_137">        54. Our country is making rapid steps in industrialization and of
course it comes with advantages as well as disadvantages and however nice
balance is to be struck down between environment/ecological protection and
developmental activities in the form of industrialization by following the
principles of sustainable development and it means that necessary guidelines
should be in place to ensure development while protecting the environment and
ecology.
</p>
<p id="p_138">        55. A careful scrutiny and analysis of the materials placed before this
Court would also indicate that two departments of the Government of Tamil
Nadu, namely Water Resources Department, State Ground &amp; Surface Water     
Resources Data Centre, Chennai and Urban Development Department acted    
opposite to each other.  Once necessary permission has been accorded for 
drawal of ground water for industrial purposes, unless it is cancelled, a
view may not be taken by another arm of the very same Government by citing
public agitations and law and order problems and of course, a solution has to
be found in the light of the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court
in the above cited decisions to strike a balance between
ecological/environmental aspects and industrialization.
</p>
<p id="p_139">        56. The learned Judge, in para 19 of the impugned order, has also taken
note of the affidavit of undertaking filed by the first respondent/writ
petitioner that they would not draw water from the subject lands and they
would find alternative source of water by other means and they would also
source the supply of water by other means and also taken note of the fact
that rules of governance cannot be allowed to be stifled or violated and the
decision of the Statutory Authority cannot be governed by mere objections
from the public on the basis of street sentiments who may be driven by vested
interest or camouflaged as public interest, beneath lie a personal agenda of
some pressure groups. 
</p>
<p id="p_140">        57. If law and order problem in the form of public agitation etc., is
going to be the sole consideration, then it will be very difficult to attract
investments in the State and the State of Tamil Nadu is always a pioneer in
industrialization and it is one of the foremost States which continues to
attract investments for starting very many industries and it is also known as
?Detroit of India? for the reason that very many automobile industries had
established their factories and other anxillary industries connected thereto.
In the considered opinion of the Court, if law and order problem is the sole
criteria/consideration, it may lead to a dangerous condition of stalling
further industrialization and it may in-turn lead to unemployment and unrest.
</p>
<p id="p_141">        58. This Court, on an independent application of mind to the entire
materials placed before it, is of the considered view that there are no error
or infirmity in the reasons assigned by the learned Judge in remanding the
matter and also protecting the interest of the writ petitioner in para 20 of
the impugned order.  There are no merit in the Writ Appeal as well as in the
Writ Petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_142">        59. In the result,
</p><p id="p_143">        (i) W.A.(MD).No.976 of 2017 is dismissed, confirming the order dated
26.04.2017 made in W.P.(MD).No.19069 of 2016.  No costs.  
</p>
<p id="p_144">        (ii)  W.P(MD).Nos.11718 of 2014 and 5915 of 2017 are also dismissed.
No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are also dismissed.
</p>        



<p id="p_145">        In the instant case, the project is a private commercial venture and
not for any public purpose to disregard the sentiments of the public based on
factual position of the depletion of water table, especially when water is
the main input for all the products produced in the appellant factory.
Secondly, the appellant is fully aware that the competent authority for land
conversion is the Tamil Nadu State Government and not the President of
Suriyur Village Panchayat and therefore averred in their petition that except
for land conversion certificate, they had all other approvals.  Thirdly, as
far as the present case is concerned the industrialization will not be
adversely affected, since the industry is started in an area not earmarked
for industries.  The appellant have only shown scant respect for the law of
the land and no regularization is possible for an illegal act (of
construction of a factory in a land which is in ?Mixed Residential Zone?).
</p><p id="p_146">        Therefore, I wish to stick on to my views.
</p>

<p id="p_147">        In view of the conflicting decisions, the Registry is directed to place
the papers before the Hon'ble Chief Justice for passing appropriate orders.
