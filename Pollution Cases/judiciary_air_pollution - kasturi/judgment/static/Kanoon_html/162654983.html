Hon'ble Mr. Ranjan Chatterjee, (Expert Member)


</p><p id="p_2">  1. This is an Appeal challenging the decision taken by Kerala

    State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (for

    short 'SEIAA') in its meeting dated 13th December, 2012, more

    particularly numbered as Item No. KLA/13.05, refusing the

    grant of Environmental Clearance (for short 'EC') sought for

    the quarrying project in Survey No. 65/1pt, Kumily Village,

    Peermade Taluk, District Idukki, Kerala.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span><p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4"> 2. Item No. KLA/13.05 of the minutes of the above SEIAA

  meeting, reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_5">
  "Application for environmental clearance for the proposed

  quarry project in Survey no. 65/1 at Kumily Village, Kumily

  Panchayat, Peermade Taluk, Idukki District, Kerala by M/s

  Kizhakethalackal Rocks (File No. 40/SEIAA/KL/7084/2012)


  SEIAA observed that the proposed project site falls within ESZ-1

  of Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP). Hence it was

  decided to reject the proposal and direct the proponent to apply

  afresh, if required, at a later stage if the Gadgil Committee

  report of WGEEP report is finalized and implemented".


</p><p id="p_6">3. According to the appellant, it has been in the business of

  quarrying and crushing granite stone since the year 1990 and

  has been continuing the said business in an uninterrupted

  way till date, with all necessary licenses and sanctions. The

  appellant pleads that on 19th March, 2013 an application for

  grant of quarrying lease under the Kerala Minor Mineral

  Concession Rules, 1967 for an area of 1.23.44 hectares of land

  under its ownership situated in village Kumily was moved;

  after due inspection and survey of the land. Geologist Idukki

  forwarded its recommendation dated 19th April, 2012 for grant

  of quarrying lease in favour of the appellant to the Director,

  Department of Mining and Geology, Government of Kerala.

  Thereafter, Government of Kerala allowed the said application

  and passed an order dated 5th May, 2013 granting the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              3</span>
    appellant mining rights over an area of 0.9309 hectares of

   Patta land comprised in Survey No. 65/1pt of Kumily Village,

   Peermade Taluk, Idukki District for a period of 12 years from

   the date of execution of the quarrying lease, subject to certain

   conditions; one of them being prior EC from Ministry of

   Environment and Forests (for short 'MoEF').      The appellant

   further states that on 8th November, 2012, it applied for EC to

   the SEIAA, the first Respondent herein, with all the required

   documents. In the wake of this application for securing EC,

   the appellant states that the technical presentation of the

   project proposal along with the impact assessment and

   management plan was given to the first Respondent.


</p><p id="p_7">4. According to the appellant, the first Respondent was satisfied

   with the aforesaid technical presentation as well as impact

   assessment and management plan and yet did not favourably

   respond to the plea for grant of EC. On enquiry, the appellant

   submits, the first Respondent Authority expressed its inability

   to issue EC for the reason that the decision had been taken

   not to consider and entertain any application for grant of EC

   in respect of the lands falling in the zones classified as ESZ-I

   in Madhav Gadgil Committee Report, namely Western Ghats

   Ecology Expert Panel (hereinafter referred to as 'WGEEP

   Report') dated 31st August, 2011.      Further, the appellant

   submits that the first Respondent explained its inability to

   consider the application for grant of EC on account of the

   interim Order dated 25th July, 2012 passed by this Tribunal in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               4</span>
    the matter of Goa Foundation &amp; Anr. Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors.,

   Application No. 26 of 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5. It is the case of the appellant that the first Respondent

   Authority has erroneously interpreted the interim Order dated

   25th July, 2012 passed by this Tribunal as direction to them

   not to issue EC for any application falling under ESZ-I

   classified   in   the   WGEEP     Report,   when    neither   the

   recommendations of WGEEP Report nor interim Order dated

   25th July, 2013 passed by this Tribunal intends to stop the

   existing quarrying activities in ESZ-I.     Thus, the appellant

   submits that the Respondents in rejecting the application for

   grant of EC have acted arbitrarily and illegally.


</p><p id="p_10">6. In reply the Respondents, the Kerala SEIAA and the State of

   Kerala while admitting the role of Respondent No. 1 as a

   regulatory authority constituted under Sub-section 3 of

   Section 3 of      the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 for

   issuance of prior EC to all projects or activities mentioned in

   the schedule of EIA Notification SO No. 1533 (E) dated 14 th

   September, 2006 have explained that the application of the

   appellant for grant of prior EC for their quarrying project at

   Village Kumily was rejected as it suffered the disadvantages

   arising out of the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated

   27th February, 2012 in WP No. 19628-29 of 2009 in Deepak

   Kumar Vs. State of Haryana;          the complaint order No.

   L.11011/47/2011-1A11 (M) dated 18th May, 2012 of the

   MoEF, Government of India as well as the interim order dated

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5</span>
    25th July, 2012 passed by this Tribunal in Application No.

   26/2012 filed by Goa Foundation (supra). Though, the

   Respondents     disputed      the   merits    of     the   technical

   presentations, they chose not to dispute the fact that the

   appellant has been in the business of quarrying and crushing

   stone on the strength of necessary licences and sanctions right

   from the inception of its business in 1990. According to the

   Respondents the impugned decision taken by Respondent No.

   1 in its 13th meeting dated 13th December, 2012 and the State

   Level Expert Appraisal Committee (hereinafter referred to as

   'SEAC') minutes at annexure A and B annexed to the appeal

   are in due compliance with the directions of the Hon'ble

   Supreme Court and this Tribunal as well as instructions of

   MoEF.    However, the Respondents did not dispute various

   licenses/certificates   of   registration   issued   by    the   local

   authorities, Pollution Control Board and the State Government

   from time to time annexed to appeal at annexure A-1

   collectively except branding those licenses/certificates of

   registration as invalid for want of prior EC as directed by the

   Hon'ble Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case (supra).


</p><p id="p_11">7. The appellant in his Rejoinder submitted that the business of

   quarrying and crushing granite stone was started in 1990 by

   Mr. K. I. Varghese, one of the partners in appellant firm and

   father of the managing partner under the name of Sanju Stone

   Crushers in the year 1990 which was subsequently, turned

   into a partnership concern of Mr. K. I. Varghese, his wife, Mrs.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  6</span>
    Thankamma Varghese and their son, Sanju in the year 2007.

   The appellant added that the first Respondent being a

   regulatory authority under Sub-section 3 of Section 3 of

   <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, is under an obligation to

   duly consider the application for grant of EC, but the

   Respondents have conveniently avoided the actual legal

   implications arising out of WGEEP report and High Level

   Working Group ('HLWG'/also called the Kasturirangan report)

   coupled with the orders passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court

   and this Tribunal in the matter above mentioned. According to

   the appellant, neither the report nor the order dated 27 th

   February, 2012 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the orders

   dated 25th July, 2012 and 29th February, 2013 passed by this

   Tribunal, regulate or direct a complete ban on existing

   quarrying activities in ESZ-1 area. Rather, the report and

   orders have only called for proper environmental control for

   the existing quarrying projects in the region.


</p><p id="p_12">8. Learned advocate for the appellant submitted that the WGEEP

   report as well as HLWG report have genesis in administrative

   orders passed by the MoEF for the study of environmental

   concerns relating to Western Ghat Region and as such have no

   binding force but are rather of recommendatory nature and it

   was obligatory on Respondent No. 1 to have considered the

   merits of the application made for grant of EC by the appellant

   and not thrown out the said application merely for the reason

   that the quarrying project was situated in ESZ-1 area       as

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                7</span>
   classified by the WGEEP report, particularly when the

  business for which such EC was sought was a pre-existing

  one. According to him, the documents annexed as annexure

  A-1 collectively, amply reveal that the business of the

  appellant was being carried out initially as a proprietary

  concern and later on as a partnership concern of the family

  members of Mr. K.I. Varghese since 1990 at the place in

  question. He further pointed out from the order of the Hon'ble

  Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case (supra) as well as the

  order passed by this Tribunal that the regulatory authority,

  that is Respondent No. 1 herein, was under an obligation to

  duly consider the application moved by the appellant for grant

  of EC and to pass orders on the merits of the said application

  with reference to the recommendations in the WGEEP report.

  He submitted that the said recommendations exhorted the

  authority   concerned   to   effectively   control   the   existing

  quarrying activities for environmental and social impact

  immediately and did not recommend any blanket ban on such

  quarrying activities.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">9. Learned advocate for the Respondents submitted that the

  appellant has freshly applied for grant of EC and going by the

  recommendation in WGEEP report that no new license should

  be given to quarrying and sand mining in ESZ-1 area,

  Respondent No. 1 had rightly rejected the application of the

  appellant for grant of EC. He argued that the Respondent No.

  1 had passed the order in deference to the order passed by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                               8</span>
     Hon'ble Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case and this

    Tribunal in Goa Foundation case. He, therefore, urged for

    rejection of this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">10. The controversy thus raised, begs a few questions; firstly,

    whether the rejection of the proposal for grant of EC was the

    result of proper application of mind or not and secondly, what

    could have been the approach of the regulatory authority in a

    matter of such kind.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">11. To answer these questions, one has to first understand the

    factual scenario from the pleadings and the documents

    annexed to the appeal at annexure A-1 collectively. The

    certificate of 'no objection' issued to M/s Sanju Stone

    Crushers dated 22nd December, 1990 at annexure A-1

    collectively reveals that Mr. K.I. Varghese, Kizhakethalackel,

    Kumily had made an application dated 12th October, 1990 to

    the Kerala State Pollution Control Board for its 'no objection'

    to set up a stone crusher at Survey No. 65/1 at village Kumily

    and such 'no objection' was granted, subject to several

    conditions prescribed mainly to contain air, water and land

    pollution. There is also on record, a copy of the Kumily

    Panchayat license granted to Mr. K.I. Varghese for running

    stone crusher at the said land on 3rd October, 1991. This

    license was granted under Sections 96, 97 and 98 of the

    Kerala Panchayat Act, 1960 and was to be renewed further.

    These documents give credence to the appellant's contention

    that the business of quarrying stone was being carried on at

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                9</span>
     the land in question since 1990 or thereabout. A copy of the

    certificate of permanent registration as small scale industry

    unit granted in favour of Shri K.I. Varghese, Kizhakethalackel

    dated 28th October, 1993 by the Department of Industry and

    Commerce, Government of Kerala also signifies the merits of

    the said contention.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">12. It appears from the record that the quarrying lease in respect

    of portion of land measuring 1.801 ha of certificate No. 65/1pt

    at village Kumily, Idukki District was granted in favour of Mr.

    K.I. Varghese for the period commencing from 10th October,

    2001 to 6th September, 2011 by the State of Kerala vide

    quarrying lease dated 10th October, 2001. Now, the appellant,

    a partnership firm M/s Kizhakethalackel Rocks comprising of

    partners Mr. K.I. Varghese, his wife, Mrs. Thankamma

    Varghese and their son, Sanju George were seeking EC for

    quarrying works at 0.93 ha of portion of land at Survey No.

    65/1pt admeasuring 2.1651 ha of land at the Village Kumily.


</p><p id="p_21">13. Substantially, therefore, the mining operations were being

    carried on by Mr. K.I. Varghese initially as a proprietor and

    later as a partner in business at Survey No. 65/1pt or in

    different portions thereof at village Kumily.


</p><p id="p_22">14. In this backdrop, it needs to be examined whether the first

    Respondent exercised its jurisdiction as a regulatory authority

    under Environment Clearance Regulations of 2006 properly or

    not, in exercise of the powers conferred by Sub-section (1) and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                 10</span>
     clause (v) of Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_3">Section 3</a> of the Environment

    (Protection) Act, 1986 read with clause (d) of sub-rule (3) of

    Rule 5 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986. The

    Central   Government    made     it   obligatory   from   date   of

    notification SO No. 1533 (E) dated 14th September, 2006 for

    every new project or activity of expansion or modernisation of

    existing project or activity or existing capacity addition with

    change process and technology listed in the schedule to the

    said notification to obtain EC from the Central Government or

    from the SEIAA, duly constituted by the Central Government

    under Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_4">Section 3</a> of the said Act, as the case

    may be.

</p><p id="p_24">15. Before the judicial pronouncement in Deepak Kumar's case

    (supra), no environmental land clearance was required for

    mining lease of areas less than 5 hectares vide entry 1(a) in

    schedule to the Environmental Clearance Regulations, 2006.

    When faced with the situation where extraction of alluvial

    material within or near river bed has an impact on rivers,

    physical habitat characteristic and mischief in getting mining

    licenses for extraction of sand and other mining minerals in

    blocks of less than 5 hectares for dispensing with the

    necessity of an appropriate environmental assessment plan,

    the honourable apex court in order to curb such mischief,

    directed that licenses of mining minerals including other

    renewable minerals for an area of less than 5 hectares be

     granted by the States/Union territories only after getting

    environmental clearance from MoEF/SEIAA.


</p><p id="p_25">16. In the light of this judicial mandate, Kerala State Pollution

    Control Board granted consent to operate under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_5">Section 21</a> of

    2012 to the appellant on the condition that necessary EC for

    such quarrying work shall be obtained.         The appellant,

    therefore, moved application dated 8th November, 2012 in the

    prescribed form as given in the Form-I at Appendix 1 to the

    Environmental Clearance Regulations, 2006 to Respondent

    No. 1.

<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">17. A reading of the minutes of the 13th meeting of Respondent No.

    1 held on 13th December, 2012 reveals that the authority

    decided to reject the proposal for grant of EC coming within

    ESZ-I at the initial stage itself and direct the proponent to

    apply afresh at a later stage when the WGEEP report is

    finalised and implemented. What made Respondent No. 1 to

    reject the proposals given within ESZ-1 in the initial stage

    itself can be gathered from the following paragraphs drawn

    from the said minutes.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
    "The Chairman proposed that SEIAA reconsider its earlier

    decision on EC proposals for the mining projects which come

    under ESZ-1 of WGEEP report. As per the directions of the

    Tribunal, the existing provisions of the WGEEP report should


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                               12</span>
 be complied with. It is noted that the WGEEP report does not

permit any mining activity in the sites within ESZ-1.       After

holding elaborate discussions on the issue, SEIAA decided to

reject the proposals coming within ESZ-1 in the initial stage

itself and direct the proponent to apply afresh, at a later stage

when the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) report

is finalised and implemented.
</p>
<p id="p_29">
To implement the above decision, SEIAA directed modification

in the questionnaire for mining projects to be made effective

immediately and the proponents be requested to make a

declaration whether their project site falls within ESZ-1 of

Gadgil Committee report of WGEEP or not. It was decided that

in such cases where the proponent declares the site to be

within ESZ-1, the Secretariat may reject the application for

Environmental Clearance at the preliminary stage of scrutiny

itself and inform the project proponent accordingly.      SEIAA

may be kept informed of such rejections. On the other hand,

if the proponent has not indicated in the questionnaire the

location of the site specifically, the proposal may be forwarded

to SEAC for appraisal after verification of all other requisite

documents. If SEAC finds that the site falls with ESZ-1, SEAC

may recommend for rejection of the proposal, without further

processing.   SEIAA may subsequently reject the application

based on SEAC recommendations".

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                            13</span>
</p><p id="p_31">     It appears that SEIAA was prompted to take the decision in

    question, firstly, for the reason of our directions and secondly,

    due to recommendations of the WGEEP report.


</p><p id="p_32">18. Referring to our directions dated 25th July, 2012 passed in the

    matter of Goa Foundation case (<a href="/doc/180993556/" id="a_8">Goa Foundation &amp; Ors. vs

    Union of India &amp; Ors</a>; Original Application no. 26 of 2012,

    pending before us which reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_33">
    "We direct that as and when the Ministry considers the

    applications for granting EC in respect of other areas falling in

    ESZ-1, they shall take note of WGEEP report and take

    decision only in consonance with the provisions made therein.

    The State Level EACs shall also adhere to the same restriction

    in respect of ESZ-1 zone".
</p>
<p id="p_34">
    It is not difficult to discover that there is no blanket ban

    imposed on the discretion to be employed by the authority

    concerned in the matter of grant of EC to the projects falling in

    ESZ-1.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">19. It is correct that WGEEP report as well as HLWG report      have

   genesis in administrative orders passed by the MoEF for the

   study of environmental concerns relating to Western Ghats

   region and as such have no binding force but are rather of

   recommendatory nature giving advice to the Government

   concerned.   Both these reports shed light on environmental

   concerns relating to Western Ghats region and it is for the

   authority to take appropriate decisions in the matter of grant of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                 14</span>
    ECs to the projects falling in Western Ghats region in the light

   of such studies, in order to safeguard the environment and at

   the same time, promote sustainable development.


</p><p id="p_37">20. Para   13   of   the   WGEEP      report   deals    with    proposed

    guidelines/summary         recommendations         for     sectorwise

    activities in the words of WGEEP graded or layered approach,

    with regulatory as well as promotional measures, appropriately

    fine-tuned to local ecological and social context within the

    broad framework of Regions of highest sensitivity Zone which

    is ESZ-1; Regions of high sensitivity ESZ-2; and Regions of

    moderate sensitivity ESZ-3, is advocated and is tabulated in

    table (6) at para 13. As regards quarrying and sand mining in

    ESZ-1, it does recommend effective control of existing

    quarrying and sand mining activity for environmental and

    social impacts immediately.       No blanket ban on the existing

    quarrying and sand mining activity in ESZ-1 has been

    prescribed. Needless to say that assessment of environmental

    and social impact is clearly a step to exercise effective control

    over the existing quarrying and sand mining activities in ESZ-

    1 region.

<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">21. In the instant case, SEAC in its 10th meeting held on 26th and

    27th November, 2012 dealt with the proposal for EC moved by

    the appellant as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_40">
    "Before the presentation of the proposal by the project

    proponent, the Committee held detailed discussions on the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                 15</span>
 proposed project site as it falls within 10 Kms of state

boundary between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Periyar Wildlife

Sanctuary. The proposed area comes under the Eco Sensitive

Zone 1 (ESZ-1) of WGEEP report.            The proponent was then

allowed to make a presentation of their proposal.                The

proposed project site falls within 9˚38'N and 77˚08'E.           The

Committee was of the opinion that since the elevation

difference of the site is more than 1000 m, it is definitely eco-

sensitive. It was pointed out by the proponent that although

the project site as evident from the google image indicated

thick forest vegetation, it is actually rubber plantation.       The

proponent was asked to revise the local geology given in the

write up as it varied much from geology of the proposed site.

The proponent has not provided practical measures to contain

noise during blasting operation. The proponent was of the

opinion that since they adopt delayed electrical controlled

blasting, the impact is very less compared to traditional

blasting. Since the proponent has not suggested specific plans

towards   Corporate   Social        Responsibility,   the   Committee

suggested conducting free medical check-ups for people

around 300 m around the project site who are willing for the

same as part of medical camps which can be conducted once

in a year.   The Committee also asked whether the existing

roads are capable of withstanding 20 T trucks for transporting

the excavated material. To this end the proponent stated that

the plying of trucks is within the campus only for which the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                               16</span>
 private road maintained by them is being used. Even after the

clarification from the proponent regarding the queries raised

by SEAC, the Committee was concerned about the site coming

under ESZ-1 of WGEEP report.             With this in view, the

Committee decided to defer the proposal for the time being. It

was further decided to inform the proponent to approach

SEAC for environmental clearance at a later stage, after the

finalization of the WGEEP report, specifically demarcating

various ESZs, if required, in the light of the National Green

Tribunal orders.    In addition to scrupulously following the

general conditions suggested for all mining projects, the

Committee resolved to insist on the proponent for compliance

of the following specific conditions:
</p>
<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">1. Revise local geology of the project site.


</p><p id="p_43">2. Provide details regarding depth upto which the geological

  resource is found.
</p>
<p id="p_44">
</p><p id="p_45">3. Consent from the people inhabiting the area 100 m around

  the edge of the core zone of the project area for conducting

  quarrying activities.
</p>
<p id="p_46">
</p><p id="p_47">4. Landscape plan with index of species of plants to be

  provided.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">5. Specific methodology adopted for drilling and blasting

  including the technical details regarding the geometry of

  drill holes to be provided to SEAC before initiating any

  activity.
</p>
<p id="p_50"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                              17</span>
</p><p id="p_51">     6. A perspective view and plans of reclamation activities to be

       provided before initiating any activity."


</p><p id="p_52">22. As observed earlier the mining activity was being carried on by

    Mr. K. I. Varghese, firstly, as a proprietor and later on as a

    partner in the business with his family members at Survey No.

    65/1pt village Kumily, Peermade Taluk, District Idukki,

    Kerala. As an existing work in ESZ-1, it was incumbent upon

    the SEAC to have used its discretion in the light of

    environmental and social impact study after having duly

    considered the environmental and social impacts of the

    quarrying works at the site in question. The SEAC was free to

    recommend either the grant or rejection of EC sought for by

    the appellant considering the fact that the quarrying works are

    ongoing since 1990. Unfortunately, this has not been done by

    the SEAC and has merely chosen to defer the proposals for the

    time being. Pertinently, the first Respondent, SEIAA towed the

    line of SEAC and failed to exercise its jurisdiction as a

    regulatory authority under the Environmental Clearance

    Regulations, 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_53">
</p><p id="p_54">23. With a view to protect the legacy of nature as bequeathed in

   Western Ghats region in the face of onslaught in the name of

   economic    prosperity   and     to   strike    a   balance   between

   conservation    of   nature's    legacy   and       development,   the

   Government of India initiated the aforesaid study called WGEEP

   as well as a study under the chairmanship of Dr. K.

   Kasturirangan, also called HLWG.
</p>
<p id="p_55"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                   18</span>
    The HLWG was also tasked with the mandate to take a holistic

    view of the issue and to bring synergy between protection of

    environment and biodiversity and the imperatives of equity for

    the   indigenous   residents    of   the   Western   Ghats   area,

    particularly the disadvantaged sections of society, so that their

    rightful aspirations for inclusive growth and sustainable

    development are also protected and addressed.


   However, it is to be borne in mind that the work of development

    ought not to be stalled indefinitely waiting for the Government

    to take a final stand in the matter of operationalizing the

    recommendation of WGEEP report and HLWG report. We also

    reserve our comments as to which of the two reports-WGEEP

    report or HLWG report serves the object of the said studies,

    keeping in mind the said object and the mandate of the

    Environment Clearance Regulations, 2006, to dispose of the

    application for grant of EC in the stipulated time frame. The

    SEAC and SEIAA shall remain under obligation to freshly

    consider the application of the appellant for the grant of EC and

    to take appropriate decision in the matter.


</p><p id="p_56">24. Hence the order:
</p>
<p id="p_57">
a. The impugned decision refusing to grant the EC for the

   quarrying project of the appellant in survey no. 65/1pt village

   Kumily, Taluk Peermade, District Idukki, Kerala dated 13th

   December, 2012 is set aside.
