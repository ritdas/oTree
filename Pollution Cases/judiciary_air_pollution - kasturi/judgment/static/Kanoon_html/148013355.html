Date of pronouncing the order :                  March 20, 2020

                                           ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">PER P.M. JAGTAP, VICE-PRESIDENT (KZ)

        These two appeals filed by the assessee against two separate
orders both dated 14.05.2019 passed by the Ld. CIT(A) - 25, Kolkata
for Assessment Year 2014-15 &amp; 2015-16 involve common issues and
the same, therefore, are being disposed of by a single consolidated
order along with the corresponding stay applications filed by the
assessee being S.A. Nos. 18 &amp; 19/Kol/2020.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.      Although as many as 15 identical grounds are raised in these
two appeals by the assessee, the learned counsel for the assessee has
pressed and argued Ground Nos. 4, 5 &amp; 10 which read as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "4. For that the lower authorities failed to consider that the grant given
       by the Government were for specific purposes and it could not be treated

                                              I.T.A. Nos. 1726 &amp; 1727/Kol/2019 &amp; S.A. Nos. 18 &amp; 19/Kol/2020
                                                                        Assessment Year: 2014-15 &amp; 2015-16
                                                                        West Bengal Pollution Control Board


     income of the assessee and therefore the same should have been excluded
     in the assessment.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     5. For that the lower authorities failed to consider that income which did
     not accrue or arise to the appellant was assessed wrongly as its income.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     10. For that in the facts and circumstances of the case the receipts of the
     Board are covered under <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_1">Article 289</a> of the Indian Constitution and hence
     not liable to tax."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_3">3.    The relevant facts of the case apropos these Ground Nos. 4, 5 &amp;
10 are that the assessee is a Government Organisation with the main
objective of performing activities of controlling pollution. The return
of income for the year under consideration was filed by it on
19.11.2015 declaring total income at nil after claiming exemption u/s
10(46) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961. During the course of assessment
proceedings, the AO noticed that the assessee was notified u/s 10(46)
on 04.04.2016 from A.Y. 2016-17 to 2021-22 vide Notification No.
25/2016in F. No. 196/11/2015-ITA-I. He also noted that the assessee
was not in possession of any certificate or notification on the basis of
which exemption u/s 10(46) could be claimed / allowed for the year
under consideration i.e. A.Y. 2014-15. He accordingly disallowed the
assessee's claim for exemption u/s 10(46) for the year under
consideration and treating the assessee as an AOP, he computed the
entire surplus of Rs. 40,60,04,865/- as the income of the assessee in
the assessment completed u/s 143(3) of the Act vide an order dated
02.12.2016.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.    Similarly the claim of the assessee for exemption u/s 10(46) for
A.Y. 2015-16 was disallowed by the AO and treating the assessee as
an AOP, the surplus of Rs. 53,22,73,708/- was computed by the AO as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            3</span>
                                                I.T.A. Nos. 1726 &amp; 1727/Kol/2019 &amp; S.A. Nos. 18 &amp; 19/Kol/2020
                                                                          Assessment Year: 2014-15 &amp; 2015-16
                                                                          West Bengal Pollution Control Board


the total income of the assessee vide an order dated 23.11.2017
passed u/s 143(3) of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.    Against the orders passed by the AO u/s 143(3) for both the
years under consideration, appeals were preferred by the assessee
before the Ld. CIT(A) and while disposing of the same vide his
impugned orders, the Ld. CIT(A) adjudicated upon only few grounds
raised by the assessee dismissing the other grounds as not pressed.
Aggrieved by the orders of the Ld. CIT(A), the assessee has preferred
these appeals before the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.    We have heard the arguments of both the sides and also
perused the relevant material available on record. As submitted by
the learned counsel for the assessee, the issues raised in Ground Nos.
4, 5 &amp; 10 in the present appeals were also raised by the assessee by
way of specific grounds raised in the appeals filed before the Ld.
CIT(A). He has also submitted that a detailed submission was made
on behalf of the assessee in support of its case on these issues and the
same as extracted by the Ld. CIT(A) at page no. 32 to 41 of his
impugned orders was as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     "39. Ground No. 4, 5 &amp; 5: The assessee was constituted u/s 4 of the Water
     (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 under the name "West
     Bengal Pollution Control Board". The preamble of the Act reads as under:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">An Act</a> to provide for the prevention and control of water pollution and
       the maintaining or restoring of wholesomeness of water, for the
       establishment, with a view to carrying out the purposes aforesaid, of
       Boards for the prevention and control of water pollution, for conferring on
       and assigning to such Boards powers and functions relating thereto and
       for matters connected therewith.</blockquote>

<p id="p_7">       WHEREAS it is expedient to provide for the prevention and control of
       water pollution and the maintaining or restoring of wholesomeness of
       water, for the establishment, with o view to carrying out the purposes

                                           I.T.A. Nos. 1726 &amp; 1727/Kol/2019 &amp; S.A. Nos. 18 &amp; 19/Kol/2020
                                                                     Assessment Year: 2014-15 &amp; 2015-16
                                                                     West Bengal Pollution Control Board


  aforesaid, of Boards for the prevention and control of water pollution and
  for conferring on and assigning to such Boards powers and functions
  relating thereto."
</p>
<p id="p_8">40. From the preamble itself it can be seen that the assessee-board was
created to discharge governmental function relating to environment and
in particular for prevention &amp; control of water pollution as' well as for
maintaining / restoring wholesomeness of water. The assessee-board was
also entrusted with the task of prevention, control and abatement of air
pollution and giving effect to decisions taken in United Nations
Conference and Human Environment. Further the assessee-board was
empowered to act as state-agent for preservation of natural resources of
the earth which includes quality of air and control of air pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_9">41. Under various provisions of the environment legislatures, namely the
Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and The Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, L981, it can be seen that the
assessee is created, controlled and performed as desired by the
government. As for example, u/s 4 of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water Act</a>, the state government
specifies the powers conferred on it and assigns the functions to be
performed. U/s 17 of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water Act</a>, the assessee has to plan a
comprehensive programme for the prevention, control or abatement of
pollution of streams and wells in the state and to secure the execution
thereof; Further it has to advise the state government on any matter
concerning the prevention, control or abatement of water pollution; Over
and above it has to perform such other functions as may be prescribed /
entrusted to it by the state government. Further just like a government
department, it has to mobilize its resources from the budgetary
allocation, it has to borrow money only on government approval and it
has to place its budget before the government. Further it has to incur
expenditure in accordance with the instructions laid down under the
General Financial Rules and other instructions issued by the government
from time to time. U/s 50 of the Water act, all members &amp; officers of the
assessee-board shall be deemed to be public servants within the meaning
of <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_9">section 21</a> of the Indian Penal Code while acting in pursuance of any of
the provisions of this Act.
</p>
<p id="p_10">42. Considering the above statutory aspects, the appellant contends that
the income derived by it, is the income of the State and is therefore not
liable to tax under <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_10">Article 289(1)</a> of the Constitution of India. Without
prejudice, it is contended that the activities of the appellant board
constitute the functions incidental to the ordinary functions of the State
and therefore, its income is immune from tax under Clause (3) to Article
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                          5</span>
                                               I.T.A. Nos. 1726 &amp; 1727/Kol/2019 &amp; S.A. Nos. 18 &amp; 19/Kol/2020
                                                                         Assessment Year: 2014-15 &amp; 2015-16
                                                                         West Bengal Pollution Control Board


289 of the Constitution of India. In fact the state cannot allow the
functions to be discharged by any private entity. These functions can only
be discharged by the state or any one appointed by it on its behalf to
discharge the above state functions.
</p>
<p id="p_11">43. It is submitted that the functions performed by the appellant broadly
fall under <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_11">Article 48A</a> of the Constitution of India which provides for
protection and improvement of environment falling under the directive
principles of State Policy in Part IV of the Constitution of India and
accordingly, any income derived in the exercise of functions performed by
the State or incidental to ordinary functions of the State is not liable to
tax under <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_12">Article 289(1)</a> <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_13">/ 289(31of the Constitution of India.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_12">40. Apart from the above, the distinguishing features of the assessee
which entitles to consider its income as 'state income' are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_13">  a) The appellant board does not carry on any business / commercial
  activity.
</p>
<p id="p_14">  b) The appellant board is only a regulatory body for public welfare.
</p>
<p id="p_15">  c) The appellant board was appointed exclusively for carrying out the
  state function or the state obligation mandated by the Constitution of
  India as well as by the statute.
</p>
<p id="p_16">  d) The functions to be discharged by the Board are set out in the Water
  (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, L974 and The Air (Prevention
  and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_17">  e) The appellant board is vested with powers which only a state discharge
  and not any private entity or a private organization.
</p>
<p id="p_18">  f) lf the veil of the assessee board is lifted, it would be seen that state is the
  person running and controlling the board.
</p>
<p id="p_19">  g) Even possessing of own funds or PAN No. does not make any difference
  since the appellant board is acting as an exclusive agent of the state for
  performing a state function and a state obligation which falls wholly in
  the realm of state domain.
</p>
<p id="p_20">  h) As the activity carried on by the board is of such a nature which the
  state alone can carry on, the income generated / derived from such
  activity has to be treated as income of the state government.
</p>
<p id="p_21">41.The relevant provision contained under <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_16">article 289(1)</a> of the
Constitution of India, is reproduced as follows:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                       6</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                                            I.T.A. Nos. 1726 &amp; 1727/Kol/2019 &amp; S.A. Nos. 18 &amp; 19/Kol/2020
                                                                      Assessment Year: 2014-15 &amp; 2015-16
                                                                      West Bengal Pollution Control Board


  "Exemption of property and income of a State from Union taxation (1) the
  property and income of a State shall be exempt from Union taxation.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">  (2) Nothing in clause (1) shall prevent the Union from imposing, or
  authorising the imposition of, any tax to such extent, if any, as Parliament
  may by law provide in respect of a trade or business of any kind carried on
  by, or on behalf of, the Government of o State, or any operations connected
  therewith, or any property used or occupied for the purposes of such trade
  or business, or any income accruing or arising in connection therewith.
</p>
<p id="p_23">  (3) Nothing in clause (2) shall apply to any trade or business, or to any
  class of trade or business, which Parliament may by law declare to be
  incidental to the ordinary functions of government,"
</p>
<p id="p_24">42. Thus <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_17">Article 289</a> is divided into three parts: while clause (1) of <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_18">Article
289</a> says that the property and income of State shall be exempt from
union taxation, clause (3) provides that nothing in clause (2) which talks
about imposition of tax, shall apply to any trade or business, which
parliament may by law declared to be incidental to the ordinary functions
of government. Thus, a plain reading of the aforesaid clauses of <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_19">Article
289</a> makes it clear that they are independent of each other and speaks of
three different situations


</p><p id="p_25"> 43. <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_20">Section 4</a> of the Water (prevention and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_21">Pollution) Act</a>,
1974, empowers the state government to constitute a state pollution
control board through a notification published in the official gazette for
exercising such powers and functions as may be assigned to the board
under the Act. Similarly, <a href="/doc/1966744/" id="a_22">section 4</a> of The Air (prevention and control of
pollution) Act, 1981, provides that state pollution control boards
constituted under <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_23">section 4</a> of The Water (prevention and control of
pollution) Act, 7974 shall be deemed to be the state board for the
prevention and control of air pollution. Further other provisions of both
the aforesaid Acts, including assimilation of funds, preparation of budget,
spending of money, borrowings for short term &amp; long term etc. leaves no
room for doubt that the state government exercises control over the

Act, 1974 empowers the state government to supersede the state pollution

over all the powers, functions and duties performed by the state board
and also property owned or controlled by the board shall vest in the state
government. Therefore, from the aforesaid provisions, it can be seen that
though the board apparently seems to possess an independent entity, in

fact it is not so. Mere possession of PAN or having separate logo will not
change the real situation.
</p>
<p id="p_27">45. Therefore, examining the provisions contained under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_25">Water Act</a>,
1974 or the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_26">Air Act</a>, 1981 vis-a-vis the provisions contained under <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_27">Article
48A</a> read with <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_28">Article 289</a> of the Constitution of India, it is evident that the
board is exercising the powers/functions as an agent/extended arm of the
state government and these cannot characterized to be in the nature of
trade or business. <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_29">Article 48A</a> of the Constitution states that "The State
shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to
safeguard the forests and wild life of the country". The assessee-board
was constituted under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_30">Water Act</a>, 1974 / the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_31">Air Act</a>, 1981 to do this
state function assigned by the Constitution and accordingly all
receipts/income as were accrued / arises to the assessee, essentially
accrued/arisen to the state government. When the property or income of
state is exempt from union taxation and when the board has no real
existence other than the state, the expression 'income of a state' as
incorporated under <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_32">Article 289(1)</a> has to be interpreted to mean, the
income of the board. In other words, the board cannot be considered as
some authority other than the state for all real purpose. Therefore, the
assessee is eligible to claim immunity from taxation under clause (1) of of
the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_28">46. Even the Water (prevention and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_33">Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 &amp; The
Air (prevention and control of pollution) Act, 1981 clearly stipulates that
the board can be dissolved by the state government at any time and
immediately upon such eventuality the property vests with, the state
government. Therefore considering the various provisions of the
environmental legislations and considering the <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_34">Article 48A</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_35">Article
289</a> of the Constitution, the income / receipts of the assessee-board can
be fairly interpreted to mean as the income / receipts of the state
government and such income / receipt did not accrue / arise in the hands
of the assessee-board. U/s 4 of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_36">IT Act</a> income tax is chargeable in
respect of total income. When the income does not accrue / arise to the
assessee, nothing is includible in the total income computed u/s 5 of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_37">IT
Act</a>. Therefore, when the income / receipt accrues to the government and
not to the assessee-board, is eligible to get immunity from taxation under
<a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_38">article 289(1)</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_29">47. Without prejudice we further submit that all the receipts made in
various heads, are capital receipts and therefore not subjected to Income
tax. The main receipts of the assessee-board are comprised of
appropriation of funds by the state government from state consolidated

                                                                       West Bengal Pollution Control Board


fund as required u/s 35 of the Water (prevention and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_39">Pollution)
Act</a>, 7974 and by the central government from the consolidated funds of
India u/s 8 of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_40">Control of Pollution) Cess Act</a>,
1977 from the proceeds collected under the Act. The funds so released by
the government / collected by the assessee-board on behalf of the
government, requires to expend only to meet the specified objectives as
enumerated in the respective enactments. In other words, the assessee
was not the owner of the fund and cannot claim any right to use the fund
in any manner that it desires, rather the assessee was under obligation to
spend the fund for the specific purpose as enumerated in the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_41">Water Act</a>,
L974, the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_42">Air Act</a>, 1981 &amp; the <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_43">Water Cess Act</a>, 1977. In essence the whole
fund as held by the assessee-board is meant to protect the environment, to
conserve the natural resources as well as to promote the state's overall
objective of public welfare. Thus by nature all the receipts in the hands of
the assessee-board are capital receipts and therefore not liable to be
includible in the total income for levy of income tax u/s 4 of the lncome
<a href="/doc/6749/" id="a_44">Tax Act</a>"
</p>
<p id="p_30">48. It is well settled that every receipt or amount received/accounted, is
not income and to consider the same, it is required to examine the nature,
character and purpose of any realization. Amount received is income in
the hands of the assessee, if he has title/right over the said amount in
form of dominion and right to use the said amount. This principle was
substantiated by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT Vs.
DTTDC in ITA Nos. 166/2001, 161,/2004 &amp; 320/2004 &amp; ITR Nos. 30-
33/1997. The facts of the aforesaid case are identical to the facts of the
assessee's case in the present appeal. The assessee is a Government
company and as directed by the Government, the assessee-company
undertook a massive investment programme in transport infrastructure.
As the same requires substantial fund, the assessee was allowed to run
retail trade in country liquor and held the money under a fund named
"Transport infrastructure Utilisation Fund". The assessee did not consider
the same as income on the ground that these receipts were mandatorily
required to be spent for construction of flyovers etc. and were not to be
regarded as receipts which are in the nature of income. While dealing
with the aforesaid claim of the Assessee, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court
observed as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_31">  '25. Every receipt or amount received/accounted, is not income. Amount
  received is income in the hands of the assessee if he has title/right over the
  said amount in form of dominion and right to use the said amount. When
  examining, the concept of income' one has to keep in mind, commercial
  reality, specialty of the situation rather thon pure theoretical or doctrine

  aspects. The business aspect of the matter has to be viewed as o whole but
  without disregarding the statutory language. Depending upon the nature
  and character of the deposits/payments, should be given to hold whether
  or not the amount received was income/profit."
</p>
<p id="p_32">49. In the case of <a href="/doc/1389778/" id="a_45">Siddeshwar Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd. vs. CIT &amp;
Ors</a>., (2004) 270 ITR 1 (SC), the word 'income' or 'profit' was examined
and interpreted. In the said case, issue arose whether deposits/payments
made in different heads/parties was diversion of income at source or not
and whether the deposits/funds have to be included in the income earned.
The Supreme Court emphasized that the nature and character of the
deposits/payments is determinative and relevant.
</p>
<p id="p_33">50. In the case of <a href="/doc/460127/" id="a_46">CIT vs. Bazpur Coop. Sugar Factory Ltd</a> (1988) 172 ITR
321 (SC), the question arise as to whether the amounts credited to loss
equalization and capital redemption reserve fund were held to be
income/profit. The Apex Court held that all realizations do not get
impressed with the character of revenue receipts includable in the taxable
income and when the assessee does not have unfettered dominion over
the money, the same cannot be treated as income. The Supreme Court
expounded that the following questions should be raised and answered:
</p>
<p id="p_34">  "(1) Do the receipts bear a character of income at the time it reached the
  hands of the assessee?
</p>
<p id="p_35">  (2) Does the title in the receipt vest with the assessee?
</p>
<p id="p_36">  (3) Does the assessee exercise complete dominion over the funds in
  question?
</p>
<p id="p_37">  (4) Does the assessee regarded the money as that of a third party or treat
  the money of that of a third party/, with assessee having no unfettered
  dominion over the same?
</p>
<p id="p_38">  (5) Does the assessee stand in the position of debtor in relation to those
  funds/deposits?
</p>
<p id="p_39">  (6) What is the primary purpose of collection of said amount?"
</p>
<p id="p_40">51. In the present case, the assessee-board requires only to fulfil the
objective of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_47">Water Act</a>, to expend all the receipts the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_48">Air Act</a> and other
environmental Laws. Therefore considering the facts of the case read with
the principal established by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court and the terms of
reference stated by the Apex Court, the receipts in the hands of the
assessee-board requires to consider as capital receipts not liable to tax.

submit that no income had accrued/arisen in the hands of the assessee-

<p id="p_42">7.    The learned counsel for the assessee has contended that Ld.
CIT(A) however dismissed the relevant grounds by mentioning in his
impugned orders that they were not pressed. He has contended that
the said grounds were not only pressed by the assessee but even a
detailed submission in support of the issues raised therein was made
by the assessee which was extracted by the Ld. CIT(A) in his
impugned orders. He has contended the Ld. CIT(A) therefore was not
justified in dismissing the grounds as not pressed and urged that the
matter may be sent back to the AO for deciding these issues as same
were not even considered and decided by the Assessing Officer.
Keeping in view all the facts of the case as borne out from the record,
we are inclined to accept this contention of the learned counsel for
the assessee. Even the ld. DR has not raised any objection for sending
the matter back to the AO for adjudication of these vital issues
relating to the assessment of the assessee for both the years under
consideration after proper and necessary verification. We accordingly
set aside the impugned orders of the ld. CIT(A) on these issues and
restore the matter to the file of the AO for deciding the same on merit
in accordance with law after giving the assessee proper and sufficient
opportunity of being heard.
