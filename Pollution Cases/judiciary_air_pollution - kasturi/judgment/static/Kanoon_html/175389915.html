                 W.P.(C)No.2242 of 2014 E

               --------------------------------------------

          Dated this the 30th day of March, 2015

                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       The Petitioner, having proposed to construct its

Corporate Office comprising Basements, Ground plus twelve

floors and Terrace having a total area of 22535 sq.mt.,

submitted an application for building permit to the

respondent Corporation. The land on which it wanted to

construct is an extent of 3.20 acres in Survey Nos.

139/1,139/3, 140, 140/3, 140/1, 143/2 and 143/3 of

Elamkulam Village and Survey Nos.227 and 228/1 of

Poonithura Village, both in Kanayannur Taluk. Locationally,

the   property lies on the side of the Jawaharlal Nehru

Stadium Link Road, which is a 22 meter wide public road.

</p><p id="p_2">       2. Simultaneously, while applying for the building

permit, the petitioner is said to have obtained the following

necessary statutory clearances and certificates: (1) Exhibit

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WPC 2242/14                  2</span>




P2 Environmental Clearance by the Ministry of Environment

&amp; Forests, Government of India, New Delhi; (2) Exhibit P3

Composite Consent under various <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Pollution Act</a>s issued by

Kerala State Pollution Control Board; (3) Exhibit P4 No

Objection Certificate issued by Airports Authority of India;

(4) Exhibit P5 No Objection Certificate issued by Southern

Naval Command; (5) Exhibit P6 Confirmation issued by the

fifth respondent Greater Cochin Development Authority

(GCDA) that the land comes under the category of mixed

use (residential and commercial) as per Varied Structure

Plan, and (6) Exhibit P7 No Objection Certificate issued by

Fire &amp; Rescue Services Department.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       3. As a matter of past developments, the petitioner

pleads that prior to 2008, since there was no necessity to

obtain   permission  from   the   second   respondent   for

construction of multi-storied buildings for residential

purposes, the first respondent, being the sole competent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WPC 2242/14                     3</span>




authority, granted building permits to the petitioner's

neighbouring plot owners to raise multi-storied complexes.

The developers who took advantage of the statutory position

include Kent Constructions, Indian Medical Association

(IMA), Skyline Builders, Olive Builders, Desai Homes, etc.

The structures raised by these companies or associations

are said to have been located on either side of the

Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium Link Road.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4. On receipt of the petitioner's application, in terms of

the statutory scheme, initially the first respondent forwarded

it to the fourth respondent, who in turn forwarded the same

to the second respondent. The first respondent has, however,

informed the fourth respondent through Exhibit P8 that it has

no proposal involving the petitioner's plot and that as per

Clause 4.13 of the Structural Plan of Kochi City,

construction for mixed use is also permitted in the said plot.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WPC 2242/14                   4</span>




</p><p id="p_5">       5. In course of time, through Exhibit P9, the first

respondent rejected the petitioner's application for building

permit on the ground that the second respondent, through

Exhibit P10, has directed it not to grant permission.

Assailing Exhibits P9 and P10 proceedings issued by the

first and second respondents, the petitioner has filed the

present writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       6. In the above factual back drop, Mr.Joseph Markos,

the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner

company, has strenuously contended that after the Kochi

International Stadium was built, there is no other proposal

for acquisition of land pending, requiring any ground or

open space. According to him, adjacent to the petitioner's

property already many multi-storied constructions came up,

duly sanctioned by the respondent Corporation.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WPC 2242/14                    5</span>




</p><p id="p_7">         7. Placing reliance on Raju S. Jethmalani v. State

of Kerala1 and Nasar v. Malappuram Municipality2, the

learned Senior Counsel has, in the alternative, contended

that though the land belonging to a private person can be

included in a development plan, unless the property is

acquired by the State Government or the Local Authority to

effectuate the said purpose, the land owner cannot be

denied the right to use the property for any other purpose.

</p><p id="p_8">         8. Drawing my attention to Exhibit P13 plans of

Cochin Corporation, the learned Senior Counsel would

contend that the properties on either side of the Stadium

Link Road, including that of the petitioner, are shown under

mixed use.
</p>
<p id="p_9">         9. It is also the contention of the learned Senior

Counsel that the plots adjacent to the petitioner's are

similar and that the canal splits those plots as well in two;


1 (2005) 11 SCC 222
2 2009 (3) KLT92

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">WPC 2242/14                    6</span>




nevertheless, the authorities concerned have treated them

as lying contiguous and permitted the owners thereof to

cover the canal with a culvert. According to him, the

respondent Corporation has thus extended the benefit of

road access to the property owners from the 22 metre width

road.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       10. The learned Senior Counsel has emphasised that

without that permission and the use of the culvert covering,

none of the neighbouring properties would have had road

access. In petitioner's case, the respondent Corporation,

contends the learned Senior Counsel, has already permitted

it through Exhibit P11 proceedings to construct a culvert,

which the petitioner did. In sum and substance, the

contention of the learned Senior Counsel is that denial of

permission to the petitioner is a clear case of invidious

discrimination falling foul of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_2">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">WPC 2242/14                    7</span>




Eventually, the learned Senior Counsel has urged this Court

to allow the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_11">       11. Per contra, the learned Special Government

Pleader has strenuously opposed the claims and contentions

of the petitioner. He has submitted that the survey numbers

in which the petitioner's land is situated is earmarked as

Ground and Public Open Space Zone as per the Structure

Plan. According to him, under Clause 4.13 special provision

of the Structure Plan for Central City, mixed use is

permitted on either side of the roads having existing or

proposed width of 12 metres or more to a depth of 75

metres from the boundary. The maximum permissible FAR

and coverage for building under residential and commercial

occupancies shall be 2.5 and 50% in mixed use. The learned

Special Government Pleader contends that the petitioner's

plot does not fit into the above scheme.
</p>
<p id="p_12"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">WPC 2242/14                  8</span>




</p><p id="p_13">       12. The learned Special Government Pleader has also

contended that a part of the petitioner's plot is lying in the

Poonithura Village abutting 20 metre wide road, but the

rest of the extent is in Elamkulam Village with a 9 metre

road abutting. The property, situated in two villages having

been   cleaved   by   the Karanakkodam       canal    with a

Corporation owned culvert constructed across it, cannot be

called a contiguous one. Major portion of the petitioner's

land lies in Elamkulam Village. 75 metres depth from the 20

metre road boundary includes the petitioner's plot in

Poonithura Village, the canal and a portion of the

petitioner's plot in Elamkulam Village. As such, the

construction activity beyond 75 metre line in the petitioner's

plot, contends the learned Special Government Pleader, is

not permitted as it is zoned for Ground and Public open

space. In other words, the petitioner's plot does not have

the necessary FAR and coverage.
</p>
<p id="p_14"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">WPC 2242/14                      9</span>




</p><p id="p_15">         13. It is the generic contention of the learned Special

Government Pleader that the recreational open spaces in

Kochi city are grossly inadequate and that they cry for the

need of not trifling with the existing open spaces. According

to him, the ownership of the culvert (constructed across the

canal) is vested with the Corporation. Hence, the plot

cannot be considered as a contiguous one. Defending

Exhibit P10 proceedings, the learned Special Government

Pleader would contend that only abiding by the existing

regulations has the second respondent issued the said

proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_16">         14. The learned Special Government Pleader has also

contended that there is every need for a planned

development as has been held in Friends Colony

Development Committee v State of Orissa3. He has also

made efforts to distinguish the ratio of Nazzar (supra) by

contending that it does not involve zoning and planning

3 (2004) 8 SCC 733

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">WPC 2242/14                     10</span>




without the necessity of acquisition of land. Summing up his

submissions, the learned Special Government Pleader has

submitted that the Structure Plan for Central City of Kochi

is still in force and that the culvert connecting the two plots

of the petitioner is owned by the Corporation, thereby

rendering the petitioner's plot unfit for any building permit.

</p><p id="p_17">         15. The learned Counsel for the first respondent has

adopted, in their entirety, the arguments of the second

respondent. He has further submitted that the first

respondent forwarded the petitioner's application for

building permit to the second respondent in terms of Rule

54 of the Kerala Municipality Building Rules. According to

him, the respondent Corporation has to go by the directive

of the second respondent, which it eventually did.

</p><p id="p_18">         16. Heard Mr.Joseph Markos, the learned Senior

Counsel for the petitioner, the learned Standing Counsel for

the first respondent and the learned Special Government

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">WPC 2242/14                    11</span>




Pleader for the second respondent, apart from perusing the

record.
</p>
<p id="p_19">       17. On a compendious consideration of the rival

pleadings and submissions, the following issues emerge for

discussion:
</p>
<p id="p_20">       i. Whether the fact that the survey numbers where

the petitioner's property is situated in 'Ground and Public

Open Space Zone' as per the Structure Plan comes in the

way of the petitioner's putting its property to a mixed use,

which is otherwise permitted in the area?
</p>
<p id="p_21">       ii. Whether the contiguity of the petitioner's property

is affected in view of the bisection of the property by the

Karanakkodam canal, which has been covered by a culvert,

though?
</p>
<p id="p_22">In re, Issue No.1:
</p>
<p id="p_23">       18. Indeed, it is not disputed that the area is densely

constructed, al beit, after due sanction from the respondent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">WPC 2242/14                      12</span>




Corporation; nor is it disputed that the area comes under

mixed use. But the fact remains that the survey numbers in

which the petitioner's property is situated lie in 'Ground and

Public Open Space Zone'. The property in question is shown

in Kochi City Structure Plan as a place earmarked for public

utility. It is axiomatic that in any master plan, various areas

may be marked as public utility places or as lung spaces or

recreational open spaces. The places thus shown may

belong to the Corporation or to any individuals. To sub-

serve the public purpose, the properties owned by

individuals, having been earmarked for public use, are, in

fact, required to be acquired before they could be dedicated

for the declared purpose. In the present instance, no

acquisition proceedings have been initiated.

fell for consideration was whether without acquiring the

land the Government can deprive a person of his use of the

land. Answering the said question, the Hon'ble Supreme

Court has held thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "[T]his in our opinion, cannot be done. It
            would have been possible for the Municipal
            Corporation and the Government of Maha-
            rashtra to acquire the land in order to pro-
            vide civic amenities. But the land in question
            has not been acquired. We are quite con-
            scious of the fact that the open park and gar-
            den are necessary for the residents of the
            area. But at the same time we cannot lose
            sight of the fact that a citizen is deprived of
            his rights without following proper proce-
            dure of law...We fail to understand how the
            burden can be placed on the appellants that
            they should provide suitable area in the
            present locality for using the same as garden
            or park. Rather, the burden should have been
            placed on the Municipal Corporation or the
            State Government instead of putting it on the
            appellants that they must provide some
            space for garden and park."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">As far as this Court is concerned, firstly in <a href="/doc/492480/" id="a_3">Hassan v.

Corporation of Calicut4</a> it considered the issue whether

rejection of the application submitted by the Appellants

therein for permission for construction can be sustained in

view of Clause (vii) of Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Section 393</a> of the

Kerala Municipality Act. This Court, per P.A.Mohammed, J.,

has held thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            "5. It must be recalled that every citizen has
            the freedom to enjoy his land in a manner he
            likes of course subject to the prevailing laws
            in the country, the right to hold land and en-
            joyment thereof though is not a fundamental
            right, is a civil right protected by Chapter IV
            of the Constitution. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_5">Article 300A</a> mandates
            that no person shall be deprived of his prop-
            erty save by authority of law. When a person
            is restrained from enjoyment of his land it
            may amount to deprivation of his property.
            But such deprivation can be made only by au-
            thority of law. That means all restrictions for
            enjoyment of land must be in accordance
            with the procedure authorised by law. It also
            envisages strict compliance of such proce-
            dure in all matters restraining the enjoyment
            of land."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_26">In fact, the above ratio was quoted with approval in

<a href="/doc/79993492/" id="a_6">Padmini &amp; Ors v. State of Kerala5</a> by a learned Division

Bench. Further, in Nasar v. Malappuram Municipality6,

a learned Single Judge of this Court, following the ratio of

Padmini (supra), has observed that in so far as the owner

of the land is concerned, the acquisition affects his interest

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">WPC 2242/14                    15</span>




only from the issuance of notifications and declarations

under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_7">Land Acquisition Act</a>; therefore, any attempt to

curb the rights of the owners of lands, until the publication

of those statutory notifications and declarations, would

result in infraction of the right to property under

<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_8">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution. It is further opined that

any infraction of that nature would also result in the

violation of the equality principle in the matter of

enforcement of laws as is enshrined in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_9">Article 14</a> the

Constitution. It is, in the end, emphatically held that any

demand to create a rider over the title of the owner of the

property under the pretext of a Town Planning Scheme

which has not become operational by acquisition would,

essentially, be oppressive and would not be countenanced

in the face of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_10">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.

</p><p id="p_27">       20. This Court therefore concludes, insofar as the

first issue is concerned, that the objection regarding

'Ground and Public Open Space Zone' cannot be sustained.

In re, Issue No.2:
</p>
<p id="p_28">       21. To appreciate the second issue in its proper

perspective, we may examine Clause 4.13 Other Special

Provisions of the Structural Plan of Kochi City, which clearly

provides that the regulations specified under Clauses 2.4 to

2.8 shall be applicable with the modifications prescribed

thereunder. Sub-clauses (i) and (iv) of Clause 4.13, which

are relevant, are as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">          "(i) All uses permitted in the residential and
          commercial use zones may also be permitted
          on either side of roads having existing or
          proposed width of 12 Meters or more to a
          depth of 75 Meters from the boundary of the
          road.

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">          . . .</blockquote><p id="p_29">

</p><p id="p_30">          (iv) The Maximum permissible F.A.R. and
          Coverage for buildings under residential and
          commercial    occupancies     (as   defined in
          building rules in force) shall be 2.50 and 50%

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">WPC 2242/14                        17</span>




           respectively in the areas prescribed under (i),
</p><p id="p_31">           (ii) and (iii) above.''

</p><p id="p_32">         22. Indisputably, the petitioner's property lies along

the 22 metre road. The next criterion it has, however, to

fulfil is that the property should have width of 12 metres or

more, with a depth of 75 metres from the boundary of the

road. Only in such an eventuality is the petitioner permitted

to have the mixed--residential and commercial--uses under

sub-clause (i) with the applicable F.A.R and Coverage as

provided under sub-clause (iv) above.
</p>
<p id="p_33">         23. Topographically, the petitioner's property falls

within two villages, i.e. Elamkulam and Poonithura, divided

by a canal, which in turn has a culvert constructed across.

The issue is whether the petitioner's property thus located

can be called a contiguous plot. Though negative equity has

no application, the fact, however, remains that most of the

properties in the vicinity are similarly located, cleaved by

the canal. All of them have been permitted to build culverts

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">WPC 2242/14                    18</span>




across and use the properties as if they were contiguous. It

is, indeed, relevant to observe that the respondent

Corporation has permitted through Exhibit P11 proceedings

even the petitioner to bridge across the canal with a culvert.

In Exhibit P11, the conditions stipulated therein inter alia

require the petitioner as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          "7) As is done by Skyline and Kent, canal
          should be constructed through the compound
          of M/s.Muthoot Finance and to avert water
          logging.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">          8) As is done by M/s. Kent and IMA, land for
          road construction on the western side of the
          canal should be surrendered free of cost and
          the same should be made available in the
          prescribed form."</blockquote><p id="p_34">

</p><p id="p_35">       24. In fact, uniformly, the first and second

respondents have treated all other properties as contiguous

after the construction of culverts across the canal, thereby

letting the property owners to fulfil the distance norms in

Clause 4.13 of the Other Special Provisions of the Structural

Plan of Kochi City. Thus, once the contiguity issue is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">WPC 2242/14                     19</span>




resolved, there is no manner of doubt that the petitioner's

property passes the muster under Clause 4.13 extracted

above.
</p>
<p id="p_36">       25. Before proceeding further, it may be appropriate

to refer to the observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

Friends Colony Development Committee (supra), relied

on by the learned Special Government Pleader. Their

Lordships, making a reference to the chapter on "Zoning

and Planning" in American Jurisprudence, 2nd, Vol.82, have

stressed the importance of planned development of urban

spaces by holding thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">          "22. In all developed and developing
          countries there is emphasis on planned
          development of cities which is sought to be
          achieved by zoning, planning and regulating
          building construction activity. Such planning,
          though highly complex, is a matter based on
          scientific research, study and experience
          leading to rationalisation of laws by way of
          legislative  enactments     and   rules   and
          regulations framed thereunder. Zoning and
          planning do result in hardship to individual
          property owners as their freedom to use their
          property in the way they like, is subjected to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">WPC 2242/14                      20</span>




          regulation and control. The private owners
          are to some extent prevented from making
          the most profitable use of their property. But
          for   this  reason    alone   the   controlling
          regulations cannot be termed as arbitrary or
          unreasonable. The private interest stands
          subordinated to the public good. It can be
          stated in a way that power to plan
          development of city and to regulate the
          building activity therein flows from the police
          power of the State. The exercise of such
          governmental power is justified on account of
          it being reasonably necessary for the public
          health, safety, morals or general welfare and
          ecological    considerations;     though     an
          unnecessary or unreasonable inter-meddling
          with the private ownership of the property
          may not be justified.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">          23. The municipal laws regulating the
          building construction activity may provide for
          regulations as to floor area, the number of
          floors, the extent of height rise and the
          nature of use to which a built-up property
          may be subjected in any particular area. The
          individuals as property owners have to pay
          some price for securing peace, good order,
          dignity, protection and comfort and safety of
          the community. Not only filth, stench and
          unhealthy places have to be eliminated, but
          the layout helps in achieving family values,
          youth values, seclusion and clean air to make
          the locality a better place to live. Building
          regulations   also   help   in   reduction   or
          elimination of fire hazards, the avoidance of
          traffic  dangers    and    the   lessening   of
          prevention of traffic congestion in the streets

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">WPC 2242/14                     21</span>




          and roads. Zoning and building regulations
          are also legitimised from the point of view of
          the control of community development, the
          prevention of overcrowding of land, the
          furnishing of recreational facilities like parks
          and playgrounds and the availability of
          adequate    water,    sewerage     and     other
          governmental or utility services."</blockquote><p id="p_37">

</p><p id="p_38">       26. Eventually, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has

observed that the zoning regulations, etc., do achieve the

larger purpose of the public health, safety or general

welfare. Any violation of zoning and regulation laws takes

the toll in terms of public welfare and convenience being

sacrificed apart from the risk, inconvenience and hardship

which is caused to the occupants of the building. Indeed,

there cannot be any quarrel with the above propositional

peroration.
</p>
<p id="p_39">       27. The issue here, shorn of extraneous intricacies,

concerns itself with the distance norms to be observed. With

the culvert across the canal the property is required to be

treated as contiguous; once it is contiguous, the petitioner's

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">WPC 2242/14                  22</span>




plot becomes fully compliant with the distance norms.

Culvert has already been in place as has been permitted

through Exhibit P11 by the first respondent Corporation. In

the context of contempranea expositio, usage or practice

developed under a statute is indicative of the meaning

ascribed to the words by contemporary opinion. All along,

the respondent authorities, wherever they have permitted

the use of culvert, have treated the property on either side

of the canal as contiguous. I do not see any egregious

reason for a differential treatment to be meted out to the

petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_40">       28. In the facts, and circumstances, I am of the

considered opinion that Exhibits P9 and P10 issued by first

and second respondents respectively cannot be sustained

and are accordingly set aside. Consequently, first and

second respondents are directed to re-consider the

petitioner's application for building permit afresh, keeping

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">WPC 2242/14                  23</span>




in view the observations of this Court above, and pass

appropriate orders thereon as expeditiously as possible, at

any rate, within a month's time from the date of receipt of a

copy of the judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_41">       With the above direction, the writ petition stands

disposed of. No order as to costs.
