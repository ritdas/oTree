finally at the stage of admission.            In all these Petitions, the

petitioners, who are original accused nos. 12 to 15 and 19 to 22,

are challenging the order dated 8th March, 2018 passed by the

issuing process under <a href="/doc/75233928/" id="a_1">Sections 7</a>, <a href="/doc/30610064/" id="a_2">8</a>, <a href="/doc/142112542/" id="a_3">9</a>, <a href="/doc/171616267/" id="a_4">10</a>, <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_5">15</a>, <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_6">16</a> and <a href="/doc/69926654/" id="a_7">17</a> of the

the Government under the supervision of accused No. 12 i.e.,

Maharashtra          State       Road     Development         Corporation            Ltd.

(hereinafter referred to as "the MSRDC") took a policy decision to

construct Bandra Worli Sea Link Project (hereinafter referred to as

"BWSL"). At that time, accused No. 12 i.e., the MSRDC received

an Environmental Clearance for construction of BWSL Project.

BWSL Project was completed and it was inaugurated on 1 st July,

2009, and was made available to public.                   It is the case of the

complainant that thereafter, it was noticed that after inauguration of

the BWSL Project, nearly 45,000 additional vehicles ply per day on

this road against the earlier vehicle movement of around 3,000 to

5,000 per day and, therefore, there is tremendous increase in

vehicular traffic in Worli Sea Face area leading abnormal increase

in the levels of air and noise pollution.                 The level of the air

pollution is beyond the National Ambient Air Quality Standards

(hereinafter referred to as "NAAQS") issued by Central Pollution

Control Board (hereinafter referred to as "CPCB").                                   The

complainant has relied on the studies conducted by National

Environmental Engineering Research Institute (hereinafter referred

to as "NEERI") and the noise monitoring conducted by accused

No. 21. The noise pollution has exceeded the levels prescribed

under the Noise Rules. The air and noise pollution is a direct cause

of the traffic movement in BSWL. According to the complainant,

liberty was granted by this Court in Writ Petition No. 992 of 2010,

therefore, the complainant had moved before the National Green

Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as "the NGT") by filing an

Application No. 35 of 2011. In the said Application, on 28 th July,

2016, the NGT had passed the order of amicable settlement.

Pursuant to which, certain directions were given, however, till

today, there is no change in the noise and air pollution levels.

Hence, the complainant, before filing the complaint, gave

prerequisite notice of             60 days as contemplated under <a href="/doc/125409775/" id="a_8">Section

19(b)</a> of the said Act to all the respondents for violation of the

relevant Sections of the said Act so also the said Rules and also

for breach of Notification No. MIS/2014/CR 71/ TC1 dated 31 st July,

2014     issued       by     Environment     Department,        Government             of

Maharashtra. Thereafter, the complainant lodged a private

complaint in which, the learned Magistrate considered the

complaint and the documents placed before it and passed the

following order on 8th March, 2018 :

    Misc. Application of 202/2013 which was filed in
    between Dilip Nevatia V/s. State of Maha. &amp; Ors. The

    shows that accused nos. 1 to 5, 10 to 15, 19 to 22 has
    not complied the order of Hon'ble National Green
    Tribunal Western Zone, Bench Pune. They have also
    ignored the said order even it was brought to the notice

for want violation of the order dated 11 th October, 2013 passed by

the learned Members of the NGT in Misc. Application No. 202 of

2013. The petitioners/ accused Nos. 12 and 13 were not parties to

the said proceedings and the said order was also not against the

petitioners/ accused Nos. 12 and 13 i.e., the MSRDC and its

Chairman. He has pointed out that the complainant had not given

statutory notice under <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_9">Section 19</a> (b) of the said Act to the

petitioners/ accused Nos. 12 and 13. He has further pointed out

paragraph No.6 of the said Notification wherein it is mentioned that

the authorities responsible for implementation of the standards and

their use in the State to control air and noise pollution are different

authorities, but not the petitioners/accused Nos. 12 and 13.

Hence, there is no violation either of the order passed by the NGT

or also the directions given in the said Notification and, therefore,

the order of issuance of process against the petitioners/ accused

Nos. 12 and 13 is to be dropped, quashed and set aside.

that Rule 34 of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_12">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 states about

Department and accused no. 21 and 22, Maharashtra Pollution

Control Board, argued that cognizance should not have been

taken by the learned Magistrate against accused nos. 21 and 22.

There is no compliance of <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_34">Section 19</a> of Environment (Protection)

Act. The sanction to prosecute under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_35">section 19B</a> is required. He

argued that there are two defects in the notice. The notice is

required to be given as per Rule 9 of the Environment (Protection)

Rules. Form of Notice should be under Rule 11. It is not given as

per Form 11, so it is defective.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">9.       He also submitted that the notice is given only to three

persons, hence the prosecution cannot be filed against other

persons. Hence it is not maintainable. It is also not a valid notice,

as it is not sent to Environmental Department. He argued that the

letter of Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF) can be

substituted for statutory notice under <a href="/doc/125409775/" id="a_36">section 19(b)</a> of the Act. The

<a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_37">section 19(6)</a> of Environment Protection Act is not so sacrosanct.

He relied on the ratio laid down in the case of Bhajanlal, reported

in (1992) 1 SCC 335 (Paragraph 102). He submitted that if there

is any other efficacious remedy in the legal statute, then he should

not come to High Court by filing this. The complainant should have

approached the National Green Tribunal for non-compliance of its

order.     Hence, the entire complaint is to be dismissed on this

ground alone.

paragraphs 1 to 23, the complainant has given his historic

narration and the averments do not constitute any offence against

the respondents or the petitioners. Whatever accusation is made

is found only in paragraph 24 of the complaint, which are very

vague. These allegations are not sufficient to issue process. No

assertion is made that the accused has committed offence due to

failure to do certain act. The violation of order of National Green

Tribunal cannot be an offence under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_38">Environment (Protection) Act</a>.

there is no compliance of BS-IV standards and no compliance of

checking of PUC certificates; (ii) The vehicles that have met the

noise standards are only to be allowed to use BWSL and Worli

Sea Face Road; (iii) The authority failed to control indiscriminate

use of sirens having impermissible levels of sound and failing to

ensure that they are used in accordance with law in silent and

residential area of Worli Sea Face. Thus, the grievance made in

respect of air pollution and noise pollution due to honking and

using vehicles without PUC (Pollution under control Certificate).

Along with this notice, the complainant has referred to the direction

under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_68">section 31A</a> of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_69">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1981 dated 29th September, 2016 issued by the Maharashtra

Pollution Control Board/accused no. 21 to Transport Commissioner

and the Police Commissioner (Transport).             Thus, it shows that

accused no. 21 has issued directions regarding controlling of air

and noise pollution. I have considered the objections raised by the

petitioners and I am of the view that there is overall compliance of

issuing the notice under Form IV Rule 11 of the Environment

Protection Rules and therefore there is no default of sending the

notice under <a href="/doc/125409775/" id="a_70">section 19(b)</a> of Environment (Protection) Act.

standards are to be fixed by MOEF.               It also directed that the

prescribed standards so fixed by MPCB in consultation with CPCB

shall be communicated to the Transport Commissioner, State of

Maharashtra and fixed standards are to be communicated to the

Sirens and Multi-toned Horns Manufacturing Authorities and the

Registering Authority in the State of Maharashtra and to all the

of the use of sirens and multi-tone horns and such horns are to be

removed from the concerned vehicle. The Government vehicles

are also prohibited from installing such multi-toned horns. The

honking is prohibited between 10.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. in any

locality. The Police Commissioner was directed to promulgate the

sound standards. The use of horns by the ambulance is also to be

monitored.       The Tribunal referred to earlier directions dated 9 th

January, 2013 and said that the responsibility is fixed on MPCB or

CPCB for compliance within a period of four months and same

shall    be       immediately    communicated         to      the      Transport

Commissioner and the Director General of Police without any

paragraph 8 of the said order, the Tribunal has made it clear that in

case of non-compliance of the directions, the Tribunal may hold

the Authority in contempt and prosecute them.

<p id="p_114">In the said case, four circumstances are laid down whether the

order of issuance of process can be quashed and set aside.

the complaint, prima facie has been made out or not to issue

Magistrate is not expected to embark upon a detailed discussion of

the merits or demerits of the case.

mainly concerned with the allegations made in the complaint or the

evidence led in support of the same and he is only to be prima

against the accused".

while relying on the case of <a href="/doc/1758785/" id="a_142">Chandra Deo vs. Prokash Chandra

was held that what the Magistrate has to be satisfied is whether

there is "sufficient ground for proceeding" and not whether there is

sufficient ground for conviction. The adequacy of the evidence for

conviction can be determined only at the trial and not at the stage

of enquiry.

under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_148">section 482</a> of Cr. P.C. are very wide, however, they are to

be exercised with due care and caution. In respect of issuance of

process, the Supreme Court has observed that :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">      "28. Summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a
      serious matter. Criminal law cannot be set into motion as a
      matter of course. It is not that the complainant has to bring
      only two witnesses to support his allegations in the complaint
      to have the criminal law set into motion. The order of the
      Magistrate summoning the accused must reflect that he has
      applied his mind to the facts of the case and the law
      applicable thereto.        He has to examine the nature of
      allegations made in the complaint and the evidence both oral
      and documentary in support thereof and would that be
      sufficient for the complainant to succeed in bringing charge
      home to the accused. It is not that the Magistrate is a silent
      spectator at the time of recording of preliminary evidence
      before summoning of the accused. The Magistrate has to
      carefully scrutinise the evidence brought on record and may
      even himself put questions to the complainant and his
      witness to elicit answers to find out the truthfulness of the
      allegations or otherwise and then examine if any offence is
      prima facie committed by all or any of the accused."

<p id="p_132">68.   Thus, it is a settled law that the High Court should sparingly

use its inherent powers in the matter of quashing and setting aside

the process and the learned Magistrate while issuing process

should consider the complaint and other documents relied by the

complainant and should not think of the success of the case.

However, the powers of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_149">section 482</a> of Cr.

P.C. and <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_150">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India are not completely

restricted. The High Court not only has supervisory powers to stop

the abuse of powers but is required to use its powers to do the

justice and stop unnecessary criminal litigations when no specific

offence is made out.

directions given by National Green Tribunal were followed by

Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.         The directions issued by

Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to Maharashtra State Road

Development Corporation Ltd, i.e., accused nos. 12 to 15. The

copy of the reminder dated 10th November, 2016 and 11th

no. 21 was sent to the Transport Commissioner, Maharashtra

12th January, 2016 given by the Scientist-II, (Environment Dept.),

Government of Maharashtra to the Commissioner of Police and

Transport Commissioner, Maharashtra and Member Secretary,

MPCB in respect of taking action pursuant to notice under <a href="/doc/125409775/" id="a_151">section

19(b)</a> of Environment (Protection) Act is also written. Another letter

of Member Secretary dated 28th February, 2017 was written by

MPCB/accused no. 21 to the complainant in response to the notice

and it is mentioned that the National Green Tribunal in its order

dated 20th January, 2017 passed in Application No. 35 of 2011 filed

by the complainant had directed the Regulatory Authorities to

comply with the directions issued by the Maharashtra Pollution

Control Board vide letter dated 29 th September, 2016                          and

accordingly all the authorities are communicated the order dated

20th January, 2017. All these documents and communication is a

part of the complaint. It shows that MPCB/accused no. 21 and

Environment Department/accused no. 19 have taken steps

pursuant to the order of National Green Tribunal. However, as

pointed out by the complainant, if at all there is air pollution or

noise pollution, then it is to be controlled,as suggested by him,

strictly compulsory that PUC and honking is required to be

monitored.

</p><p id="p_137">70.   In criminal law, it is necessary for the complainant to make

out a specific case against each accused. The general allegations

are not sufficient to issue process against any person.                     In the

present matter, the petitioners/MSRDC, i.e., nos. 12 to 15, were

not parties in Miscellaneous Application No. 202 of 2013 before the

National Green Tribunal. It is also not clear what directions were

given to these petitioners and by whom. Thus, considering the

present set of facts, as per the directions given by the National

Green Tribunal, action was taken by accused nos. 19 to 22, i.e.,

Environment Department and Maharashtra Pollution Control

Board, hence there is no material to issue process against these

petitioners under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_152">Environment Protection Act</a> or Air and Noise

(Regulation and Control) Rules. Thus, the order of issuance of

process is set aside and quashed qua the petitioners only.



</p><p id="p_138">71.   I appreciate the efforts taken by the respondent/ original

complainant for maintaining the ecological balance of this fully

crowded city.        Though the process is quashed and set aside, the

mission taken by the complainant to fight against air and noise

pollution cannot be underestimated.
