(By Sri.R.G.KOLLE, AGA FOR R.1 &amp; 3
SRI.D.NAGARAJ, ADV. FOR R.2)


     THESE WRIT PETITIONS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226
AND 227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO
QUASH THE ORDER DATED 01.09.2012 ISSUED BY THE 2ND
RESPONDENT VIDE ANNEXURES-B &amp; B1 AND DIRECT THE 3RD
RESPONDENT TO ISSUE PRESCRIBED FORM TO THE
PETITIONERS ENABLING THEM TO FILE AN APPLICATION
SEEKING GRANT OF LICENSE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE STONE
CRUSHER.
                               -3-


     THESE WRIT PETITIONS COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING THIS DAY, NAGARATHNA .J, MADE THE
FOLLOWING:


                           ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Sri.R.G.Kolle, learned AGA takes notice for respondent

nos.1 and 3.   Sri.D.Nagaraj, learned counsel takes notice for

respondent no.2. Since no prayer has been sought as against

respondent nos.4 and 5, notices to them are dispensed with.


</p><p id="p_2">      2. In these writ petitions, petitioners have assailed the

orders dated 01.09.2012 and 17.10.2012 (Annexures-B and

B1) passed by the 2nd respondent.       By the said orders, the

stone crusher units run by the petitioners have been ordered

to be closed under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">Section 31A</a> of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, read with Rule 20-A of Karnataka Air

(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1983.


</p><p id="p_3">      3. We have heard the learned counsel for parties and

perused the materials on record.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      4. As far as the closure orders are concerned, the same

cannot be adjudicated before this Court by filing Writ Petitions,

in view of the observations and directions of the Apex Court in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               -4-</span>


the case of <a href="/doc/1436850/" id="a_3">Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan

and others vs. Union of India and others</a>, (2012 (8) SCC

</p><p id="p_6">326).      Having regard to paragraphs 40 and 41 therein, the

writ petitions so far as assailing the closure orders are

concerned, are dismissed reserving liberty to the petitioners,

to adjudicate the said matter before the appropriate forum, if

they are so advised.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      5 The second prayer in these Writ Petitions is for a

direction to the 3rd respondent to issue prescribed Form to the

petitioners, in order to enable them to file applications seeking

grant of license for establishing their stone crusher units in the

safer zone. As far as this direction is concerned, Sections 3

and 4 of the Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers Act,

2011, enables the person who is carrying on the business of

stone crusher to make an application seeking grant of a

license under the provisions of the said Act.      Therefore, no

direction can be given for the petitioners to be issued with any

prescribed Form for making an application seeking grant of a

license.     It is incumbent upon the petitioners to make

appropriate applications in terms of <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_4">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_5">4</a> of the

Act read with Rules, in order to seek grant of a license for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              -5-</span>


running stone crusher units in the safer zone.   Therefore, no

direction can be given in that regard.   Liberty is reserved to

the petitioners to make appropriate applications before the 3rd

respondent, in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">     6. With the above observations, the writ petitions are

disposed of.
