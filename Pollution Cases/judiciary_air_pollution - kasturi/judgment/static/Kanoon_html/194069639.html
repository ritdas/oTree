HEADNOTE:



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">			 O R D E R
     Mr. M.C.  Mehta -	environmentalist lawyer	 - has filed
this public  interest  petition	 under	<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1">Article	 32</a>  of	 the
Constitution of	 India seeking	a direction  to the  Haryana
Pollution Control Board (the Board) to control the Pollution
caused by the stone crushers, pulverisers and mine operators
in the	Faridabad - Balabgarh area. We are in the process of
monitoring the	petition. The core question which we propose
to deal	 with  in  this	 order	is  whether  -	to  preserve
environment and	 control pollution  - the  mining operations
should be  stopped within the radius of five kilometers (km)
from the tourist resorts of Badkal lake and Surajkund in the
State of Haryana.
</p><p id="p_2">     This  Court  by  the  order  dated	 November  20,	1995
directed the  Board to	inspect and  ascertain the impact of
mining operations  on the  ecologically	 sensitive  area  of
Badkal lake and Surajkund. The inspection was done by a team
of  the	  Board	 comprising   of  Dr.  B.  Sengupta,  Senior
Scientist, Shri Lalit Kapoor, Senior Environmental Engineer,
Shri R.C. Kataria, Environmental Engineer and Dr. J. Moitra,
Scientist 'B'. The inspection report of the Board was placed
before this  Court along with an affidavit filed by Dr. S.P.
Chakrabarti,  Member   Secretary  of   the  Board.   In	 the
affidavit, regarding  the mining activities, it is stated as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "For   the	  purpose   of	 mining,
     explosives are  being used for rock
     blasting. Because	of  unscientific
     mining    operation,     overburden
     materials	(top   soil  and   murum
     remain) were  observed to	be lying
     haphazardly.   Deep    mining   for
     extracting	 silica	 sand  lumps  is
     causing  ecological   disaster   as
     these  mines  lie	unreclaimed  and
     abandoned.	 As  a	matter	of  fact
     mining site  reveals total	 lack of
     environmental planning"</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">     The  report   contains  the  following  recommendations
regarding the mining activities in the area:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     "Mining
     At present, manual as well as semi-
     mechanised mining	of  hard  stone,
     weathered	soft  stone  and  coarse
     sand in  33 mining	 area leased  by
     the State	Government of Haryana is
     operative. Explosives  are used for
     rock blasting.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     Recommendations
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     1)	 Environmental	Management  Plan
     (EMP) shall  be  prepared	by  mine
     lease holders  for their  mines and
     actual   mining	operation   made
     operative after  obtaining approval
     from  the	 State	 Department   of
     Environment   or	 Haryana   State
     Pollution	 Control    Board.   The
     Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
     should be	implemented following  a
     time-bound	  action    plan.   Land
     reclamation    and	   afforestation
     programmes shall  also be	included
     in the  EMP and must be implemented
     strictly	by    the   implementing
     authorities.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     2)	 Mining	  activities  should  be
     stopped within  a radius  of  5  km
     from Badkhal  Lake and  Suraj  Kund
     (tourist place).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     3) At present mining activities are
     going on  without obtaining consent
     as	  required    under   the    Air
     (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution)
     Act</a>, 1981,	 from the  Haryana State
     Pollution Control Board. Mine lease
     holders  shall   take   appropriate
     steps to  obtain consent  from  the
     State   Pollution	 Control   Board
     failing which  the State  Pollution
     Board shall  take necessary  action
     in this regard.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     4) The  mine owners  should  adhere
     strictly to  Mine Safety  Plan  and
     install all necessary devices.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     5) The  overburden along  with  top
     soil should  be properly  preserved
     for use  at the time of reclamation
     of abandoned mine.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     6) Use  of explosives  in the mines
     should  be	 regulated  as	per  the
     <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_3">Explosive Act</a>  and after  obtaining
     approval	from	the    Competent
     Authorities."
</blockquote><p id="p_4">This Court on March 21, 1996 noticed the statement of
Mr, Gopal Subramaniam, learned counsel appearing for the
State of Haryana in the following words:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">     "Mr. Gopal	 Subramaniam states that
     the mining	 work has stopped within
     the radius of 5 kms of Badkhal Lake
     and Suraj	Kund. We  appreciate the
     gesture of	 Haryana Government. Mr.
     Subramaniam states	 that the  steps
     to provide	 green belt in that area
     are  also	in  progress.  He  shall
     place on  record the positive steps
     which are in the contemplation."
</blockquote><p id="p_5">Mr. Shanti  Bhushan, Mr. G.L. Sanghi &amp; Mr. R.S. Suri learned
counsel	 appearing   for  the	mine  operators	  vehemently
contended before  this Court  on March	29,  1996  that	 the
mining	operations   were  closed   without  affording	 any
opportunity to	the lessees  of	 the  mines.  After  hearing
learned counsel, this Court passed the following order:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     "There is	no order  by this  Court
     directing the closure of the mines.
     Mr. Shanti Bhushan, however, states
     that in  view of  the  observations
     made by  this Court  in the earlier
     orders, the  Haryana Government has
     closed the	 mines in  the area. The
     main  contention	raised	is  that
     without hearing the mine owners and
     without	 giving	    them     any
     opportunity, the  mines  have  been
     closed. Needless to say that action
     regarding closure of the mines have
     been taken	 on  the  basis	 of  the
     report  submitted	by  the	 Central
     Pollution Control Board. Be that as
     it	 may,  we  give	 opportunity  to
     these mine-owners	to present their
     case before this Court."
</blockquote><p id="p_6">The mining operations within the radius of 5 kms from Badkal
lake and Surajkund were stopped by the Haryana Government on
the basis  of the recommendation made by the Board. The mine
operators  through  their  learned  counsel  raised  serious
objection to the recommendation of the Board seeking closure
of the	mining	operations  within  the	 radius	 of  5	kms.
According to  learned counsel  the pollution  generated,  if
any, by the mining activities cannot go beyond a distance of
one km	and as such the closure of the mines within the area
of 5  kms was  wholly unjustified.  It was  suggested by the
learned counsel	 that another opinion in this respect may be
obtained from an expert body like the National Environmental
Engineering Research  Institute (NEERI). This Court on April
12, 1996 passed the following order:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     "We have  heard learned counsel for
     the parties.  We are  of  the  view
     that it would be useful to have the
     expert  opinion   of  the	National
     Environmental Engineering	Research
     Institute on  the point whether the
     mining operations	in the said area
     are to  be stopped	 in the interest
     of	   Environmental     Protection,
     Pollution	 Control   and	 Tourism
     Development.  If	so  whether  the
     limit should be five kms. or less.
	  We,  therefore,   request  Dr.
     Khanna to	send an	 inspection team
     to the  area  concerned  preferably
     within next  week	to  examine  the
     question of  closure of  the  mines
     from the  environment and pollution
     point of  view. The team shall also
     examine the  working of  the  stone
     crushers  and  pulverisers	 in  the
     area.  Initially  report  regarding
     mines may	be filed. We request Dr.
     Khanna to	have the report filed in
     this Court within ten days."
</blockquote><p id="p_7">The NEERI has filed its inspection report dated 20, 1996.
</p><p id="p_8">     We have heard learned counsel for the mine operators at
length.
</p><p id="p_9">     The two  tourist places, Surajkund and Badkal lake, are
located in  Faridabad district of Haryana State and are at a
distance of  about 18/24  kms. from  New Delhi.	 Because  of
their proximity	 to the	 capital city of India these resorts
have a great tourist potential. We may refer to the relevant
parts of the NEERI report:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">     "Air Quality Monitoring was carried
     out by  the Inspection  Team at one
     working  mine   beyond  5	km  from
     Badkal lake  and Surajkund	 area to
     assess the	 extent of air pollution
     from   the	   mining    activities,
     overburden loading and haulage, and
     to determine  fugitive emissions of
     Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">     One    monitoring	  station    was
     established in  upwind direction at
     a	distance   of  300   m,	 whereas
     another  monitoring   station   was
     located in	 downwind  direction  at
     50m distance  from the  face of the
     mine. The mining activity was being
     carried out  in an	 area of  0.75 x
     1.0 km2. The air quality monitoring
     was conducted for four hours during
     mining  operations.   The	blasting
     operation also  took  place  during
     the air  quality monitoring. At the
     upwind and	 downwind stations,  SPM
     concentrations were  observed to be
     124 and 416 ug/m3 respectively. The
     contribution from mining activities
     was 292 ug/m3.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	  Fugitive     air     pollutant
     emission rate  of	SPM  for  mining
     activities was also estimated using
     upwind-downwind   technique.    The
     fugitive emission	rate  was  30.26
     gm/sec for	 production of 4000 tons
     of stones during four hours.
	  Noise levels	were measured by
     inspection team at the working mine
     beyond 5  kms from Badkal lake. The
     noise levels were observed to be in
     the range	of 52-80  dBA. The noise
     levels  were  also	 measured  at  a
     distance of  500 m	 away  from  the
     working mine,  and it  was observed
     to be equal to the background noise
     level of  40-42 dBA.  Noise  levels
     were also measured during blasting,
     when 820  gms of explosive was used
     in four  holes of	1.2 m depth. The
     maximum noise level of 59.5 dBA was
     recorded at  a distance  of  500  m
     from the blast site. "
</blockquote><p id="p_10">The following recommendations have been made by the NEERI in
the report:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">     "6.1 Mining
     6.1.1     Detailed	     exploratory
     operations need to be undertaken to
     facilitate	  the	 estimation   of
     reserves in  the  region,	and  for
     scientific	 management   of  mining
     operations.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">     6.1.2 The mine lease owners need to
     undertake the  mining operations in
     series, i.e. mining activities must
     be completed to full potential in a
     block before  moving to  the  next.
     This will	help in	 reclamation  of
     land in  the block	 in which mining
     operations have been completed.
     6.1.3 All	the mine  lease	 holders
     need  to  prepare	detailed  mining
     plans, and	 obtain approvals before
     the actual	 mining	 operations  are
     initiated.	 The  implementation  of
     approved mining  plans by	the mine
     lease holders  needs to  be ensured
     by	 a   designated	 authority  with
     specialization in environment.
     6.1.4 The mine lease holders should
     also prepare mine safety plans, and
     ensure  installation  of  necessary
     devices  for   protection	of  mine
     workers.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">     6.1.5 In  view of	the observations
     made by  the Archaeological  Survey
     of India  (ASI) on the availability
     of	 stone	 age  tools   and  other
     historic remains, ASI needs to work
     in	 collaboration	 with  the  mine
     lease holders  on matters	relating
     to excavation operations.
     6.1.6  Dust   suppression	measures
     like sprinkling of water on haulage
     roads  and	  overburden  dumps  and
     other areas  need to be implemented
     by mine lease holders.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">     6.1.7 In order to minimize the dust
     pollution caused  due to  vehicular
     traffic,	it   is	  necessary   to
     initiate a number of measures, e.g.
     an alternate  by pass  road must be
     laid to  insure  that  no	vehicles
     pass through  the area  within 1 km
     radial distance  from the periphery
     of the lakes.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">     6.1.8 It  is necessary  to minimize
     the    duration	 of	blasting
     operations.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">     6.1.9 Necessary  measures	must  be
     initiated by  the	Haryana	 Tourism
     Department to  protect the	 quality
     of lake  waters, and  to  eliminate
     the non-point sources of pollution.
     6.1.10.The Environmental Management
     Plans (EMP) being formulated by the
     mine  owners  should  include  land
     rejuvenation   and	   afforestation
     programmes,  and	other	measures
     necessary to protect the quality of
     the environment  and human	 health.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">     The   mining    operations	  should
     commence only after the approval of
     EMPs by  a designated  authority. A
     time bound	 action plan needs to be
     initiated for the implementation of
     the  measures   delineated	 in  the
     Environmental Management Plans.
     6.1.11. In	 order	to  protect  the
     Surajkund and  Badkal lakes and the
     associated tourist complexes, it is
     necessary to  develop and implement
     scientifically designed  greenbelts
     around  these  complexes,	as  also
     around  boundaries	  of   different
     mining blocks.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">     6.1.12. Greenbelt	should	also  be
     developed and implemented on either
     side of  the roads	 in  the  mining
     area and  Surajkund-Badkal road  to
     minimize the  effects of  dust  and
     noise pollution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">     6.1.13. The question of lifting the
     ban on  mining operations	needs to
     be considered  in conjunction  with
     the  implementation   of  stringent
     pollution	     control,	    land
     reclamation, greenbelt,  and  other
     Environmental  Management	measures

<p id="p_12">     The two expert opinions - by the Board and by the NEERI
</p><p id="p_13">- leave	 no doubt  in our mind that the mining activities in
the vicinity  of tourist  resorts are  bound to cause severe
impact on  the local  ecology. The  mining brings  extensive
alteration in  the natural  land profile  of the area. Mined
pits and  unattended  dumps  of	 overburdened,	left  behind
during	the   mining  operations,   are	  the	irreversible
consequences  of   the	mining	operations.  Rock  blasting,
movement of  heavy vehicles,  movements	 and  operations  of
mining equipment  and machinery cause considerable pollution
in the	shape of noise and vibration. The ambient air in the
mining area  gets highly  polluted by  the dust generated by
the	blasting     operations,     vehicular	   movement;
loading/unloading/transportation and  the exhaust gases from
equipment and machinery used in the mining operations.
</p><p id="p_14">     The  Board	  has  notified	  the  Ambient	Air  Quality
Standards by  the Notification	dated April  11,  1994.	 The
notification fixes limiting standards of pollutants (Sulphur
Dioxide, Oxides	 of Nitrogen,  Suspended Particulate matter,
Respirable Particulate	Matter, Lead and Carbon Monoxide) in
respect	  of   sensitive   areas,   industrial	 areas	 and
residential,  rural  and  other	 areas.	 The  standards	 for
sensitive areas	 are stringent than the standards prescribed
for  industrial	  and  residential   areas.  The  Board	 has
recommended that the area of 5 kms around the periphery of a
centre of tourism be notified as sensitive area.
</p><p id="p_15">     The Badkhal  lake and  Surajkund are  monsoon-fed water
bodies. The natural drainage pattern of the surrounding hill
areas feed  these water	 bodies	 during	 rainy	season.	 The
mining activities  in the  vicinity of these tourist resorts
may disturb  the rain  water drains  which in turn may badly
affect the water level as well as the water quality of these
water bodies. The mining may also cause fractures and cracks
in the	subsurface, rock  layer causing	 disturbance to	 the
aquifers which	are the	 source of  ground water.  This	 may
disturb the hydrology of the area.
</p><p id="p_16">     We are,  therefore,  of  the  view	 that  in  order  to
preserve  environment	and  control  pollution	 within	 the
vicinity of  the two tourist resorts it is necessary to stop
mining in the area. The question, however, for consideration
is what	 should be the extent of the said area? NEERI in its
report has  recommended	 that  200  metres  green  belts  be
developed at  1 km  radius all	around the boundaries of the
two lakes. It is thus obvious that twelve hundred meters are
required for  the green belts. Leaving another 800 meters as
a cushion to absorb the air and noise pollution generated by
the mining  operations, we  are of the view that it would be
reasonable to  direct the stoppage of mining activity within
two  km	 radius	 of  the  tourist  resorts  of	Badkhal	 and
Surajkund. We, therefore, order and direct as under:
</p><p id="p_17">1. There  shall be  no mining activity within 2 km radius of
the tourist  resorts of Badkhal and Surajkund. All the mines
which fall within the said radius shall not be reopened.
</p><p id="p_18">2. The	Forest Department  of the  State of  Haryana and  in
particular the	Chief Conservator  and the  District  Forest
Officer, Faridabad  shall undertake  to	 develop  the  green
belts as  recommended by  NEERI with  immediate effect.	 The
NEERI has  also suggested  the development plan and the type
of trees  to be	 planted. We direct the Chief Conservator of
Forests, Haryana, District Forest Officer, Faridabad and all
other concerned	 officers or  the Forest Department to start
the plantation	of tree	 for developing	 the green belts and
make all efforts to complete the plantations of trees before
the monsoon (1996).
</p><p id="p_19">3. We  direct the Director, Mining and Geology, Haryana, the
Haryana	 Pollution   Control  Board   to  enforce   all	 the
recommendations of NEERI contained in para 6.1 of its report
(quoted above)	so far as the mining operations in the State
of Haryana  are concerned.  All the mines operators shall be
given notices  to implement he said recommendations. Failing
to comply with the recommendations may result the closure of
the mining operations.
</p><p id="p_20">4. We  further direct that no construction of any type shall
be permitted  now on wards within 5 km radius of the Badkhal
Lake and  Surajkund. All  open areas shall be converted into
green belts.
</p><p id="p_21">5. The	mining leases  within the  area from  2 km  to 5  km
radius shall  not be  renewed without  obtaining  prior	 "no
objection" certificate	from the  Haryana Pollution  Control
Board as  also from  the Central  Pollution  Control  Board.
Unless both  the Boards	 grant no  objection certificate the
mining leases in the said area shall not be renewed.
