      energy in the State. The Appellant proposed to set up solar power

      plants of varied capacity using solar photovoltaic ("PV") technology

      in the State in consonance with the new solar initiative. One of the

      aspects of the State Government's Policy was to encourage setting

      up of solar plants and fixation of tariff at a nominal rate with respect

      to solar power, wherein solar PV technology is used.

       Regulations, 2008, the control period of the tariff was fixed as one

       year from the date of the order, and the format for the Energy

       Purchase Agreement ("EPA") was to be determined by State

     Solar Tariff Order, specifically with regard to the issue of control

     period. All such review petitions were dismissed by the State

     Commission. However, in light of the emergent situation, the State

     Commission, suomotu, initiated proceedings to consider extension

     proposed 72 MW solar PV power plant and the sanctioned

     Kamuthi 400/230-110 KV SS. The above grid connectivity was to

     be effected only after commissioning of sanctioned new Kamuthi

4.1    The Appellants have installed Solar PV projects with an installed
       capacity of 288 MW at an aggregate capital investment of
       Rs.1887.76 Crores, relying on the promises held out by the
       Respondents re. tariff in terms of:-

          2014, amended vide Order dated 01.04.2015), wherein tariff of
          Rs.    7.01   per   unit   was   fixed   for   solar   power     plants
          commissioned upto 31.03.2016 (i.e. within the control period

4.3. Once the connectivity to the promised evacuation facility was
      made available by TANGEDCO, the Appellants were able to
      commence commercial operations from 18.09.2016.Yet, the

      5.10/unitin    terms    of      TNERC   Solar   Tariff   Order     dated
      28.03.2016.Being aggrieved, the Appellants filed respective
      Petitions before TNERC, seeking appropriate relief in the following
      terms:-
</p>
<p id="p_64">(a)   TANGEDCO should pay tariff as per the TNERC Solar Tariff Order
      dated 12.09.2014 since the Appellants had fulfilled all their
      obligations with respect to commissioning of the plant within the
      control period of TNERC's Comprehensive Tariff Order dated
      12.09.2014, and it was TANGEDCO that failed to back charge the
      plants by connecting it to evacuation system within the control
      period. The 400kV new Kamuthi substation to which the
      Appellants' projects were to be connected for evacuation of power,
      was not available when the Appellants' projects were ready for
      commissioning i.e. 15.03.2016 (216 MW) and 22.03.2016 (72
      MW). As such the Appellants' cannot be made to suffer for delay
      that was beyond their control.
</p>
<p id="p_65">(b)   In terms of Clause 5 of EPA and the Comprehensive Tariff Order
      dated 12.09.2014 the Appellants' solar power projects are entitled
      to a tariff of Rs. 7.01/unit.
</p>
<p id="p_66">      By the Impugned Orders, TNERC refused to entertain the Petitions
      filed by the Appellants on the ground that the issue involved in the
      Petitions is not regulatory in nature. TNERC has directed that the
      Petitions be registered as a Dispute Resolution Petition ("DRP")
      and not as a Miscellaneous Petition ("MP"), relying on the TNERC

</p><p id="p_67">- Fees and Fines Regulations, 2004 as amended from time to time
("Fees and Fines Regulations"). The relevant extract of the
Impugned Order in Appeal No. 31 of 2016 (identical to Appeal No.
32 of 2016) is as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_68">"3.5. In this connection, it is necessary to elaborate on the nature
of Dispute Resolutions. A Dispute Resolution Petition is one which
is taken up upon a motion made by either of the parties i.e. the
Petitioner or the Licensee for resolution of a dispute.
...
</p><p id="p_69">3.6 It may be seen from the express provision in <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_9">section 86</a> (1)
</p><p id="p_70">(f), the Commission is empowered to adjudicate all disputes
between the Licensees and Generating Companies and hence any
dispute between a Licensee and a generating company, or
generating companies or Licensees inter se whether such dispute
relates to a period anterior to the signing of PPA or posterior to the
signing of PPA can be adjudicated only by the Commission.
3.7. Having held so, the short question which arises for
consideration in this petition is whether the prayers of the
Petitioner as set out in para 1 herein are in the nature of dispute
resolution. It may be seen from the prayers of the Petitioner that
there are prayers such as (a) to declare that the Petitioner's 72
MW Solar Project, was commissioned on or before March 31,
2016, (b) to declare that the Petitioner's Solar Power Project is
entitled to a tariff of Rs.7.01 per unit which in our view, are in the
nature of dispute resolution as they involve monetary claims
between the Licensee and the Generator. Needless to say, any
monetary claim cannot be adjudicated without resorting to
appropriate dispute resolution mechanism. Any order passed
without following the required procedures would not be in
consonance with the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_10">section 86</a> (1) (f) of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_11">Electricity Act</a>, 2003.
Though the Petitioner seeks to contend that the prayers are of
miscellaneous nature, the fact remains that the prayers herein are
clothed with the attributes of dispute resolution. Without hearing
the response of the Licensee the issues raised in this petition
cannot be disposed on merit...."

4.4   It is submitted that the Impugned Order has decided the nature of
the Petition based on the Fees and Fines Regulations, rather than
actually analysing the nature of the issues involved. The aforesaid
findings are based on an incorrect interpretation of the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_12">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 ("<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_13">Electricity Act</a>") as well as the Fees and Fines
Regulations. In passing the Impugned Orders, TNERC has failed to
appreciate that:-
</p>
<p id="p_72">(a)   The Appellants' were ready for commissioning their projects well
      before 31.03.2016 (within the control period of Comprehensive
      Tariff Order).To this effect, respective certificates were issued by
      Chief Electrical Inspector on 22.03.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_73">(b)   TANGEDCO has never challenged the authenticity of the Chief
      Electrical Inspector's certificates declaring that the Appellants'
      plant was ready for commissioning on 22.03.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_74">(c)   TANGEDCO was admittedly unable to construct the sub-station for
      connectivity and declined the Appellants' request for providing
      alternative connectivity effectively bottling up installed solar
      capacity. In such a scenario, Appellants have invoked regulatory
      powers of TNERC, to declare commissioning of its power projects.
</p>
<p id="p_75">(d)   Declaration of successful commissioning of the projects does not
      constitute a lis which can be mutually settled between the parties.
      TNERC has the power to grant the relief sought for, by exercising
      its regulatory functions.

<p id="p_76">4.5   The Appellants regret to point out that TNERC issued such a
      direction when it was not discharging its adjudicatory functions
      under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_14">Section 86(1)(f)</a> of the Electricity Act as is evident from the
      tabulated sequence of events.To date there is no clarity as to if

      and when the judicial member shall be appointed. It is noteworthy
      that simultaneously TNERC was entertaining other matters re.
      Solar projects which involved issues of MUST RUN Status and
      compensation for BACKING DOWN. It is submitted that this
      incongruent stance of TNERC has led to a delay of three years in
      grant of relief to the Appellants, who have suffered adverse
      financial impact on account of the said delay.
</p>
<p id="p_77">A.    The present case is to be decided by exercise of regulatory
      powers.
</p>
<p id="p_78">Re.   Regulatory and Adjudicatory functions of the Commission

4.6   The position stated above is borne out by the fact that the Solar
      Tariff Orders issued by TNERC on 12.09.2014, 01.04.2015,
      28.03.2016     et.al.    contains    and     deals     with      several
      comments/objections of the public to the proposed tariff. Yet, the
      Solar Tariff Order was NOT been issued under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_15">Section 86(1)(f)</a>.
      Mere raising of objections by Respondents did not convert the
      matter into "adjudicatory" in those case. As such, perhaps raising
      of objections is not a conclusive of a matter being adjudicatory.
      TNERC in exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_16">Sections 14</a> and <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_17">62</a>
      regularly undertakes exercises of grant of license and tariff
      determination respectively, through a public consultation process.
      Should the view taken by TNERC be accepted, every time an
      objection is raised by a stakeholder in a public hearing (even in
      cases involving <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_18">Section 14</a> and <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_19">62</a>), it shall become a dispute and
      there will be no effective "regulatory powers". It is submitted:-

<p id="p_85">(a)   <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_39">The Electricity Act</a> was enacted to address problems of

<p id="p_86">(b)   In this background, independent regulators were appointed, vested
      with diverse roles i.e., grant of licence, determining tariff, regulating
      diverse activities, establishing and enforcing standards, conducting
      investigation, enforcing laws, adjudicating upon disputes and
      advising on policy making.[Ref. - <a href="/doc/1152518/" id="a_44">L. Chandra Kumar vs. Union of

              statutory and regulated contracts.
</p>
<p id="p_91">(c)   It is noteworthy that, Parliament has used different words in
      different provisions to signify different functions of the regulator.
      For example -
</p>
<p id="p_92">      (i)     <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_51">Section 86(1)(a)</a> of the Electricity Act empowers the State

<p id="p_93">      (ii)    <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_52">Section 86(1)(b)</a> empowers the State Commission to

              the generating companies and distribution licensees through
              agreements for power produced for distribution and supply.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      powers of the Commission. De-hors the legislative context and
      scheme, the traditional definition of 'lis' can be extended to cover
      each of the 11 functions listed in Section 86(1) whenever the
      related proceedings involve a claim and a denial on such claim. It
      does not appear to be the legislative intent behind the Act to club
      everything under 'adjudicatory' function thereby rendering the
      other functions nugatory. As such, the implementation of
      obligations of the Procurer to grant connectivity to enable a solar
      generator to commission and to evacuate power must be seen as
      a regulatory function in terms of IEGC read with State Grid Code,
      Tamil Nadu Solar Policy and the Energy Purchase Agreements.

      with it, full power over the thing subject to regulation and in

Watchdog &amp; Ors. vs. CERC &amp; Ors. (2017) 14 SCC 80, has held that
Regulatory Commissions can exercise their general regulatory powers in
the absence of any guidelines. Evidently, this is a fit case where TNERC
ought to have exercised its regulatory powers, for granting relief to the
Appellants, and declaring applicability of tariff of Rs. 7.01 per unit.

convert the matter into dispute under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_54">Section 86(1)(f)</a> of the Electricity

</p><p id="p_101">(b)   It has been wrongly observed by TNERC that since the matter

      It is a settled position that even in exercise of regulatory powers
      the Commission is required to observe principles of natural justice.
      (eg. In tariff determination, TNERC is required to afford an
      opportunity of hearing to the consumers who may like to raise
      objections)

Re.   Fees and Fines Regulations.
</p>
<p id="p_102">4.10 TNERC further fell into error in attempting to decide the nature of
      the proceedings on the basis of which classification shall attract
      higher fees under the Fees and Fines Regulations. It is submitted
      that TNERC has not considered that the determinative factor will
      be the claim and the relief sought . TNERC was required to decide
      the nature of the Petition by appreciating the nature of prayers
      sought in the Petition and then accordingly, the fees would have
      been paid as per the Fees and Fines Regulations.

<p id="p_103">4.11 In view of the aforesaid provisions, it is clear that the Statutory

      ought to have considered the nuanced difference between
      regulatory and adjudicatory powers vested with State Electricity
      Regulatory Commissions, which have been specifically invoked by

4.12 It is submitted that while passing the Impugned Order, TNERC has
      failed to take note of the fact that the Appellants' had completed
      their projects well in time. It was TANDEGCO's failure to provide
      the evacuation facility in time (before 31.03.2016) which now
      seeks to take advantage of its own wrong. In this regard,

     judgement in DERC v. BSES Yamuna Power Ltd. &amp; Ors. (2007) 3
     SCC 33 is noteworthy wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
     held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_113">     "42....In the present case, DERC was required to consider the
     effect of its decision. Privatisation and disinvestment were the
     policy decisions taken by GoNCTD. The utilities were incurring
     losses. The assets of the utilities were getting depleted. The
     public-private participation is the order of the day. Therefore, the
     Policy Directions invited bids from the private sector on the basis
     of certain assurances. Under the above circumstances, on the
     facts of the present case, legitimate expectation was built into the
     investments made by the DISCOMs herein. The representations
     were there in the Policy Directions, BST Order laying down
     normative principles for tariff fixation for 5 years and the Transfer
     Scheme. Drawing up of tariff for 5 years was to impart certainty.
     ...In other words, what is given by one hand is taken away by the
     other. In other words, the return on the total package becomes
     illusory if the rate of depreciation is reduced from 6.69% to 3.75%.
     The certainty for 5 years is also obliterated for reducing the rate of
     depreciation. This violation also infringes the doctrine of legitimate
     expectation of the DISCOMs to get lawful and reasonable recovery
     of expenditure. DERC was expected to fix the rate in the context of
     the policy of privatisation. The object behind fixation of principles
     for 5 years was to impart certainty and consistency in tariff
     designing, putting the prospective investors to notice regarding
     their tariff entitlements for 5 years and to provide a level playing
     field to the DISCOMs to compete with other competitors in the
     electricity industry.... "

      consequently, the lower tariff of Rs.         5.10 has been made

      of legitimate expectation is squarely applicable to the Appellants'
      case, and the Appellants' are entitled to the tariff of Rs. 7.01/unit,

</p>

<p id="p_176">      (a) MUST RUN status, which was the bone of contention in the
            proceedings pursued through Appeals No. 350-351-352 of
            2017, is NOT an issue in the present proceedings.
</p>

<p id="p_177">      (b) Project specific extension of control period is a feature of the
            present proceedings; but not so in the earlier batch of Appeals.
</p>

<p id="p_178">      (c) Allegations of delay on the part of the State Utilities for
            providing   evacuation     facilities   leading     to    delay      in

            feature of the instant batch of Appeals.

         352 of 2017 was entertained by the Respondent Commission.
         There is no such similarity of any previous petitions with
         identical prayer treated earlier by the Commission as
         Miscellaneous Petitions pertaining to Appeals No.31 and 32 of
         2017.
</p>

<p id="p_181">5.7 From the foregoing, it is evident that the conclusions drawn by this
    Appellate Tribunal in the earlier batch of Appeals No. 350-351-352
    of 2017 do not apply to the instant Appeals on all the fours.
</p>

<p id="p_182">5.8 Respondent Commission respectfully submits that as in the
    previous batch of Appeals, the Appellant had tried to raise the issue
    of distinction between Regulatory Vs Adjudicatory functions the
    Respondent Commission in the instant batch of Appeals as well. It
    is respectfully submitted that irrespective of whether the issues
    involved fall under regulatory or adjudicatory functions of the
    Respondent Commission, what is relevant and significant is whether
    at all, there is a dispute involved in the issues raised in the
    proceedings     before   the   Respondent     Commission.       In   this
    connection, the Respondent Commission respectfully submit the
    following:
</p>

<p id="p_183">    (a) Neither the Fees and Fines Regulations nor any other
         regulation defines any category of proceedings such as
         Regulatory or Adjudicatory.
</p>

<p id="p_184">    (b) In the absence of any formal definition, the phrase "Dispute
         Resolution Petition" is to be understood in its dictionary
         meaning.

</p><p id="p_186">      (c) Whether there was a dispute between the parties to the
          proceedings is to be inferred from the pleadings and
          background of the case.
</p>

<p id="p_187">      (d) If a dispute between the parties can be inferred from the
          pleadings and background of the case, it is immaterial whether
          the issue raised in the proceedings fall under the Regulatory or
          Adjudicatory functions of the Respondent Commission.
</p>

<p id="p_188">5.9    It may be seen from the petition filed by the Appellant before the
       Respondent Commission that the Appellant Petitioner's effort was
       to secure a declaration that the Power Project was commissioned
       on or before 31 March 2016 and consequently claim tariff @ Rs.
       7.01 per unit. This was resisted by the respondents before the
       Commission.
</p>

<p id="p_189">5.10 That there was a serious dispute between the parties before the
       Respondent Commission is evident, inter alia, from the following
       averments in the Petition filed by the Appellant before the
       Respondent Commission:
</p>
<p id="p_190">      (a) In Para 13 of the Petition before the Respondent Commission,
          the Appellant Petitioner had stated that "........The
          Respondents were entirely responsible for the Commissioning
          of the sub-station ...... However, TANGEDCO was not acting
          with the same vigour and speed to enable completion of the
          construction of the evacuation facilities...."
</p>
<p id="p_191">      (b) In para 14 of the Petition before the Respondent Commission,
          the Appellant had averred that ".......The Petitioner's plant was
          ready for commissioning by 22.03.2016. However, the

                                                            A.Nos. 31 &amp; 32 of 2017



        Respondents failed to commission the 110 kv substation at
        Kamuthi ...."
</p>
<p id="p_192">    (c) In para 16 of the Petition before the Respondent Commission
        the Appellant had alleged that "...... the non-evacuation of
        power is on account of complete inaction on the part of
        TANGEDCO...."
</p>
<p id="p_193">    (d) In para 17 of the Petition before the Respondent Commission
        the Appellant had alleged ".... TANGEDCO failed to accede to
        the Petitioner's request for issuing Deemed Commissioning
        certificate as of 31.03.2016. ....... It is stated that the Petitioner
        promptly replied to the letter on 09.05.2016 denying that the
        Petitioner's plant was incomplete and reiterating that the project
        was ready for commissioning." (Emphasis supplied).
</p>
<p id="p_194">    (e) In para 18 of the Petition before the Respondent Commission
        the Appellant had contended that "......the 1st Respondent
        ought to have enabled evacuation within the control period. The
        Respondents have failed to discharge their obligations in
        terms of the Energy Purchase Agreement dated 04.07.2015.
        ....." (Emphasis supplied)

5.11 In this connection the Respondent Commission craves leave to
     clause 11 of the Energy Purchase Agreement between the
     Appellant and TANGEDCO annexed as Annexure A/7 to the
     Appeal No. 31 of 2017 which is extracted hereunder for ease of
     reference:
</p>

<p id="p_195">     "If any dispute or difference of any kind whatsoever arises between
     the parties relating to this agreement, it shall in the first instance be
     settled amicably, by the parties, failing which either party may
     approach the Commission for the adjudication of such dispute
     under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_88">section 86(1)</a> (f) of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_89">Electricity Act</a>, 2003. In accordance
     with Conduct of Business Regulations 2004 of the Commission.

     This agreement shall be governed by the laws of India and the
     Courts at Chennai alone shall have jurisdiction."
</p>

<p id="p_197">5.12 From the foregoing, it is evident that by the Appellant's own
     contention, there was a dispute between the Appellant and
     TANGEDCO and the Respondent Commission was approached
     for adjudication of such dispute. Having invoked the adjudicatory
     function of the Respondent Commission, the Appellant is estopped
     from contending that the proceedings came under the Regulatory
     functions of the Respondent Commission, much less that the issue
     did not involve dispute resolution.
</p>

<p id="p_198">5.13 Respondent Commission further submits that the following
     grounds urged in the Petition before it also affirms the conclusion
     that the Appellant was raising a Dispute before the Respondent
     Commission:
</p>

<p id="p_199">    (a) Ground II: TANGEDCO cannot be Permitted to Benefit from its
        own Wrong


</p><p id="p_200">    (b) Ground IV: TANGEDCO Will not Suffer Prejudice if the
        Petitioner is Granted a Tariff of Rs. 7.01 a Unit


</p><p id="p_201">    (c) Ground     V:   TANGEDCO       Cannot    Arbitrarily      Discriminate
        Between Projects that Would Result in Prejudice to Equally
        Situate Persons




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                                                     Page 42 of 60</span>
                                                            A.Nos. 31 &amp; 32 of 2017



</p><p id="p_202">     (d) Ground VI: TANGEDCO's Actions have the Potential to
           Seriously and Detrimentally Affect the Very Viability of the
           Petitioner's Project


5.14 It is evident that all the above grounds amount to levelling of
      serious allegations on the contesting party and give rise to keen
      disputes.
</p>

<p id="p_203">5.16 Before parting, the Respondent Commission respectfully submits
      that the crux of the issue in these proceedings relates to the effort
      of the Appellant to get entitled for Tariff of Rs. 7.01 per unit for the
      Solar power generated from its 72 MW plants as against Rs. 5.10
      per unit prevailing on the date of its commissioning. If the
      Appellant Petitioner were to file a Dispute Resolution Petition, it
      would be required to file Court Fee to the tune of approximately
      Rs. Twenty Lakh. Allowing the Appellant to get the issue resolved
      through a Miscellaneous Petition would result in loss of about Rs.
      Twenty lakh to the public exchequer.
</p>

<p id="p_204">6.    Submissions of the Respondent No. 2 and 3.
</p>

<p id="p_205">6.1 The grievance of the appellant is that the application of the

        no dispute with regard to the date of commissioning of the
        appellant's power plant.

         which is well within the powers of the Regulatory Commission
         in terms of Regulation 48 of (Conduct of Business) Regulations

</p><p id="p_214">    (vii) The Regulatory Commission should not have directed
          conversion of the petition filed by the appellant invoking the
          regulatory power into a Dispute Resolution Petition despite the
          fact that the Regulatory Commission had given an undertaking
          before the High Court that it will not take a dispute resolution
          petitions pending disposal of the writ petitions before the
          Madras High Court.

    filed by it before a Regulator Commission was under the regulatory
    jurisdiction of the Commission and not under the adjudicatory

    prayers sought by the appellant before the Regulatory Commission.

the undertaking given by the appellant dated 16.06.2015 wherein
the appellant had given an undertaking that it will not claim any
deemed generation or any other benefit whatsoever from the
distribution licensee, in case the transmission licensee could not
commission the proposed 400 KV SS at Kamuthi, Ramanad District
even though the project of the appellant is complete well in
advance. The letter states that:
</p>
<p id="p_225">"In such of those letters issued during the last 10 days or before
31.03.2016, your group companies fourth and fifth have also
specifically claimed that the projects are ready for commissioning.
On a thorough field verification, it was revealed that the project
works were not in complete shape and were not ready for
commissioning. Besides, your request to take lines by crossing the
  road is still to be approved by the Government of Tamil Nadu. It is
not known to the TANGEDCO, how your group companies fourth
and fifth had claimed that they were ready for commissioning
without obtaining permission to lay lines by crossing the road from
the Government. The above said factual position clearly falsifies
fourth and fifth of your group companies claim of ready for
commissioning of the subject plants"
</p>
<p id="p_226">  In the second last paragraph of the same letter, the distribution
licensee specifically stated that:

"TANGEDCO it has not even stated at any point of time the
proposed date of commissioning of sanctioned Kamuthi 400 KV SS
and associated transmission network and in any case has never
guaranteed that the commissioning of Kamuthi 400 to be SS will be
prior to 31.03.2016 so as to achieve probable date of
commissioning of the SPG prior to 31.03.2016."
</p>
<p id="p_228">Annexure A-12 is the letter of the appellant dated 09.05.2016,
apparently, the appellant disputes the contention of the distribution
licensee that there was never a guarantee given by the distribution
licensee that the commissioning of Kamuthi 400 KV SS will be prior
to 31.03.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_229"> Paragraph 2 of the same letter contends that the understanding of
parties was that the commissioning of 400 KV SS and providing
connectivity to the projects would be done within the control period.
This again is contrary to what is contended and stated by the
distribution licensee in the second last paragraph of its letter dated
15.04.2016.
</p>

<p id="p_230"> At paragraph 6, the appellant disputes the contention of the
distribution licensee that the projects of fourth and fifth group of
companies of the appellant were not ready for commissioning. The
appellant in letter dated 09.05.2016 only refers to the approval
dated 22.03.2016, which is a conditional approval. Further the
appellant in reply to the specific contention of the distribution
licensee that -- Besides, your request to take lines by crossing the
road is still to be approved by the Government of Tamil Nadu." --
states that the project is complete in all respect and it had not made
any false self-declaration.

6.4    The facts stated in the above prargraph establish that there exist
       more than one dispute. (i) Whether the conditions stipulated in
       conditional approval dated 22.03.2016 were complied with to the
       satisfaction of the Chief Electrical Inspector; (ii) Whether approval
       of Government of Tamil Nadu was obtained by the appellant for
       taking the 33 KV cable across the public road; (iii) Whether the
       undertaking given by the appellant is to be read as contended by
       the appellant or as contended by the distribution licensee; (iv)
       Whether the project is complete as contended by the appellant as
       on 31.03.2016 or incomplete as contended by the distribution
       licensee.
</p>

<p id="p_232">6.5 Apart from the above factual disputes spelt out from the
      correspondences between the appellant and the distribution
      licensee, marked as annexures, the contention and prayer of the
      appellant to its entitlement for project specific extension of the
      control period from 31/03/2016 till the date of interconnection of the
      appellant's 72 MW project to the grid by Respondent No. 2, in order
      for Respondent No. 2 to pay the petitioner the tariff of rupees and
      7.01 unit is not a regulatory issue as contended by the appellant in
      the petition before the Regulatory Commission and before this
      Appellate Tribunal. Extension of control period of a generic tariff for
      a particular project is not contemplated under any of the
      Regulations of TNERC.
</p>

<p id="p_233">6.6 The above prayer of the appellant is not maintainable in view of the
      law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Gujarat Urja Vikas

<a href="/doc/149053996/" id="a_95">Nigam Ltd. v. Solar Semiconductor Power Co. (India) (P) Ltd</a>.,
(2017) 16 SCC 498 : 2017 SCC OnLine SC 1248 at page 533 ---
</p>

<p id="p_234">"60. In the case at hand, rights and obligations of the parties flow
from the terms and conditions of the Power Purchase Agreement
(PPA). PPA is a contract entered between GUVNL and the first
respondent with clear understanding of the terms of the contract. A
contract, being a creation of both the parties, is to be interpreted by
having due regard to the actual terms settled between the parties.
As per the terms and conditions of the PPA, to have the benefit of
the tariff rate at Rs 15 per unit for twelve years, the first respondent
should commission the solar PV power project before 31-12-2011. It
is a complex fiscal decision consciously taken by the parties. In the
contract involving rights of GUVNL and ultimately the rights of the
consumers to whom the electricity is supplied, the Commission
cannot invoke its inherent jurisdiction to substantially alter the terms
of the contract between the parties so as to prejudice the interest
of GUVNL and ultimately the consumers.
</p>


<p id="p_235">61. As pointed out earlier, the Appellate Tribunal has taken the view
that the control period of the Tariff Order was fixed by the State
Commission itself and hence the State Commission has inherent
power to extend the control period of the Tariff Order. It may be that
the tariff rate as per Tariff Order, 2010 as determined by the
Committee has been incorporated in Clause 5.2 of the PPA. But that
does not in any manner confer power upon the State Commission to
exercise its inherent jurisdiction to extend the control period to the
advantage of the project proponent, first respondent and to the
disadvantage of GUVNL who are governed by the terms and
conditions of the contract. It is not within the powers of the
Commission to exercise its inherent jurisdiction to extend the control
period to the advantage of any party and to the disadvantage of the
other would amount to varying the terms of the contract between the
parties."

      "68. In exercise of its statutory power, under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_96">Section 62</a> of the
     Electricity Act, the Commission has fixed the tariff rate. The word
     "tariff" has not been defined in the Act. Tariff means a schedule of
     standard/prices or charges provided to the category or categories
     for procurement by the licensee from the generating company,
     wholesale or bulk or retail/various categories of consumers. After
     taking into consideration the factors in <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_97">Sections 61(a)</a> to (i), the
     State Commission determined the tariff rate for various categories
     including solar power PV project and the same is applied uniformly
     throughout the State. When the said tariff rate as determined by the
     Tariff Order, 2010 is incorporated in the PPA between the parties, it
     is a matter of contract between the parties. In my view, Respondent
     1 is bound by the terms and conditions of PPA entered into between
     Respondent 1 and the appellant by mutual consent and that the
     State Commission was not right in exercising its inherent jurisdiction
     by extending the first control period beyond its due date and thereby
     substituting its view in the PPA, which is essentially a matter of
     contract between the parties."

</p>

<p id="p_238">8.     Findings and analysis:-
</p>

<p id="p_239">       Let us have a look at the chronology of events leading to this
       appeal-
</p>

<p id="p_240">i)      In 2012, the Government of Tamil Nadu issued a Solar Energy
        Policy to generate 3000 MW solar power by 2015.
</p>

<p id="p_241">ii)     The State Commission issued a comprehensive order on solar
        power on 12.09.2014 and fixed the tariff for Solar Power Plants at
        Rs.7.10 per unit.
</p>

<p id="p_242">iii)    In terms of TNERC Power Procurement from New Renewable
        Sources of Energy Regulations, 2008, the control period of the
        tariff was fixed as one year from the date of the order.
</p>

<p id="p_243">iv)     The State Commission vide their order dated 01.04.2015 extended
        the control period of solar power tariff till 31.03.2016. Accordingly,
        all solar power projects commissioned on or before 31.03.2016
        became entitled to a tariff of Rs. 7.10 per unit.
</p>

<p id="p_244">v)      On 04.07.2015, the Appellant entered into an Energy Purchase
        Agreement with the TANGEDCO for the implementation of its 72
        MW solar power project.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                                                     Page 51 of 60</span>
<p id="p_245">                                                               A.Nos. 31 &amp; 32 of 2017




</p><p id="p_246">vi)     The Respondent No.3 proposed to interface the Appellant power
        plant with the TANTRANSCO Grid at the sanctioned new Kamuthi
        400/230-110 kV sub-station by erecting 110 kV line for a distance
        of 8 kilometer. As per the extent Regulation, the Respondent No.2
        was entirely responsible by commissioning the Kamuthi sub-
        station and the 110 kV line connecting the sub-station and the
        solar plant.
</p>

<p id="p_247">vii)    On 22.03.2016, the Chief Electrical Inspector accorded approval to
        commission the solar power plant.
</p>

<p id="p_248">viii)   On 24.03.2016, the Appellant informed the Respondent No.3 that
        the   project    was   ready   for   commissioning.     However,        the
        Respondent No.2 could not commission the sub-station at
        Kamuthi.       The Appellant requested to consider an alternate
        proposal to evacuate the power through one circuit of 110 kV DYC
        old Kamuthi sub-station to new Kamuthi sub-station line at new
        Kamuthi sub-station. However, the alternate proposal was not
        accepted.
</p>

<p id="p_249">ix)     The Appellant vide its letter dated 25.03.2016 and 31.03.2016
        informed the Respondent No.3 and Chief Engineer NCES that the
        Appellant's plant has been ready since 22.03.2016 and non-
        evacuation power is on account of non-commissioning of new sub-
        station at Kamuthi by Respondent No.2.
</p>

<p id="p_250">x)      On 15.04.2016, the Respondent No.2 informed the Appellant that
        the Appellant's plant was not ready for commissioning                   on

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                                                       Page 52 of 60</span>
                                                             A.Nos. 31 &amp; 32 of 2017



        31.03.2016 and in terms of letter dated 17.06.2015 it was duly
        clarified that the Appellant would not be entitled to claim any
        deemed generation or any other benefit from the Respondent No.2
        in case the TANTRANSCO could not commission proposed sub-
        station at Kamuthi.
</p>

<p id="p_251">xi)     Subsequently,    the   Appellant    could   commence       commercial
        operation of their plant only on 18.09.2016 after the commissioning
        of Kamuthi sub-station by Respondent No.2. Though the delay in
        commercial operation of the plant was due to delay in
        commissioning of Kamuthi sub-station by Respondent No.2 but the
        Appellant is being paid a lower tariff of Rs. 5.10 per unit attributing
        the delay in commissioning of the plant on the Appellant.
</p>

<p id="p_252">xii)    Being aggrieved, the Appellant filed a Petition before the State
        Commission as a Miscellaneous Petition however the Registry of
        the State Commission directed the Petitioner to file the same as a
        Dispute Resolution Petition (DRP) and returned the Petition. The
        Appellant again approached the Registry to place the matter
        before the State Commission for maintainability.
</p>

<p id="p_253">xiii)   On 16.11.2016, the State Commission passed the Impugned
        Order directing the Appellant to file appropriate fees while
        observing that the matter involved a dispute in terms of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_98">Section
        86(1)(f)</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003. Aggrieved by this order the
        Appellant has filed the instant Appeal.
</p>

<p id="p_254">xiv)    Now let us have a look at the Order passed by the State
        Commission.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                                                     Page 53 of 60</span>
<p id="p_255">                                                      A.Nos. 31 &amp; 32 of 2017



The relevant operative portion of the Impugned Order of the State
 Commission is reproduced below:-
</p>

<p id="p_256">"3.5. In this connection, it is necessary to elaborate on the nature of
    Dispute Resolutions. A Dispute Resolution Petition is one which
    is taken up upon a motion made by either of the parties i.e. the
    Petitioner or the Licensee for resolution of a dispute. The power
    of the Commission to resolve the dispute flows from <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_99">section 86</a>
    (1) of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_100">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 which provides as follows:-
</p>

<p id="p_257">    "<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_101">Section 86</a>. (Functions of State Commission): --- (1) The State
    Commission shall discharge the following functions, namely: -
</p><p id="p_258">    (a) x x x
</p><p id="p_259">    (b) x x x
</p><p id="p_260">    (c) x x x
</p><p id="p_261">    (d) x x x
</p><p id="p_262">    (e) x x x
</p><p id="p_263">    (f) adjudicate upon the disputes between the licensees, and
       generating companies and to refer any dispute for arbitration;
       xxx xxx


3.6. It may be seen from the express provision in <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_102">section 86</a> (1) (f),
    the Commission is empowered to adjudicate all disputes
    between the Licensees and Generating Companies and hence
    any dispute between a Licensee and a generating company, or
    generating companies or Licensees inter se whether such
    dispute relates to a period anterior to the signing of PPA or
    posterior to the signing of PPA can be adjudicated only by the
    Commission.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                                              Page 54 of 60</span>
<p id="p_264">                                                            A.Nos. 31 &amp; 32 of 2017




      3.7. Having held so, the short question which arises for
          consideration in this petition is whether the prayers of the
          Petitioner as set out in para 1 herein are in the nature of
          dispute resolution. It may be seen from the prayers of the
          Petitioner that there are prayers such as (a) to declare that the
          Petitioner's 72 MW Solar Project, was commissioned on or
          before March 31, 2016, (b) to declare that the Petitioner's Solar
          Power Project is entitled to a tariff of Rs.7.01 per unit which in
          our view, are in the nature of dispute resolution as they involve
          monetary claims between the Licensee and the Generator.
          Needless to say, any monetary claim cannot be adjudicated
          without resorting to appropriate dispute resolution mechanism.
          Any order passed without following the required procedures
          would not be in consonance with the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_103">section 86</a> (1) (f) of the
          <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_104">Electricity Act</a>, 2003. Though the Petitioner seeks to contend
          that the prayers are of miscellaneous nature, the fact remains
          that the prayers herein are clothed with the attributes of dispute
          resolution. Without hearing the response of the Licensee the
          issues raised in this petition cannot be disposed on merit."
</p>

<p id="p_265">xv)    Though the State Commission in the Impugned Order have
       considered submission made by the Appellant and have recorded
       that the Appellant filed their Petition as Miscellaneous Petition but,
       in the findings, the State Commission framed the only question for
       consideration, whether the prayers of the Petitioners are in the
       nature of dispute resolution.

xvi)    Now let us have a look at the grounds on which the petition has
        been filed and also the prayer of the Appellant:
</p>

<p id="p_267">        Grounds:
</p><p id="p_268">        I.       This Hon'ble Commission has inherent powers to extend the
                 control period for the Petitioner on a project specific basis.
</p>
<p id="p_269">        II.      TANGEDCO cannot be permitted to Benefit from its own
                 wrong

        III.     The Petitioner had legitimate expectations that its project
                 would be inter-connected on or Before March 31, 2016.
</p>
<p id="p_270">        IV.      TANGEDCO will not suffer prejudice if the Petitioner is
                 granted a tariff of Rs. 7.01 a unit.
</p>
<p id="p_271">        V.       TANGEDCO cannot arbitrarily discriminate between projects
                 that would result in prejudice to equally situate persons.
</p>
<p id="p_272">        VI.      TANGEDCO's actions have the potential to seriously and
                 detrimentally affect the very viability of the Petitioner's
                 project.
</p>
<p id="p_273">        VII.     The extension of the applicability of the tariff of Rs. 7.01 to
                 the Petitioner's project is also essential to satisfy the

         operation was delayed due to delay in commissioning of
         Kamuthi sub-station by Respondent No.2,
     •   the request to the State Commission for invoking its regulatory
         powers to extend the control period due to non-commissioning
         of evacuation facility by Respondent No.2,
     •   the fact that the solar plant was set up by the Appellant by
         making huge investment under the promotional Solar Policy
         notified by the State Government, wherein a tariff of Rs. 7.01
         per unit was to be given to the Appellant on completion of the
         project by 31.03.2016,

</p>

<p id="p_285">xviii) The State Commission has not discussed the facts of the case and
      the prayer of the Appellant, to consider the Petition filed by them,
      as Miscellaneous Petition and also to exercise the regulatory
      powers of the State Commission. The entire analysis is bent
      towards justifying that it is a Dispute Resolution Petition.
</p>

<p id="p_286">xix) <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_105">The Electricity Act</a>, 2003 has assigned multiple functions to the
      State Commission. The State Commission determines the tariff,
      regulates the purchase and procurement of electricity, plays the
      role of facilitator, issue licences, promote the co-generation and
      new and renewable energy sources, levy fees, specify grid code,
      enforce standards, fix trading margin and discharge other functions
      assigned under the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_106">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 besides adjudicating
      function.
</p>

<p id="p_287">xx)   The Appellant in their prayer have asked the State Commission to
      exercise their regulatory powers. In the interest of natural justice
      and equity, the State Commission besides elaborating on the
      nature of dispute resolution should also have discussed the other
      aspects of regulatory nature of the prayer. There is absolutely no
      discussion on this aspect of regulatory nature of the prayer sought
      by the Appellant.

sustainable business model to supply electricity to the consumers
in the State in the most efficient manner. With this objective in
mind, the endeavour of the State Commission while dealing with
such matters should be lenient one, especially in matters relating
to promotion of electricity generation from solar power plant under
the promotional schemes notified by the State Government. This
instant case is one such case wherein the Appellant have invested
huge sums of money for generation of electricity through solar
plant on the premise that if the plant is completed by 31.03.2016
than it will be paid a tariff of Rs. 7.01 per unit. The availability of
tariff of Rs. 7.01 per unit is the very basis of setting up of this
project by the Appellant. In this case the project has been
completed before 31.03.2016. The Appellant have submitted the
certificate issued by the Chief Electrical Inspector on ground that
the evacuation infrastructure to be created by the Respondent
No.2 was not completed and therefore evacuation of power from
the solar plant of the Appellant could not take place. It is at this
time the Appellant approached the State Commission for exercise
of the regulatory powers to accede to their prayer. In view of the
facts of the case, the averments made by the Appellant, the
grounds given by the Appellant in their appeal and the prayer
made by the Appellant, it would be appropriate to treat the Petition
of the Appellant as Miscellaneous Petition and not as a Dispute
Resolution Petition because of monetary claims between the
licensee and the generator.
