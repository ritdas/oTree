<p id="p_2">1.        Leave granted.

</p><p id="p_4">2.        All       these    appeals      are     filed       by     the

appellants         being    aggrieved       and     dissatisfied

with the judgment and order passed by the High

Court    of    Andhra       Pradesh    in    various          Letters

Patent Appeals as also in Writ Petitions.                             By

the said orders, the High Court rejected the

prayer        of     the     appellants           for        quashing

proceedings         under    the   <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_1">Land      Acquisition            Act</a>,

1894 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act') for

acquisition of land being illegal, unlawful,

mala fide and in colourable exercise of power

by the State.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Factual background

</p><p id="p_6">3.        To appreciate the controversy in the

present appeals, it is appropriate to refer to

the facts in the first matter i.e. Civil Appeal

arising       out     of    SLP(C)     No.      2239         of     2006

(Sooraram          Pratap    Reddy    &amp;      Ors.       v.        Deputy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                   4</span>

Collector, Ranga Reddy &amp; Ors.).                    It was the

case of the appellants before the High Court

that the Government of Andhra Pradesh sought to

acquire a large chunk of land in the name of

`public purpose' for the purported development

of `Financial District and Allied Projects'.

According      to     the   appellants,    the     action    has

been taken in colourable exercise of power and

in total violation of the Land Acqusition Act,

1894 as well as several other statutes in force

in the State of Andhra Pradesh; such as, Andhra

Pradesh       Urban     Area    Development       Act,   1975;

Zoning       Regulations;       <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment       (Protection)

Act</a>,   1986;     Water      (Prevention    and     <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control    of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 etc. The action has been

taken, alleged the appellants, with mala fide

intention       and     oblique      motive   to      transfer

valuable land of small farmers to a foreign

company and few selected persons with vested

interest.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.           A notification under <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_4">Section 4</a> of the

Act    was    published        in   the   State     Government
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                     5</span>

Gazette on July 17, 2002.              The said action was

challenged and the validity of notification was

questioned in a writ petition in the High Court

of Andhra Pradesh.             The High Court dismissed

the petition following an earlier decision in

Writ Petition No. 21712 of 2002 by observing

that the writ petition involved similar issues.

The High Court, however, directed that `urgency

clause' sought to be invoked by the Government

under    <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_5">Section     17</a>   of     the    Act   was      illegal,

unlawful    and    unwarranted.        That     part    of     the

notification was, therefore, set aside and the

Authorities were directed to proceed to hear

objections of the owners/interested persons by

following   procedure       under      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Section    5A</a>    of     the

Act.     According to the appellants, the High

Court was wholly wrong in dismissing the writ

petition    relying       on    the    judgment        in     Writ

Petition No. 21712 of 2002 since in that case,

the Court has considered only one issue; viz.

the    acquisition    was      or   was   not    for        public

purpose as the beneficiary was Andhra Pradesh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                    6</span>

Industrial         Infrastructure       Corporation       Limited

(`APIIC' for short).             Really, the property has

been given in bounty to a foreign Company which

was    not    lawful.         The     High   Court   failed    to

consider       and     decide       several    important      and

crucial issues raised by the small landowners.

</p><p id="p_8">5.           Being aggrieved by the order passed in

the    writ    petition,        the    appellants       preferred

Writ    Appeal       which    was     also   dismissed.       The

appellants         have,     therefore,       approached     this

Court by filing the present appeal.                  Initially,

notice       was    issued.     Several       matters     raising

similar issues were also filed and all were

ordered to be placed for hearing together.

</p><p id="p_9">6.           We have heard learned counsel for the

parties.
</p>
<p id="p_10">Submissions of appellants

</p><p id="p_11">7.           The learned counsel for the appellants

contended that the High Court was wholly wrong

in     dismissing       writ-petitions         as    also    writ

appeals.           According    to    the    appellants,     land
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                           7</span>

acquisition proceedings were clearly unlawful,

illegal,     mala     fide        and       violative         of     the

fundamental rights of the appellants. They were

taken in colourable exercise of power by the

authorities.      The      appellants         are   small          land-

holders and their only livelihood was dependant

on    land   attempted       to        be    acquired         by     the

respondents.          According         to    the       appellants,

there was no `public purpose' as defined in the

Act and the land is acquired for a private

foreign      company.            The        acquisition             was,

therefore,      bad   in    law    and       for    a   collateral

purpose. It was also submitted that even if it

is assumed for the sake of argument that the

land could be acquired for a public purpose by

a     private       Company,           the     procedure             for

acquisition of land by a private company under

Part VII of the Act ought to have been followed

and not the procedure under Part II providing

for    acquisition          of     land        by       the        State

Authorities.        It was urged that in the era of

globalization, if a foreign company wanted to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                         8</span>

establish       its    business,       it   was        required     to

follow    the    prescribed        procedure           and    parties

must be left to settle their deal by entering

into mutual agreement for sale and purchase of

properties. In other words, according to the

appellants, power of `eminent domain' has no

application to such cases. The provisions of

the Act must be strictly construed and judicial

scrutiny in such matters i.e. in the matters of

acquisition       of     land     by    the   State          or   its

instrumentality for a private party, namely,

for use and occupation of land by a foreign

company should be very strict. It was further

submitted that proceedings were totally mala

fide which was clear from the fact that huge

land owned and possessed by influential persons

such     as,    Smt.     Vijay    Nirmala,         a    well-known

actress and other persons in public life had

been     excluded.         Thus,       rich   landlords            and

politically           patronage        persons         have       been

deprived of their property.                   Malicious action

on the part of the State Authorities was also

clear from the fact that though the land was

sought to be acquired for industrial policy of

the Government, initially, `urgency clause' was

applied and <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_7">Section 17</a> was pressed in service.

It was because of the High Court's intervention

that urgency clause was quashed and authorities

were directed to take action in accordance with

law and only thereafter notices were issued and

procedure     under      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Section       5A</a>    of     the    Act     was

said affidavit, it was, inter alia, contended

that appellants were not small land-holders or

marginal farmers.         Most of them have converted

agricultural lands unauthorizedly into housing

plots     and     sold   them     to     various       builders/

developers/property           dealers/estate         agents    and

they were not cultivating the land.                   No doubt,

there    were     certain     small     land-owners/farmers

also. But, it was contended by the State, that

because     of    industrial       policy      of     the    State

Government, a decision was taken to construct

Information Technology and Hardware Industrial

Policy 2005-10 and for the said purpose land

was sought to be acquired under the provisions

of     the    Act.             Proceedings        were,      therefore,

initiated           and        necessary      notification             was

issued.         There           was   no     illegality          in    the

procedure        contemplated              under       the    Act      for

acquisition               of      land.           APIIC       is         an

instrumentality of State which was to pay the

entire amount of compensation and such action

could not be said to be illegal or contrary to

law.         It was, therefore, submitted that the

appeals are liable to be dismissed.

General Manager (Law), contended that it was

State of Andhra Pradesh and has been developing

infrastructural                projects      in     the      State      to

the   projects        have     already       taken    shape     and

others are in various stages of development. It

was submitted that time was a critical factor

for implementation of those projects. In view

of development of these special projects, the

respondent-Corporation               would      be     improving

facilities in the round-about areas. It was for

completion          of        several         projects         that

notifications under the Act were issued by the

State.   The        High     Court    was     satisfied       about

public purpose and hence rejected the ground

put forward by land-owners that acquisition was

not for public purpose. According to the High

Court, however, the procedure laid down in the

under <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_11">Section 17</a> of the Act could not have been

invoked. In several cases, awards were made and

possession of the land was also taken over.                            In

some other cases, award is not passed and the

land is still in the possession of the land-

owners.      That,       however,       does       not       mean     that

proceedings      under          the    Act       were     illegal       or

unlawful.

Andhra      Pradesh      introduced          Tourism         Department

project in its entirety, the High Court was

wholly right and fully justified in dismissing

the petition and not interfering with the land

acquisition proceedings.

misconceived          and      ill-founded             and        the

petitioners were not entitled to any relief.

It    was     stated        that     the    Special          Deputy

but they have illegally converted agricultural

land into non-agricultural land and have sold/

transferred/ allotted to builders/ developers/

real estate owners of properties.                       Acquisition

was     the      Nodal            Agency      which        was      an

`instrumentality' of the `State'. The amount of

compensation         was     to    be      paid    by    APIIC     and

acquisition          was     under      power       of     `eminent

domain'. Acquisition is not for foreign company

or private party and the High Court was right

in not insisting for following procedure laid

down in Part VII of the Act as the case is

covered by procedure prescribed in Part II of

the Act.      Public purpose was precise, perfect

and    lawful    and       the      land     was    acquired        in

consonance with the procedure laid down in the

Act.    It was only with a view to delay the

proceedings that petitions were filed by the

petitioners          which        has   resulted         in      gross

injustice       to     Emaar        which     has       made     large

Writ Petitions in High Court

</pre><p id="p_28"><a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_25">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_26">6</a> of the Act was challenged by

some of the land owners by filing Writ Petition

No. 21712 of 2002 in the High Court of Andhra

Pradesh      at    Hyderabad.          The        learned    Single

Judge, vide a judgment and order dated April

25, 2003 partly allowed the petition.                       He held

that in view of counter-affidavit filed by the

authorities,       it    could   not        be    said     that   the

acquisition        was    illegal       or        unlawful        and,

therefore, was not sustainable. Acquisition of

land   was    in    exercise      of        power     of    eminent

domain and was intended for public purpose, to

wit, for development of New Projects by APIIC

Ltd.   The        acquisition         was        to   enable       the

activities         of      APIIC,           which          was     an

instrumentality of State operating in the area

of industrial infrastructure. The purposes of

APIIC were demonstrably public purposes.                            It
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                                 2</span>

was also held that the claim of the petitioners

as being small farmers was not well-founded as

no agricultural operations were being pursued

by them as asserted by the authorities in the

counter-affidavit which was not denied.                    The

availability of alternative land as pleaded by

the petitioners was also not correct since the

lands   available        were   not   contiguous     to    the

existing developed areas and hence could not be

said to be `alternative'.
</p>
<p id="p_29">19.         The     Court,      however,      held        that

invocation of urgency clause under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_27">Section 17</a>

of    the   Act    and   dispensing    with   enquiry      as

contemplated by <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_28">Section 5-A</a> of the Act was not

legal. <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_29">Section 5-A</a> of the Act is a salutary

provision which enables the persons whose land

is proposed to be acquired to urge all grounds

that    may   be   available     against   the     proposed

acquisition at the enquiry. Unless real urgency

is demonstrated, dispensing with the enquiry

and invocation of urgency clause was irrational

and arbitrary exercise of power by the State.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                                      2</span>

By such process, an enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_30">Section 5-A</a>

of    the   Act     cannot      be    jettisoned       on   jejune

grounds     of      irrational         and      unsubstantiated

urgency.          Since    no      such   urgency      could    be

demonstrated by the State, the action to the

extent of dispensing with the enquiry was held

to be bad.        The petition was, therefore, partly

allowed     directing        the      authorities      to    issue

notice to the landowners under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_31">Section 5-A</a> of

the   Act   and     to    take       further    proceedings     in

accordance with law.

<p id="p_30">20.         The Court finally stated;

      notice under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_32">section 4(1)</a> of the Act

<p id="p_31">21.         Other    petitions         filed    by   other     land

owners were also partly allowed relying upon

The Division Bench dismissed all the appeals

holding that the land was needed for public

purpose and the acquisition could not be said

to be contrary to law.      Similarly, the learned

single Judge was also right in coming to the

conclusion    that   on   the   facts   and   in   the

circumstances of the case, urgency clause could

not have been applied under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_33">Section 17</a> of the

      of India (IRDA) and also to SBH Staff

      that in order to ensure compactness of

       there is no prohibition to acquire

       no reason to acquire private patta

the parties, it is appropriate if we examine

the relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_46">Land Acquisition

Act</a>, 1894. As the Preamble states, the Act has

been enacted for the purpose of enabling the

State to acquire land for public purposes as

also for Companies. <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_47">Section 3</a> defines various

expressions.        The   expression       `Company'       is

defined in clause (e) to mean a Company as

defined in the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_48">Companies Act</a>, 1956 (other than

a     Government     Company).    Clause       (ee)   defines

`appropriate       Government'.       Clause    (f)   defines

`public purpose'. The definition is inclusive

in nature and includes purposes mentioned in

</p>
<p id="p_67">38.         The term `eminent domain' is said to

have originated by Grotius, legal scholar of

the seventeenth century. He believed that the

State possessed the power to take or destroy

property for the benefit of the social unit,

but he believed that when the State so acted,

it    was   obligated   to   compensate   the   injured

property owner for his losses.

<p id="p_68"> 39.        In his well known work `De Jure, Belli

et Pacis', the learned author proclaimed;

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">       "The property of subject is under the
       eminent domain of the State, so that
       the State or he who acts for it may
       use, alienate and even destroy such
       property, not only in the case of
       extreme   necessity,  in   which  even
       private person have a right over the
       property of other, but for the ends of
       public utility, to which ends those
       who founded civil society must be
       supposed to have the intended the
       private ends should give way".

<p id="p_69">40.         Blackstone too believed that State had

no general power to take private property of

land-owners,        except         on   the     payment           of    a

reasonable price. The right of the State or the

sovereign      to   its       or    his    own        property         is

absolute while that of the subject or citizen

to his property is only paramount. The citizen

holds his property subject always to the right

of    the    sovereign        to   take   it     for     a    public

purpose. The power of eminent domain is merely

a means to an end; viz. larger public interest.

</p><p id="p_70">41.         The power of eminent domain does not

depend for its existence on a specific grant.

It is inherent and exists in every sovereign

State without any recognition thereof in the

Constitution or in any statute. It is founded

on    the     law   of        necessity.        The     power          is

inalienable. No Legislature can bind itself or

its successors not to exercise this power when

public      necessity     demands       it.     Nor    it    can       be

abridged       or    restricted           by     agreement             or

contract.

</p><p id="p_75">44.         Willis     in      his       well        known    work

`Constitutional Law' discusses two view points

as to exercise of power of eminent domain. The

older and stricter view was that unless the

property was dedicated for user by the public

at large or a considerable section thereof, it

would   not    be    for    public      use     or    for    public

purpose.      The    modern      and    more    liberal       view,

however,      is    that    it     is    not     an    essential

condition      of    public      use    that     the    property
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                                   4</span>

for public user and it is sufficient that the

public derives advantage from the scheme.

Bradley, (1896) 164 U.S. 112 : 41 Law Ed. 369,

an    Act    of     California     provided        for       the

acquisition of lands whenever 50 land-owners or

a majority of them in a particular locality

required it for construction of a watercourse,

the object of the legislation being to enable

dry lands to be brought under wet cultivation.

The validity of the Act was challenged on the

ground that the acquisition would only benefit

particular       land   owners   who    could    take    water

from the channel and the public as such had no

direct interest in the matter and consequently

there was no public user. The contention was

right if narrow view was to be accepted but was

not   well-founded       if   liberal    view    was    to   be

adopted.

      confined to the land-owners, or even
      to anyone section of the State. The
      fact that the use of the water is
      limited to the land-owner is not,
      therefore, a fatal objection to this
      legislation. It is not essential that
      the entire community, or even any
      considerable portion thereof, should
      directly enjoy or participate in an

certain vacant sites were acquired for enabling

Panchamas to build houses. It was argued that

this was not a public purpose as the benefits

of    the    acquisition        were      to   go    only   to    few

public officers, the purpose is a
public one. If the same fleet of cars

private purpose. If bread is 'seized'
for feeding a starving section of the

Infrastructure Projects in the State to attract

industries in the State and for the overall

development of the State.                The policy laid down

guidelines      for    attracting           and    facilitating

private     investment            in     infrastructure.       It

provided        for          infrastructure              projects

implementation        in    Private-Public          Partnership

(PPP) requiring Government support.                  The Policy

envisaged the need for a special legislation

called Infrastructure Development Act (`IDA')

supported by rules, guidelines and sectorial

policies. While IDA was to constitute a Special

Infrastructure Promotion Authority (IPA) having

quasi judicial functions, the Task Force was to

undertake executive functions outlined in IDA.

The intention behind the integrated project was

to establish Hyderabad as a major business-cum-

leisure tourism infrastructure asset for the

State.     It   was        also        stated     that   in   the

Acquisition for Company: Whether public purpose?


</p><p id="p_183">102.      The    main    contention         of     the    learned

counsel for the appellants in all these cases

is that the land is sought to be acquired by

the    Government      for     a    private       Company.           In

accordance      with    the    provisions         of     the    Act,

therefore,       procedure         laid      down        by         the

Legislature     in     Part   VII    was    required           to    be

followed. According to the counsel, since the

acquisition is not in accordance with Part VII

of the Act, the entire acquisition is vitiated

being contrary to law. It is, therefore, liable

to be quashed and set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_184">103.      The     submission         on     behalf        of        the

respondents, on the other hand, is that the

acquisition       is     by        the     State       for          its

instrumentality        i.e.    APIIC.      Such     acquisition
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">                                                                        7</span>

was,     therefore,       for    `public      purpose'.           The

entire compensation was to be paid by APIIC and

hence     procedure,      which     was      required       to     be

followed, was under Part II and not under Part

VII     as    contended    by     the     writ   petitioners.

Admittedly,       the     said      procedure         has        been

followed and hence it cannot be said that the

acquisition was not in consonance with law. It

was also submitted that in earlier proceedings,

this contention had been expressly raised by

the writ petitioners before the High Court. The

learned Single Judge specifically negatived it

holding that the land was needed for `public

purpose'. The said order was confirmed even by

the     Division        Bench.      Hence,       so     far        as

acquisition by the `State' under Part II of the

Act     for    public     purpose       is   concerned,           the

earlier order has attained finality.                   The High

Court held that the appropriate Government was

not justified in invoking urgency clause under

<a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_120">Section 17</a> of the Act and no urgency could

demonstrably be shown to exist, the declaration

as to urgency and dispensing with the inquiry

under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_121">Section 5-A</a> of the Act was held unlawful.

The State Government was, therefore, directed

to follow procedure under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_122">Section 5A</a> of the Act

by     issuing     notice      to   the   land   owners   by

of being heard to the persons interested in the

land.        The    said      exercise    was    thereafter

undertaken         by   the     authorities      and   final

public purpose or `for a company'.        If it is

so, acquisition will be governed by Part II of

the Act and the procedure laid down in the said

Part has to be followed.         Part VII, on the

other hand, deals with acquisition of land for

companies.    In such cases, previous consent of

appropriate     Government    and   execution    of

agreement for transfer of land is necessary and

procedure laid down in that Part is sine qua

non for the acquisition.

appellants is that the so-called acquisition is

the respondents is that it was in pursuance of

industrial policy of the State that land was to

be acquired by APIIC and the entire amount of

such the acquisition is covered by Part II of

amount of compensation (which according to this

Court was not factually correct). The aggrieved

land owner approached this Court.

</p><p id="p_195">113.      According         to    this     Court,        the     main

point for determination was whether or not the

acquisition proceedings had been vitiated by

reason of the admitted fact that there was no

attempt made by the Government to comply with

the    requirement     of        Part     VII     of     the     Act.

Referring to Babu Barkya, this Court held that

the conclusion arrived at by the High Court was

`entirely     correct',          though     the        process       of

reasoning     by      which        it     had     reached            the

conclusion was erroneous. The Court observed

that the Act contemplates acquisition for (i) a

public purpose, and (ii) for a Company; thus,

conveying     the   idea         that    acquisition           for    a

Company, is not for a public purpose. It was

also   observed     that         the    purposes        of     public

utility, referred to in <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_135">Sections 40</a> and <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_136">41</a> of

the Act were akin to public purpose. Hence,

acquisition     for    a   Company    are    governed      by

considerations        of   public    utility.     But     the

procedure for the two kinds of acquisitions is

different and if it is for a Company, then

acquisition has to be effected in accordance

with the procedure laid down in Part VII.

Barkya, the Court observed;
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_59">       "There is no doubt that, as pointed
       out in the recent decision of this
       Court, the Act contemplates for a
       public purpose and for a Company, thus
       conveying the idea that acquisition
       for a Company is not for a public
       purpose. It has been held by this
       Court    in   that   decision    that  the
       purposes of public utility, referred
       to in Ss. 40-41 of the Act, are akin
       to public purpose. Hence, acquisition
       for    a    public    purpose    as   also
       acquisitions     for    a    company   are
       governed by considerations of public
       utility.     But the procedure for the
       two     kinds    of     acquisitions    is
       different, in so far as Part VII has
       made     substantive     provisions    for
       acquisitions of land for Companies.
       Where acquisition is made for a public
       purpose, the cost of acquisition for
       payment of compensation has to be paid
       wholly    or   partly    out   of   Public
       Revenues, or some fund controlled or

       managed by a local authority. On the
       other   hand,    in  the    case   of   an
       acquisition     for   a    company,    the
       compensation has to be paid by the
       Company. But, in such a case, there
       has to be an agreement, under<a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_140"> S. 41</a>,
       for the transfer of the land acquired
       by the Government to the Company on
       payment of the cost of acquisition, as
       also other matters not material to our
       present    purpose.       The    agreement
       contemplated by S.41 is to be entered
       into between the Company and the
       appropriate Government only after the
       latter is satisfied about the purpose
       of   the    proposed   acquisition,    and
       subject to the condition precedent
       that the previous consent of the
       appropriate Government has been given
       to the acquisition.        The `previous
       consent' itself of the appropriate
       Government is made to depend upon the
       satisfaction of that government that
       the purpose of the acquisition was as
       laid down in S.40. It is, thus, clear
       that the provisions of Ss. 39-41 lay
       down   conditions    precedent    to   the
       application of the machinery of the

with <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_144">section 6</a> of the Act, lead to
this result that the declaration for
the acquisition for a Company shall
not be made unless the compensation to
be awarded for the property is to be
paid by a company. The declaration for
the acquisition for a public purpose,
similarly, cannot be made unless the
compensation, wholly or partly, is to
be   paid     out   of    public    funds.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_63">Therefore,     in   the    case    of   an
acquisition for a Company simpliciter,
the declaration cannot be made without
satisfying the requirements of Part
VII. But, that does not necessarily
mean that an acquisition of a Company
for a public purpose cannot be made
otherwise than under the provisions of
Part VII, if the cost or a portion of
the cost of the acquisition is to come
out of public funds. In other words,
the      essential      condition      for
acquisition for a public purpose is
that the cost of the acquisition
should be borne, wholly or in part,
out   of    public   funds.   Hence,    an
acquisition for a Company may also be
made for a public purpose, within the
meaning of the Act, if a part or the
whole of the cost of acquisition is
met by public funds. If, on the other
hand, the acquisition for a Company is
to be made at the cost entirely of the
Company itself, such an acquisition
comes under the provisions of Part
VII. As in the present instance, it
appears that part at any rate of the
compensation to be awarded for the
acquisition is to come eventually from
out of public revenues, it must be
held that the acquisition is not for a
Company    simpliciter.    It   was   not,

<blockquote id="blockquote_66">    "Therefore, though the words `public

    same meaning, they have to be read in
    the restricted sense in accordance
    with<a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_150"> s. 40</a> when the acquisition is for
    a company under<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_151"> s. 6</a>. In one case, the
    Notification under<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_152"> s. 6</a> will say that
    the   acquisition   is    for    a   public
    purpose,   in   the    other    case    the
    Notification will say that it is for a
    company. The proviso to<a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_153"> s. 6(1)</a> shows
    that where the acquisition is for a
    public purpose, the compensation has
    to be paid wholly or partly out of
    public    revenues     or     some     fund
    controlled or managed by a local
    authority.     Where      however       the
    acquisition is either for a company,
    the compensation would be paid wholly
    by the company. Though therefore this
    distinction    is   there      where    the
    acquisition is either for a public
    purpose or for a company, there is not
    a     complete     dichotomy       between
    acquisitions for the two purposes and
    it cannot be maintained that where the
    acquisition is primarily for a company
    it must always be preceded by action
    under Part VII and compensation must
    always be paid wholly by the company.</blockquote><p id="p_199">
    A third class of cases is possible
    where the acquisition may be primarily
    for a company but it may also be at
    the same time for a public purpose and
    the whole or part of compensation may
    be paid out of public revenues or some
    fund controlled or managed by a local

acquisition may look as if it is
primarily for a company it will be
covered by that part of<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_154"> s. 6</a> which
lays down that acquisition may be made
for a public purpose if the whole or
part of the compensation is to be paid
out of the public revenues or some
fund controlled or managed by a local
authority. Such was the case in <a href="/doc/208309/" id="a_155">Pandit
Jhandu Lal v. State of Punjab</a>. In that
case the acquisition was for the
construction of a labour colony under
the    Government   sponsored   housing
scheme for the industrial workers of
the   Thapar   Industries  Co-operative
Housing Society Limited and part of
the compensation was to be paid out of
the public funds. In such a case this
Court held that "an acquisition for a
company may also be made for a public
purpose within the meaning of the Act,
if a part or the whole of the cost of
acquisition is met by public funds"
and therefore it was not necessary to
go through the procedure prescribed by
Part VII. It is only where the
acquisition is for a company and its
cost is to be met entirely by the
company itself that the provisions of
Part VII apply. In the present case it
is not the case of the respondents
that any part of the compensation is
to be paid out of what may be called
public funds. It is not in dispute
that the entire compensation is to be
paid by the Works and therefore the
provision of Part VII would apply to
the present case; and it is in this

not because the public would have a

make a good livelihood, but because an
institution of this kind is useful to

that     there     is      acute     shortage       of     housing

accommodation both in rural and urban areas of

the country.        The Court also stated that since

the low income group. If for that purpose it

sought to acquire land, it could not be said

that acquisition was illegal or unlawful.

stated:

<blockquote id="blockquote_81">       "Simply because there is an element of

       some profit but to see that the profit
       motive does not lead to exploitation

       are available to the poor people and
       to middle class people at nominal or
       affordable prices, or even on no-

       Board exercises the necessary control.
       It is certainly a public purpose to

<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_190">Companies      Act</a>,       1956.       The      acquisition          was

challenged on the ground that though land was

sought to be acquired for a Company, procedure

was followed under Part II and not under Part

VII and hence it was bad in law. The record

revealed that the payment of entire amount of

compensation was to be made by the Company. It

was, therefore, incumbent to follow procedure

laid down in Part VII. During the pendency of

the writ petition, however, it was contended by

the    State       that    it      would       be     contributing

Rs.100/- and hence it was covered by Part II

and the acquisition was legal and valid.

a Company and not by the State for a `public

laid   down     in    Part      VII      was   required        to    be

followed.       Since        it       was      not     done,        the

acquisition was bad in law.

       would not have gone into the said
       question    but    the    agreement
       provides for payment of entire

       material on record, must hold that
       the State had not formed any

`World Tourism Organization Report' and `Vision

2020    Document'       took          a    policy           decision      for

the    development          of     the      City        of       Hyderabad.

For the said purpose, it decided to establish

an     Integrated           Project         which            would       make

Hyderabad a major Business-cum-Leisure Tourism

Infrastructure          Centre            for     the        State.       The

project     is    both           structurally               as    well     as

financially integrated. It is to be implemented

through     Andhra          Pradesh         Infrastructure                and

Investment Corporation (APIIC) which has taken

all    steps     to    make        Hyderabad            a     world-class

business         destination.                   APIIC             is       an

instrumentality of State and works as `Nodal

Agency'    developing            the       project           which     would

facilitate socio-economic progress of the State

by      generating               revenues,              weeding           out

unemployment          and    bringing             new       avenues       and

opportunities for public at large. Development

of     infrastructure            is       legal     and          legitimate

`public     purpose'          for         exercising             power     of

eminent domain. Simply because a Company has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_126">                                                                 1</span>

been   chosen     for    fulfillment    of     such    public

purpose does not mean that the larger public

interest    has       been   sacrificed,       ignored      or

disregarded. It will also not make exercise of

power bad, mala fide or for collateral purpose

vitiating the proceedings.

<p id="p_279">

</p><p id="p_280">169.       In our judgment, the respondents are

right in submitting that in case of integrated

and indivisible project, the project has to be

taken as a whole and must be judged whether it

is in the larger public interest. It cannot be

split into different components and to consider

whether    each   and    every     component    will    serve

public    good.   A     holistic    approach    has    to   be

adopted in such matters. If the project taken

as a whole is an attempt in the direction of

bringing        foreign       exchange,         generating

employment opportunities and securing economic

benefits to the State and the public at large,

it will serve public purpose.

that     the    Infrastructure              Development       Project

conceived by the State and executed under the

auspices of its instrumentality (APIIC) is one

covered by the Act. The Joint Venture Mechanism

for     implementing          the        policy,     executing         the

project and achieving lawful public purpose for

realizing the goal of larger public good would

neither       destroy     the       object      nor    vitiate         the

exercise       of     power         of     public     purpose          for

development of infrastructure. The concept of

joint     venture        to    tap        resources     of    private

sector     for      infrastructural              development           for

fulfillment         of        public        purpose        has        been

recognized       in    foreign           countries     as     also      in

India in several decisions of this Court.

to be paid by State agency (APIIC) which also

works    as    nodal      agency         for    execution        of    the

project.       It   is    primarily            for   the     State      to

decide whether there exists public purpose or

not. Undoubtedly, the decision of the State is

not beyond judicial scrutiny. In appropriate

cases, where such power is exercised mala fide

or   for   collateral           purposes     or   the   purported

action     is     de     hors    the    Act,      irrational       or

otherwise unreasonable or the so-called purpose

is `no public purpose' at all and fraud on

statute      is         apparent,       a      writ-court          can

undoubtedly          interfere.        But    except        in    such

cases, the declaration of the Government is not

subject to judicial review. In other words, a

writ     court,        while     exercising       powers         under

Articles 32, 226 or 136 of the Constitution,

cannot     substitute          its   own     judgment       for    the

judgment        of      the      Government       as        to    what

constitutes `public purpose'.

are of the view that the action of the State in

initiating             acquisition           proceedings           for

establishing           and      developing        infrastructure

objectionable. The High Court was, therefore,

right in dismissing writ petitions as also writ

appeals and we find no infirmity therein. All

the   appeals,    therefore,        are           liable                  to         be

dismissed   and     are   accordingly                          dismissed,

however, leaving the parties to bear their own

costs.
