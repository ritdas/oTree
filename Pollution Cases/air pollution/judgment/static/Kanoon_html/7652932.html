            ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 11th day of March, 2013



                           JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     Petitioners challenge Ext. P7 stop memo issued by the

local authority and seeks to continue the construction work

in terms of Ext. P2. Petitioners also challenge Ext. P8 and P9

order. Ext. P7 is the stop memo issued by the Secretary of

Kannur Municipality on 17.10.2012 stating that they have

received a complaint in respect of construction of a multi-

storied complex, being constructed in Survey No. 456/9 of

Kannur Municipality and until the complaint is disposed of,

the construction activity should be kept in abeyance.

</p><p id="p_2">     2.   Ext. P8 is the direction issued by the Government

on 25.10.2012 directing the Secretary of the Municipality to

stay the operation of the permit and furnish a report to the

Government in that regard. Ext. P9 dated 02.11.2012 is

another stop memo issued by the Secretary of the

W.P. (C) NO. 25537 OF 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>

Municipality pursuant to Ext. P8.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.     The facts as narrated in the writ petition would

disclose that the 1st petitioner and the 2nd petitioner had

acquired an extent of 42 cents of land in the Survey No.

aforesaid, along with a building permit issued in favour of

the earlier owner. The permit was transferred in their name

as per Ext .P2 dated 29.03.2011 and Ext. P1 dated

31.03.2011. The permit is renewed from 12.08.2011 for a

period of 3 years.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.     Subsequently, petitioners were faced with a stop

memo alleging that the road access was less than 5 meters

which was later withdrawn as per Ext. P4, on a finding that

the road access was having more than 5 meters width. They

were again faced with another stop memo dated 21.04.2012

which was also withdrawn as per Ext. P6 dated 06.10.2012

This was followed by another stop memo Ext. P7. In Ext. P7

also no specific reason had been pointed out for the

issuance of stop memo. Hence the writ petition was filed

aggrieved by repeated stop memo's without showing any

W.P. (C) NO. 25537 OF 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>

reason.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.     Ext. P7 was stayed by this Court on 31.10.2012

and during the pendency of the writ petition on the basis of

Ext. P8 issued by the Government, Ext. P9 stop memo was

again issued. The writ petition was therefore amended

challenging Ext. P8 and P9 as well.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6.     The main contention urged by the petitioners is

that they have obtained all necessary licenses/permission

for construction of the building and without showing any

reason for cancelling the permit or suspending the permit

Ext. P7, P8 and P9 have been issued. Apparently on a

reference to Ext. P7, P8 and P9 no specific reason is pointed

out as to why the stop memo is issued, rather than stating

that    some      complaints  were    received regarding  the

construction. In Ext. P8 Government Order there is

reference to certain complaints received in that regard.

</p><p id="p_7">      7.     Counter affidavit is filed by the 3rd respondent

inter alia contending that Government has received many

complaints against the construction done by the petitioners

W.P. (C) NO. 25537 OF 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                4</span>

from representatives of the Thillery Residents Association.

An enquiry was conducted through the Regional Joint

Director of Urban Affairs, Kozhikode and on the basis of the

enquiry it was found that there is violation of Rule 24(8) of

Kerala Municipality Building Rules (hereinafter referred to as

KMBR). Further it is stated that the existing area comes

under CRZ II Zone and since the value of construction will

be more than Rs. 5 crores, it required permission from the

Coastal Zone Management Authority (CZMA) and the

petitioners had not obtained any such 'No objection

Certificate'.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      8.     Further it is stated that the concurrence of the

Defence Authority has not been obtained as per Rule 5(5) of

the KMBR. A reference is made to letter dated 03.08.2012

from the Defence Station Commander (DSC) informing that

as per the latest guidelines from the Head Quarters the

distance from land for construction of multi-storied building

has been increased from 100 to 500 meters and since the

permit was obtained by considering 100 meter distance, the

W.P. (C) NO. 25537 OF 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5</span>

same requires to be cancelled. The Ground Water Authority

also pointed out that the construction affects the level of

ground water in neighbouring areas.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      9.     Counter affidavit is filed by the party respondent,

the Residents Association as well. According to them, the

Municipality has the power to suspend or revoke the

building permit in terms of Rule 16 and the Government had

power to direct the Secretary to issue order in terms of Rule

18(5) of KMBR. It is further contended on basis of Ext. R2

</p><p id="p_10">(b) that the minimum distance from defence land should be

500 meters and such a requirement had not been taken into

consideration by the Municipality while issuing the permit.

Further reference is made to Ext. R2(d) by contending that

the construction of the building will affect the water aquifer

in the area which will ultimately lead to disastrous situation

and scarcity of water in the wells in the nearby locality. The

report of the Regional Joint Director is produced as Ext. R2

</p><p id="p_11">(g) as well as Ext. R2(j) in which grounds taken by the

Government is specifically indicated. Therefore according to

W.P. (C) NO. 25537 OF 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  6</span>

the party respondent, the building permit had been issued

without any basis and without proper materials on record

and that it is in violation of various provisions of law and

that the construction will lead to scarcity of water in the

locality.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      10. Heard the learned Senior Counsel Sri. M. Ramesh

Chander appearing for petitioners, the Additional Advocate

General Sri. K. A. Jaleel and the learned counsel for the 2nd

respondent Sri. V.R. Kesava Kaimal.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      11.     It is not in dispute that Ext. P1 is the renewal of

the permit already granted on 13.08.2008. The Rules

governing the grant of permit alone will apply as far as

renewal is concerned. It is the contention of the party

respondent that the construction of the building had not

started and that is why a change of opinion is required in

the matter. I do not think so. If a building permit has been

granted on 13.08.2008, necessarily if the building is not

completed and the permit is to be renewed it cannot be

based on any change of law that occurred after the issuance

W.P. (C) NO. 25537 OF 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              7</span>

of the original permit. The learned counsel for petitioners

relies upon the 'No Objection Certificate' issued by the

Cantonment authority as Ext. P13 in order to indicate that

during the relevant time as per the Rules prevailing the

construction was possible within a distance of 100 meters.

Ext. P13 is dated 02.08.2008 issued by one Col. P.K.

Vasudevan, addressed to the Municipality indicating that

they have no objection for granting permission for

construction of Ground Floor + 13 Floor + Terrace of

residential flats in T.S.No. 456 in Cannanore Municipality.

They have also approved the plan which was enclosed along

with the application. That being the situation, the arguments

of the Additional Advocate General as well as the party

respondent that subsequently there is a change in the Rules

governing the construction of structures and the distance

factor is enhanced from 100 meters to 500 meters, will not

help the Government or the party respondent to contend for

the position that the building permit has to be cancelled. It

is not in dispute that the building permit had been granted

W.P. (C) NO. 25537 OF 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                              8</span>

with reference to the Rule position governing as on 2008

and admittedly the change had occurred only after the

issuance of the building permit on 12.08.2008. This is

evident from Ext. R2(b) issued on 03.04.2012 which states

that as per the latest instructions from the Higher Head

Quarters, issuance of NOC for any construction in respect of

multi-storied building, the minimum distance from defence

land will be 500 meters. Apparently this instruction had

been received after Ext. P1 dated 31.03.2011 when the

building permit was even renewed. Therefore such a

contention is not available to the Government as well as the

party respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      12. In regard to the allegation of violation of CRZ

norms, there is no clarity in the objection statements filed

by the Government or the party respondent. There is a

contention that the property is situated in CRZ II area. But

there is no material to indicate the same. However, this is a

matter to be enquired into by the appropriate authority and

cannot be decided at this point of time.
</p>
<p id="p_15">W.P. (C) NO. 25537 OF 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                9</span>

</p><p id="p_16">      13. In regard to the allegation that the water source

of the neighbouring locality will be affected on account of

the building being constructed, cannot be a reason for

revoking a building permit already granted. When a building

permit is granted it is supposed to have issued in terms with

the Rules governing the issue. That the construction of the

building will affect the water source in the area can never be

an issue which will be considered while issuing a building

permit. For that reason itself Rule 16 cannot be invoked by

stating that the water source will be affected. That apart

petitioners had obtained consent from the Pollution Control

Board as evident from Ext. P15 which includes the consent

to establish issued under the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of

Pollution) Act</a> as well. That apart if the Ground Water

Department has any objection in respect of drawing of water

by the petitioners from the said property it is open for them

to take appropriate proceedings under the Kerala Ground

Water (Control and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_2">Regulation) Act</a>, 2002. But the learned

counsel for        petitioners submits that the property in

W.P. (C) NO. 25537 OF 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                               10</span>

question is not a notified area. At any rate it is a matter

pending before the Division Bench in W.A. No. 1109 of 2012

and that issue is not considered now.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      14. On an overall consideration of the aforesaid

factual circumstances involved in the matter, it is clear that

the Government had invoked Rule 18(5) and directed the

Secretary to stop the construction. The materials relied

upon by the Government in this regard does not seem to be

satisfactory to invoke such a drastic step. But the question

is whether this Court can interfere with a stop memo issued

on the basis of Ext. P8. As far as the Secretary is concerned

he is under obligation to comply with the directions issued

by the Government in terms of Rule 18(5). That apart even

otherwise the Secretary had issued Ext. P7 stop memo.

</p><p id="p_18">      15. Going by the factual circumstances involved in the

matter and in the light of my findings as stated above I do

not think that this is a fit case in which the Secretary or the

Government was justified in stopping the construction of a

multi-storied complex without a clear understanding of the

W.P. (C) NO. 25537 OF 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                 11</span>

factual circumstances involved in the matter. If at all the

Secretary has to consider this issue, a proper notice has to

be    issued     to   the  petitioners  narrating   the alleged

deficiencies, they have to be heard in the matter and then a

final decision can be taken. Without any material on record

or without any material suggesting that there is a possible

violation of any of the Rules governing the issue, stopping

construction of an activity which is already permitted as

early as in 2008 is bad in law and is liable to be set aside. In

that view of the matter, I am of the opinion that the

impugned orders are liable to be set aside. However

reserving the right of the Secretary to initiate fresh action if

it is felt that there is any violation of the building permit or

they can invoke Rule 16 of the KMBR. However any such

action shall precede a proper notice and only after hearing

of the petitioners and other connected parties that such

drastic steps should be taken.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      In the result the writ petition is allowed and Ext. P7, P8

and P9 are quashed, reserving the right of the Secretary of

petitioners and after hearing them and any other interested

parties.
