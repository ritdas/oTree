                                    ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The complainant has filed this complaint on the averments that

opposite party No.1 who is a Registered Cooperative Society

registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_2">Societies Registration Act</a> XXI of 1860 whereas

opposite parties No.2 &amp; 3 are its Chairman and Vice Chairman. Apart

from other objectives, they are providing housing facilities and had

advertised for their project in the name and style of 'Sherwood

Estate', in Sector 113, Mohali. The complainant being interested to

purchase the residential plot for his own personal living, booked the

same on the basis of advertisement given by the opposite parties.

He visited their office situated at Mohali. The complainant alongwith

the application paid a sum of Rs.12,00,000/- and Rs.20,00,000/- vide

receipt dated 06.06.2011 and Rs.21,000/- towards Membership fee.

He also paid a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- to the opposite party. Receipt of

the same was misplaced but opposite party No.4 confirmed the

receipt of payment of Rs.34,50,000/-.       Opposite parties allotted a

residential plot measuring 250 sq. yards at the rate of Rs.13,800/- per

sq.yards in favour of the complainant. As per clause 9 of the

allotment letter, opposite parties assured him to hand over the

possession of the plot within a period of one and half year from the

date of booking i.e. 26.04.2011. However, they failed to develop the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Consumer Complaint No.180 of 2016                                    3</span>


said land as per the terms and conditions mentioned in the allotment

letter and to hand over the possession of the plot within the stipulated

period. Rather, they decided to hand over the project to Opposite

party No.4 i.e. RKM Housing Ltd., Mohali and pleaded that the said

project will be started immediately and the possession shall be

handed over to the buyers within a short period. The complainant

signed the consent letter for the MoU dated 15.07.2014 executed

between opposite parties No.1 to 3 and opposite party No.4 with the

understanding that the possession of the plot shall be handed over to

the complainant shortly.            However, the revised allotment letter

No.RKM/016 dated NIL was issued to the complainant by opposite

party No.4 in the month of November, 2014, wherein they stated that

the possession shall be handed over within a period of 20 months. In

the month of December, 2015, the complainant came to know that

GMADA had issued a letter to the Punjab Govt. stating that opposite

parties No.1 to 3 in connivance with opposite party No.4 are grabbing

the money from the general public and have failed to complete the

project.   Alleging deficiency in service, the present complaint has

been filed by the complainant seeking refund of Rs.34,71,000/-

alongwith interest at the rate of 18% per annum; Rs.5,00,000/- as

compensation towards mental harassment; and Rs.50,000/- towards

litigation expenses; Rs.1,00,000/- towards counsel fee;

</p><p id="p_2">2.           Upon notice, Sh.A.S.Verma, Advocate, had filed his

power of attorney on behalf of opposite parties No.1 to 3 but he has

filed the written statement only on behalf of opposite parties No.1 and

</p><p id="p_3">3. In their written reply they raised the objections that the complaint is

not maintainable in the present form against the opposite parties as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Consumer Complaint No.180 of 2016                                 4</span>


he did not come to the Forum with clean hands and suppressed the

material facts and that the complainant failed to make the payment as

per the schedule given along with the allotment letter. On merits, it

was admitted that the complainant deposited a sum of Rs.21,000/- as

Membership fee with the opposite parties which is not refundable.

The complainant also paid Rs.12,00,000/- on 26.04.2011 and

Rs.20,00,000/- on 06.06.2011 and in total he has paid Rs.32,00,000/-

. It was denied that he paid an amount of Rs.34,50,000/-. It was

admitted that the complainant was allotted a residential plot

measuring 250 square yards at the rate of Rs.13,800/- per square

yard in their project Sherwood Estates in Mohali and had assured him

to hand over the possession within one and half year but it was

subject to the payment of all the dues. Opposite party is a society

and not a colonizer and the work of the society is being run with

smooth payment of the members and in case members make default,

the future of the society will spoil on account of non-payment by the

complainant and other members. Thus, the opposite party could not

get   the   CLU     from    GMADA   and   fee   was   increased   from

Rs.1,29,00,000/- to Rs.2,40,00,000/-. When the opposite parties were

not in a position to take further steps then the management decided

to hand over the project to opposite party No.4 i.e. RKM Housing.

The agreement dated 15.07.2014 was signed between opposite

parties No.1 to 3 and opposite party No.4 and then project was

transferred to opposite party No.4 who issued a revised allotment

letter to the complainant. The complainant consented for transfer of

the project to opposite party No.4. As per clause 7 of the revised

allotment letter the amount so paid by the complainant to these
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Consumer Complaint No.180 of 2016                                      5</span>


opposite parties was transferred to opposite party No.4.          It was

denied that there was any deficiency in service on part of the

opposite parties. Complaint is without any merit and it be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_4">3.           Notice was issued to opposite party No.4. After receipt of

the notice opposite party No.4 did not file the written reply within the

stipulated period of 45 days as provided under <a href="/doc/156059896/" id="a_3">Section 13(1)(a)</a> of the

Act. Therefore, vide order dated 30.09.2016, it was ordered that the

written reply of opposite party No.4 cannot be taken on the record.

</p><p id="p_5">4.    The parties were allowed to lead their respective evidence.

</p>
<p id="p_7">6.    We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have

carefully gone through the allegations as alleged in the complaint,

written version filed by the opposite parties, evidences and

documents placed on the record as well as written arguments filed by

the opposite party No.1 &amp; 3.
</p>
<p id="p_8">Misc. Application No.1542 of 2017

</p><p id="p_9">7.    During the pendency of the complaint opposite parties No.1 &amp; 3

moved an application for dismissal of the present complaint qua

opposite parties No.1 &amp; 3 because opposite party No.1 is the Society

and opposite party No.3 is Vice Chairman, according to <a href="/doc/1509263/" id="a_4">Section 13</a> of

the Societies Registration Act 1860, provided as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "In the event of any dispute arising among the said governing

      body or the members of the society, the adjustment of its affairs

      shall be referred to the principal court of original civil jurisdiction

      of the district in which the chief building of the society is situate

      and the court shall make such order in the matter as it shall

      deem requisite."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">8.    Therefore, this Commission has no jurisdiction to decide the

matter between the society and members. To support this proposition

he has referred the judgment reported in 2009(5) BCR 201 titled as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Consumer Complaint No.180 of 2016                                   7</span>


General Manager, Telecom Vs. M.Krishnan &amp; Anr., wherein it has

been held that Consumer Forum does not have the jurisdiction as

there is a special remedy in <a href="/doc/1471289/" id="a_5">Section 7B</a> of Telegraph Act regarding

disputes in respect of telephone bills. Later on, the Hon'ble National

Commission had circulated the instructions that under <a href="/doc/76226/" id="a_6">Section 3</a> of

the Act an additional remedy has been provided.            Therefore, the

Consumer Fora, have the jurisdiction as held in II (2014) CPJ 38

titled as "GMTD, BSNL, Shillong Vs. KUM.D.Phawa, Mangpoh".

Moreover, the provisions under the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_7">Telegraph Act</a> are entirely

different than the provisions under the <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_8">Cooperative Societies Act</a>,

therefore, this judgment will not apply to the facts of the present case.

He has further referred to the judgment reported in 2013(4) C.P.J.

333 titled as Anjana Abraham Vs. Managing Director of

Koothattukulam Farmers Service Co-operative Bank Ltd., in

which, there was a dispute between a member and Cooperative

society regarding the settlement of account. In that event, it was

observed that if there is alternative remedy under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_9">Section 69</a> of the

Act, the complaint was rightly dismissed by the Consumer Fora. He

further referred to a judgment reported in 2015(2) C.P.J. 207, titled as

K.D.Kothiyal Vs. Phool Kaul &amp; Ors. in that case, there was a

dispute between two members of the society. In that context, it was

held that consumer complaint is not maintainable.           He has also

referred to a judgment reported in 2016(4) C.P.J. 711 titled as

Rajendra      Singh     Verma       Vs.   Committee   of   Management,

Indraprastha Sahakari Awas Samiti Limited &amp; Anr. It was a

dispute regarding the outstanding amount. The matter was settled by

the arbitrator. In that context, it was held by the Hon'ble Bench that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> Consumer Complaint No.180 of 2016                                    8</span>


once the matter is settled by the Arbitrator then the complaint before

the National Commission is barred by principles of res judicata. He

has referred to another judgment reported in 2016(2) C.P.J. 42 titled

as "Hanuman Sahakari Pani Pruvatha Sanstha Maryadit &amp; Ors.

Vs. Ramchandra Bapuso Khade &amp; Ors.". In that case, there was a

dispute between the opposite party and society regarding loss

caused on account of non-supply of water for irrigation of land. In

that context, it was held by the Hon'ble National Commission that

Consumer Fora has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.

Whereas, learned counsel for the complainant referred to the

judgment of Hon'ble National Commission reported in 2017(1) CLT

73 titled as "Raj Kumar Goyal Vs. Malwinder Singh Battu &amp; Ors."

In this case, opposite purchased a land and assured to its members

to allot flats but failed to give possession. In that context, it was held

that even if the issue is to be handled by the Cooperative Department

under cooperative law, jurisdiction of Consumer Fora to deal with

these matters is not barred. In that case, personal liability of the

office bearers of Cooperative Society will also be there. In that case,

a Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in III (1996) CPJ 1

(SC) titled as "Fair Air Engineers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. N.K.Modi" was also

relied upon. In another judgment reported in IV(2015) C.P.J., Pg.16

titled as H.R. Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. Vandana Sanjay Pandya &amp; Ors, it

was observed that <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_10">Cooperative Societies Act</a> does not oust the

jurisdiction of <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_11">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986. A specific provision

under <a href="/doc/830756/" id="a_12">Section 3</a> of the Act has been provided. The same is

reproduced as under:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> Consumer Complaint No.180 of 2016                                  9</span><p id="p_11">


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "3. Act not in derogation of any other law: The provisions of
      the Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the
      provisions of any other law for the time being in force."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_12">9.    This Section is in addition to and not in derogation of provisions

under any other Act. Where the Cooperative Society has assured for

the services after taking the amount from its members then it falls

within the ambit of services and where the society is in default of

services then the matter is covered under the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_13">Consumer Protection

Act</a>, 1986 and Consumer Foras have the jurisdiction to entertain the

complaints. Therefore, we do not agree with the plea raised by the

counsel for opposite parties No. 1 &amp; 3 that the complaint against

opposite parties No.1 &amp; 3 be dismissed. The application is without

merit and it is hereby dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">Main Complaint

</p><p id="p_14">10.   It is an admitted fact that opposite parties No.1 &amp; 3 through its

office bearers had launched a project 'Sherwood Estates' at Sector

113, Mohali.       On the basis of advertisements, the complainant

booked one plot measuring 250 square yards with the opposite

parties at the rate of Rs.13,800/- per sq. yards and the same was

allotted to the complainant. It's total cost comes to Rs.34,50,000/-

and the entire payments has been made by the complainant as

pleaded in the complaint, receipts of the amount Rs.32,21,000/-

inclusive of Rs.21,000/- as Membership fee, Ex.C-3 to Ex.C-6 have

been tendered. He has also referred to the revised allotment letter

issued by RKM Housing Limited, in which it is admitted that total

payment of Rs.34,50,000/- has been received by the opposite parties.

The IDC charges of Rs.3,75,000/- has been shown which is to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> Consumer Complaint No.180 of 2016                                        10</span>


paid by the complainant.            Through this revised allotment letter, it

makes it clear that the complainant was bound to pay Rs.3,75,000/-

to opposite parties No.1 &amp; 3. As per the allotment letter issued by

opposite parties No.1 &amp; 3, Ex.C-7 and according to clause 9 of the

same, they were to hand over the possession of the plot to the

allottee within the period of one and half year.             Accordingly, the

possession was to be given by December, 2013 but it was not made.

Then, there was a memorandum of understanding signed between

opposite parties No.1 to 3 and opposite party No.4, Ex.OP1&amp;3/4.

Opposite parties No.1 to 3 decided to handover the entire project to

opposite party No.4. Apart from this, he took over all the assets and

liabilities to develop it for the Members/Allottees vide agreement

dated 15.07.2014. On the basis of that, opposite party No.4 issued a

revised allotment letter No.RKM/016 dated NIL, Ex.OP1&amp;3/5 to the

complainant, wherein it was mentioned that the possession of the flat

would be delivered within a period of 20 months, but the project was

not completed. In reply to the letter written by Mr.Vishal Gupta, to

GMADA in open Sangat Darshan; Ex.C-9, it has been stated that as

per report M/s Sherwood Estates through its Chairman Sh.Parampal

Singh Sidhu and Vice Chairman Sh.Parneet Bhardwaj and Managing

Director Sh.Kanwaljeet Singh Walia of M/s R.K.M. Housing has

connived with each other and without seeking any permission started

enrolling and collecting money from the members of the said society

and, as such, have violated the provisions of Section 4 of the PAPRA

Act, 1995. Section 4 of the PAPRA is provides as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">    "4. Issuing of Advertisement or Prospectus:-

</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">11.     During the course of arguments, counsel for opposite parties

No.1 &amp; 3 failed to convince us how they have complied with the

provisions of Section 4 of PAPRA, 1995.             In case any person

launched any project without complying with <a href="/doc/733045/" id="a_14">Section 4</a> of the Act is

unfair trade practice. Therefore, without complying with <a href="/doc/733045/" id="a_15">Section 4</a>,

even applications cannot be called for from the members for the

project. Even when the project was transferred to opposite party No.4

they were not having the requisite permissions from the concerned

departments. Opposite party No.4 has now taken the CLU from

Senior Town Planner vide their letter dated 02.12.2016, Ex.OP-4/6.

Clause 9 of the letter issued by Senior Town Planner is as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">        "(ix) Applicant shall obtain NOC from P.P.C.B. under the

        Water Prevention and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">Pollution Act</a>, 1970, Municipal

      Solid Waste Management and Handling Rules, 2000 or any

      other relevant Act before undertaking any development at site."</blockquote><p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">      However, opposite party No.4 has also not placed on the record

the requisite Certificate obtained by them from the concerned

department. Therefore, we are of the view that if opposite party No.4

did not obtain the requisite certificates from all concerned

departments referred in Ex.OP-4/6 then how they can start

developing of project.
</p>
<p id="p_18">12.          Therefore, we are of the opinion that there is unfair trade

practice as well as deficiency in service on the part of the opposite

parties. The project was transferred to opposite party No.4 to

complete the same and they had undertaken to complete within a

period of 20 months but nothing was done on their part and opposite

party No.4 failed to complete the project within the stipulated period.

</p><p id="p_19">13.          If this is the situation when the opposite party failed to

obtain the necessary permissions from the concerned authorities and

to complete the project within the stipulated time the consumer

cannot be allowed to suffer for an indefinite period and he is entitled

to refund of his amount. It has been so held in 2007(2) CLT 440 titled

as 'Kamal Sood Vs. DLF Universal Ltd.' and 2014(2) CLT 401 titled

as    'Brigadier     B.S.Taunque    (Retd.)    &amp;   Others    Vs.    M/s

Sangeethashree Builders &amp; Developers International Private

Limited &amp; Others'. Similar orders have been passed by this

Commission in F.A. No.231 of 2016 decided on 12.10.2016 titled as

M/s R.K.M. Housing Ltd. Vs. Smt. Geeta Bhatia &amp; Anr. and F.A.

No.230 of 2016 decided on 12.10.2016 titled as M/s R.K.M. Housing

</p><p id="p_21">14.              No other point was argued by the counsel for the parties.

Accordingly, we accept the complaint and ordered:

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">         (ii)    to pay Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation on account of

                 unfair trade practice on the part of the opposite parties by

                 giving false assurances to develop the area within the

                 stipulated period of two years which causes mental

                 tension and harassment to the complainant;

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">         (iii)   to pay Rs.21,000/- as litigation costs.

<p id="p_22">15.              The above directions be complied with within 45 days

from the date of receipt of certified copy of the order.

period due to heavy pendency of court cases.
