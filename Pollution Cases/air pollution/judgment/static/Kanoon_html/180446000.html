  21st July, 2016 passed by respondent no.2­Collector of
  Electricity Duty, Gandhinagar whereby exemption from
  payment of electricity duty under the Gujarat Electricity
  Duty Act, 1958 (here­in­after referred to as "the Act") to the
  petitioner has been denied.
</p>

<p id="p_13">3. Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner is a company
  incorporated under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>
  1956 and a wholly owned subsidiary of Air Liquide
  International, a French company and a world leader in
  extraction, production and supply of gases for industry,
  health       and    environment     purposes   with     world        wide
  presence.
</p>

<p id="p_14">  3.1)        The petitioner was earlier engaged in providing
  facilitation for manufacturing of nitrogen gas in the State of
  Gujarat and had been undertaking its business activities
  on site at the premises of Gujarat Guardian Limited at
  Ankleshwar and E.I. DuPont at Savli under an agreement
  on a build, own operate and maintain basis since 1996. As
  per the terms of agreement between the parties, the
  manufacturing plant was set up on the land acquired by
  the respective companies with whom the agreement is
  entered into and all infrastructure and other resources
  including supply of power was made by such companies at
  their costs and all dues thereof were also paid by them.
  Moreover, all the requisite registrations/permissions for
  installation       of plant and machineries, including the
  permission for electricity connection from respondent no.4­
  Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company were also taken by the said
  companies for their respective premises. The petitioner was

entitled to monthly service fees only and entire production
of nitrogen gas was consumed by such companies.
</p>

<p id="p_15">3.2)      It is the case of the petitioner that as per the
contractual          understanding        between      the     parties,        the
petitioner         availed   registration     as   a   "manufacturer               ­
supplier of the industrial gases" under the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_2">Central Excise Act</a>, 1944, as the petitioner was obligated to
raise symbolic invoices for such supply of gas that is
generated and manufactured at the premises for their own
consumption. The electric duty connections were applied
by such companies in their own names and consequently
electricity duty exemptions under the provisions of the Act,
had also been availed and enjoyed by them on account of
establishment of industrial units.
</p>

<p id="p_16">3.3) In the year 2009, petitioner decided to establish its
own independent industrial undertaking for carrying out
various activities like extraction, production and supply of
liquid gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, argon etc. at
Jhagadia, District Bharuch as a medium scale industry
and due sanction was obtained from the Ministry of
Industry and Commerce, New Delhi.
</p>

<p id="p_17">3.4) The petitioner was allotted premises by the Gujarat
Industrial Development Corporation                     in the industrial
estate at Jhagadia, District Bharuich and the petitioner
obtained all other requisite permissions, sanctions and
registration for the functioning of its independent unit
under various Acts as under :

</p>

<p id="p_26">3.5) It is the case of the petitioner that after receipt of the
aforesaid          approvals   an     independent    "New        Industrial
Undertaking" came to be established at Jhagadia, for
which fresh capital was introduced by the petitioner to
purchase new machinery and equipments and                      completely
new plant with advanced technology was installed. The
petitioner had invested approximately Rs. 68 crores for
setting up of the independent unit and the industrial
production in the said independent unit commenced on
25th November, 2009.
</p>

<p id="p_27">3.6)      The petitioner filed an application on 28 th January,
2010 before the respondent no.2               under the prescribed
Form­E seeking a "Certificate of Eligibility for Exemption of

Electricity Duty" under <a href="/doc/15811120/" id="a_9">section 3(2)(vii)</a> of the Act read with
Rule 11(1) of the Bombay Electricity Duty (Gujarat) Rules,
1986 ("the Rules" for short) as the independent unit
established by the petitioner at Jhagadia was a "New
Industrial Undertaking" within the meaning of the Act so
as to entitle the petitioner for exemption from payment of
duty for the first five years from the date of commencement
of commercial production in the independent unit of the
petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_28">3.7) It is the case of the petitioner that petitioner was only
engaged in production of nitrogen gas at the premises in
Ankleshwar and Savli in the industrial unit of the
respective companies, but after setting up its own new
undertaking           at    Jhagadia,       petitioner      also      started        to
manufacture oxygen gas and as such, it is the case of the
petitioner that petitioner not only made fresh investment in
plant and machinery but also engaged in the production of
a    completely            new   product         which     was        not      being
manufactured at the industrial units of its clients'
companies.

<p id="p_29">3.8)       The petitioner thereafter, supplied various details
with regard to the purchase of plants and machineries as
well     as        investment    made           by   the   petitioner        in     its
independent new unit at Jhagadia.
</p>

<p id="p_30">3.9) However, respondent no.2 by impugned order dated
18th November, 2010, rejected the application of the
petitioner to grant exemption from the electricity duty by
considering the independent unit of the petitioner as a new

industrial undertaking within the purview of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_31">3.10) The petitioner therefore, being aggrieved by the order
dated 18th November, 2010 preferred an appeal before
respondent         no.3­appellate     authority   under        the       Act.
Respondent No.3­appellate authority however, by order
dated 29th May, 2013 dismissed the appeal filed by the
petitioner. The petitioner thereafter preferred, Special Civil
Application No.16374/2013 before this Court wherein ad
interim relief restraining the respondents from initiating
coercive recovery of electricity duty from the petitioner was
granted by order dated 25th October, 2013. This Court by
judgment and order dated 31st August, 2015 ordered to set
aside the order passed by the appellate authority dated 29th
May, 2013 on the ground that said order was thoroughly
non speaking and unreasoned and remanded the matter
back to the original authority respondent no.2 to ascertain
certain limited factual aspects. The operative portion of the
order dated 31st August, 2015 reads as under :
</p>
<p id="p_32">"24. It would be necessary for the authority to ascertain as
to whether the plant and / or machinery previously used at
the sites of the clients or part of it have been installed by
the petitioner at the Jhagadia unit and/or used for and in
the production activity or not and whether, on strength of
relevant documents the petitioner has established that (a)
the unit at Jhagadia is set up by new plant and machinery;
and (b) the plant and machinery at any of the sites of its
clients i.e. the plant and machinery previously used in
India are not used in setting up the unit at Jhagadia and /
or are not used in production process and whether
sufficient and cogent and satisfactory documentary
evidence to support its said assertion is made available by
the petitioner.

<p id="p_33">24.1 Thus, for the said purpose, i.e. for ascertaining the
factual aspect, the matter is required to be remitted to the
original authority who will call for relevant documents and
material from the petitioner to ascertain the said factual
aspect (if such material is already available on record
before him) and if he is satisfied upon verifying the relevant
documents and material and after granting opportunity of
hearing to the petitioner that the unit at Jhagadia is set up
by new plant and machinery and not with the plant and
machinery or part of it previously used in India, then, the
authority will pass appropriate fresh order in light of the
discussion in this decision.
</p><p id="p_34">For the said purpose i.e. for remitting the matter to the
original authority for determining the aforesaid aspect
impugned orders are set aside with the direction to
consider and decide the petitioners application afresh
having regard to the aspects discussed and decided in
present decision and after verifying relevant documents
and after hearing the petitioner."
</p>

<p id="p_35">3.11) The petitioner however, preferred Letters Patent
Appeal No.1/2016 though the matter was remanded                                 to
respondent         no.2   for     de     novo   consideration,          certain
observations were made in the judgment that were
indicative in nature and were binding on the original
authority. Division Bench in its order dated 6th January,
2016       clarified   such       aspects      and   directed      that       the
observations made in the judgment dated 31st August,
2015 would not prejudice the rights of either side and the
matter was remanded to respondent no.2 to take an
independent view of the matter in accordance with law.
</p>

<p id="p_36">3.12)       The petitioner therefore, approached respondent
no.2 and filed detailed representation/submissions dated
15th February, 2016 along with all relevant documents in
support of its case that the unit established at Jhagadia

by the petitioner that both the plants at the site of Gujarat
Guardian Limited and E.I. DuPont were in existence and
were        operating/functioning               and     therefore,        it     was
contractually, practically and legally impossible to take out
any assets/machinery installed at such units and utilise
the same in the new unit of the petitioner at Jhagadia. The
petitioner also produced details of investments made in the
unit at Jhagadia of about Rs. 68 crores along with relevant
purchase orders/invoices for purchase of plant and
machinery and certificate of the Chartered Accountant in
support there of.

<p id="p_37">3.13)       Respondent No.2 after providing opportunity of
hearing to the petitioner on 17th May, 2016 called upon the
petitioner to place on record certain other documents to
establish that no plant/machinery were transferred from
the premises of Gujarat Guardian Limited and E.I. DuPont
to    the      unit    of      petitioner       at    Jhagadia      even       after
commencement of commercial production at the unit at
Jhagadia in August 2009. The petitioner thereafter,
provided           requisite     details        by     way     of     additional
representation dated 7th June, 2016 to point out that the
petitioner has established its unit at Jhagadia without
transfer or utilising any plant or machinery at the aforesaid
two companies. Respondent No.2 however, again reiterated
its earlier order and rejected the application for grant of
exemption from the electricity duty to the unit of the
petitioner at Jhagadia by impugned order dated 21st July,
2016.

Hon'ble the Acting Chief Justice Mr. Jayant Patel, as he

be understood in terms of increase in capacity or slight
modification in the product which may enhance the

considered as disqualifying factor for the new unit which is
based upon new technology for altogether a new product
warranting fresh investment, new machinery and plants
and technical knowhow. It is also relevant to note that if
the Unit is changing its technology for better result of the
same product than in that case such change and
investment might not be eligible for duty exemption. The
petitioner had in fact established it case for seeking
exemption before the respondent no.1 as its contention

found that the view taken by the learned Single Judge in
Special Civil Application No.17038/2012 calls for no

establishes that the unit at Jhagadia established by the

expansion of the existing business of the petitioner as the
petitioner has started a new unit and is producing new
product in the form of gases other than nitrogen gas

committed an error by holding that Jhagadia unit of the
petitioner         although   meets       with   the     requirement             of
explanation (a) and (b) given under <a href="/doc/15811120/" id="a_10">section 3(2)(vii)</a> of the

producing industrial gas in the State and hence does not
meet with the requirement of explanation (c) given under
<a href="/doc/15811120/" id="a_11">section 3(2)(vii)</a> of the Act. It was therefore, held that the
petitioner is not entitled to exemption from electricity duty
since the unit of petitioner at Jhagadia is an expansion of
its existing business or undertaking at the State of Gujarat
and therefore, it does not qualify as a new industrial
undertaking pursuant to explanation (c) given under

<a href="/doc/15811120/" id="a_12">section 3(2)(vii)</a> of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_46">6.4) Learned Senior Advocate for the petitioner submitted
that the Act was amended with effect from 1st April 2013,
whereby even an additional unit of a company is eligible for
exemption          from   payment           of   electricity     duty        with
retrospective effect. However, respondent no.2 rejected
such submission on the ground that benefit of exemption
is available to eligible additional unit of the industrial
undertaking qualifying for the same as provided in the
Amended Act and which has commenced after the date of
the said amendment i.e. 1st April, 2013 with prospective
effect only. It was therefore, submitted that the impugned
order dated 21st July, 2016 is contrary to the settled legal
position as held by this Court in case of                      Kores (India)
Limited Textile Division(supra) which is also confirmed
by Division Bench of this Court.

<p id="p_48">"16. The keywords in the statutory scheme are "generates
energy either singly or jointly with any other industrial
undertaking for its own use or as the case may be, for the
use of industrial undertaking which are jointly generating
the energy." We have to look into the facts of the present
case to find out as to whether the statutory conditions
enumerated above are satisfied in the facts of the present
case or not. The appellant no.1 is a separate registered
company which holds 42% equity shares of the appellant
no.2. The appellant no.2 has been constituted as a Special
Purpose Vehicle for generating electricity. The appellant
no.2 is a generating company within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/358102/" id="a_16">Section 2(4A)</a> of Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948. The
submission which has been pressed by the counsel for the
appellant is that both the appellant no.1 and appellant
no.2 are generating energy jointly for the use of industrial
undertaking which are jointly generating the energy."
</p>

<p id="p_49">6.6) He further relied upon the observations made by the
Apex Court in the following paragraphs :
</p>
<p id="p_50">"18. Even assuming appellant no.1 and appellant no.2 are
jointly generating the energy for the use of industrial
undertaking which are jointly generating the energy, the
Gujarat Electricity Board to whom 300 MW has been
allocated cannot be held to be industrial undertaking
which is jointly generating the energy with appellant. The
Statutory scheme for grant of exemption has to be strictly
construed. The appellant no.2 is not jointly generating
energy with Gujarat Electricity Board and it is selling the
energy to the extent of 300 MW to Gujarat Electricity
Board. The conditions of the statutory provisions of <a href="/doc/15811120/" id="a_17">Section
3(2)(vii)(a)</a> are not fulfilled. The High Court has further held
that both ESL and EPL being distinct separate legal
entities merely because ESL might have 42% shares
holding in EPL, it cannot be said that ESL is generating
electricity jointly with EPL and EPL is generating electricity
jointly with ESL for use of electricity by ESL.

contained in <a href="/doc/15811120/" id="a_18">Section 3(2)(vii)(a)</a> can neither be tinkered
with nor diluted. Learned Counsel for the appellant
contends that the State Government had granted
permission to the ESSAR Power Plant to set up a
generating station as a special case and to supply power
generated by it to its sister concerned i.e. ESSAR Steel and
ESSAR Oil as a special case. The letter of the State
Government dated 05.06.1995 further stated that if there
is any excess power generated by EPL, the same may be
purchased by the Board at the price decided by the Board.
It is useful to extract the letter of permission dated
05.06.1995 issued by the State Government which was to
the following effect:­
"The Govt. has considered all the aspect on the above
matter and after careful consideration, has decided to
agree in principle to the demand of ESSAR Power Limited
to set up a generating station as a special case, and to
supply power generated by it to its sister concern, i.e.
ESSAR Gujarat, ESSAR Steels and ESSAR Oil again as a
special case only subject to fulfillment of requirements of
legal provisions as laid down under <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_19">Section 15</a>­A and 18­<a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_20">A
of the Electricity Supply Act</a> and with the express condition
that the power generated through this subject shall never
as sold outside the State or to any other person except as
mentioned above. Moreover, in case, the power generated
by EPL is to be wheeled, GEB shall decide the wheeling
rate according to the sound commercial principles. In
addition to this, if there is any excess power generated by
EPL, the each may be purchased by the Board, at a price
decided by the Board subject to the norms laid down by
GoI from to time.
</p><p id="p_52">It is, therefore, requested that GEB may take further
necessary action in the matter."
</p>

<p id="p_53">6.7) It was therefore, submitted that provisions of <a href="/doc/15811120/" id="a_21">section
3(2)(vii)</a> of the Act are required to be strictly construed as it
pertains to statutory scheme for grant of exemption and
the same can never be tinkered with nor diluted.

  November, 2015 in Civil Application (for condonation of
  delay) No. 12275/2015 with Letters Patent Appeal (Stamp)
  No. 1352/2015, wherein the Division Bench confirming the
  judgment of the learned Single Judge has observed as
  under :
</p>
<p id="p_55">  "6. We may record that it is not the case of the appellant
  that same machinery of the earlier existing unit is used for
  manufacturing of a new product. Rather, it is an admitted
  position that new machineries are purchased for
  establishing the manufacturing unit of hosiery cotton. Not
  only that, but the unit is separate and independent. It is
  not the case of the appellant that any unused machinery or
  unused capacity of the other unit is used for
  manufacturing activity of the present unit. The learned
  Single Judge found that when for a separate product by
  the very company separate unit including that of the
  machinery are purchased and established, it cannot be
  said that the same would fall in the definition of expansion
  as sought to be canvassed. In the decision of the Apex
  Court (supra), the Apex Court had specifically taken note of
  the aspect that there was addition in the production of
  portland cement by establishing new kiln and further idle
  capacity of crushers, cranes, packing machines, coal mills
  and raw mills of other unit were utilised for manufacturing
  of the additional capacity of portland cement. Under these
  circumstances, the decision upon which the reliance has
  been placed by the learned Government Pleader can hardly
  be made applicable to the facts of the present case when in
  the present case, undisputedly new machineries are
  purchased and no machinery of the existing unit is utilised
  coupled with the aspect that the manufacturing is of

situated at the premises of E.I. DuPont India Limited. He
relied upon Article No. (2.2.2) of the said Supply agreement
to point out that the costs, duties (Customs and Excise), all
taxes, charges (freight and insurance) etc. on the plant,
machinery and equipment required for the FLOXAL
SYSTEM will be borne and paid by the petitioner. He
further referred to Article no. (5) for payment to point out
that all payments under the agreement will become due for
payment            after     30       days      from        the        monthly
invoices/statement of account being furnished by the
petitioner to         E.I. DuPont India Limited. He referred to
Article No. (6.2) of the Supply agreement to submit that
FLOXAL SYSTEM will be designed for minimum 12 years
life    cycle      and     petitioner     would    be     responsible            for
maintenance           and     cost      of     whatever       maintenance/
replacement is required to maintain the life cycle of
FLOXAL          SYSTEM.       He     therefore,   submitted           that      the
petitioner was already having its plant and machinery in
the form of existing units though it may be at the premises
of     E.I. DuPont India Limited and other unit at the
premises of Gujarat Guardian Limited                    at Ankleshwar. It
was therefore, submitted that the petitioner was in the
business of manufacture and supply of industrial gases in
the State of Gujarat and therefore, the petitioner would not
be eligible for exemption from the electricity duty in view of
explanation (c) to <a href="/doc/15811120/" id="a_22">section 3(2)(vii)</a> of the Act as the unit of
the petitioner at Jhagadia is nothing but an expansion of
the existing business or undertaking in the State of
Gujarat. It was further submitted that in application made

petitioner has stated in column no.6 of the said application

He also invited attention to Article No. 5 of Nitrogen Supply

petitioner and Gujarat Guardian Limited to point out that

contract. He further relied upon Article No. 5.2 of the said
agreement to point out that the petitioner was responsible
for establishment of the unit. He also referred to Article No.
1 to submit that the contract was entered into to install,
own and operate FLOXAL plant in order to supply nitrogen
according to the specifications set forth in Article No. 2 of
the agreement between the parties. It was therefore,
submitted that the petitioner was already in the business
of manufacture/production of industrial gases in the State
of Gujarat and therefore, unit of the petitioner at Jhagadia
is only an expansion and only because the petitioner is
producing different types of gases at its unit at Jhagadia, it
cannot be said that the petitioner is engaged in different
business or is manufacturing/producing new project.
</p>

<p id="p_61">7.2) It was further submitted that on perusal of details
provided to the notes to the accounts of the petitioner for
the financial year 2009, sales details clearly show at page
no.     249        of   the   petition         that   the      petitioner          has
manufactured nitrogen gas. He also relied upon the annual
report for financial year 2010 to submit that the details of
the sales includes manufactured goods of nitrogen gas. It
was therefore, submitted that unit at Jhagadia established
by the petitioner is not entitled to exemption from
electricity duty and the impugned order passed by
respondent no.2 is based upon the facts of the case and,
therefore, no interference is required to be made.

Supreme Court Cases 394, wherein the Apex Court has
dealt with similar issue of granting exemption from levy of
electricity duty for new industrial undertaking. It was
submitted that the Apex Court after considering the
provisions of the Act has held as under :
</p>
<p id="p_63">"9. To appreciate the exception contained in Explanation 1
to clause (ii)(c) of <a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_24">Section 3</a> (2) (vii) (b),it is necessary to
understand the meaning of the word 'expansion'. The word
'expansion' is a noun derived from the word 'expand', which
is a verb. The word 'expand' means 'to become greater or
bigger in size, to spread out. As per the New Shorter Oxford
English Dictionary, the word 'expand' means 1.v.t. 'spread
or stretch (a thing) out 2. Become extended; spread out,
unfold. 3.v.t. Give full expression to 4.v.t. Widen the
boundaries of, increase the area, scope etc., of; enlarge,
dilate 5.v.i. Become greater in area, bulk, capacity etc;
become larger; increase the scope of one's activity or the
scale of operations of something; take in or go into a new
area of activity.
</p>
<p id="p_64">10. This meaning is to be applied to the facts on record.
The respondent company when it initially started had a
production capacity of 660 metric tonnes which was
subsequently increased to 1000 metric tonnes. In 1969­70
by setting up the alleged new unit, production capacity of
the company more than doubled. But as already seen this
unit is not self contained. It is not an independently viable
unit. It is dependant on various items of plant and
machinery and mills of the existing unit. Further
respondent was having two kilns and third is added. This
leads to the inevitable conclusion that the new unit is an
expansion of an existing undertaking in the State. Once it
is held to be a case of expansion, the claim for exemption
from electricity duty, set up by the respondent, completely
falls to the ground. In the facts and circumstances of the
case we are clearly of the view that the respondent is not
entitled to exemption from electricity duty. The High Court
failed to apply the real test which emerges from the
judgment of this Court in Textile Machinery Corporation
(supra) which was affirmed in a subsequent decision in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">                        Page 22 of 36</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71"> C/SCA/17182/2016                                CAV JUDGMENT</span>



Bajaj Tempo Ltd, Bombay Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax,
Bombay City­III, Bombay [1992 (3) SCC 78]. Accordingly,
this appeal is allowed. The judgment of the High Court
under appeal is set aside. The respondent is held not
entitled to exemption from electricity duty. In the facts of
the case there will be no order as to costs."
</p>

<p id="p_65">7.4) It was therefore, submitted that as facts of the case of
the petitioner is similar to that before the Apex Court, as
the petitioner is also having two plants and has added
third plant at Jhagadia, it is nothing but expansion of
existing undertaking in the State and therefore, once it is
the case of expansion, claim of exemption of electricity duty
cannot be granted.
</p>

<p id="p_66">7.5) With regard to the reliance placed on the decision in
case of Essar Steel India Limited and another (supra) on
behalf of the petitioner, it was submitted that in paragraph
no. 18 of the said decision, the Apex Court has held that
statutory scheme has to be strictly construed. It was
therefore, submitted that the said decision would be
helpful to the respondents and as it is held by respondent
no.2 by appreciation of documentary evidence on record
that unit of the petitioner at Jhagadia is nothing but an
expansion of its existing business in the State of Gujarat,
exemption from electricity duty is rightly denied.
</p>

<p id="p_67">7.6) With regard to reliance placed on the judgment of
learned Single Judge in case of        Kores (India) Limited
Textile Division (supra) on behalf of the petitioner, it was
submitted that in paragraph no. 24 of the said judgment, it
is categorically held that if unit is changing its technology
for better result of the same product than in that case such


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                       Page 23 of 36</span>

change and investment might not be eligible for duty
exemption. Reliance was also placed on the averments
made in the affidavit in reply filed on behalf of respondent
no.2 to submit that as far as the provision made in the
Amended Act with effect from 1st April, 2013 is concerned,
an additional unit of a company is eligible for exemption
from payment of electricity duty only when an application
under prescribed amended Form E is filed and as per the
Amended Act, such application would have to be filed
under <a href="/doc/15811120/" id="a_25">section 3(2)(vii)</a> of the Act, whereas the petitioner
has filed application dated 2nd February, 2010 under
prescribed Form E under <a href="/doc/15811120/" id="a_26">section 3(2)(vii)</a> of the Act and
therefore, the petitioner is not entitled to exemption from
levy of electricity duty retrospectively because as per the
Amended Act, additional unit may become eligible subject
to certain terms and conditions prescribed by the State
Government with prospective effect only.
</p>

<p id="p_68">7.7) It was further submitted that the unit of the
petitioner at Jhagadia cannot be termed as new industrial
undertaking as the petitioner was earlier engaged in
manufacturing of gases which was being provided to its
clients and therefore, it cannot be said that the petitioner
is engaged in the business of manufacturing of gases and
equipments for the first time in the State of Gujarat which
is a prerequisite for falling within the meaning of "new
industrial undertaking".
</p>

<p id="p_69">7.8) With regard to the submission made on behalf of the
petitioner that the petitioner has made fresh investment in
its unit at Jhagadia, it was submitted that the fact that an

  entity by establishment of a new industrial undertaking
  when expands its existing business, every creation in
  business requires new investment and therefore, it cannot
  be considered as new industrial undertaking under the
  provisions of the Act. It was therefore, submitted that as
  the petitioner was already running the business in the
  State of Gujarat since 1996 and when it started its unit at
  Jhagadia in the year 2009, it would not mean that the
  petitioner has set­up new industrial undertaking under the
  provisions of <a href="/doc/15811120/" id="a_27">section 3(2)(vii)</a> of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_70">8. Having considered the submissions made by both the sides
  as well as perusing all the documents produced on record
  by the petitioner, the following facts emerge :
</p>

<p id="p_71">  1) The petitioner started its business activity in the State
  of    Gujarat      since   1996      by    establishing       plant        for
  manufacturing of nitrogen gas at the premises of Gujarat
  Guardian Limited at Ankleshwar and E.I. DuPont at Savli.
</p>

<p id="p_72">  2)      The petitioner was raising invoices for supply of
  nitrogen gas as per the terms and conditions of the Supply
  agreement between the petitioner and aforesaid two
  companies.
</p>

<p id="p_73">  3) In the year 2009, the petitioner with an investment of
  Rs. 68 crores in the new plant and machinery established
  unit at Jhagadia for manufacturing different types of gases
  with the use of fresh capital, state of art new machineries
  and equipments.

<p id="p_74">9. On the basis of documentary evidence produced on record
  at the time of hearing, which were also part of the record
  with        respondent    no.2,           along    with        additional
  representations made by the petitioner on 15th February,
  2016 and 7th February, 2016, pursuant to the order dated
  6th January, 2016 passed by this Court in Letters Patent
  Appeal No.1/2016, it clearly shows that none of the plant
  and machinery which was used by Gujarat Guardian
  Limited at Ankleshwar and E.I. DuPont at Savli. have been
  used by the petitioner for establishing its unit at Jhagadia.
</p>

<p id="p_75">10.       On the basis of the documents produced by                          the
  petitioner on record it is established that unit at Jhagadia
  is set up by new plant and machinery and plant and
  machinery at any site of the clients of the petitioner are not
  used in setting up the unit at Jhagadia.

<p id="p_94">12.       The        short    question      therefore,   which       arises        for
  consideration of this Court is that whether after remand of
  the case by this Court in the year 2015, the petitioner has
  been able to demonstrate that whether the plant and
  machineries at the unit at Jhagadia have been utilised or
  used in the production activity previously or not and
  whether such plant and machinery is new machinery, as
  the remand was made by this Court to ascertain this fact.
  If the answer to such inquiry is in the affirmative, then the
  question of consideration as to whether unit at Jhagadia is
  expansion of the existing unit or it is a new industrial unit
  would be a futile exercise.
</p>

<p id="p_95">13.       However, respondent no. 2 has not disputed the fact
  that the unit of the petitioner at Jhagadia is not formed by
  the splitting up or the reconstruction of a business or
  undertaking already in existence in the State or is not
  formed by transfer to a new business or undertaking of a
  building, machinery or plant previously used in India for
  any industrial purpose, of such value in relation to total
  value      of      the     aforesaid     investments,      as      the       State
  Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette
  specify, meaning thereby, that clauses (a) and (b) given
  under <a href="/doc/15811120/" id="a_32">section 3(2)(vii)</a> of the Act are fulfilled by the
  petitioner.

  the case of the petitioner vis­a­vis as to whether there is
  expansion of the existing business or undertaking in the
  State of Gujarat but unfortunately respondent no.2 has
  applied clause (c) to explanation of <a href="/doc/15811120/" id="a_33">section 3(2)(vii)</a> of the
  Act and rejected the claim of the petitioner for exemption
  from electricity duty applying clause (c) of the explanation
  holding that the unit of the petitioner at Jhagadia is
  nothing       but   an   expansion         of   the   existing       unit       or
  undertaking in the State of Gujarat.
</p>

<p id="p_97">15.       Thus from the facts emerging on record, it is clear
  that the petitioner has not used any of the plant and
  machinery at the unit at Jhagadia which was previously
  used by the petitioner either at the unit in the premises of
  Gujarat Guardian Limited at Ankleshwar or E.I. DuPont at
  Savli. Therefore, the only question which is required to be
  considered is as to whether establishing unit at Jhagadia
  would amount to expansion of the business or undertaking
  of the petitioner or not?
</p>

<p id="p_98">16.       So far as issue of expansion is concerned, the same is
  no more res integra in view of decision of this Court in case
  of Kores (India) Limited Textile Division(supra), wherein
  it is held as under :

<p id="p_99">  "20. The close reading of provisions and explanation in

  that for claiming the benefits of exemption in electricity

  relation to total value of the aforesaid investments, as the
  State Government may, by notification in the Official
  Gazette, specify or should not be an expansion of the
  existing business or undertaking in the State."
</p>

<p id="p_100">17.       The facts of the case are therefore, required to be
  considered         so   as   to     ascertain   that    whether           the
  establishment of unit by the petitioner at Jhagadia would
  amount to expansion of existing business or undertaking
  in the State or not. For this purpose it is necessary to refer
  to the observations made by the Apex Court in case of
  Saurashtra Cement &amp; Chemical Industries Ltd. (supra)
  as under :
</p>
<p id="p_101">  "7. Crucial question for consideration before us is whether
  it is a case of expansion of an existing unit? The case of
  expansion of an industrial undertaking would qualify for
  exemption under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_34">Section 15C</a> of the Income Tax Act while
  in view of clause (ii)( c) of Explanation 1 contained in the
  Bombay Electricity Duty Act, 1958, an expansion of
  existing business undertaking would not qualify for
  exemption from electricity duty. Para 18 of the judgment in
  Textile Machinery Corporation (supra) throws considerable
  light on the controversy before us. Para 18 reads as below:
</p>
<p id="p_102">  "18. The assessee continues to be the same for the purpose
  of assessment. It has its existing business already liable to
  tax. It produced in the two concerned undertakings
  commodities different from those which he has been
  manufacturing or producing in its existing business.
  Manufacture or production of articles yielding additional
  profit attributable to the new outlay of capital in a separate
  and distinct unit is the heart of the matter, to earn benefit
  from the exemption of tax liability under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_35">Section 15C</a>. Sub­
  section (6) of the section also points to the same effect,
  namely, production of articles. The answer, in every
  particular case depends upon the peculiar facts and
  conditions of the new industrial undertaking on account of
  which the assessee claims exemption under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_36">Section 15C</a>.
  No hard and fast rule can be laid down. Trade and

  industry do not run in earmarked channels and
  particularly so in view of manifold scientific and
  technological developments. There is great scope for
  expansion of trade and industry. The fact that an assessee
  by establishment of a new industrial undertaking expands
  his existing business, which he certainly does, would not,
  on that score, deprive him of the benefit under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_37">Section
  15C</a>. Every new creation in business is some kind of
  expansion and advancement. The true test is not whether
  the new industrial undertaking connotes expansion of the
  existing business of the assessee but whether it is all the
  same a new and identifiable undertaking separate and
  distinct from the existing business. No particular decision
  in one case can lay down an inexorable test to determine
  whether a given case comes under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_38">Section 15C</a> or not. In
  order that the new undertaking can be said to be not
  formed out of the already existing business, there must be
  a new emergence of a physically separate industrial unit
  which may exist on its own as a viable unit. An
  undertaking is formed out of the existing business if the
  physical identity with the old unit is preserved. This has
  not happened here in the case of the two undertakings
  which are separate and distinct."
</p>
<p id="p_103">  8. It will be seen from the facts on record in the present
  case that the so called new unit/undertaking is not totally
  independent of the assets of the existing unit. Admittedly
  certain assets, to which reference has already been made,
  are being utilized in the manufacturing activity carried on
  by the new unit. It cannot be said that the new unit is
  completely independent or that the new unit could do
  without the assets of the existing unit. If use of the old
  plant and machinery etc. was necessary to complete the
  manufacturing process in the new unit, the new unit is not
  totally independent nor it is able to complete the process of
  manufacture of cement on its own as a viable unit. The
  new unit is dependent on the existing assets. A physical
  identity with the old unit is preserved. In view of the
  exception carved out in the definition of a new industrial
  unit contained in the Act, it cannot be said that the
  respondent is entitled to exemption from electricity duty.

  the unit of the petitioner at Jhagadia is totally independent
  of the assets of other units at the premises                    of Gujarat
  Guardian Limited at Ankleshwar or E.I. DuPont at Savli
  and none of the assets of the units situated in                      Gujarat
  Guardian Limited           or E.I. DuPont are being utilised in
  manufacturing the product being carried on by the unit of
  the petitioner at Jhagadia. Therefore, it can be said that
  the unit of the petitioner at Jhagadia is completely
  independent unit and same is established without use of
  assets of the unit either at Gujarat Guardian Limited or
  E.I. DuPont. It is also not the case of the respondents that
  any of the old plant and machinery was used by the
  petitioner to complete the manufacturing process in the
  unit at Jhagadia, but on the contrary the unit at Jhagadia
  is totally independent and is able to complete the process
  of manufacturing of industrial gases on its own as a viable
  unit. It is also a matter of fact that the unit at Jhagadia
  established by the petitioner is not dependent on any of the
  assets used by the units at Gujarat Guardian Limited or
  E.I. DuPont and physical identity of the unit at Jhagadia is
  independent than that of other two units. It can therefore,
  be said that the petitioner is entitled to exemption from
  electricity duty in view of exception carved out in the
  definition of new industrial unit.

unit at Jhagadia for production of industrial gases with
new technology, new plant and machinery, new set up and
therefore, it meets with the criteria of new industrial
undertaking. It would therefore, be germane to refer to the
observations made by this Court in case of Kores (India)
Limited Textile Division(supra) as under :
</p>
<p id="p_106">23. Thus, even the Supreme Court has elaborately
discussed the meaning of word 'expansion' and its all
derivatives. The observation of the Supreme Court in para­
10 would indicate those were the reasons for not treating
the respondent to be eligible for benefits. As it was in that
case capacity was increased, whereas, in the instant case
on hand, it is absolutely uncontroverted that company had
started altogether new product and when there is a new
product, which is requiring the new machinery and which
is requiring new premises, and old machinery is not put to
use nor is the raw material is put to use. It cannot be said
that it is the expansion of earlier product or business. The
diversification in production activities requiring new
technology, new method and new plant and machinery,
new set up cannot denied benefit of exemption in duty only
on the ground that the same is merely expansion of the
original company. In fact what is to be looked into is
whether the new unit meets with the criteria for " new
industrial under taking" and if its meet than the certificate
of exemption is to be granted to such unit irrespective of
the fact that the owner had been producing some other
product in State of Gujarat.
</p>
<p id="p_107">24. The 'expansion' word occurring in the provision could
be understood in terms of increase in capacity or slight
modification in the product which may enhance the
product's saleability but that in itself cannot be classified
to be diversification so as to give different colour to the
undertaking and make it eligible for exemption in
electricity duty. As against this, if the same business or
organization is venturing into production of new product
with different capacity and different machinery with
different raw material and input, then, though the
Company and organization has been producing another

  product in the State of Gujarat would in itself not
  considered as disqualifying factor for the new unit which is
  based upon new technology for altogether a new product
  warranting fresh investment, new machinery and plants
  and technical knowhow. It is also relevant to note that if
  the Unit is changing its technology for better result of the
  same product than in that case such change and
  investment might not be eligible for duty exemption. The
  petitioner had in fact established it case for seeking
  exemption before the respondent no.1 as its contention
  referred to in para 16 (v) to 16(x) have not been adverted to
  at all by the respondent no.1. in its order dated 8.11.2012

       concerned, as it is held that the petitioner is entitled to
