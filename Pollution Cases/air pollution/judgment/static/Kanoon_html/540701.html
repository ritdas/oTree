<p id="p_1">THE HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE         

        These  two  writ  petitions  are  being  disposed  off  by this common
judgment. 
</p><p id="p_2">        2.  Heard the learned counsel for the parties.  We  have  perused  the
records in the above two writ petitions.
</p><p id="p_3">        3.    The  writ  petitions  relate  to  allegations  of  pollution  by
Tanneries.
</p><p id="p_4">        4.  W.P.No.15244 of 2004 has been filed praying for  the  issue  of  a
Writ  of  Certiorarified  Mandamus  to quash the Consent Order dated 16.8.2002
issued by the first respondent/Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board in favour of
the 2nd respondent/The  Perundari  Leather  Industries  Eco  Security  Private
Limited (hereinafter called PLIES).
</p><p id="p_5">5.  W.P.No.    1682 of 2003 has been filed praying that no tanneries should be
set up in and around Perundurai, as it would  cause  damage  to  the  drinking
water, as well as water used for agriculture purposes.
</p><p id="p_6">6.  The  petitioner  in  W.P.No.  15244 of 2004 claims to be a Welfare Society
registered under Section 10 of the  Tamil  Nadu  Societies  Registration  Act,
1975.   It is alleged in paragraph-3 of the affidavit filed in support of this
petition that there are about 800 tanneries situated in  the  State  of  Tamil
Nadu,  of  which  about 550 are in Vellore district, 100 in Dindigul district,
150 located in Pammal and Pallavaram and 50 tanneries in  Erode  and  some  in
Trichy District.   It is alleged that these tanneries let out effluents, which
contain Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) not less than 10000 to 15000 mg/1  litre.
The outer limit fixed for discharge of TDS is only 2100 mg/per 1 litre for the
tanneries.
</p><p id="p_7">7.  The  Supreme  Court in VELLORE CITIZENS WELFARE FORUM Vs.  UNION OF INDIA          
(1996) 5 SCC 647 gave several directions relating to tanneries in the State of
Tamil Nadu.    In  the  above  decision,  taking  into  account  the   various
considerations, the Supreme Court issued the following directions:-
</p>
<p id="p_8">1.  The Central Government shall constitute an authority under <a href="/doc/66315068/" id="a_5">Section 3(3)</a> of
the  Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and shall confer on the said authority
all the powers necessary to deal with the situation created by  the  tanneries
and other  polluting  industries  in  the  State of Tamil Nadu.  The authority
shall be headed by a retired Judge of the High Court and  it  may  have  other
members    preferably  with  expertise  in the field of pollution control and
environment protection  to be appointed  by  the  Central  Government.    The
Central  Government  shall  confer  on  the said authority the powers to issue
directions under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_6">Section 5</a> of the Environment Act and for taking measures with
respect to the matters referred to in clauses (v), (vi), (vii), (viii),  (ix),
</p><p id="p_9">(x) and  (xii)  of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_7">Section 3</a>.  The Central Government shall
constitute the authority before September 30, 1996.
</p><p id="p_10">2.  The authority so constituted by the Central Government shall implement the
Precautionary Principle and the Polluter Pays Principle.    The  authority
shall,  with  the  help  of expert opinion and after giving opportunity to the
polluters concerned assess the loss to the ecology/environment in the affected
areas and shall also  identify  the  individuals/families  who  have  suffered
because  of  the pollution and shall assess the compensation to be paid to the
said individuals/families.    The  authority  shall  further   determine   the
compensation  to  be  recovered  from  the  polluters as cost of reversing the
damaged environment.  The authority shall lay down just and fair procedure for
completing the exercise.
</p><p id="p_11">3.  The authority shall compute the compensation under two heads  namely,  for
reversing the ecology and for payment to individuals.  A statement showing the
total  amount to be recovered, the names of the polluters from whom the amount
is to be recovered, the amount to be recovered from each polluter, the persons
to whom the compensation is to be paid and the amount payable to each of  them 
shall  be  forwarded  to  the  Collectors/District  Magistrates  of  the  area
concerned.  The Collector/District Magistrate shall recover  the  amount  from
the polluters,  if  necessary,  as arrears of land revenue.  He shall disburse
the compensation awarded by the authority to the affected persons/families.
</p><p id="p_12">4.  The authority shall direct the closure of the industry owned/ managed by a
polluter in case he evades or refuses to pay the compensation awarded  against
him.   This  shall  be in addition to the recovery from him as arrears of land
revenue.
</p><p id="p_13">5.  An industry may have set up the  necessary  pollution  control  device  at
present  but it shall be liable to pay for the past pollution generated by the
said  industry  which  has  resulted  in  the  environmental  degradation  and
suffering to the residents of the area.
</p><p id="p_14">6.   We  impose  pollution  fine of Rs.10,000 each on all the tanneries in the
districts of North Arcot Ambedkar, Erode Periyar, Dindigul  Anna,  Trichi  and
Chengai M.G.R.    The fine shall be paid before October 31, 1996 in the office
of the   Collector/District   Magistrate   concerned.      We    direct    the
Collectors/District  Magistrates  of these districts to recover the fines from
the tanneries.  The money shall be  deposited,  along  with  the  compensation
amount recovered from the polluters, under a separate head called Environment
Protection  Fund  and shall be utilised for compensating the affected persons
as  identified  by  the  authorities  and  also  for  restoring  the   damaged
environment.   The pollution fine is liable to be recovered as arrears of land
revenue.  The tanneries which fail to deposit the amount by October  31,  1996
shall  be  closed  forthwith  and  shall  also be liable under the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_8">Contempt of
Courts Act</a>, 1971.
</p><p id="p_15">7.  The authority, in consultation with  expert  bodies  like  NEERI,  Central
Board, Board shall frame scheme/schemes for reversing the damage caused to the  
ecology and  environment  by  pollution  in  the  State  of  Tamil  Nadu.  The
scheme/schemes so framed shall be executed by the State Government  under  the   
supervision of  the Central Government.  The expenditure shall be met from the
Environment Protection Fund and from other sources  provided  by  the  State
Government and the Central Government.  
</p><p id="p_16">8.   We suspend the closure orders in respect of all the tanneries in the five
districts of North Arcot Ambedkar, Erode Periyar, Dindigul  Anna,  Trichi  and
Chengai M.G.R.  We direct all the tanneries in the above five districts to set
up  CETPs  or  Individual  Pollution Control Devices on or before November 30,
1996.  Those connected with CETPs  shall  have  to  install  in  addition  the
primary devices  in  the  tanneries.    All  the  tanneries  in the above five
districts shall obtain the consent of the Board to function and  operate  with
effect from  December 15, 199 6.  The tanneries who are refused consent or who
fail to obtain the consent of the Board by December 15, 1996 shall  be  closed
forthwith.
</p><p id="p_17">9.   We  direct  the  Superintendent  of  Police  and  the  Collector/District
Magistrate/Deputy Commissioner of the district concerned to  close  all  those
tanneries  with immediate effect who fail to obtain the consent from the Board
by the said date.  Such tanneries shall not be reopened unless  the  authority
permits them  to  do  so.    It  would  be open to the authority to close such
tanneries permanently or to direct their relocation.
</p><p id="p_18">10.  Government Order No.    213  dated  March  30,  1989  shall  be  enforced
forthwith.   No new industry listed in Annexure I to the notification shall be
permitted to be set up within the prohibited area.  The authority shall review
the cases of all the industries which are already operating in the  prohibited
area  and it would be open to the authority to direct the relocation of any of
such industries.
</p><p id="p_19">11.  The standards stipulated by the Board regarding  total  dissolved  solids
(TDS) and  approved  by  the  NEERI shall be operative.  All the tanneries and
other industries in the State  of  Tamil  Nadu  shall  comply  with  the  said
standards.   The  quality  of  ambient waters has to be maintained through the
standards stipulated by the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_20">        8.  In Paragraph 26 of  the  aforesaid  judgment,  the  Supreme  Court
observed  that  the Madras High Court would be in a better position to monitor
the above directions, and hence, the Chief Justice of the  Madras  High  Court
was  requested to constitute a special Green Bench to deal with the case and
other environmental matters.  The High Court was requested to treat the matter
as a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_9">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India and gave  liberty
to the  parties  to approach the High Court as and when necessary.  As per the
directions of the Honourable Supreme Court  in  the  aforesaid  decision,  the
Chief  Justice  of Madras High Court nominated Honble Mr.Justice P.Bhaskaran,
as the Chairman of the authority constituted under  direction  no.(1)  of  the
order of the Supreme Court mentioned above. 
</p><p id="p_21">        9.   The  Honourable  Mr.Justice P.Bhaskaran on 12.10.99 visited Erode
and S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a>OT Industrial Estate, Perundurai and recommended that all tanneries in
Erode must be shifted to State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil  Nadu
Limited  (in  short  S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">IPC</a>OT), Perundurai in order to reduce pollution in the
river Cauvery and Kalingarayan Canal, the main sources of drinking  water  and
irrigation of Erode Distirct.
</p><p id="p_22">        10.   It  may be mentioned that Tamil Nadu Co-operation for Industrial
Infrastructure Development (in short TACID) have put up an Industrial Growth
Centre at Perundurai and Engur villages, Perundurai Taluk, Erode  District  by
acquiring 2800  acres of lands.  Subsequently, in the year 1999 the Perundurai
Industrial Growth Centre was merged with S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12">IPC</a>OT.  Since the entire  extent  of
2800 acres of land had not been utilized for the purpose for which it has been
acquired,  the  TACID  approached  the  1st  respondent with a request to give
consent to establish a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (in  short  CETP)  to
enable the tanneries at Erode to relocate their units to S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_13">IPC</a>OT complex.
</p><p id="p_23">        11.    On  17.03.2001,  the  District  Environmental  Engineer  issued
instructions to form a CETP and asked Erode tanners  to  shift  their  tanning
activities to  S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14">IPC</a>OT  Complex,  Perundurai.    On  28.04.2001,  the  District
Collector wrote a detailed D.O.  letter on the present status of river Cauvery
and Kalingarayan canal and strongly recommended for the shifting of  tanneries
in Erode  to  S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_15">IPC</a>OT  Complex,  Perundurai  for curtailing the pollution.  The
District Collector, Erode requested the S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16">IPC</a>OT  Industrial  Growth  Centre  to
allot lands  for  the  tanneries.  Thereafter, Erode District Small Industries
Association, informed the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board about  the  steps
taken  by them to set up a tannery complex at S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17">IPC</a>OT Industrial Growth Centre,
Perundurai.  About 50 tanneries in and around Erode Town have  been  asked  to
relocate their units at S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18">IPC</a>OT Complex, Perundurai.
</p><p id="p_24">        12.   The  petitioner in the present writ petition had also filed Writ
Petition No.  1682 of 2003 praying for the relief of Mandamus  forbearing  the
respondents  from permitting any polluting industries, particularly tanneries,
either old or new, to be established  in  and  around  Perundurai.    In  that
petition, the Division Bench of this Court on 24.01 .2004 passed the following
order:-
</p><p id="p_25"> Notice  to respondents 1 and 2.  Pollution Control Board not to give consent
for establishment of any new tannery pending further orders
</p><p id="p_26">        13.  It is alleged in paragraph-7 of the affidavit filed in support of
the petition that despite the communication  of  the  above  said  order,  the
second respondent/PLIES has proceeded with the construction of tanneries.  The
petitioner  came to know that the consent was issued prior to the order of the
Division Bench in W.P.No.1682 of 2003, and hence by this  petition  they  have
challenged the consent order dated 16 .08.2002 issued by the first respondent/
Tamil  Nadu  Pollution Control Board in favour of the second respondent/PLIES.
It is submitted that <a href="/doc/647509/" id="a_19">Section 25(3)</a> of the Water  (Prevention  and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_20">Control  of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 has been violated, as the enquiry before granting consent
was not  held.    It  is  also  submitted  that  as per the Environment Impact
Assessment  Notification  S.O.60  (E)  Dated  27.1.2004  prior   environmental
clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India has
not been  obtained.    It  is  alleged that setting up of tanneries will cause
damage to the agriculturists living in that area, as  the  main  water  source
will be  polluted.  It is alleged that the  Precautionary Principle has been
violated.  It is also alleged that permitting polluting industries in the area
will have adverse affect on the patients and  will  aggravate  the  infectious
diseases.
</p><p id="p_27">14.  It is alleged in paragraph-4 (j) of the affidavit filed in support of the
writ  petition  that  the  respondents  are  planning  to  permit tanneries in
Perundurai, which is land locked for almost 25 kms.  radius and  they  do  not
have any  perennial  river.  It is alleged that the  Precautionary Principle
is being violated by permitting polluting industries to  be  set  up  in  that
area.   It  is  alleged  that  if  tanneries  are  allowed to be set up there,
effluents that would be discharged by the tanneries will  pollute  the  ground
water.  The petitioner, therefore, prays that no tanneries should be set up in
and around Perundurai, as it would cause damage to the drinking water, as well
as water used for agriculture purposes.
</p><p id="p_28">        15.    In   the  counter  affidavit  filed  on  behalf  of  the  first
respondent/Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board in W.P.No.15244 of 2004, it  has
been  clarified  that whereas in its interim order in Writ Petition (C) No.914
of 1991 ( Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum Vs.  Union of India and others), the
Supreme Court had prohibited setting up of tanneries in  the  State  of  Tamil
Nadu,  subsequently,  in  its  final  judgment,  there  is  no  such  absolute
prohibition.  What is stated in direction no.10 contained in the  judgment  is
this:-
</p><p id="p_29">10.  Government  Order  No.    213  dated  March  30,  1989  shall be enforced
forthwith.  No new industry listed in Annexure I to the notification shall  be
permitted to be set up within the prohibited area.  The authority shall review
the  cases of all the industries which are already operating in the prohibited
area and it would be open to the authority to direct the relocation of any  of
such industries.
</p><p id="p_30">What is now prohibited is setting up of new industries listed in Annexure-I to
the Notification dated 30.3.89 in the prohibited area only.
</p><p id="p_31">        16.   The definition of Prohibited Area, as contained in G.O.Ms.No.2
13, Environment and Forests (EC-I) dated 30th March 1989, reads:-
 In the Government Order first read above, the Government have ordered, among
other things, that no industry  causing  serious  water  pollution  should  be
permitted  within  one kilometer from the embankments of rivers, streams, dams
etc., and that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board should furnish a list of
such industries to all local bodies.    It  has  been  suggested  that  it  is
necessary  to  have  a  sharper definition for water sources so that ephemeral
water collections like rain water  ponds,  drains,  sewerages  (biodegradable)
etc., may  be  excluded  from  the  purview of the above order.  The Chairman,
Tamil Nadu  Pollution  Control  Board,  has  stated  that  the  scope  of  the
Government  Order  may be restricted to reservoirs, rivers and public drinking
water sources.  He has also stated that there should  be  a  complete  ban  on
location  of  highly  polluting industries within 1 kilometer of certain water
sources.
</p><p id="p_32">2.  The Government  have  carefully  examined  the  above  suggestions.    The
Government  impose  a  total  ban  on  the  setting up of the highly polluting
industries mentioned in Annexure-I to this order within one kilometer from the
embankments of the water sources mentioned in Annexure II to this order.
</p><p id="p_33">3.  The Government also direct that  under  any  circumstance  if  any  highly
polluting  industry  is  proposed  to  be set up within one kilometer from the
embankments of water sources other than those mentioned in Annexure_II to this
order, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board  should  examine  the  case  and
obtain the approval of the Government for it
        Thus,  the  Prohibited Area is an area within one kilometer from the
embankments of rivers, streams, dams etc.   There  is  nothing  to  show  that
Perundurai  comes  within  the  Prohibited  Area,  rather  it is admitted in
paragraph-4 (l)  of  the  affidavit  of  the  petitioner  that  they  are  not
questioning  the  competence  of  the  respondents  of  permitting  to  set up
tanneries in Perundurai.
</p><p id="p_34">        17.  The apprehension of the petitioner is that if tanneries  are  set
up  in  Perundurai  the  ground water will get polluted and the agriculturists
would not be able to use the land for cultivation due to pollution.
</p><p id="p_35">        18.  Counter affidavit has been filed in W.P.No.1682 of  2003  by  the
Joint  Chief  Environmental  Engineer,  Tamil  Nadu  Pollution  Control Board,
Chennai.  Paragraphs 6 to 9 of this counter affidavit states as follows:-
 It is respectfully submitted that the Tamil Nadu Corporation for  Industrial
Infrastructure  Development  (TACID),  a  Government of Tamil Nadu enterprises
have put up an Industrial  Growth  Centre  at  Perundurai  &amp;  Ingur  Villages,
Perundurai  Taluk,  Erode  District by acquiring 1133 hectares (2800 acres) of
land.  This industrial growth center has been planned to  accommodate  various
types of  industries  such  as  textile dyeing, tanneries, chemicals etc.  The
TACID applied to Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board on 2.4.1996  and  obtained
consent  to  establish  Water  and  <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_21">Air Act</a>s from Tamil Nadu Pollution Control
Board on 18.8.97.  Subseqsuently, during 1999, the said Perundurai  Industrial
Growth  Centre  has  been merged with S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_22">IPC</a>OT, Tamil Nadu which is now known as   
S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_23">IPC</a>OT Industrial Growth Centre (SIGC). 
</p><p id="p_36">It is respectfully submitted that the District Collector, Erode  District  has
addressed  the  Chairman  &amp;  Managing  Director, S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24">IPC</a>OT, Chennai in his letter
dt.24.3.2001 to  allot  land  in  the  SIGC,  Perundurai  for  the  tanneries.
EEDISSIA  (Erode District Small Industries Association) had informed the Board
in their letter dated 19.10.2001 about the initiatives taken by them to put up
a tannery complex at SIGC, Perundurai. 
</p><p id="p_37">It is further submitted that  25  proposed  tanneries  have  come  forward  to
establish   the   tanneries  in  SIGC  and  formed  a  CETP  company  by  name
M/s.Perundurai Leather Industries Eco-Security Private Ltd (PLIES) and applied
for the consent of the Board under Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_25">Air Act</a>s on 06 .05.2002 to put up
a CETP to treat  a  2500  KLD  of  trade  effluent  arising  from  the  member
tanneries.   As  per  the precautionary principle, the Board has advocated for
two stage treatment system to address the  wastewater  problem  posed  by  the
tanneries.
</p><p id="p_38">Stage No.1 :  The physio-chemical, biological treatment system.
Stasge No.II:   To propose a system to address the problem of containing total
dissolved solids and ensuring zero discharge
The CETP company has been furnished the proposals  for  Stage  I  prepared  by
CLRI, a  pioneer  research  institute  exclusively for leather industries.  It
addresses the solution for biological parameters such  as  Biochemical  oxygen
demand  and  Chemical oxygen demand etc., The proposals pertaining to Stage II 
could ensure Zero discharge of effluent.  Based on the above, Board has issued
consent to  establish  to  the  CETP  company  on  16.8.2002  considering  the
precautionary principle with certain conditions stressing the implementation
of  treatment  systems  as  per stage I &amp; II before commissioning of the CETP,
which treat the trade effluent arising from 25 member tanneries of  the  CETP.
On  implementation  of  consent order conditions, it could be ensured that the
reuse of treated effluent zero discharge from the CETP.
It is respectfully submitted that TACID and  latter  SIGC  have  developed  an
industrial  complex  to accommodate the dyeing industries, tannery industries,
chemical industries etc., in Perundurai &amp; Ingur  Villages,  Perundurai  Taluk,
Erode District.    It  is  an  industrial  complex  and  located away from the
prohibited area as contemplated in G.O.Ms.No.213 , E &amp; F Dept., dt.30.3.89 and
G.O.Ms.No.127, E&amp;F Dept., dt.8.5.98.  These G.Os  prohibit  14  categories  of
industries such as tanneries, textile dyeing units etc., located within one km
and five   km  respectively  from  specified  water  sources.    Further,  the
implementation of stage I &amp; II by the CETP ensure that the TDS  of  2100  mg/l
specified by the Board shall be achievable and treated trade effluent shall be
completely  reused  by  the  member  tanneries  by  installing R.O system with
suitable evaporation system for the rejects so as  to  ensure  Zero  discharge
from the  CETP.  Under the circumstances, the Board has taken action to comply 
with the orders of the Honble Supreme Court of  India  dt.28.8.96  issued  in
W.P(civil) No.914/91.   Thus,  the  TDS  problem  can  be  solved.   Moreover,
incorporating  the  above  precautionary  principles,  the  consent  order  to
establish to the CETP was issued with appropriate conditions to the above CETP
at SIGC,  Perundurai  on 16.8.2002.  On implementation of the treatment system
as per the conditions imposed, the apprehension of the  petitioner  about  the
TDS problem  will  be  resolved.    The  CLRI, Chennai and Council for Leather
Exports have involved to assist technically and financially in  implementation
of the CETP, M/ s.Perundurai Industries Eco Security Pvt.Ltd, SIGC, Perundurai
upto Stage-I.    The  CETP  system proposed at SIGC, Perundurai is a candidate
technology and also based on best available technology (BAT) system.
It is evident from the above that S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_26">IPC</a>OT Industrial Growth Centre, Perundurai,
Erode District  is  not  within  the  Prohibited  Area  as  contemplated  in
G.O.Ms.No.213,  E&amp;F Dept., dt.30.3.89 and G.O.Ms.No.127, E&amp;F Dept., dt.8.5.98.  
Hence, in our opinion, there can be no bar to setting  up  tanneries  in  that
area.
</p><p id="p_39">        19.   It  is also evident from the facts of the case that in May 2002,
the Technical and  Advisory  Consultant,  Central  Leather  Research  Instiute
(CLRI), a Government of India undertaking, submitted a detailed project report
before  Tamil  Nadu  Pollution  Control  Board  for the construction of Common
Effluent Treatment Plant on behalf of PLIES.  On 16.08.2002,  the  Tamil  Nadu
Pollution Control Board issued consent to PLIES for construction of the Common
Effluent  Treatment  Plant  with zero discharge concept based on the report of
the Central Leather Research  Institute.    On  25.10.2002,  the  Council  for
Leather Exports under the Ministry of Industries and Commerce was appointed as 
the  Implementing Agency of the project and the Government of India sanctioned
Rs.294 lakhs as grant for the construction  of  a  Common  Effluent  Treatment
Plant at  Perundurai  through Council for Leather Exports.  On 18.12.2002, the
Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board issued noticed to all 44 tanneries situated
at Erode to shift to S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27">IPC</a>OT, Perundurai within 3 months.  On  27.01.2003,  the
Central  Leather  Research  Institute  released  posters  to  relocate all the
tanneries at Erode to S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_28">IPC</a>OT, Perundurai.  We are informed  that  the  overall
construction  of  Effluent  Treatment  Plant has been practically completed at
Perundurai.
</p><p id="p_40">        20.  It may be mentioned that consent under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_29">Section 25</a>  of  The  Water
(Prevention  and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_30">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 was given on 16.08.200 2 and
the said order is appelable under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_31">Section 28</a>.   However,  without  filing  any
appeal  and  exhausting the alternative remedy, writ petition No.15244 of 2004
has been  filed  on  31.05.2004  challenging  the  consent  order  granted  on
16.08.2002 i.e.,  after  a lapse of 19 months.  In our opinion, on this ground
alone, the  writ  petition  should  have  been  dismissed.    Public  Interest
Litigation is often misused now days, and such petitions are being filed often
with ulterior  motive.    However, we need not elaborate on this aspect, as we
are of the opinion that there are absolutely no merits in this petition.
</p><p id="p_41">        21.  On 12.10.1999, Loss of Ecology (P&amp;PC) Chairman headed by Hon ble
Mr.Justice P.Bhaskaran visited the tanneries  situated  in  Erode,  which  are
polluting  river Cauvery and Kalingarayan canal, and directed the tanneries to
be shifted to S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_32">IPC</a>OT, Perundurai.  The Pollution Control Board has also issued
notices to all tanneries in Erode to shift to S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_33">IPC</a>OT, Perundurai.   The  State
Industries  Promotion  Corporation  of Tamil Nadu Limited (S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_34">IPC</a>OT), which is a
Government of Tamil Nadu undertaking, had  acquired  2500  acres  of  land  in
Perundurai,  which  is  far  away  from  the water sources, for the purpose of
Industrial Growth Centre for locating the industries declared  as  capable  of
highly polluting  the  environment.    In this center, an area of 106 acres of
land has been allotted to the tannery zone.  About  25  tanneries,  which  had
wanted to shift to Perundurai, formed a company to establish a Common Effluent
Treatment  Plant, and approached the Central Leather Research Institute, which
gave a detailed project report on the basis of  which  the  Pollution  Control
Board granted  consent  on  16.08.2002.    As  per  the project report and the
conditions of consent there is no  discharge  of  effluent  in  land  and  the
process involves zero discharge.
</p><p id="p_42">        22.   The  total cost of construction of the Common Effluent Treatment
Plant was Rs.7 crores, out of which the second respondent (PLIES) has invested
Rs.4.06 crores and the Government of India has sanctioned Rs.2.94 crores.  The
project is being monitored by a wing of  the  Ministry  of  Industries  namely
Council for  Leather  Exports.   It is alleged that the construction of Common
Effluent Treatment Plant is almost complete.    The  photographs  showing  the
stage of the construction is enclosed as an annexure.
</p><p id="p_43">        23.   In  our opinion, the writ petition is an abuse of process of the
Court.  The Common Effluent Treatment Plant will be used by 25  tanneries  and
they  will  let  out  effluents to this Common Effluent Treatment Plant, which
will be treated and  recycled  with  zero  discharge.    We  cannot  see  what
objection any one can have to this.
</p><p id="p_44">24.   The factual position has been set out in great detail in paragraphs 6 to
9 of the counter-affidavit of  the  Tamil  Nadu  Pollution  Control  Board  in
W.P.No.  1682  of  2003, which we have quoted in entirety above.  A perusal of
these factual averments clearly show that the authorities  have  ensured  that
there  will  be  no  pollution  in  Perundurai, because of the Common Effluent
Treatment  Plant,  and  the  apprehension  of   the   petitioner   is   wholly
misconceived. 
</p><p id="p_45">25.   As  already  stated  above,  these days public interest litigation has
become largely private interest  litigation  for  ulterior  motives,  or  is
misused by business rivals, or persons who sponsor such litigation from behind
with mala fide intentions.  We cannot appreciate these tactics.  The docket of
the Court  is  already overful with arrears.  The Court should discourage this
kind of motivated litigation, which only adds to its burden.
</p><p id="p_46">26.  In a very recent decision of the Supreme Court in Special Leave  Petition
(Civil) No.26269  of 2004 (Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware Vs.  State of Maharashtra)
dated 14.12.2004, it has come down very heavily on public interest litigation,
which is filed with ulterior motive eg., black mailing.  The Supreme Court  in
that decision observed:-
</p><p id="p_47">  Public  Interest Litigation which has now come to occupy an important field
in the administration of law should not be publicity interest litigation  or
Private  interest litigation or politics interest litigation or the latest
trend paise income litigation.  The High Court has found that  the  case  at
hand belongs  to  the  last  category.    If  not properly regulated and abuse
averted, it becomes also a tool in unscrupulous hands to release vendetta  and
wreck vengeance,  as  well.    There  must be real and genuine public interest
involved in the litigation and not merely an adventure of knight errant  borne
out of  wishful  thinking.  It cannot also be invoked by a person or a body of
persons to further his or their  personal  causes  or  satisfy  his  or  their
personal rudge  and  enmity.    Courts  of justice should not be allowed to be
polluted  by  unscrupulous  litigants  by  resorting  to   the   extraordinary
jurisdiction.  A person acting bona fide and having sufficient interest in the
proceeding  of  public  interest litigation will alone have a locus standi and
can approach the Court to wipe out violation of fundamental rights and genuine
infraction of statutory provisions, but  not  for  personal  gain  or  private
profit or  political  motive or any oblique consideration.  These aspects were
highlighted by this Court in The Janata Dal Vs.  H.S.Chowdhary  1992  (4)  SCC
305 and  Kazi Lhendup Dorji Vs.  Central Bureau of Investigation 1994 Supp (2)
SCC 116.  A writ petitioner who comes  to  the  Court  for  relief  in  public
interest  must  come  not only with clean hands like any other writ petitioner
but also with a clean heart,  clean  mind  and  clean  objective  (See  Ramjas
Foundation Vs.    Union  of  India,  AIR  1993  SC  852  and  K.R.Srinivas Vs.
R.M.Premchand, 1994 (6) SCC 620.   
</p><p id="p_48">It is depressing  to  note  that  on  account  of  such  trumpery  proceedings
initiated before the Courts, innumerable days are wasted, which time otherwise
could  have  been  spent  for the disposal of cases for the genuine litigants.
Though we spare no efforts in fostering and developing the laudable concept of
PIL and extending our long arm of sympathy to  the  poor,  the  ignorant,  the
oppressed  and  the  needy whose fundamental rights are infringed and violated
and whose grievances go unnoticed, un-represented and unheard; yet  we  cannot 
avoid  but  express  our  opinion that while genuine litigants with legitimate
grievances relating to civil matters involving properties  worth  hundreds  of
millions  of  rupees  and  criminal  cases in which persons sentenced to death
facing gallows under untold agony and persons sentenced to  life  imprisonment
and  kept  in incarceration for long years, persons suffering from undue delay
in service matters  government or private, persons awaiting the  disposal  of
cases wherein huge amounts of public revenue or unauthorized collection of tax
amounts  are  locked  up,  detenue  expecting their release from the detention
orders etc., etc., are all standing in a long serpentine queue for years  with
the  fond  hope  of  getting  into  the  Courts  and  having  their grievances
redressed, the busybodies,  meddlesome  interlopers,  wayfarers  or  officious
interveners  having  absolutely no public interest except for personal gain or
private profit either of themselves or as a proxy of others or for  any  other
extraneous  motivation or for glare of publicity break the queue muffing their
faces by wearing the mask of public  interest  litigation  and  get  into  the
Courts  by  filing vexatious and frivolous petitions and thus criminally waste
the valuable time of the Courts and as a result of which  the  queue  standing
outside  the  doors of the Courts never moves, which piquant situation creates
frustration in the minds of the genuine litigants and  resultantly  they  lose
faith in the administration of our judicial system.
</p><p id="p_49">Public  interest  litigation  is a weapon which has to be used with great care
and circumspection and the judiciary has to be extremely careful to  see  that
behind  the  beautiful  veil of public interest an ugly private malice, vested
interest and/or publicity seeking is not lurking.  It is  to  be  used  as  an
effective  weapon  in  the  armory of law for delivering social justice to the
citizens.  The attractive brand name of public interest litigation should  not
be used  for suspicious products of mischief.  It should be aimed at redressal
of genuine public wrong or public injury and not publicity oriented or founded
on personal vendetta.  As indicated above, Court must be careful to see that a
body of persons or member of public, who approaches the Court is  acting  bona
fide  and  not  for personal gain or private motive or political motivation or
other oblique considerations.  The Court must not  allow  its  process  to  be
abused for oblique considerations by masked phantoms who monitor at times from 
behind.   Some persons with vested interest indulge in the pastime of meddling
with judicial process either by force of habit or from improper  motives,  and
try to  bargain  for a good deal as well to enrich themselves.  Often they are
actuated by a desire to win notoriety or cheap popularity.  The  petitions  of
such busybodies deserve to be thrown out by rejection at the threshold, and in
appropriate cases with exemplary costs.
</p><p id="p_50">As noted supra, a time has come to weed out the petitions, which though titled
as public  interest litigations are in essence something else.  It is shocking
to note that Courts are flooded with large number of so called public interest
litigations where even a minuscule percentage can legitimately  be  called  as
public interest  litigations.    Though  the  parameters  of  public  interest
litigation have been indicated by this Court in large  number  of  cases,  yet
unmindful  of the real intentions and objectives, Courts are entertaining such
petitions and wasting valuable judicial time which, as noted above,  could  be
otherwise utilized for disposal of genuine cases.
</p><p id="p_51">27.   The  entire  matter  has  been  considered  in  detail  by the concerned
authorities, and this court should not sit as  a  Court  of  appeal  over  the
decisions of  such  authorities,  who have expertise in the matter.  The Court
does not have  expertise  in  these  matters,  and  should  exercise  judicial
restraint as held by a Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/433594/" id="a_35">RAMA.MUTHURAMALINGAM v.    
THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE</a> (2004 (5) CTC 554)           

</p><p id="p_52">        28.  In  a  very  recent  decision in W.P.No.  33528 and 34436 of 2004
dated 17.12.2004, (Sethu Samudhram Case) this Court in  detail  expressed  its
views  on  the  need  for  rapid  industrialization to make India a modern and
powerful industrial State.  In the above decision, this court also  considered
the   question  of  industrialization  and  its  relation  with  environmental
protection, and we reiterate the views expressed in that decision.
