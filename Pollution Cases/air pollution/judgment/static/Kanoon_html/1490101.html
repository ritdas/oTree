<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT

 

P.V. Hardas, J.
</p>
 

<p id="p_2"> 1. By  this  Petition, filed in public  interest,
the  Petitioner, a practicing lawyer in the State of Goa
has  challenged the appointment of the first Respondent,
dated  24th  October, 2001, as the President of the  Goa
Administrative Tribunal. 
</p> 

<p id="p_3"> 2.        The Petitioner avers that the Petitioner being
a   practicing  lawyer  and   being  interested  in  the
Administration of Justice has filed the present Petition
in  public  interest  and in the interest of  the  legal
fraternity  of Goa.  It is stated that the Goa, Daman  &amp;
Diu  Administrative Tribunal was constituted by the Goa,
Daman  &amp; Diu Administrative Tribunal Act, 1965 which was
passed  by  the  Legislative Assembly of Goa  and  which
subsequently received the assent of the Governor on 26th
March,  1965.  Consequent to the attainment of Statehood
by Goa, in the "Goa, Daman &amp; Diu Administrative Tribunal
Act, 1965", the words "Daman and Diu" were omitted.  The
enactment  is,  therefore, presently entitled  "The  Goa
Administrative  Tribunal  Act, 1965".  By virtue  of  an
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1">Amendment Act</a> of 1966, the Administrative Tribunal which
earlier comprised of a Chairman and such number of other
members  as  was determined by the State Government  was
amended to make the Tribunal a single member body headed
by a President. 
</p> 

<p id="p_4"> 3.        The  Goa, Daman &amp; Diu Administrative  Tribunal
Rules,  1966,  which were framed in the exercise of  the
powers  conferred by <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_2">Section 13</a> of the Goa, Daman &amp;  Diu
Administrative  Tribunal  Act,  the  qualifications  for
appointment of Member or Chairman are prescribed by Rule
</p><p id="p_5">2.   Sub-Rule  2  of  the   said  Rules  prescribed  the
qualifications  for appointment as a Chairman.  Sub-Rule
2 reads as under:- 
</p>   

<p id="p_6"> "The  Chairman  shall  be  a
person who is: 
</p>   

<p id="p_7"> (a)   a  judicial officer of seven
years standing, or  
 

</p><p id="p_8">(b)   an  advocate of seven  years
standing, or
 

</p><p id="p_9">(c)   "holding a superior post not
lower  than Joint  Secretary
to  the  Government, in  the
Law   Department    of   the
Government  for  at least  3
years."
</p> 

<p id="p_10">4.        By  a Notification which was published in  the
Government  Gazette on 25th May, 2001, the Government of
Goa,  in exercise of the powers conferred by Section  13
of the Goa Administrative Tribunal Act, 1965 amended the
Goa,  Daman  &amp; Diu Administrative Tribunal Rules,  1966.
The words "Daman and Diu" as appearing in the Goa, Daman
&amp;  Diu Administrative Tribunal Rules, 1966 were omitted.
Similarly,  the  word "Chairman" was substituted by  the
word  "President".   Clause (b) of Sub-Rule 2 of Rule  2
was substituted by the following:-
 "An  advocate  of  not  less  than
seven  years  standing   and  with
knowledge of Konkani, knowledge of
Marathi being desirable".
</p> 

<p id="p_11">5.        The  Petitioner  states that the post  of  the
President  of the Administrative Tribunal is  designated
as   Group   "A"   and   carries    a   pay   scale   of
Rs.14,300-400-18,300 which is identical to the pay scale
of  a  District  Judge.   It is  also  stated  that  the
President  of the Administrative Tribunal enjoys all the
emoluments,  benefits  and  privileges  as  that  of   a
District Judge.  It is further stated that the President
of  the  Administrative   Tribunal  discharges  judicial
functions  and the Tribunal is required to deal with  28
enactments.   The  Tribunal has Original,  Appellate  as
well  as  Revisional jurisdiction and the Tribunal  even
sits  in  Appeal over the revisions of the Civil  Judge,
Senior Division.  Thus, it is stated that the Government
of  Goa could not have appointed the first Respondent as
the  President  of the Administrative  Tribunal  without
prior   consultation   with  the   High  Court   as   is
contemplated  in  <a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_3">Article  233</a> of  the  Constitution  of
India.  The Petitioner has, therefore, prayed for a Writ
of  quo  warranto calling upon the first  Respondent  to
show  under  what  authority he is holding the  post  of
President  of  Administrative Tribunal and  has  further
prayed  for  setting aside the appointment of the  first
Respondent.  The other relief which is prayed for is the
issuance  of Writ of Certiorari for quashing and setting
aside  the impugned Order of the first Respondent  dated
24th October, 2001.
</p> 

<p id="p_12">6.        A   Bill  was  introduced  in  the Legislative
Assembly  in the State of Goa on 19th July, 2001,  which
was  published in the Official Gazette dated 28th  July,
2001, seeking to create the post of Additional President
of  the  Administrative  Tribunal.  The Bill  sought  to
amend  Section 3 of the Goa Administrative Tribunal Act,
1965  to  include  an  Additional  President  who  would
constitute  the  Tribunal.  The Bill sought to make  the
powers  of the President and the Additional President to
be   co-extensive and the jurisdiction to be concurrent.
Wherever  the  word "President" occurred, amendment  was
sought  to  include the Additional President.  The  said
Bill  was  thereafter  passed  by  the  Goa  Legislative
Assembly  on 23rd July, 2001 and received the assent  of
the  Governor  of  Goa on 5th September,  2001  and  was
published  in the Official Gazette dated 12th September,
2001.  Meanwhile, an advertisement dated 20th July, 2001
was issued for filling up the posts of the President and
the Additional President of Goa Administrative Tribunal.
In  the  said  advertisement, under the  heading  "Age",
"Essential"  and  "Other qualifications", it was  stated
that  the candidate should not be less than 40 years  of
age  and should be an Advocate of not less than 7  years
of  standing with knowledge of Konkani and Marathi being
desirable.    According   to    the   Petitioner,   this
advertisement was issued even before the Bill was passed
by  the Legislative Assembly and received the assent  of
the  Governor.  Incidentally, it may be stated that  the
Petitioner  has  averred  that the sister of  the  first
Respondent is married to the third Respondent who at the
relevant  time  was the Minister for Law, Judiciary  and
Legislative  Affairs, Government of Goa.  The Petitioner
describes  the third Respondent as the "co-brother"   of
the first Respondent.
</p> 

<p id="p_13">7.        The  Government  of  Goa   had  constituted  a
Committee  comprising  of Respondent Nos.4, 5 and 6  who
are  the  Law  Secretary,  the Chairman  of  Goa  Public
Service  Commission and the Additional Advocate  General
of  State of Goa respectively.  It is this Committee  of
Respondent  Nos.4  to  6 which had  selected  the  first
Respondent  and  had recommended his  appointment.   The
first Respondent, therefore, came to be appointed as the
President of the Goa Administrative Tribunal by an Order
dated  24th  October,  2001, published in  the  Official
Gazette   dated   8th  November,   2001.   It   may   be
incidentally mentioned that the appointment of the first
Respondent was on probation for a period of two years in
the pay scale of Rs.14,300-400-18,300.
</p> 

<p id="p_14">8.        In  response  to  the notice  issued  by  this
Court,  the  first  Respondent filed his reply  and  had
raised   a   preliminary     objection   regarding   the
maintainability of the Petition.  According to the first
Respondent,  the Petitioner had prayed for a Writ of quo
warranto  and  as the first Respondent was  holding  the
requisite  qualifications, the Petition was liable to be
dismissed.   Secondly,  it is stated that assuming  that
consultation  with  the  High Court was  necessary,  the
first  Respondent  "could"  have been appointed  as  the
President  of  the  Goa   Administrative  Tribunal  and,
therefore,  the  Writ of quo warranto would be a  futile
writ.    In  response  to   the  allegations  that   the
advertisement  had  been issued without waiting for  the
Bill to become the law, the first Respondent states that
he  had  been appointed as the President and not as  the
Additional  President.   It is also stated by the  first
Respondent that none of the appointments to the posts of
the  President/Chairman  of the Administrative  Tribunal
had  been made without prior consultation with the  High
Court.   It  may  incidentally be stated here  that  the
Petitioner  has  averred  that   the  fourth  Respondent
herein, who is a retired District Judge was also holding
the   additional   charge  as   the  President  of   the
Administrative  Tribunal.   Prior to the appointment  of
the fourth Respondent, the post of President/Chairman of
the Administrative Tribunal had been held by one Shri A.
D.   Salkar, who was then the Additional District Judge.
This  post  had  earlier been held by one  Shri  F.   N.
Tavora,  who was then a Civil Judge, Senior Division and
who  had been appointed on deputation to the higher post
as  President.   The first Respondent in his  reply  has
also  challenged  the locus standi of the Petitioner  to
file a Petition.  The first Respondent has admitted that
the  sister  of the first Respondent is married  to  the
third  Respondent but, however, denies the  relationship
of  a "co-brother-in-law".  The Respondent No.1  further
states that the President of the Administrative Tribunal
cannot  be equated with a District Judge and, therefore,
no  prior consultation with the High Court is  required.
The  second  Respondent i.e.  the State of Goa,  in  its
reply  has  also  challenged  the locus  standi  of  the
Petitioner  to  file the present Petition.  It  is  also
alleged that the Petitioner is seeking self publicity in
the  newspapers.  It is also stated that the appointment
to  the post of President of the Administrative Tribunal
vests  with  the State Government and, therefore,  prior
consultation  with the High Court was not necessary.  It
is  stated  that there is no irregularity or mala  fides
involved  in  the appointment of the  first  Respondent.
The  first Respondent, therefore, claimed the  dismissal
of the Petition.
</p> 

<p id="p_15">9.        The  third  Respondent, who then was  the  Law
Minister,  has  filed his Affidavit  contending  therein
that  the first Respondent has been appointed  following
due  procedure  as per the Goa  Administrative  Tribunal
Act,  1965  and the Rules framed there under.  The  third
Respondent denied the averment that the first Respondent
had been appointed at his behest and further denied that
Respondent  Nos.4  to 6 were under his  direct  control.
The  third  Respondent, however, in para 8 of his  reply
admitted  that  the  sister of the first  Respondent  is
married to the brother of the third Respondent.
</p> 

<p id="p_16">10.       Respondent  Nos.4 and 5 have filed their reply
contending  therein  that out of 35 candidates  who  had
applied, 26 candidates were eligible and were called for
interview.    The   names  of   the  6  candidates  were
short listed  and  the first Respondent was first in  the
merit  list.   Respondent Nos.4 and 6 have  also  stated
that there was no irregularity or mala fides involved in
the appointment of the first Respondent.
</p> 

<p id="p_17">11.       When  the Petition came up for final  hearing,
we  requested  Mr.  M.  B.  DCosta, Advocate to  assist
the  Court  as Amicus Curiae.  Accordingly, Mr.  M.   B.
DCosta, Advocate has submitted his written submissions,
which shall be referred to by us in our Judgment.
</p> 

<p id="p_18">12.       <a href="/doc/82904/" id="a_4">Section    3</a>,   Sub-Section     (2)   of   the
<a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_5">Administrative  Tribunal  Act</a>,  1965 provides  that  the
Tribunal  shall consist of a President and an Additional
President,  both  of  whom  shall be  appointed  by  the
Government.  It further provides that both the President
and  the  Additional President shall  have  co-extensive
powers  and  a concurrent jurisdiction to deal with  the
cases  filed  in the Tribunal.  Let us now  examine  the
nature  of  the  disputes  which  are  referred  to  the
Tribunal for adjudication.
</p> 

<p id="p_19">13.       Section  7 of the Goa Administrative  Tribunal
Act,  1965  provides that the Tribunal shall  have  same
powers  as are vested in a Civil Court under the Code of
Civil Procedure in respect of (i) taking  evidence  on
oath,  affirmation  or  affidavit;  (ii)  summoning  and
enforcing the attendance of witnesses;  (iii) compelling
the  discovery and production of documents and  material
objects;   (iv) requisitioning any public record or  any
copy  thereof  from  any court or office;   (v)  issuing
summons  for  examination of witnesses or production  of
documents.    While  exercising   either  revisional  or
appellate  jurisdiction  as  per  <a href="/doc/1477685/" id="a_6">Section  7(1)(A)</a>,  the
Tribunal  has  the  power,  if it  thinks  necessary  to
direct  further  investigation to be made or  additional
evidence  be taken or it may itself take such additional
evidence  or may remand the case for disposal with  such
direction  as it deems fit.  <a href="/doc/1583406/" id="a_7">Section 7(2)</a> provides  that
the Tribunal shall be deemed to be a Civil Court and its
proceedings  shall be deemed to be judicial  proceedings
within  the meaning of <a href="/doc/308396/" id="a_8">Sections 193</a>, <a href="/doc/311136/" id="a_9">219</a> and <a href="/doc/1969991/" id="a_10">228</a> of  the
Indian  Penal  Code.  <a href="/doc/1491847/" id="a_11">Section 10</a> of the Act clothes  the
Tribunal  with  the powers of review either on  its  own
motion  or an application made to it either by the party
interested   or   on  the   application  of  the   State
Government.   <a href="/doc/535122/" id="a_12">Section 11</a> provides that all final  orders
of the Tribunal shall be executed  in the same manner as
a Decree of a Civil Court.  A Notification, published in
the  Official Gazette dated 31st December, 1976  clothes
the  Administrative  Tribunal  in the  exercise  of  its
original,  appellate or revisional jurisdiction with all
the powers which are vested in a Civil Court.
</p> 

<p id="p_20">14.       Mr.   M.   B.   DCosta, the  learned  Counsel
appointed as Amicus Curiae, has submitted before us that
the  Administrative  Tribunal  has the  jurisdiction  to
decide:
</p>  

<p id="p_21">A.   Appeals  under the Goa  School  Education
Section  22  of the Goa School Education  Act,

</p> 

<p id="p_47">16.       It  is  thus  clear  that  the  Administrative
Tribunal  performs  judicial functions and is  a  Court.
The  Administrative  Tribunal adjudicates upon  disputes
that  would  have  been within the jurisdiction  of  the
ordinary  Civil  Courts to decide.   The  Administrative
Tribunal acts as an Appellate Court against the decision
of  the  Registrars  nominee   under  the   Maharashtra

<p id="p_48">17.       The  learned  Single  Judge of this  Court  in
Maharashtra  Co-operative  Courts  Bar  Association  and
1990(3)  BCR  437  has  held  that  the  Judges  of  the
Co-operative  Court  are  Judicial  Officers  and  their
appointments  are  to be governed by <a href="/doc/205445/" id="a_38">Article 234</a> of  the
Constitution of India.  The Administrative Tribunal acts
as an Appellate Court over the decisions rendered by the
Registrars  nominee,  who  in   Goa  functions  as  the
Co-operative  Court.   The  Administrative  Tribunal  is
clothed with  judicial  powers  and  hears  and  decides
Appeals  and Revisions and is, therefore, a Court though
the  nominclature is that of "Administrative  Tribunal".
The  powers  which the President of  the  Administrative
Tribunal  exercises  and which are conferred on him  are
judicial  in  nature  and  the   orders  passed  by  the
Administrative Tribunal are binding on the parties.  The
next   question   is  whether   the  President  of   the
Administrative Tribunal can be considered as a "District
Judge"  within  the definition of their term in  <a href="/doc/730559/" id="a_39">Article
236</a>  of the Constitution of India.  It may  incidentally
be  stated  that the pay scales of the President of  the
Administrative Tribunal and that of a District Judge are
identical.

conceded  that  the appointment of the first  Respondent
cannot  be sustained.  According to the learned Advocate
General,  prior  consultation with the High Court as  is
contemplated  in <a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_40">Article 233</a> is a must before appointing
any person as President of the Administrative Tribunal.
</p> 

<p id="p_50">19.       Mr.   M.   B.   DCosta,  the  learned  Amicus

Apex  Court  in  <a href="/doc/1353604/" id="a_41">State  of  Maharastra  v.   Labour  Law</a>
2  SCC  688  to urge before us that  the  Administrative
Tribunal is a Court as it adjudicates upon disputes that
would  have been within the jurisdiction of the ordinary
Civil  Courts.   Their  Lordships of the  Supreme  Court
after  considering  <a href="/doc/67871/" id="a_42">Chandra  Mohan  v.   State  of  U.P</a>.
should  not  be  interpreted narrowly  to  exclude  from
judicial service new hierarchy of Civil Courts being set
up  which are headed by a Judge who can be considered as
a   District  Judge  bearing  in  mind   the   extensive
definition  of  their  term  in   <a href="/doc/730559/" id="a_43">Article  236</a>  of   the
Constitution  of India".  In para 20, Their Lordships of
the  Supreme  Court have endorsed the view of  the  High
Court  which  have held that the persons presiding  over
Industrial and Labour Courts would constitute a judicial
service  so  defined and, therefore, the recruitment  of
Labour  Court  Judges  would be required to be  made  in
accordance  with  <a href="/doc/205445/" id="a_44">Article  234</a> of  the  Constitution  of

<p id="p_51">20.       Mr.   M.   B.   DCosta,  the  learned  Amicus

Sah  and  others</a>    and
particularly to para 45 of the Report which reads thus:-
 "As  we  have already seen  above,
the  second  part of  <a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_46">Article  235</a>
deals  with  the  topic  of  other
conditions  of  service  including
the right of appeal which might be
guaranteed to judicial officers by
appropriate legislation enacted by
the   authorities   acting   under
<a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_47">Article   309</a>  but   that  is   an
operation  on  the  limited  field
permitted  by  the second part  of
<a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_48">Article 235</a> at the second level of
the  pyramid  of  the  Subordinate
Judiciary  and nothing more.   Dr.
Dhavan was right when he contended
that on the scheme of Articles 233
to  235  it  is not  as  if  other
legislation   is  a  total  taboo.</p>
<p id="p_52">However,   the   said   submission
ignores  the  fact that it is  the
limited  field  earmarked  by  the
second   part  of    <a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_49">Article   235</a>
regarding  permissible  regulation
of  conditions of service that  is
reserved  for operation of <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_50">Article
309</a>   through    its   appropriate
authorities.  But, save and except
this  limited  aspect   which   is
permitted, the rest of the control
totally  vests  in the High  Court
under  <a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_51">Article  235</a>   first  part.</p>
<p id="p_53">What  is permitted by <a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_52">Article  235</a>
cannot  be considered as a blanket
power     entrusted      to    the

under   <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_53">Article    309</a>    by   the

</p><p id="p_54">These  twin articles conspicuously
do  not envisage even the  limited

Constitution-makers that so far as
appointment to available vacancies
and  Judges  of   the  Subordinate
Legislature   nor   the  Governor,
High   Court,    can    have   any
supplied by us)
 

</p><p id="p_55">21.       Similarly,  our attention was also invited  to
the  decision  of  the Apex Court  in  Chandramouleshwar
 and particularly to the observations  of
the Apex Court at para 7 which reads thus:
 "Consultation  with the High Court
under  <a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_56">Article 233</a> is not an empty
formality.  So far as promotion of
officers  to the cadre of District
Judges is concerned the High Court
is  best  fitted  to  adjudge  the
claims and merits of persons to be
considered  for   promotion.   The
Governor   cannot   discharge  his
function  under <a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_57">Article 233</a> if  he
makes  an appointment of a  person
without   ascertaining   the  High
Courts  view  in regard  thereto.
</p><p id="p_56">It  was  strenuously contended  on
behalf  of the State of Bihar that
the  materials  before  the  Court
amply  demonstrate that there  had
been  consultation  with the  High
Court  before  the  issue  of  the
notification  of October 17, 1968.
</p><p id="p_57">It  was  said that the High  Court
had given the Government its views
in the matter;  the Government was
posted  with  all  the  facts  and
there  was consultation sufficient
for  the  purpose of <a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_58">Article  233.</a>
</p><p id="p_58">We    cannot       accept    this.
</p><p id="p_59">Consultation  or  deliberation  is
not  complete or effective  before
the  parties  thereto  make  their

respective points of view known to
the  other  or others and  discuss
and examine the relative merits of
their views.  If one party makes a
proposal  to  the other who has  a
counter proposal in his mind which
is   not  communicated    to   the
proposer  the  direction  to  give
effect  to  the  counter  proposal
without  anything more, cannot  be
said  to  have been  issued  after
consultation.  In our opinion, the
notification  of October 17,  1968
was not in compliance with <a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_59">Article
233</a>  of the Constitution.  In  the
absence   of    consultation   the
validity  of  the notification  of
October   17,  1968    cannot   be
sustained".
</p> 

<p id="p_60">22.       Thus,   looking  to  the   functions  of   the
Administrative  Tribunal, we are of the considered  view
that  the Administrative Tribunal is a Court.  Since, it
is  vested  with judicial powers of Appeal and  Revision
under  the  various  statutes, which powers  are  to  be
exercised  by a District Judge, we are of the view  that
the post of the President of the Administrative Tribunal
is equivalent to the post of a District Judge within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/730559/" id="a_60">Article 236</a> of the Constitution of India.  In
our  considered  view,  therefore, the  Respondent  No.1
could  not  have been appointed as the President of  the
Administrative  Tribunal without prior consultation with
the High Court.  The Respondent No.1 has, therefore, not
been   appointed  in  terms  of   <a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_61">Article  233</a>  of   the
Constitution of India and, therefore, his appointment is
illegal  and  he  is  usurper  of  the  Office  of   the
Administrative Tribunal.
</p> 

<p id="p_61">23.       Mr.   M.   S.  Usgaonkar, the  learned  Senior
Counsel  appearing on behalf of the first Respondent has
urged  before us that the first Respondent is  qualified
as  per  the  qualifications  prescribed  and  thus  the
appointment of the first Respondent has not been made in
contravention  of  the Goa Administrative Tribunal  Acts
and  Rules.  Further, it is urged by Mr.  Usgaonkar, the
learned  Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the first
Respondent  that  since the Respondent No.1 fulfils  the
eligibility  criteria,  the  Respondent  No.1  could  be
appointed  after  consultation with the High  Court  and
thus,  the  writ of quo warranto would be  futile.   The
learned  Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the first
Respondent has placed strong reliance on the decision in
<a href="/doc/1916481/" id="a_62">P.  L.  Lakhanpal v.  Ajit Nath Ray</a> reported in AIR 1975
prayed  for  against the then Chief Justice of India  on
the  ground  that  the Chief Justice of India  had  been
appointed   in  violation  of   <a href="/doc/1995948/" id="a_63">Article  124(2)</a>  of  the
Constitution  of  India  as the  mandatory  consultation
comprehended  was not made and as the Rule of  seniority
which  inheres in that Article was not followed and  the
appointment  was malafide.  The Full Bench of the  Delhi
High  Court  held  that  the issue of the  writ  of  quo
warranto  would  be  futile  because of  the  result  of
resignation  of the Judges who were senior to Justice A.
N.   Ray(Respondent)  had  resigned  and  Justice A.  N.
Ray,  therefore, became the senior most puinse Judge  and
not  only could be re-appointed but would be entitled to
be re-appointed as the Chief Justice of India.
</p> 

<p id="p_62">24.       The  decision of the Full Bench and the  point
canvassed by Mr.  M.  S.  Usgaonkar, the learned Counsel
appearing  on  behalf of the first Respondent  fell  for
consideration before the Division Bench of this Court in
the  Judgment of Gajanan Krishnaji Bapat v.  Corporation
I.C.   167.   The  Division  Bench   in  para  15  after
considering  the  Full Bench Judgment of the Delhi  High
Court has held thus:-
</p><p id="p_63"> "Though the above cases have dealt
with the principle of the futility
of  the  writ of quo warranto,  we
think that this aspect of futility
will have to be borne in mind even
when  we  consider  the  grant  or
otherwise  of  any other  type  of
writ,    order    or    direction.</p>
<p id="p_64">Ordinarily,  this Court would  not
issue  a writ which has an element
of   futility.   But    the   main
question  is as to whether in  the
present  case  an  order  or  writ
quashing  the  impugned orders  is
likely  to  become futile or  not.
</p><p id="p_65">It  was  contended by  Mr.   Bobde
that  the  Corporation may in  its
meeting   re-appoint    respondent
No.4.   He  drew our attention  to
the  fact that respondent No.4  is
qualified to hold the post of Dean
and as such there could not be any
impediment  for the re-appointment
of  the respondent No.4.  We think
that  the  principle  of  futility
arising   on   account    of   the
likelihood   of     re-appointment
cannot be extended to a case where
the  appointing  authority has  no
power to make the appointment.  To
put  it more clearly, would it  be
possible   for    the   appointing
authority,  as also the  appointed
person,  to  say that  though  the
appointment  has not emanated from
the  competent, still do not quash
the appointment because one cannot
rule out the possibility that some
rightful     authority      having
competence to make the appointment
may make the appointment in favour
of  respondent No.4?  We feel that
such   defence   would    not   be
permissible   by   extending   the
principle  of futility of a  writ.
</p><p id="p_66">The contingency  of re-appointment
would  have  some importance  when
the  person who has made the first
appointment    can     make   such
re-appointment  after  curing  any
irregularity.    This   does   not
include   a    case    where   the
appointing  authority has no power
to  make  an appointment.  It  was
rightly  urged  on behalf  of  the
petitioner    that      if     the
respondents     contention     is
accepted,   the   position   would
become    very     anomalous   and
irrational,  as  any person  could
make  any appointment for any post
and   the  appointee    with   all
impurity  would  sit tight on  the
post  by  asking the Court not  to
exercise  the  discretion  as  the
possibility   of    the   rightful
authority    re-appointing    that
person could not be ruled out".
</p> 

<p id="p_67">25.       Mr.   M.   S.  Usgaonkar, the  learned  Senior
Counsel  appearing on behalf of the first Respondent has
not seriously canvassed the point of locus standi of the
Petitioner  to file the Petition.  However, a  reference
may  usefully be made in the Judgment of the Apex  Court
in  <a href="/doc/112850760/" id="a_64">S.   P.   Gupta  v.   Union  of  India</a>  reported  in
1981(Supp) SCC 87 wherein the Apex Court has held thus:-</p>
<p id="p_68"> "Yet  again,  whenever there is  a
public  wrong  or   public  injury
caused  by  an act or omission  of
the  State  or a public  authority
which   is    contrary    to   the
Constitution  or  the   law,   any
member  of the public acting  bona
fide   and     having   sufficient
interest  can  maintain an  action
for redressal of such public wrong
or public injury.  The strict rule
of  standing  which  insists  that
only  a person who has suffered  a
specific legal injury can maintain
an  action for judicial redress is
relaxed   and  a   broad  rule  is
evolved  which  gives standing  to
any  member  of the public who  is
not   a   mere   busybody   or   a
meddlesome  interloper but one who
has  sufficient  interest  in  the
proceeding.   In the absence of  a
machinery to effectively represent
the  public interest generally  in
courts,   it  is    necessary   to
liberalise the rule of standing in
order  to provide judicial redress
for  public  injury  arising  from
breach  of  public  duty  or  from
other    violation      of     the
Constitution   or  the    law   by
allowing public minded persons and
organisations  to  move the  court
and  act  for a general  or  group
interest,  even  though, they  may
not  be directly injured in  their
own   rights.   It  is   only   by
liberalising  the  rule  of  locus
standi  that  it  is  possible  to
effectively  police the  corridors
of power and prevent violations of
law.   The  oppression   might  be
financial,  commercial,  corporate
or governmental".
</p> 

<p id="p_69">26.       The appointment of the first Respondent cannot

be  faulted on the ground that the first Respondent is a
relative  of the third Respondent who was then the State
Law  Minister.   An independent Selection Committee  had
been constituted comprising of Respondent Nos.4, 5 and 6
and  they  had  selected  the   first  Respondent   from
amongst  the  various  candidates  who  had  applied  in
pursuance to the advertisement.  The Selection Committee
comprising  of Respondent Nos.4, 5 and 6 are independent
persons  and  there is nothing to suggest that the  said
Selection Committee was amenable to being pressurised in
selecting a particular candidate.  There is also nothing
on  record to suggest that the third Respondent, who is
distantly  related  to the first Respondent, has in  any
manner   influenced   the   Selection  Committee.    We,
therefore,  see  no  merit  in this  submission  of  the
Petitioner.
</p> 

<p id="p_70">27.       We,  therefore,  unhesitantly  hold  that  the
appointment  of Respondent No.1 is not by any  authority
of  law.  The Government had no authority to appoint the
first  Respondent as the President of the Administrative
Tribunal  in  flagrant breach of the mandate of  <a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_65">Article
233</a> of the Constitution of India.  In the preceding para
of  the  Judgment,  we have held that the  post  of  the
President  of the Administrative Tribunal is  equivalent
to  the  post of a District Judge as defined in  <a href="/doc/730559/" id="a_66">Article
236</a>  of  the  Constitution of India.   Thus,  the  Order
appointing the first Respondent dated 24th October, 2001
cannot be sustained and deserves to be quashed.
</p> 

<p id="p_71">28.       This  is a public interest litigation and  the
Petitioner  has not challenged the validity of the Rules
relating  to  the  appointment of the President  of  the
Administrative  Tribunal.  The appointment of the  first
Respondent,  without  prior consultation with  the  High
Court,  is ultra vires the Constitution of India.  Hence
the  Rules are ineffective and unenforceable.  According
to  us,  the Rules providing for the appointment of  the
President  of  the  Administrative Tribunal  instead  of
being  struck down as unconstitutional, can be read down
to   include  consultation  with   the  High  Court,  in
consonance  with  <a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_67">Article  233</a> of  the  Constitution  of
India,  before appointing any person as the President of
the Administrative Tribunal.
</p> 

<p id="p_72">29.       The  Apex Court in Delhi Transport Corporation
1991 SC 101 has held as under:
</p><p id="p_73"> "The  doctrine of reading down  or
of  recasting  the statute can  be
applied in limited situations.  It
is  essentially used, firstly, for
saving a statute from being struck
down    on    account    of    its
unconstitutionality.   It  is   an
extension  of  the principle  that
when   two   interpretations   are
possible    one     rendering   it
constitutional   and   the   other
making  it  unconstitutional,  the
former  should be preferred.   The
unconstitutionality  may    spring
from  either  the incompetence  of
the  legislature  to   enact   the
statute  or from its violation  of
any  of  the   provisions  of  the
Constitution.      The      second
situation which summons its aid is
where   the  provisions   of   the
statute  are  vague and  ambiguous
and  it is possible to gather  the
intentions of the legislature from
the  object  of the  statute,  the
context  in  which  the  provision
occurs  and the purpose for  which
it is made".
</p> 

<p id="p_74">30.       Relying  on the aforesaid Judgment of the Apex
Court, we are of the considered opinion that in order to
save the Rules from being struck down as ultra vires the
Constitution,   the  Rules  should  be  read   down   to
mandatorily  include  consultation with the  High  Court
before  making  any  appointment  to  the  post  of  the
President   or   the  Additional    President   of   the
Administrative Tribunal.
</p> 

<p id="p_75">31.       We  hope that in future when the  appointments
to  the  post  of the President  of  the  Administrative
Tribunal  are  made, <a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_68">Article 233</a> of the Constitution  of
India would be followed in its letter and spirit so that
the  independence of the Judiciary is secured which  the
Apex Court says is the "bulkwark".
</p> 

<p id="p_76">32.       Before  parting  with  the Judgment,  we  must
place  on  record our deep appreciation to  the  efforts
taken  by  Mr.   M.  B.  DCosta,  the  learned  Counsel
appointed  by us as Amicus Curiae, in placing before  us
the  relevant and necessary data which has enabled us to
effectively   adjudicate  the  point   raised  in   this
Petition.
</p> 

<p id="p_77">33.       In the result, therefore, Writ Petition No.351
of  2001  is  allowed.   The appointment  of  the  first
Respondent  as  the  President   of  the  Administrative
Tribunal,  dated  24th October, 2001, is hereby  quashed
and  set  aside.  Rule made absolute in terms of  prayer
clauses (a) and (b) with no order as to costs.
