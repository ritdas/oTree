21.12.2017 Present:   Mr.Deven Khanna, Advocate as Amicus Curiae.

</p>
<p id="p_7">                      We have had interaction with Dr. Krishan

             Chand, Senior Scientific Professional, who is present in

             Court.   This was pursuant to suggestions given by



             Mr.Deven Khanna, learned Amicus Curiae, that the

             information qua the public conveniences should be




             geo-tagged and flagged.
</p>
<p id="p_8">



</p><p id="p_9">                        Mr.Shivank Singh Panta, learned counsel,





             further clarifies that all this can be done instantly

             without incurring any cost.   All that is required to be

             done is that a person posted at the place of availability

             of such public conveniences, has to geo-tag/flag such

             conveniences on the Google map. This would help the

             general public know the place and the type of

             conveniences available.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                        We see no reason as to why this cannot be

             or should not be done by the Department of Tourism at

             the earliest. All that is required to be done is to issue




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                              ::: Downloaded on - 26/12/2017 23:01:42 :::HCHP</span>
     direction    to   the   officers/officials   posted        at    their

    conveniences/centres to open the Google map and do




                                                             .
</p>
<p id="p_11">    the needful.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                 As such, we direct the Managing Director,





    Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation to

    have the needful done immediately.

</p><p id="p_13">                 Another suggestion, which has come on





    record, is that map server can be installed with the

    involvement of AGISAC-a Government body, to create

    data and consumption of essential data of such

    information.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                 We are not aware as to whether within the



    State of Himachal Pradesh, such facility is available or

    not.   Fully appreciative of advantages of such portal,




    which we are told, presently is available in the States of





    Madhya Pradesh and Odisha, can be made available





    here also.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                 In fact, the suggestion, to us, appears to be

    meaningful and purposeful. As such, we direct the

    Principal    Secretary,    Department        of     Environment,

    Science and Technology and Additional Chief Secretary,

    Tourism, to the Government of Himachal Pradesh, to

    explore the possibility of having such server installed in

    the State of Himachal Pradesh at the earliest.                    The

    advantages of use of such technology are manifold.

</p><p id="p_16">                   Correct, complete and accurate information

    of the unit, its capacity and the facilities would be

</p>
<p id="p_17">    instantly available to the information seeker. Perhaps

    if registration of all the hotels/establishments on this





    server     is made mandatory,             it would        also     check

    infringement/violation, in fact compliance of all the

    laws, applicable within the State of Himachal Pradesh





    and more specifically the Himachal Pradesh Tourism

    Development Registration Act, 2002 and Water


    (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.

</p><p id="p_18">                  Cost of setting of this server, can be

    recovered         from      all     the        industrial           units/



    establishments/hotels functional and operational in the




    State of Himachal Pradesh, perhaps also from the

    advertisers who may be called upon to advertise.





</p><p id="p_19">                  Let affidavits of compliance be filed before





    the next date of hearing by Principal Secretary,

    Department of Environment, Science and Technology

    and   Additional        Chief   Secretary,       Tourism,        to    the

    Government of Himachal Pradesh as also by the

    Managing Director, HPTDC.
