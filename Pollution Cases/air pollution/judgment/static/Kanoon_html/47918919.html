                                  JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">       Petitioners in both these Writ Petitions are aggrieved by the denial of

affiliation by the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University to the educational

institutions run by them, on the ground that the petitioner Colleges do not fulfill

the conditions/norms fixed by the University. Petitioners seek affiliation based on

extension of approval granted to them by the All India Council for Technical

Education (AICTE) for commencing additional courses in continuation of the

approval granted to them in 2019-20. According to the petitioners, the University

has no authority to insist any further condition once approval is granted by the

AICTE. Both the petitioners had approached this Court when affiliation was

denied to them in the last academic year.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.    W.P(c).No.12314 of 2020

      2.1.   The petitioner college was granted Ext.P2 approval by the AICTE on

30.04.2019 for an additional new course in B.Tech in Aeronautical Engineering

with an intake of 60. However, while granting extension of affiliation, as per

Ext.P3 for the undergraduate courses -B.Tech in Civil Engineering, Chemical

Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering and Mechanical Engineering for
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">13563/2020                               6</span>


the academic year 2019-2020 with an intake of 60 each, University did not grant

affiliation to the additional course of B.Tech in Aeronautical Engineering. The

petitioner thereupon filed W.P(C).No.18319/2019. The University had filed a

statement therein to the effect that it had decided to grant affiliation only to the

institutions which satisfied the conditions: (1) it is having NBA accreditation (2)

intake of students for the last 3 academic years was more than 30% of the

sanctioned intake and academic performance was satisfactory. It was also stated

that the University had not issued NOC to the petitioner. This Court in Ext.P5

judgment dated 02.08.2019 found that the rejection was on valid grounds,

accepting the contention of the University that it had not issued NOC. A Review

Petition filed in March, 2020, against the judgment was disposed of on 10.08.2020

clarifying that the said judgment would not stand in the way of considering the

claim of the petitioners for affiliation in subsequent years in accordance with law.

</p><p id="p_3">      2.2.    In the meanwhile on 11.02.2020, the petitioner filed an application

for affiliation of the very same course for the year 2020-21. On 15.06.2020,

AICTE granted Ext.P15 extension of approval to the petitioner College for 5

undergraduate courses including Aeronautical Engineering for the year 2020-21.

As per Exts.P12 and P13, affiliation inspection fee was remitted on 18.06.2020.

The petitioner submits that though no deficiency is reported, University has been

denying affiliation on irrelevant grounds. Petitioner challenges Ext.P6 order dated

22.06.2019, by which the Government issued norms for issuing NOC and Exts.P7
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">13563/2020                                7</span>


and P14 orders issued on 17.01.2020 and 10.06.2020 by which the University

fixed norms for granting affiliation.    Government issued a general order Ext.P6

on 22.06.2019 fixing 3 criteria for issuing NOC for commencing new UG/PG

courses ie. (1) the programmes in the colleges should have NBA accreditation; (2)

admission in the previous years should be more than 50% of their sanctioned

intake and (3) the courses sought to be started should be innovative and should

have the approval of AICTE. The petitioner has alleged that NOC from the

Government is not required for starting additional courses and the order passed by

the Government is without authority and contrary to the well settled law on the

point. The petitioner claims that once the AICTE granted extension of approval,

the University cannot impose any restriction much less unreasonable restriction on

the fundamental right of the petitioner to run the educational institution and to start

the course in the academic year 2020-21. In Ext.P7 order dated 17.01.2020, it was

stated that based on the suggestion of the Vice Chancellor to frame a policy to start

new UG/PG courses by colleges affiliated to University, the Academic Council

after discussion recommended the following norms for according affiliation to new

UG/PG course in the colleges:(1) at least one of the existing programmes should

be NBA accredited; (2) average intake in the College for the previous three years

should be more than 50% of the sanctioned intake and (3) proposed programme

should have AICTE approval and NOC from Government at the time of

application. The proposed programme should have industry demand/employment
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">13563/2020                                  8</span>


potential. Thereafter, revised norms were issued as per Ext.P14 order dated

10.6.2020 based on the decision of the syndicate. In that order it was stated that

the recommendations of the Academic Council was placed before the 11 th meeting

of the syndicate and syndicate after deliberation resolved to fix the following

norms : (1) at least one of the existing programmes should be NBA accredited. In

the case of PG programmes, the UG programme should have NBA accreditation,

(2) the average annual intake in the institution for the previous 3 years should be

more than 50% of the sanctioned intake, 3) the proposed programme should have

AICTE approval and NOC from the Government and 4) proposed programme

should have industry demand/employment potential. The petitioner challenges

these norms on the ground that the University does not have any authority to

impose    such    conditions    when     the AICTE       has   granted   extension   of

approval/approval. The petitioner also complains that even after remitting the

inspection fee of Rs.1 lakh, the respondent University did not take any action to

inspect the infrastructural facilities in the college.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      2.3.   According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the conditions

fixed by the University are with respect to programmes and not courses.

Therefore, affiliation cannot be denied based on those norms. Going by the

definition of `programme' as well as `course' in AICTE Regulation as well as

Approval Process Handbook (APH), `course' is a particular branch of study in a

`programme' and thus undergraduate course in Aeronautical Engineering is a
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">13563/2020                                9</span>


branch of study in Engineering and Technology programme.                   Petitioner's

application was for affiliation of a course. It is also contended that NOC from the

Government or University is not required for granting affiliation for an additional

course for which AICTE has granted approval.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      2.4.   On the other hand, the contention of the University in its statement as

well as in the counter affidavit is that in view of Ext.P5 interparte judgment, the

petitioner cannot be heard to raise such contentions against the University, as

petitioner's claim is for affiliation on the basis of the very same approval, which is

extended by AICTE. In the statement filed on behalf of the University, it was

stated that considering the number of seats remaining vacant in the Colleges and

lowering of the academic standards in the engineering sector, this Court had

already upheld the action of the University in not granting affiliation. University

stated that on account of the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic it was not possible

to conduct any inspection of the college for checking the infrastructure and other

requirements. At the same time, being a regulatory body, the University has to be

vigilant to prevent further dropping of academic standards of engineering branch

and therefore to safeguard the interest of the society particularly, the student

community, it has fixed the norms for affiliation. It is stated that NBA accredited

Engineering degrees are valid in 20 nations. It is stated that in order to see that the

academic standard of the Graduate, Post Graduate and Research Programmes of

the Engineering Science, Technology and Management is improved, University
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">13563/2020                                 10</span>


has gone for NBA instead of NAAC.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      2.5.   In the counter affidavit it is stated that production of NOC from the

affiliating University is mandatory for application for approval from AICTE and

the petitioner has not obtained the same. It is stated that NBA accreditation is one

of the requirements for grant of additional courses/increase in intake, under the

provisions contained in paras.2.15, 2.15(1), 2.15(2), 2.15(3) of the Approval

Process Handbook and therefore as the petitioner College does not have NBA

accreditation, it is not eligible for approval or affiliation for starting the course. It

is stated that in order to ensure that additional courses are granted only to

deserving institutions, the University had constituted a sub-committee to examine

the matter. The Sub Committee had, after considering the report on Annual

Employability Survey 2019 submitted by an agency appointed by the Government

of India and the NASSCOM-McKiensy report Perspective 2020 and after

examining the functioning of NBA, found that accreditation of an institution by

NBA should be an important criteria for selection. It had also found that the

academic audit of the affiliated institutions conducted by external auditors is also

relevant. The Sub Committee had concluded that institutions which have

undergone the process of NBA accreditation were getting higher rating in the

academic audit and the decision of the syndicate to award new programme only to

NBA accredited institutions would ensure academic quality benchmarks as

envisaged in the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_1">University Act</a>, 2015. The decision to award new courses only to
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">13563/2020                               11</span>


such institutions was in tune with APH issued by the AICTE, according to which,

NBA accreditation is needed for new courses. It is stated that after examining the

list of Colleges where AICTE granted approval without NBA accreditation and on

the basis of the report of the sub committee, the syndicate as per Ext.R1(c) decided

to approve the same as a criterion for granting affiliation to additional courses. It

is their further case that the definitions given in AICTE regulations, its handbook

etc. cannot be relied on to understand the meaning of expression used by the

University in its norms. According to the respondents, the University wants to see

that the quality and standard of the education in the technical field are enhanced

and the interest of the student community is protected. It is stated that in view of

Ext.P5 judgment, the approval granted by AICTE will not confer any right on the

petitioner institute to claim NOC from the University and the University has the

power to consider the issue whether to grant NOC or not on the basis of the norms

framed by it. It is stated that on the basis of Ext.P8 regulation produced by the

petitioner itself the petitioner is not entitled to NOC from the 1 st respondent

University or the AICTE for B.Tech in Aeronautical Engineering. From regulation

4.9 of the AICTE Regulations (Ext.P8), NOC from the 1 st respondent University is

mandatory for any technical institution seeking approval from the AICTE as

specified in the Approval Process Handbook (APH). As per paragraph 2.1 and sub

paragraphs 1 to 3 thereof NBA accreditation is mandatory for getting approval

from AICTE for additional courses.            The petitioner does not have NBA

accreditation. In Ext.P7 the University laid down the norms to the effect that for

affiliating or starting new programme/new course at least one of the existing

programmes in the petitioner's institution should have NBA accreditation and in

the case of PG programme the Undergraduate concerned should have NBA

accreditation and should have AICTE approval and it should have NOC from the

Government. It is stated that the requirement of producing NOC from the

Government has been given a go-bye. It is stated that Ext.P13 zero deficiency

report is a report generated by the petitioner itself and not issued by the University.

The University had in its meeting held on 20.03.2020 decided to appoint a sub

committee to look into the issue regarding new programme/course, in order to see

that only deserving technical institutions should be granted NOC; the sub-

committee after examining the Annual Employability Survey 2019 prepared by an

agency appointed by the Government of India, the performance of duties and

functioning of NBA, etc. furnished report. It was decided that NBA accreditation

should be an important criterion for selection. The sub-Committee found that the

institutions with NBA accreditation are getting higher rating in the academic audit

and therefore the decision of the syndicate to award new programme only to NBA

accredited institutions will ensure academic quality benchmarks envisaged in the

APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University Act, 2015. It is stated that the finding

of the sub-committee was in tune with the provisions in Approval Process

Handbook issued by the AICTE. The syndicate after examining the report of the
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">13563/2020                                13</span>


Sub-committee and taking note of the fact that the AICTE granted approval to

several colleges without NBA accreditation, in its meeting held on 24.06.2020,

resolved to adopt a criteria for granting affiliation to the new courses/programmes,

in Colleges without NBA accreditation, in order to ensure the quality of teaching-

learning process, i.e (1) the institution should have more than 50% pass for the

outgoing students at the time of application for affiliation (2) the institution should

have most recent academic audit overall score of GOOD and (3) the institution

should have 3 years' average intake of more than 50% sanctioned strength. It is

pointed out that the syndicate has used the expressions `programme/course' in

Ext.R1(c) minutes; the meaning of the expressions "programme" and "course"

used by the University cannot be understood in the manner in which those words

and expressions are defined by AICTE in its regulations or APH. Pointing out

Ext.R1(d) and (e) letters dated 16.05.2017 and 19.01.2018 of the NBA, it is stated

that NBA had also employed the expression programme while awarding

accreditation status to an aided College to its undergraduate 'programme' in Civil

Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. It is stated that the University was

following the nomenclature adopted by the NBA and it was using the word

programme as a specific branch of learning in Engineering and not to mean the

field of Technical Engineering. It is further stated that the expert committee of

AICTE could not visit the petitioner institution before issuing Ext.P15, due to

COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and apparently Ext.P15 was issued on the last date

fixed for considering grant of approval without verifying the fulfillment of

requirements, provided in the APH 2.9.2, for starting a new course; AICTE had

therefore required all the institutions to file an affidavit in Rs.100/- Stamp paper

with a specific undertaking that the institution which applied for approval without

NOC of the University concerned shall submit the same before 30.06.2020. It is

stated that Ext.P15 approval is subject to production of NOC by the University. It

is further stated that NOC for starting a new course can be granted only in

accordance with Clause 6(3)(a) of the Regulations; as per Clause 6.3(a), the

AICTE shall grant approval after confirming that the applicant has fulfilled all the

norms and standards through the procedure prescribed in the Approval Process

Handbook (APH). Under Regulation 6(3)(f), an institution shall be eligible for

new courses equal to the number of NBA accredited courses upto a maximum of 4.

As per paragraph 2.15 of the APH, an institution shall be entitled to get approval

for starting additional course only if it has NBA accreditation. It is further stated

that the University would consider the question of grant of NOC to the eligible

institutions as per Ext.R1(c).

<p id="p_7">      2.6.   The petitioner has filed a reply affidavit stating that the petitioner has

obtained Ext.P21 NOC from the University on 13.02.2019 for closure of B.Tech

course in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with an intake of 60 and

thereafter it applied for approval of additional course and that the only condition in

para 2.15.4(a) of the APH is that the total intake shall not exceed the maximum

intake allowed. The petitioner points out that as per Exts.P22 and P23 scrutiny

committee reports of 2019, as against the columns "NOC from concerned State

Government and NOC from concerned University" it was mentioned "Not

Applicable". According to the petitioner, as per the APH for 2019-20, NOC was

necessary only for starting additional programme and not for additional course. It

is stated that clause 17.7 of the APH for 2020-21 does not require NOC from the

University or State for additional courses and the denial of affiliation on that

ground is illegal.   The petitioner stated that NBA accreditation is also not

necessary in view of para 2.15.4(a). Therefore, according to the petitioner, going

by Appendix 3, NBA accreditation is not necessary to start a course in

Aeronautical Engineering under Engineering and Technology programme. Since

approval was already granted in 2019-20, no further affidavit is necessary as

alleged by the respondents. It is also the contention that the words and expressions

to be used are as defined by the AICTE and it is for the University to move the

AICTE in case there is any defect. Further contention of the petitioner is that the

University cannot invoke its decision of 24.06.2020, fixing norms for affiliation of

courses/programmes on the petitioner institution unless it is issued in the form of

an order or made known to the public.

<p id="p_9">      2.8.   In the statement filed by the learned Government Pleader it is stated

that there were only 15 Engineering Colleges in the State in the year 1997 with an

intake of 4844 students. Engineering education in the State was opened to private

self financing sector since 2000. For the last one and a half decades private self

financing institutions were indiscriminately sanctioned in the State without any

proper study of the need for such institutions.        At present there are 149

Engineering Colleges in the State with a total annual intake capacity of 47,420

students of which 3,430 are in Government Engineering Colleges, 1,844 are in 3

Government aided Engineering Colleges, 80 are in 1 Agricultural University, 120

are in 5 Colleges under the Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, 40 are in 1

Kerala Fisheries University, 6819 in 25 Government controlled self financing

Engineering Colleges and the remaining 35,087 are in 105 private self financing

Engineering Colleges. Apart from that there are Engineering Institutions in the

State. Annual intake of UG Engineering Colleges in the State amounts to almost

4% of the all India intake. It is stated that     mushrooming of self financing

engineering colleges, unhealthy competition among them and the poor

infrastructure and faculty in most of the self financing and engineering colleges in

the State resulted in serious dent in the quality of Engineering education and

approximately 80% of those graduates from such institutions are not employable;

large section of Engineering graduates are under-employed and majority of them

are seeking employment in sectors not related to engineering; the demand for

undergraduate courses in Engineering in the private self-financing sector is on a

steep decline for the last decade as evident from the approved intake and the

vacancies in private self financing colleges; vacant seats in such colleges were

19,468 in 2015-16; 20,038 in 2016-17 and 22,819 in 2017-18; except in almost 20

self financing engineering colleges rate of admission is below 10%, based on the

statistics collected from the Commissioner for Entrance Examination who allots

candidates against 50% of the seats in private self financing colleges; pointing out

the admission rate in the petitioner college from Annexures I to III it is stated that

the petitioner institution is totally discarded by public as there is no public demand

in core Engineering subject; whereas in certain private self financing Colleges

good academic standard is maintained. It is submitted that study conducted by

academic experts in the engineering field reported to the Government that the low

rate of admission in colleges like the petitioner institution make such institutions

financially unviable and consequently they further compromise on faculty and

infrastructure which in turn undermine the already depleted standards of education

in such institutions; no such experiments shall be permitted in such institutions by

sanctioning new courses. It is stated that the Government had issued Anenxure IV

order dated 22.06.2019 in that back ground. The University had as per Annexure V

order dated 10.07.2020 sanctioned new courses in 23 colleges which satisfied the

conditions in Annexure V. It is further stated that under section 10(1)(k) of the Act
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">13563/2020                              18</span>


the AICTE shall grant permission for new courses in consultation with the agency

concerned. A proper study should have been conducted on the requirement of the

courses in consultation with the State Government and affiliating University or

Board, which are the agencies referred to in <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_2">Section 10(1)(k)</a>. The provisions

contained in the AICTE Regulations as well as the Approval Process Handbook

prescribe NBA accreditation as a condition for grant of additional courses in

existing institutions. According to the Government, there cannot be any objection

in sanctioning new courses in institutions which have good academic records and

therefore the decision of the University is accepted; the AICTE has to conduct

survey in various fields of technical education, collect data on all related matters

and make forecast of the needed growth and development in technical education

and it shall grant permission to new courses in consultation with the agencies

concerned.    According to the Government, the agencies referred to in <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_3">Section

10(1)(k)</a> are the State Government and the affiliating University/Board.

AICTE filed a statement on behalf of the AICTE.          It is stated that NOC is

no.8 is required for additional course as provided in Clause 17.7 of the APH - page

196 of APH, in the format given in form no.8 at page 219 of the APH; for closure

that an affidavit with regard to submission of NOC for closure of the course from

the State Government would be obtained from the institution as a condition

precedent for processing of application for approval of additional courses and the

institutes have submitted affidavits that they would submit the same; NOC

mentioned in clause 11 in Ext.R2(b) is applicable only for reduction in intake or

closure of course; the AICTE has taken care by way of Clause 7.4 of the APH by

insisting that 60% of the courses should have NBA accreditation within the next 3

years; Director of Technical Education was a member of the Regional Committee;

so far AICTE has not received any objection from the University or the Director of

Technical Education regarding the procedure followed in grant of approval.

understood the difference between `programmes' and `course', in tune with

definition given by AICTE, till they filed the Review Petitions against Ext.P5

judgment, as is admitted in the pleadings there. Therefore, the said difference

alone would not make the petitioner institutions eligible for affiliation. Though the

order dated 10.06.2020 laid down the norms fixed for affiliation of the

'programme', as in the previous orders, all those concerned have understood the

same as those applicable to the courses. As pointed out by Sri.Elvin Peter, even the

NBA, which is a statutory agency constituted under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_26">Section 10(u)</a> of the Act, has

in Exts.R1(d) and (e) granted accreditation to the programmes in Civil

maintenance of standards, one of the duties of the Council is to grant approval for

starting new technical institutions and for introduction of new courses or

programmes in consultation with the agencies concerned.       Under Clause (u) of

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_29">Section 10</a>, the Council has to set up a National Board of Accreditation (`NBA' for

short) to periodically conduct evaluation of technical institutions or programmes

on the basis of guidelines, norms and standards specified by it and to make

recommendation to it, or to the Council, or to the Commission or to other bodies,

regarding recognition or de-recognition of the institution or the programme. In

exercise of the powers conferred on the Council under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_30">Section 23</a> read with

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_31">Sections 10</a> and <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_32">11</a> of the Act, the Council has made 'The AICTE (Grant of

Approvals for Technical Institutions) Regulations, 2020' ("Regulations" for short).

Clause 1.1.(l) makes the Regulations 2020 applicable for the applications

extension of approval, increase in intake/Additional course . As per Clause 3.1(b)

of the Regulations, approval from AICTE is mandatory for any existing technical

institution either to conduct/increase/reduce the intake in the existing courses/

Programmes or to introduce new programmes/Courses at any level in regular

mode. As per sub-clause (c) of Clause 3.1, approval from the AICTE as well as

the affiliating University is necessary for a Technical institution to participate in

the counselling and admission process or to admit students. As per sub-clauses (d)

and (e) of Clause 3.1, the affiliating University or the State Government, as the

case may be, shall not admit any student in the absence of approval of AICTE.

Clause 4 relates to generic conditions for approval. Clause 4.4 provides that in

order to maintain quality of education, 60% of the eligible courses in any technical

institution shall be accredited in the next three years or else EoA would not be

granted. It also provides that appropriate action would be taken against institutions

with admissions consistently meagre.                Under clause 5.5, the Council has to

publish, Approval Process Handbook (APH) detailing all the documents to be

attached to the application; the Technical Education Regulatory (TER) charges to

be remitted, the norms and standards, the requirement and procedure by which the

applications are processed for grant of approval of the new/existing institutions.

Clause 4.9 deals with the requirements for the new/existing institution/deemed to

be Universities conducting Technical Programmes. Clause 4.9.d reads as follows:

</p><p id="p_22">      "4.9.d: NOC from affiliating University/ Board/ State Government/ UT shall be required,
      as applicable, for such applications as specified in the Approval Process Handbook."
Under Clause 4.14, the institutions shall have to fulfill all facilities such as

infrastructure, Faculty and other requirements to offer regular courses as per the

norms specified in the APH for the total approved intake and all such institutions
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">13563/2020                                      27</span>


shall create such infrastructure and other facilities within 2 years to fulfill the

norms. Clause 6 relates to the processing of applications and grant of approval.

Under Clause 6.1 the applications shall be processed in accordance with the

procedure prescribed in the Handbook. Clause 6.2 which relates to the procedure

for setting up new Technical Institution reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      6.2. For setting up new Technical Institution
      a. The State Government/UT and the Affiliating University/Board shall forward their
      views on the applications received for setting up new institutions submitted under
      Clause 1.2.a of the regulations to the concerned Regional Office, not later than one week
      from the last date of submission of application as notified.
      In the absence of receipt of views from the State Government/UT and the Affiliating
      University/Board, the Council shall proceed for further processing.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_23">Therefore, the opportunity for the State Government as well as University to

submit their views is available only when the application is for setting up new

institutions. Petitioners herein have not applied for setting up new institution. It

is relevant to note that the provision contained in the 2020 Regulations and the

Regulation which were in force at the time approval was granted to the petitioners

in 2019 are more or less similar.
</p>
<p id="p_24">      10.    Clause 6.2.k provides that new technical institutions granted letter of

Approval and existing institutions granted approval for introduction of new

courses, divisions, programmes, variation in intake capacity shall comply with

appointment of Faculty and Principal/Director as the case may be, as per the policy

of the Council and institutions except minority institutions, shall appoint Faculty

and Principal/Director and other technical staff as per the method and procedure of

the affiliating University/State Government and information about the appointment

shall be uploaded in the web Portal of the AICTE. As per sub-clause l, Expert

Visit Committee may be conducted to verify the fulfillment of the norms as

specified in the APH, any time before the first batch of students have passed out.

Clause 6.3 deals with processing of applications of the existing institutions. Sub-

clause (a) provides that for applications submitted under Clause 1.2, the Council

shall grant approval only after confirming that the applicant has fulfilled all the

norms and standards through the procedure as specified in the APH.                                  The

petitioners have stated that they are granted approval for additional courses.

Clause 6.3(f) and (g) which are relevant, read as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      "6.3(f): Institutions shall be eligible for new course(s)/ expansion of existing course(s),
      equal to the number of valid NBA accredited course(s), limited to a maximum of FOUR

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">      6.3(g): Institutions having an "Approved Intake" less than a Division size in any of the
      course(s) as prescribed by the Council may apply for intake of full division size
      themselves and shall maintain Faculty: student ratio accordingly, without NBA
      accreditation/ NOC from affiliating University/ Board/ State Government/ UT, subject to
      "Zero Deficiency" based on self-disclosure on AICTE web-portal. However, this is not
      applicable in case of institutions under penal action.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">As per Clause 2.9 of the Regulation, "approved intake" means the maximum

number of students that can be admitted in a course (excluding supernumerary

seats) as approved by the Council. Under Clause 2.21, 'course' means one of the

branches of learning in a programme such as Civil Engineering, Mechanical

Engineering, etc. As per sub-clause (a) of Clause 2.22, `division' means a batch of

maximum of 60 students in Diploma/Undergraduate courses in Engineering and

Technology/Hotel Management/Catering Technology/Post Graduate Courses in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">13563/2020                               29</span>


MCA/PGCM/MBA Programme, excluding supernumerary seats, if any. Therefore,

under Clause 6.3(f), the new courses or expansion of existing courses would be

permitted in an institution only if it has got NBA accreditation and number of such

courses/size of expansion permissible would be upto the number of NBA

accredited courses subject to a ceiling of 4 division. Increase in intake/additional

courses can be permitted in undergraduate and post graduate courses only in

Emerging areas. The aforesaid provision refers to new course in the first part

where NBA accreditation is made mandatory; whereas nothing is stated for

granting additional courses. While it is stipulated that additional courses should be

only in emerging areas it is not clear whether the new course cannot be an

additional course or vice versa. It is necessary to have a look at the corresponding

provision in APH, ie. para. 2.15, which deals with increase in intake/additional

course(s). Para.2.15.1 provides that the existing institutions shall expand its

activities by the addition of new/additional courses/Divisions, provided, they have

a valid NBA, for the reasons (a) increased demand in certain domains as per the

industrial need for technical personnel (b) to increase the utilisation of

infrastructure available at the technical institutions (c) ensure quality of Technical

Education being imparted. Therefore, as per para.2.5.1 of APH, the activities of

the college can be expanded either by adding new course or additional courses and

it is mandatory to have NBA accreditation for both new and additional courses.

Though <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_33">Section 10(k)</a> of the Act refers to introduction of new course and
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">13563/2020                                 30</span>


regulations 6.3 as well as several provisions in APH refer to new courses as well as

additional course, there is no definition for either of it.   It is relevant to note that

in the order granting approval to petitioners, the courses additionally sanctioned

were described as new course.
</p>
<p id="p_26">         11.     At any rate, Clause 6.3 (f) of the regulations read with para.2.5.1

makes it clear that NBA accreditation is necessary for granting both.             Under

Clause 6.3.(g) of the Regulation, NBA accreditation or NOC from the affiliating

University is not necessary for applying for intake of full division size, for

institutions where the approved intake in any of the courses is less than division

size ( 60), subject to zero deficiency on self disclosure on AICTE web-portal.

That would also indicate that NBA accreditation is necessary for all other kind of

expansion. Para. 2.15.2 deals with requirement and eligibility. Under clause (a)

thereof, accreditation is mandatory for existing courses; under clause (b)

institutions awaiting the results of the visit for accreditation are also eligible; but

they have to produce valid NBA certificate at the time of scrutiny. As per sub-

clause c, increase in intake and additional course is permitted only in emerging

areas.         As per clause d, such institutions shall apply for increase in

intake/additional course along with additional documents as per Appendix 17 of

the APH; institutions shall have zero deficiency based on self disclosure as per the

deficiency report generated through web portal. Para.2.15.5 again provides that

the number of new course/expansion of existing courses that would be permitted,
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">13563/2020                                      31</span>


would be equal to the number of valid NBA accredited course subject to a

maximum of 4 within the definition of division/programme/level on condition that

the maximum of two divisions alone can be added in the valid NBA accredited

undergraduate course provided that the total number of divisions after expansion

per course shall not exceed the maximum intake allowed as specified in Appendix

3 of the APH. All the provisions in Clause b to h of 2.15.3 would show that NBA

accreditation is mandatory for new courses as well as additional courses and even

for that there is an upper limit for the maximum intake. It also provides that the

NBA accreditation can be utilised for increase in intake or introduction of new

course only once in 6 years.
</p>
<p id="p_27">      12.     According to the University, as per the provisions contained in the

APH, the maximum number of courses permissible is 5 and maximum total intake

is 300 in an institution. The University has not granted affiliation to colleges

having more than 5 courses.           In this context para 2.15.4(a) and (b) of the APH

and Clause 6.3.(i) and (j) of the regulations are relevant, which read as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      6.3(i): The existing institutions having total "Approved Intake" equal to/less than the

      permissible, without exceeding the "Maximum Intake Allowed."

</p><p id="p_33">      14. Therefore, going by Appendix 3 read with para. 2.15.4(a) and (b), the

Maximum Intake allowed for Engineering Technology Programme in a Technical

Institution is 300; maximum number of courses is 5 and maximum intake per

Division is 60. The upper limit prescribed in Appendix 3 is made applicable in the

cases coming under 2.15.4(a) and (b).
</p>
<p id="p_34">      15.     Clause 6.3.i as well as Para. 2.15.4a relate to institutions where

approved intake is equal to the maximum intake allowed, institutions having less

than the maximum intake allowed and institutions which are not eligible for NBA

accreditation. For such institutions, permission can be granted for increase in the

same level in a programme upto the maximum intake without NBA accreditation;

application for the same should be as per Appendix 3. One fails to understand how

any increase can be effected in an institution having 'approved intake' equal to

'maximum intake allowed', upto the 'maximum intake allowed' in the same

programme. At any rate, what is permitted is for increase in intake to the extent of

difference between approved intake and the maximum intake of 300 in the same

level in the same programme and the same is permissible without NBA

accreditation.
</p>
<p id="p_35">      16.     Under clause 6.3.j the institution where the approved intake is in

excess of total intake allowed, can apply for closure of the course and thereafter

apply for increase in intake/additional course in lieu of such closure. In that event
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">13563/2020                                34</span>


also, total approved intake/additional course/division shall not exceed the total

approved intake of 300, number of course(5)/division(6) as specified in appendix 3

of APH ie. this facility is available without NBA accreditation. Para. 2.15.4 (b)

provides for the same.
</p>
<p id="p_36">      17.    From clauses (a) and (b) of 2.15.4 it is clear that increase in intake as

well as number of courses shall not exceed the maximum provided in Appendix 3.

In both (a) and (b) increase provided is in the programme and same level. For

institutions where the total approved intake exceeds the maximum intake allowed,

increase in intake/additional courses in lieu of closure can be permitted even

without NBA accreditation, in accordance with Appendix 3 and such addition can

only be in emerging areas. But in other cases (covered by sub-clause a) NBA

accreditation is necessary except for institutions which did not become eligible for

the same on completion of course by 2 consecutive batches. Para 2.15.(c) provides

that in lieu of one course with 60 intake, two courses with 30 intake can be

permitted. In this provision no ceiling is given as given in clause (a) or (b). NBA

accreditation is also not provided. It therefore means that after reduction in intake

in one course, another course can be granted in lieu of reduction. However, that

can be applied only to an institution which has not become eligible for NBA

accreditation, as Clause 15.4 starts with eligibility for accreditation.

</p><p id="p_37">      18.    It is also pertinent to note that para.2.15.5 provides for the procedure.

Under clause (a) thereof, scrutiny committee shall verify the additional document

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">13563/2020                               35</span>


as per Appendix 17 of APH. Clause (b) provides for an appeal for submitting

NBA certificate if it was not issued at the time of scrutiny. On par with clause 6.g

of the Regulations, para. 2.15.6 of APH permits institutions with intake less than

division size to apply for full division size in any of the courses, without NBA

accreditation or NOC from the affiliating University or State Government.

</p><p id="p_38">      19.   Though Sri.Santhosh Mathew argued that increase is intended for

additional courses also, as the word "increase" is not qualified and that increase in

additional courses subject to maximum intake allowed is also intended by

para.2.15.4(a), especially when increase is provided upto the maximum intake

allowed in the same programme, I am unable to accept the same, when the said

provision mentions only intake, which is qualified by approved, maximum

allowed, etc. only and the word 'course' is conspicuously absent in 2.15.4(a).

However, both those provisions are not worded properly for comprehension by a

person of normal prudence.
</p>
<p id="p_39">      20.   A reading of the entire provisions in 2.15 would show that NBA

accreditation is necessary except where it is not specifically excluded. Moreover,

Annexure 14 of the APH also states that accreditation is mandatory for increase in

intake/starting new course.    Appendix 17 provides for the documents to be

submitted   or   uploaded     for   various   purposes    including   "increase    in

intake/additional course(s)." In the case of applications for additional courses, the

relevant provision would be 17.7. It provides for additional documents to be

<p id="p_40">From Appendix 17.7 it is seen that the additional documents to be submitted by

</p><p id="p_42">      21.   NOC is required for starting new courses as per clause ix of format 2.

But the regulations or the APH do not define new course or additional course. In

the orders granting approval to the petitioners, the courses for which approval was

given were stated to be "new courses".       Therefore, it is necessary to get NOC

from the University for the new courses as well as for institutions with approved

intake less than the maximum intake allowed. Petitioners have not got NOC from

the University as prescribed in clause 9 of format 2 referred to in Appendix 17.7

or NBA accreditation as required in the APH, which is necessary under Clause

2.15.4(a). The action of the University in ensuring that the colleges have fulfilled

the requirements in the provisions in the clause 6.3(f) and 2.15.4(a) and (b) of

APH cannot be said to be illegal.

therefore consider whether the definitions would make any difference in these Writ

Petitions.

<p id="p_45">      24.    The conditions to be fulfilled for those colleges without NBA

accreditation are (1) institution should have more than 50% pass for the outgoing

students at the time of application for affiliation (ii) the institution should have

most recent academic audit overall score of "GOOD" and it should have 3 years'

average intake of more than 50% sanctioned intake. The University had fixed

more or less similar norms in the year 2019-20. The only substantial difference in

the present norms is regarding pass percentage and enhancement in percentage of

intake. The norms fixed on 24.06.2020 are for the institutions without NBA

accreditation.
</p>
<p id="p_46">       25.   In this context it is relevant to note that Ext.R2(a) proforma of

application for accreditation by NBA would show that the percentage of admission

in the courses for 3 years' period is a factor relevant for NBA accreditation. The

contention of the University is that they had fixed only those conditions fixed by

AICTE in its APH. It is also their contention that they can fix such conditions

without lowering the standard set by the AICTE, relying on the 3 Judge Bench

judgment of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/35328254/" id="a_34">State of T.N and another v. S.V. Bratheep (Minor)

and others</a>: (2004) 4 SCC 513.         There the Tamil Nadu Government fixed

separate minimum marks in the related subjects in the qualifying examination as

eligibility to be considered for admission to Engineering Colleges; whereas AICTE

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">13563/2020                                          39</span>


prescribed only aggregate 60% marks in 3 subjects together.                             The contention

relying on the judgment in Adhiyaman Educational Research Institute's case

(supra) that the State has no authority to tinker with the norms fixed by AICTE for

the purpose of ensuring uniformity with extended access of educational

opportunity, was repelled following the judgment of the Constitution Bench in

<a href="/doc/1095409/" id="a_35">Preeti Srivastava (Dr) v. State of M.P</a>: (1999) 7 SCC 120 and it was held as

follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_24">                   10. xxxxTherefore, it is difficult to subscribe to the view that once they are
           qualified under the criteria fixed by AICTE they should be admitted even if they
           fall short of the criteria prescribed by the State. The scope of the relative entries
           in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution has to be understood in the manner as
           stated in Dr Preeti Srivastava case and, therefore, we need not further elaborate
           in this case or consider arguments to the contrary such as on application of
           occupied theory no power could be exercised under Entry 25 of List III as they
           would not arise for consideration.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">           xxxxxx
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">           12.       One other argument is further advanced before us that the criteria fixed
           by AICTE were to be adopted by the respective colleges and once such
           prescription had been made, it was not open to the Government to prescribe
           further standards particularly when they had established the institutions in
           exercise of their fundamental rights guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_36">Article 19</a> of the
           Constitution. However, we do not think this argument can be sustained in any
           manner. Prescription of standards in education is always accepted to be an
           appropriate exercise of power by the bodies recognising the colleges or granting
           affiliation, like AICTE or university. If in exercise of such power the prescription
           had been made, it cannot be said that the whole matter has been foreclosed.

<p id="p_47">Though a subsequent judgment of a 3 Judge Bench of the Apex Court in State of

Maharashtra V Sant Dnyaneshwar Shikshan Shastra Mahavidyalaya: (2006) 9

SCC 1, reiterated the proposition in Adhiyaman's case and Jayagokulam Trust's

respect to Engineering Colleges and AICTE Regulations. There is much difference

between the provisions contained in NCTE Act and in AICTE Act, though both are

<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_37">Central Act</a>s within the entry 65 of List I. Moreover, in the light of the judgment

of the 5 Judge bench of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/139996215/" id="a_38">National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pranay

Sethi</a> : (2017) 16 SCC 680, when there are two judgments of co-equal benches, the

(2013) 2 SCC 617, while considering the question relating to denial of affiliation

by University, after recognition was given to a College by the NCTE, the Apex

Court held that the Department of the State concerned and the affiliating university

cannot lay down any guideline or policy which would be in conflict with the

Central statute or the standards laid down by the Central body and that their policy

has to be in conformity with the directives issued by the Central body. It was held

that all these authorities have to work ad idem as they all have a common object to

achieve i.e. imparting of education properly and ensuring maintenance of proper

standards of education, examination and infrastructure for betterment of the

educational system. In the present case in the order dated 10.06.2020, the

University had only insisted the conditions prescribed by the AICTE and those

norms in conformity with the standard prescribed by the AICTE.

certain shortcomings, which the University could not substantiate before the Apex

Court after it had called for a report. That judgment is also distinguished in

<a href="/doc/58529348/" id="a_41">Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Registrar v. Sangam Laxmi Bai

Vidyapeet and Others</a>. Therefore, the said judgment would also not be applicable

in this case, especially in the light of the 3 Judge Bench judgment in S.V.Pradeep's

case also.
</p>
<p id="p_50">      28.    In the judgment in <a href="/doc/182246329/" id="a_42">Assn. of Management of Private Colleges v. All

India Council</a> for Technical Education: (2013) 8 SCC 271 relied on by Sri.Elvin

Peter it was held that the autonomy of the University is not taken away by the

AICTE. In that case the question considered was whether AICTE had control and

supervision over the Private Colleges and whether approval from AICTE was

required for the Private Colleges affiliated to a University, conducting MCA and

MBA courses. It was found that AICTE is not intended to be controlling or

supervising authority over the University merely because the University is also

imparting courses of "technical education"; following the judgment in

Bharathidasan University V All India Council for Technical Education: (2001)

8 SCC 676 it was held that the role of AICTE vis-à-vis universities is only

advisory, recommendatory and one of providing guidance. The judgments in

Adhiyaman Educational and Research Institute's case and Jaya Gokulam

Educational Trust's case were held inapplicable. In the present case it cannot be

said that the University has transgressed into the area occupied by the central

<p id="p_51">      29.    Arguments were advanced to the effect that the objections, if any, for

the University or State Government ought to have been communicated to the

AICTE on receipt of its application within the time permitted under the

Regulations. But under the Regulation 2019 or 2020, the only provision for the

State Government and University to submit their views is when the application is

for setting up new institutions. Such a procedure is not provided in the case of any

other application.
</p>
<p id="p_52">      30.    The factual circumstances which arose and the regulations considered

in Jayagokulam Trust's case relied on by the petitioners were different. There

University denied affiliation for starting new Engineering College for want of

permission from the Government. The State Government did not grant permission

on the ground that there was no requirement of new Engineering colleges. The

Apex Court found that the only provision which requires the involvement of

Government is under Statute 9(7) of the Kerala University First Statute under

which University was only required to ascertain the "views" of the State

Government before granting affiliation and that it cannot be characterized as

approval. It was held that in case the Statute required any such approval, that

would be repugnant to <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_43">Section 10(k)</a> of the central Act. In that case, the Apex

court found that there were other provisions available for resolving the difference

of opinion with consultees like State Government, University etc. by the Task
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">13563/2020                               43</span>


force. However, such provisions are not seen available in the Regulations 18 or

2020 or the APH 2020-2021. There is no task force also. Similarly, the judgments

in <a href="/doc/57339414/" id="a_44">St. Josephs Hospital Trust v. Kerala University of Health Sciences</a>: 2012 (4)

KLT 444 or W.A.No.1485/<a href="/doc/89647955/" id="a_45">2019, State of Kerala vs. KMCT Polytechnic College</a>,

<a href="/doc/157701429/" id="a_46">P.N.N.M. Ayurveda Medical College vs. Kerala University of Health Sciences</a> :

2018 (1) KLT 572, etc. would not be applicable to the factual circumstances of the

case. In these cases also, it is seen that the University has only been insisting on

the requirements prescribed by AICTE in para. 2.15.4(a) and (b) as well as para.

17.7 of the Approval Process Handbook. In the order dated 10.06.2020, except for

the requirement of NOC from the State Government, other conditions fixed were

in tune with the parameters fixed by AICTE in the APH. It cannot be said that

those conditions are in conflict with the regulations or APH as insisted by it or that

the University has transgressed into the area occupied by AICTE. However, I am

of the view that much of the confusion could have been avoided in case the AICTE

had drafted the provisions in the APH with a little more care, clarity and

responsibility.

<p id="p_53">      31.    In the judgment in <a href="/doc/58529348/" id="a_47">Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University

Registrar v. Sangam Laxmi Bai Vidyapeet and Others</a>: 2018 KHC 6863, the

Apex Court considered a case where the College had challenged the affiliation

Regulations of the University, based on which NOC was denied for starting a

Pharmacy College. The Apex Court considered the question whether the
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">13563/2020                                       44</span>


University has got any authority to deny NOC or whether the University is bound

to issue NOC for opening a Pharmacy college and thereby to promote the

mushroom growth of institutions. The University stated that most of the seats

were remaining vacant. After considering the provisions contained in the affiliation

Regulations of the University as well as those in AICTE Regulations and also the

provisions contained in the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_48">State Act</a>, it was found that there is no repugnancy

between the two. In para. 21 it was observed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">      " xxx The mushroom growth of educational institutionscannot be permitted. The
      observation made by the High Court that unfit institution will automatically shut down
      the courses is not the judicious approach warranted in such matters. It is not only that
      the requirement of the locality should exist but it has to be ensured that only the standard
      educational institutions should come up and once they come up, they should be able to
      survive. A large number of Institutions are not to be opened up to die an unnatural death
      on the principle of survival of the fittest and due to non - availability of teachers /
      students. Standard of education cannot be compromised and sacrificed by permitting
      institutions to come up in a reckless manner without there being any requirement for
      them at a particular place. There is a need to strengthen the existing system of education
      not to make it weak by further complicating the issues by wholly unwarranted approach
      as the one adopted by the High Court. It cannot be left at the choice of the institution to
      open the course whenever or wherever they desire. The High Court has also erred in
      observing that the seats remaining vacant could not be the relevant criteria for refusal of
      NOC.

<p id="p_54">The contention of the college relying on the judgment in Adhiyaman's case,

Jayagokulam Trust case, Sant Dnyaneshwar Shikshan Shastra Mahavidyalaya's

case, Rungta Engineering College, Bhilai's case, was repelled and it was

observed that even in those judgments it was held that                            provisions of the

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_49">University Act</a> regarding affiliation of technical colleges like the engineering

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">13563/2020                                        45</span>


in respect of the matter entrusted to it under S.10 of the AICTE/<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_50">Central Act</a>. In

para.26 of the judgment it was held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">               26. xxxxA large number of institutions have already been permitted to function
       in the State by the Central Bodies. It is painful to note that at several places mushroom
       growth of the institutions had been permitted by such bodies in an illegal manner. In
       case there is no check or balance and the power is exercised in an unbridled reckless
       manner, the sufferer is going to be the standard of education. At the same time, there is a
       necessity of good institutions with new technology, but at the same time mushroom
       growth of the substandard institutions cannot be permitted. There has to be a
       requirement of educational institutions in the locality and that is one of the main
       considerations.</blockquote><p id="p_55">

</p><p id="p_56">      32.     In the present case, the statement filed by the learned Government

Pleader gives a picture of the deplorable condition of various Engineering Colleges

furnishing the actual intake, pass percentage, etc. Therefore, this Court would

reiterate the following observations in the common judgment dated 02.08.2019 in

W.P.(C) No. 16479 of 2019 and connected cases:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">      "It is also relevant to note that the alarming number of writ petitions coming up before
      this court complaining the lack of infra-structure in professional colleges on account of
      which large number of students are seeking transfer or re-allocation to other colleges
      would show that the anxiety expressed by the Division Benches of this court in 2011 and
      2012 were not misplaced. It is high time the AICTE and other regulatory bodies are to
      take remedial action to protect the student community and to strictly adhere to the
      regulations which are in force. "</blockquote><p id="p_57">



</p><p id="p_58">      33.     As far as the order dated 22.06.2019 issued by the Government is

concerned, NOC would be required only in cases where it is prescribed by the

AICTE. University itself has found that there is no requirement of NOC from the

Government for starting additional courses, when new norms are determined on

24.06.2020. Moreover, it is required under the regulations of AICTE or APH, for

starting new courses or new programmes in existing institution; that being so, in
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">13563/2020                              46</span>


the absence of any provision of law which insists an NOC from the Government

for affiliation of additional courses/new programmes in existing colleges, the

order passed by the Government is unwarranted. It shall therefore stand set aside.

</p><p id="p_59">      34.   By way of Ext.R1(c) dated 24.06.2020 which specifically mentions

courses also, the provisions relating to requirement of NOC from the Government

has already been deleted; requirement of NBA Accreditation is seen modified with

pass percentage and academic excellence. Though the said decision is not under

challenge in these Writ Petitions, it is necessary to determine whether the

University can invoke the criteria fixed for affiliation by way of the decision in

Ext.R1(c) without issuing it as an order. In the judgment in W.P.(C.).No.26206 of

2016, relied on by Sri. Santhosh Mathew, this Court interfered with the contract

awarded to the 2nd lowest tenderer, on the basis of a Government order giving

preference to Society, on the ground that the Government order was neither

published in the gazette nor mentioned in the notification inviting tender. In the

judgment in Harla v. State of Rajastan, relied on therein, it was held that the law

by which a subject was being punished should have been made known to him, by

exercising due diligence and that the mere passing of a resolution without anything

more, shall not affect the life of those who are unaware of it and that for a law to

come into being, it should be published. According to the learned Counsel for the

University, the decisions of the syndicate are not published and it is not necessary

that it should be published. But in this case ,it is relevant to note that the norms
 W.P(C).No.12314/2020 &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">13563/2020                               47</span>


fixed by the syndicate are in the area which required to be covered by the Statutes

as provided in <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_51">Section 63(2)</a> of the University Act. Statutes are to be framed and

published in the gazette. In the absence of Statute, it would be the minimum

requirement that the decisions relating to affiliation are issued at least in the form

of an order and is made known to those concerned, in order to have transparency

in the procedure. Therefore, I find force in the contention of Sri.Santhosh Mathew.

It is necessary for the University to publish the norms at least by issuing it in the

form of an order, making all those concerned aware of it. If at all any norms are

relaxed that can only be after issuing an order incorporating the revised norms.

</p><p id="p_60">       35.    In W.P.(C) No. 11778 of 2020 and connected cases petitioners had

pointed out that some of the Colleges which are already granted affiliation based

on NBA accreditation in a single course, were having pass percentage much below

</p><p id="p_61">50.   Therefore, the University has already been directed to examine whether

insisting of pass percentage of 50 for the whole institution would be more onerous

than insisting NBA accreditation in one course and see that one section of colleges

is not subjected to discrimination by adopting different yardsticks for the purpose

of affiliation.

<p id="p_62">       36.    In this context, it is also relevant to note that Annexure I of the APH

      Electronics Engineering capacity utilization around 40% as opposed to Computer
      Science and Engineering, Aerospace engineering, Mechatronics, being in the high 60%.
      This is clear pointer that the demand lies in emerging technologies as opposed to
      traditional Engineering. We recommend that no additional seats are approved in
