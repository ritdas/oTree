              CRL.R.P.NO.1937 OF 2013
              -------------------------------
       Dated this the 11th day of October, 2013

                         ORDER
</pre>



<p id="p_1">      The Revision Petitioner is the respondent in a

proceedings under <a href="/doc/1834702/" id="a_1">Section 138</a> of the Cr.P.C. before the

Executive Magistrate, Vatakara in the proceedings

No.C3-19731/2011.       The above proceedings were

initiated on a complaint filed by the 2nd respondent

herein. The case of the 2nd respondent herein is that the

Revision Petitioner is running a saw-mill and a

manufacturing unit of furniture. The 2nd respondent has

been affected by dust and sound pollution due to the

functioning of the above said manufacturing unit situated

nearby the residence of the 2nd respondent. Consequent

on the complaint, a conditional order was passed under

<a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_2">Section 133</a> of the Cr.P.C. by the Executive Magistrate

on 26/09/2012. But, the Revision Petitioner appeared

before the court through counsel on 15/10/2012 and the

case was adjourned, for filing counter affidavit, to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CRL.R.P.NO.1937 OF 2013         2</span>

26/11/2012.     According to the Revision Petitioner, the

conditional order was made absolute without hearing the

revision petitioner and passed the impugned order under

challenge in this Revision Petition.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.    The learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner,

in support of the grounds raised in the memorandum of

Revision Petition and Annexures A1 to A12 produced

along with this Revision Petition, submits that the

Revision Petitioner has already obtained all statutory

licences and no objection certificates from the concerned

authorities and he has the right to conduct the said

manufacturing unit. But, the Revision Petitioner was not

being heard in the matter nor        has he been given an

opportunity to adduce evidence before passing the

impugned order.       It is also stated that no notice was

served on the petitioner either on 26/11/2011       or any

subsequent date regarding the posting of the case by the

Executive Magistrate and impugned order is passed ex-

parte. He was deligent in prosecuting his case before the

Executive Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_3"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CRL.R.P.NO.1937 OF 2013       3</span>

</p><p id="p_4">     3.    Per contra, the   learned counsel for    the 2nd

respondent submits       that   the   Revision    Petitioner

had    been given sufficient time to adduce evidence.

According to the 2nd respondent even now the Revision

Petitioner has not obtained the consent of the Pollution

Control Board to run the manufacturing unit and instead

of it the pollution control board has already issued notice

dated 7/02/13 directing the Revision Petitioner to close

down the manufacturing unit and the above direction was

issued under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_3">Section 31</a> of AIR (Prevention &amp;        control

Pollution ) Act 1981. In short, the Revision Petitioner was

not deligent in the proceedings. Even in this writ petition

also though the Revision petitioner has produced some

other licences and no objection certificates , the Revision

petitioner has not produced the copy of the consent letter

said to have been issued by the Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_5">     4. Going by the impugned order it could be seen that

the revision     petitioner entered appearance in the

proceedings on receipt of the notice dated 26/09/2012

calling upon him to appear before the Executive

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CRL.R.P.NO.1937 OF 2013      4</span>

Magistrate and to show cause why the proceedings under

<a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_4">Section 133</a> of the Cr.P.C. shall not be initiated against

him. On receipt of the notice on 15/10/2012 the Revision

Petitioner entered appearance through his counsel and

prayed for adjourning    the case; but, on 5/1/2012 he

sought for time for filing a counter statement, and the

case was posted to 26/11/2012. On 26/11/2012, it was

again adjourned to 3/1/2013 and thereafter to 6/2/13,

13/3/13, 17/4/13 and      27/4/13 respectively.  But the

Revision Petitioner did not appear before the court on

these posting dates, nor did he file a counter statement.

There upon, again another notice was issued calling upon

him to appear on 19/06/2013 and on that day also he

didn't appear before the Executive Magistrate. But, the

2nd respondent appeared before the Executive Magistrate

and produced copy of a letter issued by the Secretary of

Nadapuram Grama Panchayath stating that no licence has

been issued to the Revision Petitioner to run a

manufacturing unit.     Thereafter on the basis of the

available evidence on record, the Executive Magistrate

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CRL.R.P.NO.1937 OF 2013       5</span>

passed the impugned order and made the conditional

order absolute.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     5. Going by the proceedings, narrated in the

impugned order I cannot find any fault with the Executive

Magistrate    in   passing the   impugned    order  under

challenge. On the other hand I find that the Revision

Petitioner was too much negligent and he has not

interested to prosecute the matter before the competent

authority under law. The learned counsel for the Revision

Petitioner prayed for an opportunity to contest the matter

again on the merits before the statutory authority.

Though, I cannot find any fault with the proceedings

under which the impugned order has been passed, for

the interest of substantive justice to both parties, I am

inclined to grant one more opportunity to the Revision

Petitioner to prosecute the matter before the competent

authority on conditions. The impugned order will stand set

aside on compliance of the following conditions.

</p><p id="p_7">     i. The Revision Petitioner shall pay a cost of

Rs.10,000/- to the 2nd respondent within a period of two

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CRL.R.P.NO.1937 OF 2013         6</span>

weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order and

produce receipt thereof before the Executive Magistrate.

</p><p id="p_8">      ii. The Revision Petitioner shall not operate his

manufacturing unit till the termination of the proceedings

after re-opening of the same.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      6. If the Revision Petitioner satisfies the above

conditions   within the    specified period,   the Executive

Magistrate shall re-open the proceedings        again on the

files and proceed in accordance with law, and pass final

order afresh, after affording sufficient opportunities of

being heard to both parties, at any rate within a period of

two months from today.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      This Revision Petition is disposed of accordingly.
