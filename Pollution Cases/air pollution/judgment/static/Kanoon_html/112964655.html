<p id="p_1">                 (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE JYOTI SARAN)

4   06-02-2019                     It is reminding the authorities for the State in the

                   Urban Development and Housing Department and the Gaya

                   Municipal Corporation of their obligations to ensure that the

                   Phalgu river in the town and district of Gaya is not polluted that

                   this writ petition is filed, whereby the petitioner seeks a
 Patna High Court CWJC No.19592 of 2018(4) dt.06-02-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           2/5</span>




          direction to the authorities on the following lines; (a) proper

          handling of waste emission, (b) to stop of dumping debris, flow

          of municipal waste as well as drain water in the Phalgu river.

</p><p id="p_2">                      We are rather constrained to observe that even when

          such obligation is a duty cast on the authorities of the Urban

          Development and Housing Department and the Gaya Municipal

          Corporation, yet it takes somebody to stand up by way of public

          interest to draw their attention.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                      Counter affidavits are filed and Mr. Sumeet Kumar

          Singh, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner invites the

          attention of this Court to an order passed by a Co-ordinate

          Bench on a similar matter arising from C.W.J.C. No. 16627 of

          2011 (<a href="/doc/114916484/" id="a_1">Pratijnya and another vs. The Union of India and others</a>),

          a copy of which is enclosed with Annexure-R5-F of the counter

          affidavit filed on behalf of the Bihar State Pollution Control

          Board, Patna and its authorities. He submits that the stand of the

          Principal Additional Advocate General, who presently is the

          Advocate General of the State is taken note of by the Bench and

          where after directions were issued for removal of the

          encroachments; establishment of solid waste treatment plant as

          well as for construction of the Dam to store water before the

          monsoon arrives.
</p><p id="p_4"> Patna High Court CWJC No.19592 of 2018(4) dt.06-02-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           3/5</span>




                      It is submitted that this order was passed on

          18.03.2015 and a period of four years is going to lapse when

          nothing has changed. Learned counsel next invites the attention

          of this Court to the direction issued by the Pollution Control

          Board at Annexure-R5-B dated 27.04.2017 to submit that in

          exercise of power vested in the Board under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_2">Section 33A</a> of the

          Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 as well as

          for restoration of river Ganga that directions were issued which

          are present at paragraph-14 of the letter.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                      It is stated that a second letter was issued by the

          Board enclosed at Annexure-R5-C on 14.03.2018 to the

          Municipal       Commissioner,          Gaya     Municipal   Corporation

          reminding him of the obligation but no steps have been taken.

          He submits that since it is in these circumstances that the writ

          petition is filed and though counter affidavits have been filed on

          behalf of the Corporation and the Pollution Control Board but

          save and except that the Board has simply continued to issue

          directions without any follow up action, no effective steps has

          been taken by the State in its Urban Development and Housing

          Department nor the Municipal Corporation, Gaya has taken

          steps either on the directions of this Court earlier passed and/or

          the direction issued by the Board.
</p><p id="p_6"> Patna High Court CWJC No.19592 of 2018(4) dt.06-02-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           4/5</span>




                      Mr. Shivendra Kishore, learned senior counsel

          appearing for the Board, while endorsing the argument

          advanced by Mr. Singh, has submitted that repeated reminders

          have been issued to the Municipal Corporation, Gaya to ensure

          compliance as well as to submit report but which is yet awaited.

</p><p id="p_7">                      Mr. Deepak Jamuar, learned A.C. to AAG-4 appears

          for the State, while Mr. R.K. Priyadarshi, learned counsel

          appears for the Gaya Municipal Corporation but neither is able

          to give an answer for the failure of the Department of Urban

          Development and Housing as well as the Gaya Municipal

          Corporation in abiding by the earlier directions of this Court

          passed in C.W.J.C. No. 16627 of 2011 or the directions issued

          by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board vide Annexure-R5-

          B, R5-C and R5-E, which has been issued following the writ

          petition in question. A peculiar stand is taken by the Municipal

          Corporation on its limited resources to deal with the issue raised

          but having said so, paragraphs 8 and 9 of the counter affidavit

          talks about the proposed action plan but which has no specific

          date and that a period of more than almost four years has lapsed

          since the issue was last raised and disposed of by this Court on

          18.03.2015, we would not allow the Corporation to stay inert.

          That the Principal Additional Advocate General has given
             Patna High Court CWJC No.19592 of 2018(4) dt.06-02-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                       5/5</span>




                      assurance before this Court on a similar issue last raised by

                      Pratijnya (supra) regarding construction of Dam, removal of

                      encroachment and construction of solid waste treatment plant it

                      is for the State to ensure compliance of same and neither of

                      them would be permitted to shoulder of the responsibility.

</p><p id="p_8">                                  We would, thus, direct the Principal Secretary, Urban

                      Development         Department         as       well   as   the   Municipal

                      Commissioner, Gaya Municipal Corporation to file a joint

                      affidavit placing on record the action plan to resolve the issue

                      raised by the petitioner as well as the time within which the

                      same is to be executed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                                  For the purpose, list this matter on 25 th February, 2019

                      under the same heading. It is made clear that should the two

                      authorities fail to give their affidavit within the date so fixed,

                      they should be present in Court at 10.30 A.M. for answer.
