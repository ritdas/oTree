<p id="p_4">Date of hearing and judgement : 30-03-2012

                     JUDGEMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)

Sharma, J

       The petitioner, who is an Executive Engineer serving in the
Tripura Sate Pollution Board, has filed this writ petition challenging
the very initiation of the departmental proceedings against him under
the provisions of CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965. According to him, the said
rules having not been adopted by the Pollution Control Board as
envisaged under the provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, the said proceedings are not sustainable in
law.
</p>

<p id="p_5">2.     The fact of the matter is that placing reliance on the provisions
of the CCS(CCA) Rules, the same very petitioner had earlier
approached this Court by filing a writ petition being WP(C) 161/2011.
In that writ petition, the plea of the petitioner against the order of
suspension was that as per the provisions of the CCS(CCA) Rules, the
order of suspension shall not be valid beyond a particular period.
Accepting the said plea of the petitioner, this Court by judgement and
order dated 22.12.2011 allowed the writ petition setting aside and
quashing the order of suspension passed against the petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_6">3.     The petitioner after enjoying the said judgment and order
dated 22.12.2011 passed by this Court in WP(C) 161/2011, on the
basis of the analogy placed by him placing reliance on the provisions
of CCS(CCA) Rules, has now filed this writ petition taking absolutely a




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                        WP(C) 140 of 2012                     Page 2 of 7</span>
 contrary plea that the said CCS(CCA) Rules are not applicable to him
as the respondent Board has not adopted the said rules as required
under the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_7">4.    I have heard Mr. S.C. Das, learned counsel led by Mr. S.Deb,
learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner as well as Mr. S.
Chakraborty, learned State Counsel representing the respondents No.
1 &amp; 2. I have also heard Mr. P. Roy Barman, learned counsel appearing
for the respondents No. 3, 4 &amp; 5. Considering the nature of the order I
propose to pass, there is no requirement to send notice to the
respondent No.6.
</p>

<p id="p_8">5.    <a href="/doc/132323072/" id="a_2">Section 12(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/151428175/" id="a_3">Section 12(3A)</a> of the aforesaid Act on
which the petitioner has placed reliance, are reproduced below :-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "Section 12(3). Subject this Court is of the opinion
             such rules as may be made by the Central
             Government or, as the case may be, the State
             Government in this behalf, a Board may appoint such
             officers and employees as it considers necessary for
             the efficient performance of its functions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             Section 12(3A). The method of recruitment and the
             terms &amp; conditions of the service (including the scales
             of pay) of the officers (other than the member
             secretary) and other employees of the Central Board
             or a State Board shall be such as may be determined
             by regulations made by the Central Board or, as the
             case may be, by the State Board ;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             Provided that no regulation made under this sub-
             section shall take effect unless :-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">          (a) In the case of regulation made by the Central Board,
              it is approved by the Central Government, and

              approved by the State Government."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_9">6.    Referring to the proviso to <a href="/doc/151428175/" id="a_4">Section 12</a> (3<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_5">A) of the Act</a>, it is the
plea of the petitioner that since the CCS(CCA) Rules has not been




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                       WP(C) 140 of 2012                     Page 3 of 7</span>
 adopted by the respondent Board in the manner and method
prescribed under the said proviso, the provisions of the said rules are
not applicable to him. In paragraph 30 of the writ petition, the
petitioner has stated that the Board in its meeting held on 16.9.98
(8th meeting) passed a resolution for adopting the Tripura State Civil
services (Conduct) Rules, 1988 and CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965 for its
officers and employees. According to the petitioner, mere adoption of
the said rules is not enough and that as per the provisions of <a href="/doc/151428175/" id="a_6">Section
12(3A)</a>, the said adoption will not entitle the respondents Board to
apply provisions of CCS(CCA) Rules, as the same has not been
approved by the State Government.
</p>

<p id="p_10">7.    The aforesaid submissions made by the learned counsel for the
petitioner, is totally misplaced and misconceived. <a href="/doc/151428175/" id="a_7">Section 12(3A)</a>
speaks of the method of recruitment and terms and conditions of
service (including the scales of pay) of the Officer (other than the
Member Secretary) and other employees of the Central Board or a
State Board. The same is required to be determined by regulations
made by the Central Board or, as the case may be, by the State
Board. Such regulation shall not take effect unless approved by the
State Govt. On a bare perusal of the aforesaid provision, it is seen
that the said provision relates to the recruitment and terms and
conditions of the service, including the scales of pay of the Officers
and employees of the State Pollution Board and the same has noting
to do with the departmental proceeding. So far as the disciplinary
proceeding is concerned, the respondent Board has adopted the
CCS(CCA) Rules by its resolution referred to above.
</p>

<p id="p_11">8.    Here is a case in which the petitioner on the earlier occasion
successfully filed a writ petition placing reliance on the provisions of
the CCS(CCA) Rules and now has again filed a writ petition contending
that the said rules are not applicable to him and consequently, the
departmental proceedings against him are liable to be interfered




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                        WP(C) 140 of 2012                     Page 4 of 7</span>
 with. I am afraid, such a conduct on the part of the petitioner cannot
be appreciated.
</p>

<p id="p_12">9.    On being pointed out the above, the learned counsel for the
petitioner submits that in absence of any rules in the Board for
conducting disciplinary proceeding, the Board is not entitled to
initiate any departmental proceeding against its Officer and
employees. If this submission is to be adopted, then in that case, the
respondent Board will not be entitled to initiate any departmental
proceeding    against   its   Officer   and   employees    under    any
circumstances.
</p>

<p id="p_13">10.   I may gainfully referred to the decision of the apex Court
reported in (1995) Supp 3 SCC 226 (Director General of Ordnance
Services and others Vs. P.N. Malhotra), in which a similar plea of
inapplicability of the CCS(CCA) Rules was taken. In that case, the
issue involved was the sustainability of the order of dismissal passed
against the Officer pursuant to a departmental enquiry under
CCS(CCA) Rules. As in the instant case, in the said case also, it was
contended that in the Ordnance Services, there was no rules
applicable to the disciplinary enquiries. As in the instant case, in the
said case also, the enquiry was conducted under the CCS(CCA) Rules.
The Apex court dealing with the similar plea held that the CCS(CCA)
Rules are nothing but a codification of principles of natural justice
and are more elaborate and beneficial than the broad principles of
natural justice. In paragraph 10 and 11 of the said judgement, the
Apex Court observed thus :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">             "10. The learned counsel for the appellants submits
             that the respondent cannot be said to have suffered
             any prejudice by following the procedure prescribed
             by 1965 Rules. He submits that the said Rules are
             nothing but a codification of the principles of natural
             justice. Indeed, it is submitted, they are more
             specific, more elaborate and more beneficial to the
             employee than the broad principles of natural
             justice. If we assume for the sake of argument that
             the respondent was entitled to insist upon an enquiry
             before he could be dismissed, we must agree with the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                        WP(C) 140 of 2012                    Page 5 of 7</span>
              submission of the learned counsel for the appellants.
             We must also say that this Court cannot be said to
             have approved the view taken by the Tribunal in that
             case (which is the same as in this case). In view of
             the peculiar circumstances of that case, this Court
             held, "we are not inclined to interfere with the
             impugned judgment of the Tribunal." The earlier
             sentence in the judgment to the effect that "we see
             no ground to interfere with the reasoning and the
             conclusions reached by the Tribunal" must be
             read alongwith the subsequent opinion aforesaid
             and in the light of all the observations made.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">             11. We must also mention that neither the Tribunal
             has stated - nor the respondent has suggested - that
             there are any other Rules applicable to disciplinary
             enquiries against such civilian employees which have
             not been followed - much les has it been stated that
             any such Rules are qualitatively different or more
             beneficial to the respondent."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">11.   It appears that the petitioner has filed this writ petition with a
calculated design to thwart the departmental proceeding initiated
against him. The conduct of the petitioner does not behove of a
responsible Officer under the respondent Board. In the earlier round
of litigation, he took the benefit of the provisions of the CCS (CCA)
Rules and now with a calculated design to frustrate the departmental
proceeding against him, has taken the plea that the said rules are not
applicable. This contradictory stand of the petitioner can not be
appreciated with the simple plea advanced by the petitioner that
while moving the earlier writ petition against the order of suspension,
the relevant fact was not known to him. If that be so, even the earlier
judgement and order passed in his favour would require a review.
However, this aspect of the matter need not detain us in view of the
findings recorded above that the CCS(CCA) Rules are applicable to the
Officers and employees of the respondent Board and even assuming
that the said rules are not applicable, in absence of any other rules,
there is no bar in conducting the proceeding following the said Rules,
as the said Rules are noting but a codification of the Principles of
natural justice. The petitioner also could not show any prejudice that
would be caused to him if the said rules are followed.
