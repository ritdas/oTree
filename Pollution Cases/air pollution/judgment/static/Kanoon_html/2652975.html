                      2      This appeal arises from a judgment of the National Green Tribunal 1 at its

                      Southern Zone Bench at Chennai dated 16 August 2016. The Tribunal allowed the

                      appeal of the respondent in part and held that the invocation of the bank

                      guarantees furnished to the appellant at the behest of the respondent was

                      unwarranted and that the amount should be refunded to the respondent.

in directing the appellant to refund the amounts covered by them to the

respondent.

<p id="p_3">4       The respondent commenced its operations in 1995 for the manufacture

and sale of instant coffee. It was granted consent under the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974.           On 6 August 2008, the Union Government

amended the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 to specify discharge standards

for the coffee industry.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
5       Complaints were received by the appellant and by the District Collector,

Guntur in regard to the environmental pollution caused by the appellant. A notice

to show cause was issued by the appellant to the respondent on 2 August 2011. A

Task Force Committee was constituted by the appellant which, after hearing the

respondent, issued directions to it on 12 August 2011. Based on the

recommendations of the Task Force Committee, the following directions were

issued to the respondent on 26 August 2011:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        “Part A
        Improvement of existing system
        a. The industry shall submit the efficiency of the ETP for the
        treatment      of effluents to the board standards.
        b. The Industry shall revamp the existing APC installed to the
        boilers to meet the board specified standards.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        Part B
        a. Fixation of flow meters at various points to ensure
        continuous operation of existing systems
        b. The industry shall install separate energy meters for all the
        pollution control equipments installed and submit the records
        to the RO, Guntur every month.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">        Part C
        a. The industry shall store the treated effluents in lined
        lagoons only, for storing the effluents during rainy season.
        b. The industry shall use the treated effluents in industry’s
        own land.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">        c. The industry shall provide separate storm water drains so
        that the colored effluents do not mix with the rain water.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          3</span>

       lagoons and lagoons shall be dismantled.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       e. The industry shall not discharge any effluents outside the
       premises under any circumstances.</blockquote><p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">       f. The industry shall submit an action plan for removal of
       colour within 30 days.”



6      In addition, the appellant directed the respondent to furnish three bank

guarantees: two in the amount of Rs 10,00,000 each and the third in the amount of

Rs 5,00,000 to secure compliance with the conditions specified in Part A, Part B

and Part C above in regard to the functioning of the respondent.


7      On 6 September 2011, three bank guarantees executed by the State Bank

of India were furnished to the appellant. The bank guarantee in the amount of Rs

5,00,000 was in order to secure compliance with the conditions stipulated in the

consent for the establishment and operation of the respondent in terms of the

applicable environmental standards. The bank guarantee covered Part C of the

directions that were issued on 26 August 2011 which were embedded in the

guarantee. The guarantee contained the following stipulation:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       “In accordance to the norms laid down by the Board as
       committed by M/S CCL PRODUCTS (INDIA) LIMITED.</blockquote><p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">       In pursuance of the above, we M/S. CCL PRODUCTS
       (INDIA) LIMITED, Guarantee the observance and
       performance by the company of the various terms and
       obligations as provided in the commitment made above and
       undertake to pay to the Board subject to a maximum sum not
       exceeding Rs 5,00,000/- (Rupees five lakhs only) on demand
       and in the event of company failing to comply with the above
       conditions/Directions.”

The respondent further undertook that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">       “Notwithstanding anything contain herein:

       Rs. 5,00,000/-

        upon us a written claim or demand on or before 06.09.2013”



8       The second bank guarantee covered Part B of the stipulation which the

Task Force Committee had required the respondent to fulfill on 26 August 2011.

The bank guarantee contained the following stipulations:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">        “In pursuance to the above, we M/S. CCL PRODUCTS
        (INDIA) LIMITED, Guarantee the observance and
        performance by the company of the various terms and
        obligations as provided in the commitment made above and
        undertake to pay to the Board subject to a maximum sum not
        exceeding Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten lakhs only) on
        demand and in the event of company failing to comply with
        the above conditions / Directions.

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">        Out liability under the Guarantee is restricted to Rs.
        10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten lakhs only). Our Guarantee shall
        remain in force until 06.09.2013, unless a suit or action to
        enforce a claim under this guarantee is filed in writing against
        us before the date of expiry, all our rights under this
        guarantee shall be forfeited and we shall be relieved and
        discharged from all liabilities whatsoever there under.”

        Notwithstanding anything contain herein:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">        a) Our liability under this Bank Guarantee shall not exceed
        Rs. 10,00,000/-

        thereof under this Bank Guarantee only and only if you serve

9       The third bank guarantee in the amount of Rs 10,00,000 covered Part A of

the stipulations which the Task Force Committee had required the respondent to

fulfill on 26 August 2011.
</p>

10      On 12 September 2012, the appellant recorded in a communication to its

Environmental Engineer in the regional office at Guntur that:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">        “The status of compliance of was reviewed in the Task Force
        Committee Meeting held on 07.03.2012 and directions were
        issued to the industry ….for compliance.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">        The Board officials inspected the industry on 21.07.2012 and
        23.08.2012 and observed certain violations. In view of the
        non-compliance of the industry with the directions issued by
        the Board, it is decided to invoke the bank guarantee of Rs.
        25 Lakhs in favour of the Board.</blockquote><p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">        The EE, RO, Guntur is directed to address the Bank to invoke
        Bank Guarantee of Rs. 25.0 lakhs in favour of the Board and
        obtain the amount by way of Demand Draft drawn in favour of
        the Member Secretary, A.P. Pollution Control Board,
        Hyderabad immediately. The original bank guarantee is to be
        returned to the Bank after obtaining the demand draft.”



In pursuance of the above communication, the bank guarantees were invoked on

12 September 2012 and the amount of Rs 25,00,000 covered by three bank

guarantees was paid over to the appellant by the State Bank of India.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         6</span>

11      Aggrieved by the actions of the appellant invoking the bank guarantees,

the respondent moved the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
12      The Tribunal by its judgment dated 16 August 2016 held that the principles

of natural justice were required to be followed prior to invoking the bank

guarantees. Finding fault with the appellant for failing to do so, the Tribunal held

that the invocation was unwarranted and the amount which has been received by

the appellant should be refunded to the respondent.


13      In the view of the Tribunal, the purpose of the bank guarantees was not

“commercial, contractual or industrial” since the guarantees were issued to secure

compliance with the directions of the appellant regarding environmental norms that

must be complied with by the respondent. Hence, it came to the conclusion that

before invoking the bank guarantees, it was incumbent upon the appellant to serve

a notice and to furnish a hearing to the respondent.


14      Assailing the judgment of the Tribunal, it has been urged by Mr T V S

Raghavendra Sreyas, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that

first, the Tribunal erred in applying the principles of natural justice as a condition to

invoke the guarantees. This, it has been submitted, is contrary to the settled legal

position. Second, it has been urged that the finding by the Tribunal that there was

a breach on the part of the appellant to furnish a reasonable opportunity to the

respondent is belied by the documentary material which shows that notices were

issued by the appellant to the respondent and that the respondent was in fact

heard by the Task Force Committee. Reliance was placed on the notice to show

cause that was issued by the appellant on 9 January 2012 and the response filed

by the respondent on 16 January 2012. Third, it was urged that even after the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       7</span>

invocation of the bank guarantees, the respondent addressed a letter dated 20

September 2012 to the appellant expressing its grievance against the invocation.

Hence, it was submitted that the respondent cannot feign ignorance about the fact

that the bank guarantees have been invoked. Finally, it was submitted that the

appellant was constrained to issue a further direction to the respondent for

furnishing an additional bank guarantee of Rs 77.50 lakhs on 12 September 2012,

the date on which the bank guarantee was invoked. Insofar as this part of the

direction is concerned, it was urged that the challenge was not pressed before the

Tribunal. On these counts, it was urged that the Tribunal was in error in interfering

with the invocation of the bank guarantees.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
15     On the other hand, Mr Sajan Poovayya, learned Senior Counsel appearing

on behalf of the respondent submitted that first, the tenor of the bank guarantees

indicate that they were not unconditional. It was urged that the bank guarantees

were furnished to secure compliance with the specific obligations which were

imposed upon the respondent in Parts A, B and C of the Task Force Committee’s

recommendation dated 26 August 2011. In the present case, it was urged that the

demand which was made to the State Bank of India was not in terms of the

conditions specified in the bank guarantees. Second, it was urged that the

respondent has complied with the recommendations of the Task Force Committee

and even at this stage, it would be appropriate if the Tribunal is called upon to

verify compliance. Third, it was urged that the letter of invocation has emerged

before this Court for the first time and had not been produced before the Tribunal.

On these grounds, it was urged that the judgment of the Tribunal interfering with

the invocation of the bank guarantees does not warrant interference.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                    8</span>

</p><p id="p_23">      16       At the outset, we must deal with the fundamental basis of the decision of

      the Tribunal in setting aside the invocation of the bank guarantee. The Tribunal

      held that the purpose of the bank guarantee was not commercial or industrial but

      was to secure compliance by the appellant with environmental norms that had

      been prescribed. Hence, in the view of the Tribunal, the appellant should have

      furnished a hearing to the respondent before the bank guarantees were invoked.


      17       We are unable to subscribe to the legal position which has been

      formulated by the Tribunal. A bank guarantee constitutes an independent contract

      between the issuing bank and the beneficiary to whom the guarantee is issued.

      Such a contract is independent of the underlying contract between the beneficiary

      and the third party at whose behest the bank guarantee is issued.


      18       The principle which we have adopted accords with a consistent line of

      precedent of this Court. In Ansal Engineering Projects Ltd. v Tehri Hydro

      Development Corporation Ltd,2 a three judge Bench of this Court held thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">                “4. It is settled law that bank guarantee is an independent and
                distinct contract between the bank and the beneficiary and is
                not qualified by the underlying transaction and the validity of
                the primary contract between the person at whose instance
                the bank guarantee was given and the beneficiary. Unless
                fraud or special equity exists, is pleaded and prima facie
                established by strong evidence as a triable issue, the
                beneficiary cannot be restrained from encashing the bank
                guarantee even if dispute between the beneficiary and the
                person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given by
                the bank, had arisen in performance of the contract or
                execution of the works undertaken in furtherance thereof. The
                bank unconditionally and irrevocably promised to pay, on
                demand, the amount of liability undertaken in the guarantee
                without any demur or dispute in terms of the bank
                guarantee…
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">                5. …The court exercising its power cannot interfere with
                enforcement of bank guarantee/letters of credit except only in
                cases where fraud or special equity is prima facie made out in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                   9</span>

                the case as triable issue by strong evidence so as to prevent
                irretrievable injustice to the parties.”



      The same principle was followed in State Bank of India v Mula Sahakari Sakhar

      Karkhana Ltd3 where a two judge Bench of this Court held thus:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">                “33. It is beyond any cavil that a bank guarantee must be
                construed on its own terms. It is considered to be a separate
                transaction.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">                34. If a construction, as was suggested by Mr Naphade, is to
                be accepted, it would also be open to a banker to put forward
                a case that absolute and unequivocal bank guarantee should
                be read as a conditional one having regard to circumstances
                attending thereto. It is, to our mind, impermissible in law.”



      A bank guarantee constitutes an independent contract. <a href="/doc/1754916/" id="a_2">In Hindustan Construction

      Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar4</a>, a two judge Bench of this Court formulated the condition

      upon which the invocation of the bank guarantee depends in the following terms :
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">                “9. What is important, therefore, is that the bank guarantee
                should be in unequivocal terms, unconditional and recite
                that the amount would be paid without demur or objection
                and irrespective of any dispute that might have cropped up
                or might have been pending between the beneficiary under
                the bank guarantee or the person on whose behalf the
                guarantee was furnished. The terms of the bank
                guarantee are, therefore, extremely material. Since the
                bank guarantee represents an independent contract
                between the bank and the beneficiary, both the parties
                would be bound by the terms thereof. The invocation,
                therefore, will have to be in accordance with the terms
                of the bank guarantee, or else, the invocation itself
                would be bad.”
                                                    (Emphasis supplied)

      19       The settled legal position which has emerged from the precedents of this

      Court is that absent a case of fraud, irretrievable injustice and special equities, the

      Court should not interfere with the invocation or encashment of a bank guarantee

      so long as the invocation was in terms of the bank guarantee.

20     In the present case, the bank undertook to the appellant that it would pay

the guaranteed amount on demand, subject to the overall amount stipulated in

each of the three bank guarantees. It was not for the bank to determine as to

whether the invocation of the bank guarantees was justified so long as the

invocation was in terms of the bank guarantee. A demand once made would

oblige the bank to pay under the terms of the bank guarantee. The State Bank of

India correctly understood its legal obligations and paid over the amount to the

appellant. In this view of the matter and having regard to the terms of the bank

guarantees, we are of the view that the principle of law which has been formulated

by the Tribunal cannot be accepted as reflecting the correct legal position.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_24">21     That apart, we are unable to accept the finding of the Tribunal that the

respondent was kept in the dark on the invocation. It is evident that following the

invocation of the bank guarantees, the respondent itself addressed a

communication on 20 September 2012 to the Member Secretary of the appellant.

The communication contains a specific reference to the invocation of the bank

guarantees. That apart, it is evident from the material on the record that the

appellant had issued a notice to show cause to the respondent to which the

respondent also submitted a response. The purpose and object of the bank

guarantees was to enable the appellant to secure compliance with environmental

standards prescribed in accordance with law. The appellant has invoked the bank

guarantees issued by the respondent because of the failure of the respondent to

discharge the obligations imposed upon it by the Task Force Committee on 26

August 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                      11</span>

22     For the above reasons, we are of the view that the Tribunal has erred in

interfering with the invocation of the bank guarantees and in directing the appellant

to refund the amount of Rs 25 lakhs covered by the three guarantees. While

invoking the bank guarantees, the appellant has clearly adverted to the fact that

the status of compliance was reviewed in the Task Force Committee Meeting; and

that the officials of the appellant had inspected the industry and had observed

certain violations. The invocation of the bank guarantees was therefore in terms of

the conditions stipulated in the bank guarantees.


23     The invocation of the bank guarantees was the subject matter of the

present appeal. We allow the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and

order of the Tribunal. There shall be no order as to costs.


24     Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
