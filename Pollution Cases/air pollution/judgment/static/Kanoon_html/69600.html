                         ----------------------------------------

                    Dated this the  8th day of June 2007


                                    O R D E R
</pre>

<p id="p_1">       The  petitioners  are  accused  1 and 3  to 5   in  a  prosecution


under   the   provisions  of  'The   Water    (Prevention   and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control   of


Pollution)   Act</a>,   1974.     It   is   alleged   that   they   are   directors   of   a


company.     The   crux   of   the   allegation   is   that   the   said   company


had committed  offence  of  water  pollution   punishable  under  the


Act in   the   locality   in  which  it is  working.   The  petitioners  have


come before this court with a prayer that the prosecution against


them   may   be   quashed   invoking   the   extraordinary   inherent


jurisdiction available to this court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_2">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.


</p><p id="p_2">       2.     What   are   the   reasons?     The   learned   counsel   for   the


petitioner   has   identified   five   specific   reasons   on   the   basis   of


which   he   claims   quashing   of   proceedings.     First   of   all,   it   is


contended  that no  notice under  <a href="/doc/117249249/" id="a_3">Section  49</a>  of the  Act has been


issued   to   the   Pollution   Control   Board   by   the   first   respondent/


complainant before launching this prosecution.  After discussions


at the bar, this point is not seriously pressed.   It is evident that


this contention is not available to the petitioners in as much as


there is specific averment in the complaint and Ext.P1 document


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl.M.C.No.1087/07                      2</span>





marked in  the  course of the  sworn  statement of complainant to


show that notice under <a href="/doc/117249249/" id="a_4">Section 49</a> of the Act had been issued to


the Pollution Control Board before the complainant embarked on


this prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">      3.       The second contention raised is that the complaint is


not maintainable  in  as much crucial  averments  to implicate  the


petitioners  are  not  there  in  the complaint.     <a href="/doc/113448045/" id="a_5">Section  47(1)</a>  reads


as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">               47.Offences   by   companies-  (1)     Where   an

      offence   under   this   Act   has   been   committed   by   a

      company,  every   person   who   at   the   time   the   offence

      was committed was in charge of, and was responsible

      to the company for the conduct of, the business of the

      company, as well as the company, shall be deemed to

      be   guilty   of   the   offence   and   shall   be   liable   to   be

      proceeded against and punished accordingly:

</p><p id="p_7">               Provided   that   nothing   contained   in   this   sub-

      section   shall   render   any   such   person   liable   to   any

      punishment provided in this Act if he proves that the

      offence was committed without his knowledge for that

      he   exercised   all   due   diligence   to   prevent   the

      commission of such offence.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                                               (emphasis supplied)


</p><p id="p_9">      4.       The relevant averment against the accused persons on


this aspect appears in paragraph 3 of the complaint which also I


extract below:
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">               "It   is   respectfully   submitted   that,   50   meters

      away from the residence of the complainant, there is a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl.M.C.No.1087/07                       3</span>





       Coir Factory in the name and style of M/s.N.C.John &amp;

       Co   (herein   after   referred   as   the   Company   in   short),

       owned   by   the   accused   herein.    The   accused   are   the

       directors   of   the   said   company   who   are   solely

       responsible   for   any   crime   committed   by   the

       company."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                                (emphasis supplied)




</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      5.     The   learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   relies   on


various   decisions   on   this   aspect   by   courts   culminating   in   the


decision in  <a href="/doc/1302578/" id="a_6">SMS Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs. Neeta Bhalla</a> [2005(8)


SCC 89] that was a decision rendered in relation to a prosecution


under   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Section   138</a>   read   with   <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_8">Section   141</a>   of   the   Negotiable


Instruments   Act.     In   the   said   decision,   it   has  been   held   clearly


and   unambiguously   that   unless   the   requisite   averments


attracting   culpability   so   far   as   the   directors   are   concerned   are


made   specifically   in   the   complaint,     cognizance   should   not   be


taken against such accused directors.  It is unnecessary to advert


to   precedents   earlier   in  <a href="/doc/1302578/" id="a_9">SMS   Pharmaceuticals   Ltd.   vs.   Neeta


Bhalla</a>   [2005(8)   SCC   89].       After   considering   the   entire   law   on


the   point,   it   has   been   held   unambiguously   that   the   requisite


averments must be there in order to attract the culpable liability


for the directors.</blockquote><p id="p_11">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl.M.C.No.1087/07                      4</span>





</p><p id="p_12">      6.     That   position   of   law   is   therefore   well   settled.     The


learned   counsel   for   the   complainant   makes   an   attempt   to


contend   that  <a href="/doc/1302578/" id="a_10">SMS  Pharmaceuticals   Ltd.   vs.  Neeta   Bhalla</a>   [2005


(8) SCC 89] is applicable only to a prosecution like the one under


<a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_11">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act where the offence


alleged   is   comparatively   insignificant   and   light   and   such   an


interpretation regarding the requirement of pleadings cannot be


blindly imported into prosecution for a very serious offence like


the one under the pollution laws.  The offence alleged committed


by the petitioners in this case affects posterity and therefore the


principles   of   interpretation   under   <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_12">Section   141</a>   of   the   N.I.Act


cannot   be   blindly   imported.     That   contention   may,   of   course,


require   serious   consideration   but   cannot   of   course   be   readily


accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      7.     The   learned   counsel   for   the   complainant   then


contends that it is not the law that the words of the statute must


be   repeated   and   reiterated   in   the   complaint.     The   core   of   the


issue   is   whether   the   requisite   allegations   have   been   raised


against   the   accused   who   are   directors   of   the   company.


Paragraph   3   extracted   above,   according   to   me,   sufficiently


notifies the accused persons of the nature of the allegations that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl.M.C.No.1087/07                          5</span>





are raised against them.  That they are solely responsible for the


crime   committed   by   the   company   is   specifically   and   effectively


narrated   and   communicated.     The   requirement   of   pleadings


whether it be civil law or criminal law is that the adversary must


be   notified   of   the   case   on   his   opponent.     The   requirements   of


pleadings   is   not   certainly   an   empty   formality.     This   has   its


foundation in the principles of natural justice which demand that


no   persons   must   be   condemned   without   being   heard.


Opportunity for  being heard effectively  includes  the  right  to be


notified of the allegations that he has to meet.    Language of the


statute need not be ritualistically repeated.  It is sufficient if such


averments are there which would effectively and cogently convey


to the indictees the case which they have to meet.  Materials and


evidence   in   support   of   such   pleadings   will   come   only   later.     In


this   view   of   the   matter,   I   am   of   the   opinion   that   it   may   not   be


appropriate   or   proper   to   throw   the   prosecution   out   at   the


threshold invoking the extraordinary inherent jurisdiction on the


ground   that   the   averments   in   paragraph   3   extracted   above   are


not   succinct,   sufficient   and   specific   -   that   they   do   not   repeat


crucial and key words of the statute in <a href="/doc/1821721/" id="a_13">Section 47(1)</a> of the Act.


This   is   not   to   say   that   I   am   totally   satisfied   with   the   nature   of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl.M.C.No.1087/07                       6</span>





pleadings.     But   the   inadequacy   of   the   pleadings   must   be


realistically   considered   and   undeserved   benefit   cannot   be


conferred on an indictee and he cannot be spared of the liability


to face the trial only on such reason.   Significantly, this is not a


case   where   there   are   no   averments   at   all.     The   averments   in


paragraph   3   extracted   above   indicate   clearly   that   the   accused


are directors of the company and they are solely responsible for


the   acts   of   the   company   -   that   is   the   crime   committed   by   the


company.   In these circumstances, I am certainly of the opinion


that   the   trial   must   proceed   and   the   court   must   wait   for   the


evidence   which   is   likely   to   be   adduced,   the   core   having   been


stated   in   paragraph   3   extracted   above.     The   second   contention


raised cannot in these circumstances, justify this court invoking


the powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_14">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">      8.     The   third   contention   raised   is   that   there   are   no


relevant   averments   which   can   attract   culpability   under   <a href="/doc/1821721/" id="a_15">Section


47(2)</a>   of   the   Act.     I   agree   with   the   learned   counsel   for   the


petitioner   on   this   aspect.     There   is   no   contention   that   any


consent   or   connivance   was  there   on   the   part   of   the   petitioners


which   resulted   in   the   commission   of   the   offence   nor   does   the


complainant have a specific case - it is evident on going through


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Crl.M.C.No.1087/07                     7</span>





the pleadings, that the petitioners are liable under <a href="/doc/1821721/" id="a_16">Section 47(2)</a>


of the Act.  The contention raised under <a href="/doc/1821721/" id="a_17">Section 47(2)</a> of the Act


is therefore entitled to succeed but such success is irrelevant in


view   of   the   answer   already   given   to   contention   No.2   referred


above.     Further,   it   is   apposite   to   note   that   accused   No.1   is


alleged   to   be   executive   director   and   sixth   accused   is   executive


officer/alleged director as status.  What the expression executive


director   and   executive   officer   means   will   certainly   have   to   be


amplified in evidence by the complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">      9.     Fourthly   it   is   contended   that   subsequent   to   the


alleged act of pollution in this case, writ petition has been filed


by the complainant along with another before the High court to


ensure that the factory is closed down and does not continue to


perpetuate   the   alleged   pollution.     Subsequently,   commissions


have  been  taken out in  the  court.    These, according  to me,  are


absolutely   irrelevant   in   as   much   as   the   precise   offence   alleged


has been committed in respect of period prior to the filing of the


writ petition.   I am not, in these circumstances, referring to the


various materials  that have  been  introduced in  evidence, in  the


course of the writ petition.   Significantly, there is no contention


that   the   allegation   made   in   the   petition   do   not   reveal   the

commission of an offence under the Act by the company during


the relevant period -  i.e the period prior to the filing of the writ


petition.

Control   Board   has   subsequently   duly   licensed   the   petitioner's


company.           The   subsequent   establishment   of   appropriate


pollution   plants   and   abatement   of   nuisance   of   pollution   cannot


certainly have the effect of obliterating or effacing the offence, if


any   already   committed.     In   view   of   that   also,   the   subsequent


granting of licence by the Pollution Control Board cannot, in any


way deliver any advantage to the petitioners.


</p><p id="p_21">       11.     No   other   contentions   are   raised.     I   am,   in   these


circumstances,   of   the   opinion   that   no   circumstances   have   been


brought   out   which   would   justify   premature   termination   of   the


proceedings   against   the   petitioners   by   invoking   the


extraordinary inherent jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_18">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.  It


is   unnecessary   to   advert   to   precedents   which   have   been   cited


copiously   at   the   Bar   on   this   aspect.     Suffice   it   to   say   that   the


jurisdiction which I am called upon to invoke and exercise is an


extraordinary inherent jurisdiction which cannot be invoked as a


matter  of  course  and  which   ought  to   be   invoked  only   sparingly

and in exceptional cases -  in  the rarest of rare cases as held in


<a href="/doc/513644/" id="a_19">Kurukshetra   University   vs.   State   of   Haryana</a>   [AIR   1977   SC


2229].  I   am   of   the   opinion   that   the   materials   available   in   this


case   [considering   the   nature   of   allegations,   the   gravity   of   the


allegations and the precise conduct alleged as revealed from the


circumstances] this is not a fit case where such a jurisdiction can


and   ought   to   be   invoked.     I   must,   however,   hasten   to   observe


that   I   have   not   intended   to   finally   conclude   any   disputed


question   of   fact   or   law   and   I   have   only   chosen   to   hold   that


powers   under   <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_20">Section   482</a>   Cr.P.C   need   not   be   invoked   at   this


stage and with the present materials.
