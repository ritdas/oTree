Coram:HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJEEV KUMAR, JUDGE


                               JUDGEMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1     The petitioner is aggrieved and has challenged the e-auction notices

issued by the District Mineral Officers of different Districts on 27.05.2020,

28.05.2020, 29.05.2020, 30.05.2020 and 01.06.2020 etc. The petitioner claims

that he had earlier responded to the e-auction notice issued by the District

Mineral Officer, Bandipora vide his No. DGM/DMO/BPR/828-832 dated

30.01.2020. The petitioner was found to be the highest bidder in the aforesaid

auctioning process and was intimated to deposit 50% of the total bid amount in
                                        2                  WPC 1046/2020




terms of e-mail dated 15.02.2020 sent by the District Mineral Officer

concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2     The petitioner submits that despite the fact that he was entitled to

allotment of blocks e-auctioned by the District Mineral Officer, Bandipora, the

process was not taken to its logical end on the ground that the Ministry of

Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India vide its

communication dated 29.04.2020 had written to the Ministry of Mines,

Government of India to have pre-embedded prior environment/forest clearance

before putting the mineral blocks to e-auction. The petitioner states that he did

not agitate the matter as he was convinced that the instructions of the Ministry

of Environment, Forest and Climate Change were required to be carried out by

all the States and Union Territories including the Union Territory of Jammu

and Kashmir.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3     The grievance of the petitioner is that while he was denied the allotment

of lease relying upon the aforesaid instructions of the Ministry of Environment

and Forest, yet the respondents issued the e-auction notices without complying

with the communication of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate

Change dated 29.04.2020. His further grievance is that the Ministry of Mines,

Government of India has now come up with detailed guidelines issued

purportedly under <a href="/doc/1814464/" id="a_1">Section 20A</a> of Mines and Mineral (Development &amp;

<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_2">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 („the Act‟ for short) which clearly provide

pre-embedded clearances before putting the mineral blocks to e-auction

process.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4     Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, therefore, contends that all

e-auction notices issued by the respondents are bad in the eyes of law as the
                                        3                   WPC 1046/2020




pre-embedded clearances as mandated by the Government of India had not

been obtained before initiating e-auction process.

5     Having heard learned counsel for the petitioner and perused the record, I

am of the view that the petitioner has no cause to maintain this petition.

6     Admittedly, the petitioner has not responded to any of the e-auction

notices impugned in this petition. He claims to have participated in the

e-auction which was conducted by the District Mineral Officer,Bandipora

pursuant to its notification dated 30.01.2020. He was declared successful in the

e-auction and was directed to deposit 50% of the bid amount.

7     Why the aforesaid e-auction process was not taken to its logical end is

not forthcoming from the record of the writ petition. Learned counsel for the

petitioner, however contends that the petitioner was given to understand that in

view of the new guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and

Claimant Change and communicated to the Secretary of Mines, Government of

India on 29.04.2020, the process has been abandoned.

8     Interestingly, the petitioner has raised no grievance with regard to the

aforesaid e-auction process. He, however, has strongly relied upon the

abandonment of the aforesaid process to justify the sustainability of his

grievance against the impugned e-auction notices.

9     As noted above, most of the e-auction notices were issued on

27.05.2020, 28.05.2020 and 30.05.2020 and one or two e-auction notices have

also been issued on 01.06.2020. The petitioner has neither participated in those

e-auction, nor has he raised any grievance as is projected in the writ petition

before any authority.
</p><pre id="pre_2">                                         4                   WPC 1046/2020




10    Confronted with the aforesaid position, learned counsel for the petitioner

</pre><p id="p_5">placed reliance on the communication of the J&amp;K Pollution Control Board (for

short "the Board") issued vide its No. PCB/LSJ/PS/20/738 dated 05.06.2020 to

contend that the matter had been taken at the relevant point of time with the

Board.
</p>
<p id="p_6">11    A perusal of the communication of the Board dated 05.06.2020 makes it

abundantly clear that the grievance which the petitioner has now projected in

this writ petition was never agitated before any authority including the Board.

The Board vide its communication dated 05.06.2020 appears to have responded

to the representation of the petitioner dated 03.06.2020 regarding the role of the

Board in the matter of mining operations. The Board clarifies that for any type

of mining activity, not only the environmental clearance from the competent

authority is required, but consent to establish and consent to operate from the

Board under Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974 and Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 is sine quo non. No other

document, letter or communication has been brought to the notice of this Court

by the learned counsel for the petitioner which could demonstrate the bona fide

of the petitioner with regard to raising of the grievance on the first available

opportunity. No explanation has been tendered to justify the wait of about

twenty one days for challenging the e-auction notices. The process of e-auction

appears to have proceeded further and is stated to be at the stage of finalization.

12    It is at this point of time the petitioner, for reasons not forthcoming from

the petition has approached this Court to somehow stop the e-auction of minor

minerals undertaken by the Union Territory of J&amp;K. Even a look at the order of

Ministry of Mines, Government of India dated 03.06.2020 laying down the
                                          5                WPC 1046/2020




guidelines for e-auction of mineral blocks with pre-embedded clearances for

mining projects makes it clear that the States and the Union Territories have

been enjoined to identify at least five mineral blocks for e-auction with pre-

embedded clearances which would be e-auctioned along with other mineral

blocks. It further provides that based on the experience from e-auction of the

identified mineral blocks on pilot basis, further steps will be taken towards

mainstreaming the concept of auction with pre-embedded clearances as per

National Mineral Policy, 2019 approved by the Cabinet.

13    Suffice it to notice that these guidelines were issued by the Ministry of

Mines in terms of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Section 20A</a> of the Act only on 03.06.2020, while as the

impugned e-auction notices had already been floated. The identification of five

mineral blocks for e-auction with pre-embedded clearances may have to be

resorted to by the respondents in the next auctions in terms of the

communication of the Ministry of Mines dated 30.06.2020, and would not

apply to the process which was already set in motion by issuing the impugned

e-auction notices prior to coming into operation of the guidelines aforesaid.

Otherwise also, the petition filed by the petitioner lacks bona fide and,

therefore, this Court is not inclined to exercise its discretionary power vested

under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_7">14    That apart, the communication dated 3.06.2020 (supra) ex-facie applies

to the minerals only and may not comprehend within its ambit the „minor

minerals‟ which expression is separately defined under <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_7">Section 3</a> (e) of the Act.

It is also pertinent to note that in terms of <a href="/doc/77055124/" id="a_8">Section 15</a> of the Act, the power to

frame statutory rules in respect of minor minerals is exclusively reserved to the

State Government and the State Government, in the exercise of aforesaid
                                                        6                      WPC 1046/2020




            power, has already promulgated the statutory rules in terms of SRO 105 of

            2016 which is being followed by the respondents in the matter of allotment of

            leases and licences of minor minerals in the Union Territory of Jammu and

            Kashmir. Ministry‟s guidelines issued in terms of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Section 20A</a> of the Act can,

            at the most, treated to be instructions to remodel their Rules on the lines

            suggested in the guidelines.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            15         For the foregoing reasons, I find no merit in this writ petition. The same

            is, accordingly, dismissed.
