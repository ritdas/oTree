     Dua, learned Senior Counsel, points out that the respondent-

     Pollution Control Board has perhaps not understood the

     intent and purport of the order. Also, inspections are not



     being carried out with earnestness. Thus far, at Parwanoo

     out   of   514    industrial     establishments,            only      291




     establishments stands inspected and all this despite the fact





     that the Pollution Control Board has got appropriate

     establishment at that place.       Even at Dharamshala, the





     Board has got an office and an Assistant Environmental

     Engineer posted there. From 11th to 13th December, 2017

     only 88 establishments could be inspected at Dharamshala.
