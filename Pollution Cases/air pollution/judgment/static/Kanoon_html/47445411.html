     THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226
AND 227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO
DIRECT THE RESPONDENTS TO CLOSE DOWN THE STONE
CRUSHING UNITS SITUATE WITHIN RADIUS OF 10 KM (I.E. 3.80

FOREST IN SHIMOGGA DISTRICT AS PER THE REPORT OF
FOURTH RESPONDENT DATED 26.09.2018 (ANNEXURE-D)
ETC.

      THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY HEARING
THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                            ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.      Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners.

His submission made today is based on certain guidelines,

which are appended to a document of the Karnataka State

Highways Improvement Project - II. He is also relying upon a

decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1725193/" id="a_1">T.N.Godavarman

Thirumulpad vs. Union of India and Others</a> [(2010)13 SCC

740].
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    -5-</span><p id="p_2">



</p><p id="p_3">2.    In the representation which is annexed to the petition,

the grievance made by the petitioners is about the noise

pollution and the air pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.    Our attention is invited to Section 6-A of the Karnataka

Regulation of Stone Crushers Act, 2011 (for short 'the said Act

of 2011'). <a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_2">Section 6</a> provides that a licence can be granted

only in a declared safer zone.           Clauses (1) and (2) of

sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Section 6-A</a> of the said Act of 2011 are

material, which read thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "6-A. Conditions for grant of licence.─(1) No
      licence shall be issued for stone crushers outside the
      safer zone.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             (2) The Licensing Authority on production of
      Consent for Operation (CFO) certificate issued by the
      Karnataka State Pollution Control Board shall grant
      licence to the applicant in such form as may be
      prescribed. The licensee shall adhere to the following
      conditions, namely,─
           (1) each unit shall abide by the provisions of the
               Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
               1981 and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,
               1986 and rules made thereunder as
               prescribed by KSPCB from time to time.
           (2) each unit shall conform to the Noise Pollution
               (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">4.    It is not the case of the petitioners that consent to

operate has not been granted to the sixth respondent.           A

perusal of the representation made by the petitioners at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               -6-</span>


Annexure-E shows that the allegation is that there is a breach

of environmental laws and the operations carried out by the

added respondent are generating a lot of dust and pollution.

The grievance is also about the noise pollution.


</p><p id="p_7">5.    The representation at Annexure-E is addressed to the

Deputy Commissioner and Chairman of the District Mines and

Stone Quarrying Control Committee.            A copy of the

representation is addressed to the District Environment and

Pollution Control Officer.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">6.    We, therefore, direct the Deputy Commissioner (second

respondent) to forward the said complaint/representation to the

jurisdictional officer of the Pollution Control Board by calling

upon the Officer to verify whether the added respondent has

committed any breach of clauses (1) and (2) of sub-section (2)

of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Section 6-A</a> of the said Act of 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">7.    After getting a report from the Pollution Control Board,

necessary orders shall be passed in accordance with law by

the second respondent on the representation made by the

petitioners.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                -7-</span><p id="p_12">


</p><p id="p_13">8.     With the above said direction, the petition is disposed of.

We make it clear that we have made no adjudication on the

merits of the allegations made in the petition.

</p><p id="p_14">       The pending interlocutory application does not survive

for consideration and it stands disposed of.
