and setting aside of the order dated 11 th  December, 2012 passed by the 

Learned Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence. 



2                 The  Applicant   No.1  herein  is   the   Chief  Promoter  of  Shree

<p id="p_2">accused in the FIR No.3 of 2012 dated 7th January 2012 registered with 

the Oshiwara Police Station, Andheri West, Mumbai. The Applicant No.1 

has been arraigned as accused No.6 in CC No.2263/PW/2012 pending on 

the   file   of   the   Learned   Metropolitan   Magistrate,   65th  Court,   Andheri, 

Mumbai.   The   Applicant   No.2   is   a   partner   of   Samartha   Development 

Corporation which has been entrusted with the development of the land 

which is the subject matter of the FIR. The Applicant No.3 is the manager 

working with the said Samartha Development Corporation. The Applicant 

No.3 has been shown as accused No.4 in the said CC No.2263/PW/2012. 

It seems that the Applicant Nos.2 and 3 were not originally named in the 

FIR but were subsequently named in the charge-sheet. 



3                 The   subject   FIR   has   been   registered   by   the   Circle   Officer, 

Andheri  under  <a href="/doc/51829346/" id="a_4">Section  15(1)</a> and (2)  of  the  <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">Environment (Protection) 

Act</a>, 1986. The subject land is Plot No.124 which forms part of a scheme 

sanctioned by the  Municipal  Corporation  vide  order  No.CE/649/BS 1/

Oshiwara, Taluka Andheri and admeasures 7747.1 sq. mtrs. As indicated 

above, it is the Samartha Development Corporation which is entitled to 

develop the said plot in respect of which it has obtained approvals for 

construction of buildings on the said plot which buildings comprise of 

three wings.

4                 The plans for the said buildings have been sanctioned by the 

</pre><p id="p_3">Municipal Corporation for Greater Mumbai (for short "MCGM") on 3 rd 

July, 2012 and commencement certificate has been issued on 6 th  April, 

2013. The MCGM has also issued NOC dated 19 th  July, 2012 from the 

Water   Works   Department.   The   Tree   Authority   has   issued   NOC   on   5 th 

September, 2012 and provisional NOC has been issued by the MTNL on 

26th  July, 2012.  Since   the  plot  falls in  the   CRZ  area,  the   Maharashtra 

Coastal Zone Management Authority (for short "MCZMA") has vide letter 

dated   11th  November,   2011   recommended   the   proposed   residential 

construction on the said plot as per the decision taken at the 71 st meeting 

of the MCZMA.

<p id="p_4">

5                 It   seems   that   some   persons   made   a   complaint   to   the 

Tahsildar alleging that mangroves were being destroyed on the said plot 

of land.   Pursuant to the said complaint it seems that a site  visit was 

carried   out   by   the   Circle   Officer,   Nandkumar   Balsaraf   and   the   other 

officers of the Revenue Department on 29 th  December, 2011.   It seems 

that thereafter a letter came to be addressed by the office of the Tahsildar, 

Andheri on 5th  January, 2012 to the Oshiwara Police Station. The Circle 

Officer thereafter visited the said Police Station on 6th January, 2012 and 

ultimately FIR came to be registered on 7 th January, 2012. The gist of the 

allegations in the FIR is to the following effect :-

               boundary   of   the   plot   of   land,   the   Applicants   have 
               allegedly dumped on  the  said  plot earth/debris at a 
               distance of 15 or 20 from the roots of 2 or 3 mangrove 
               trees which are growing inside the nala.

Applicants   carried   out   enquiries,   upon   they   came   to   know   that   the 

complaint was made by an organization called "Save Open Space".

Bench  on   22nd  August,  2012  whilst   disposing   of   the  said  Writ   Petition 

observed that there is no manner of doubt that the Investigating Officer 

would submit appropriate report to the concerned Court. It was further 

observed by the Division Bench that on the said location if damage has 

been done to any mangroves, the Investigating Officer will record the said 

fact   in   the   final   report   to   be   submitted   to   the   concerned   Court.   The 

Division Bench further observed that the Investigating Officer shall do the 

needful in the matter in  right earnest. The Division Bench accordingly 

disposed of the said Writ Petition. Hence, the said Writ Petition was filed 

before the final report was filed and before cognizance being taken.

Applicants   in   assailing   the   charge-sheet   and   the   order   dated   11 th 

December, 2012 is that the procedure and or the due process of law for 

registering   an   offence   under   Section   19   of   the   EPA   1986   was   not 

followed. It was the contention of the Learned Counsel that Section 19 of 

the EPA requires the Central Government or its officer to file a complaint 

or a private citizen to give an advance notice of 60 days to the Central 

Government   or  its  officer   before   filing   a   complaint.   It  was   further   the 

submission of the Learned Counsel that a combined reading of Section 19 

of   the   EPA   1986   and   <a href="/doc/255245/" id="a_9">Section   2(d)</a>   of   the   Cr.P.C.   indicates   that   for 

cognizance of an offence under <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_10">Section 19</a> a complaint has to be filed 

before the Magistrate and such complaint does not include a police report 

under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_11">Section  173</a> of  the  Cr.P.C.  It was  the  submission  of the  Learned 

Counsel that in the present case neither a proper authority has instituted

Noise   Pollution   Rules   framed   under   the   EPA   1986   had   come   up   for 

consideration in Dr. Mahesh Vijay Bedekar's case (supra). The Division 

Bench   held  that   the  contravention   of   the   Noise   Pollution  Rules  would 

amount to an offence under Section 15 of the EPA 1986 and therefore 

complaint in that regard would have to be made by persons authorized to 

do so. The Division Bench in the said case referred to the notification 

issued   by   the   Central   Government   being   S.O.394/E   which   shows   that 

under clause (a) of Section 19 of the EPA 1986. The power to set the 

criminal   law   in   motion   has   been   conferred   on   the   Chairman   or   the 

Member Secretaries of the State Pollution Control Board as well as the 

Regional   Officers   of   the   State   Pollution   Control   Board.   In   the   said 

notification, even the Collector is authorized under clause (a) of <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_14">Section 

19</a> to set the criminal law in motion under clause (a) of <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_15">Section 19</a>. The 

Division Bench in the context of the said notification and having regard 

to <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_16">Section 19</a> held that the Police Officers are not empowered to set the 

criminal law in motion unless there is a compliance with clause (b) of

                  should   maintain   all   records   of   pit   for   deep   burial. 
                  From the above provisions of Rules 4, 5 and 6 of the 
                  Bio-Medical Waste Rules, and the authorisation dated 
                  01/03/2013 given by GSPCB, it is clear that it is the 
                  "occupier" of the institution, who will be responsible 
                  for the alleged offence under Section 5 of the Act read 
                  with  Rules  5   and   6  of  the  Bio-Medical   Waste   Rules. 
                  None   of   the   petitioners   is   the   occupier   and   the 
                  occupier   is   the   Medical   Superintendent   of   the   said 
                  Hospital.   Considering   the   provision   of   Section   19   of 
                  the Act, the complaint ought to have been lodged by 
                  the   Central   Government   or   any   authority   or   officer 
                  authorised,  in   this  behalf,  by  that  Government  or   in 
                  the manner as specified by clause (b) of Section 19. 
                  However,   the   said   provision   has   not   been   complied 
                  with. The provision is mandatory. Hence, the learned 
                  J.M.F.C., Ponda could not have taken cognizance of the 
                  said   offence.   On   this   ground   alone,   the   F.I.R.   under 
                  Section 5 of the Act read with Rules 5 and 6 of Bio-
                  Medical Waste Rules and the Charge Sheet filed for the 
                  said offence are liable to be quashed and set aside."

<p id="p_33">Thereafter the said issue had come up before another Division Bench in 

Ajay Jagdish Pande's  case  (supra).  In the said case, a submission was 

advanced on behalf of the accused by the Learned Counsel that the Police 

could not have filed a charge-sheet in respect of an offence punishable 

under Section 15 of the EPA 1986. It was further submitted that there 

was no question of the Court taking cognizance of an offence punishable 

under the EPA 1986 on the basis of the charge-sheet filed by the police in

<p id="p_34">view of the provisions of Section 19 of the EPA 1986. The Division Bench 

held that the Court would have no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the 

offence punishable under Section 15 of the EPA 1986 on the basis of the 

documents   submitted   to   it   by   the   Police.   Paragraph   38   of   the   said 

judgment is material and is reproduced herein under :- 



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">           "38. Clearly, the Court would have no jurisdiction to take

                submitted to it by the police. Even if any action has 
                been taken by the Court pursuant to the filing of such 
                document, such action would be without jurisdiction, 
                void and ab initio. The cognizance taken in violation of 
                a specific provision would be no cognizance at all, and 
                would be non-est."

<p id="p_36">18                A   reading   of   the   aforesaid   judgments   (supra)   therefore 

reveals a common thread running in them. In so far as cognizance of an 

offence  under  the  EPA 1986 is concerned, the  weight of  the  aforesaid 

judgments   is   overwhelmingly   leaning   towards   holding   that   to   take 

cognizance of an offence under Section 15 of the EPA 1986 the complaint 

has to be made by the Central Government or any authority or officer 

authorized by the government, but does not include a police report under 

Section 173 of the CPC. In so far as the alternative contained in <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_33">Section 

19</a> is concerned, no doubt, a private individual can file a complaint but 

the same has to be filed by following the mandate of clause (b) of Section 

19 of the EPA 1986 i.e. by giving a notice in a prescribed manner of the 

alleged   offence   to   the   Central   Government   or   its   concerned   officer   of

<p id="p_37">State   that   he   intends   to   make   a   complaint   on   the   said   basis   and 

individual   would   have   to   state   that   if   within   sixty   days   does   not   get 

response then would proceed further. It is well settled by the judgments 

of the Apex Court that if a statute is requires a thing to be done, it has to 

be done in the said manner only and not in any other manner. It is in the  

aforesaid context that the relief sought in the instant application would 

have to be considered. 
</p>
<p id="p_38">

19                In so far as the instant case is concerned, there is no dispute 

about   the   fact   that   the   FIR   has   been   registered   by   the   Circle   Officer, 

Andheri and there is nothing on record to indicate that the said Circle 

Officer has been authorized by the Central Government to file an FIR in 

respect   of   an   offence   under   the   EPA   1986.   It   is   pursuant   to   the 

registration   of   an   FIR   that   investigation   was   carried   out   by   the   local 

police and a final report under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_34">Section 173</a> came to be filed by the local 

police.   It   is   pursuant   to   the   final   report   filed   that   cognizance   under 

Section 19 of the EPA 1986 has been taken by the concerned learned 

Metropolitan Magistrate. Hence, in the instant case, the cognizance of the 

offence has been taken by the learned Magistrate on the basis of a police 

report which is impermissible as per the law enunciated by the Division 

Benches of this Court. Hence, the consequences of the cognizance being 

taken on the basis of a police report which is not the modality prescribed

20                A useful reference could also be made to the judgment of the

Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 which provides for cognizance 

and trial of offences, was in contention. The said provision reads thus :-

           whether the Food Inspector, Faridkot was duly authorized 
           to   launch   a   prosecution.   The   Food   Inspector   had   been

           impugned notification dated September 7, 1972 makes it 
           manifest that it was the Director of Health Services and not

           Inspector to launch prosecutions for an offence under the

<p id="p_43">The Apex Court in the facts of the said case where the prosecution was

Inspector,   Faridkot   not   being   authorized   to   launch   prosecution   for   an 

offence   under  the  said  Act  found  fault  with  the  launching of  the  said

20(1)</a>   of   the   said   Act   does   not   contemplate   the   institution   of   a

filing of the charge-sheet inter-alia on the ground, that on the basis of the 

GPS   readings   and   spot   inspection   it   was   recorded   that   there   are   no 

mangroves on the said plot, the permission granted by the MCZMA to 

carry out construction on the said plot and that there is no mangrove 

area   of   more   than   1000   sq.mtrs.   within   50   mtrs.   distance   from   the 

proposed building on the said plot. That the two or three mangrove trees 

on the said plot as stated in the FIR do not qualify as a "mangrove area" 

because an area of 1000 sq.mtrs. must be covered by mangroves for there 

to be a mangrove area. That the said plot falls within CRZ-II and not 

CRZ-I and therefore there is no question of any mangroves growing on 

the said plot which is acknowledged by the MCGM and MCZMA. That the 

stop work notice dated 29th June 2013 being withdrawn by the MCZMA 

in its 114 meeting dated 2nd  November  2016 and  that the  restrictions 

imposed vide order dated 6th  October, 2005 passed by this Court in PIL 

No.87 of  2006  do not apply  to the  plot  in question  as the  said order 

applies to mangrove areas which are notified and which order provides 

for a mechanism for the purposes of identification and notification of the 

mangrove areas. It is on the aforesaid grounds that the Applicants have 

questioned the registering of the FIR and filing of the charge-sheet by the

<p id="p_45">police. Since we have come to a conclusion that the cognizance taken by 

the learned Magistrate is not in terms of Section 19 of the EPA 1986 and 

therefore the order dated 11th December, 2012 taking cognizance would 

have to be set aside. It is not necessary for us to go into the grounds 

afore-stated questioning the registering of the FIR and the charge-sheet. 

It would be for the Applicants to urge the said grounds in appropriate 

proceedings, if the occasion arises in future.    



22                Though we have come to a conclusion that the order dated 

11th  December,   2012   passed   by   the   learned   Magistrate   of   taking 

cognizance of the offence under Section 15 of the EPA 1986 would have 

to be set aside, it would not be out of place to revisit the direction of the 

Division   Bench   as   contained   in   the   order   dated   22 nd  December,   2016 

(clause III of the order passed by the Division Bench in PIL No.218 of 

2013). Since by the said direction, the Division Bench has held that the 

investigation carried thereon is not per-se illegal that the officer under 

clause (a) of <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_50">Section 19</a> can always file complaints in accordance with the 

said Code by relying upon the material collected during the investigation 

and material forming part of the charge-sheet prepared by the police. It is 

therefore not necessary to quash and set aside the FIR, however, we are 

required   to   modulate   the   relief   which   is   to   be   granted   in   the   above 

application accordingly. Hence, the following order :-
