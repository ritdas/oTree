                                   ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">          This is a petition filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the

Code of Criminal Procedure seeking to have Annexure A

complaint quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          2.    Petitioner is the second accused in C.C.

No.871 of 2003 before the Judicial Magistrate of the First

Class, North Paravoor.
</p>
<p id="p_3">          3.       Proceedings originated on a private

complaint filed against the accused persons for having

committed offence punishable under <a href="/doc/923007/" id="a_2">Section 37</a> read

with <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_3">Section 40</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, hereinafter referred to as the Act. The

allegation is that the first accused, which is an industry,

has conducting its affairs without complying with the

directions issued by the Department and without valid

consent of the second respondent herein under the Act.

The petitioner would submit that the industry has not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl.M.C.1451/208.              2</span>

been functioning since 14.6.2002.        On that day       an

application for renewal of licence was submitted and it was

rejected by the second respondent.       Even going by the

statement made by the second respondent herein, company

has not been      running from   27.11.2002 onwards.     It is

therefore clear that the complaint itself is not maintainable.

It is also pointed     out by the learned counsel for the

petitioner that even assuming that what the complainant

says is true, still the complaint is not maintainable for the

simple reason that it was not laid by a person authorised to

do so. Learned counsel drew the attention of this court to

<a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_5">Section 40</a> of the Act and relied on the decisions reported in

<a href="/doc/1549889/" id="a_6">Mangulal Chunilal v. Manilal Maganlal</a> (AIR 1968 SC

</p><p id="p_4">822) and <a href="/doc/1447296/" id="a_7">A.K.Roy v. State of Punjab</a> (AIR 1986 SC 2160)

to point out that the complaint is not maintainable.

</p><p id="p_5">             4.  Learned counsel appearing for the second

respondent       made available a notification issued, which

showed        the persons, who are competent to lay the

complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_6"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl.M.C.1451/208.                 3</span>

</p><p id="p_7">             5. This petition will have to be succeeded on a

very short ground. <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_8">Section 43</a> of the Act reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "43.     Cognizance of offences:-       (1) No court

      shall take cognizance of any offence under this Act

      except on a complaint made by:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      (a) a Board or any officer authorized in this behalf

      by it; or

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (b) any person who has given notice of not less

      than sixty days, in the manner prescribed, of the

      alleged offence and of his intention to make a

      complaint to the Board or officer authorized as

      aforesaid, and no court inferior to that of a

      Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of

      the first class shall try any offence punishable

      under this Act.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      (2)Where a complaint has been made under clause

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         (b) of sub-section (1), the Board shall on demand

         by such person, make available the relevant

         reports in its possession to that person:

         Provided, that the Board may refuse to make

         any such report available to such person if the

         same is, in its opinion against the public

         interest."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl.M.C.1451/208.             4</span>

</blockquote><p id="p_8">In the decision reported in Mangulal Chunilal's case, it

has been held that the person, who files a complaint must

show that he has the authority to do so. In the decision

reported in A.K.Roy's case, it has been held that in cases

where there is specific provision regarding the person, who

can lay the complaint or initiate proceedings, that will have

to be done only by that person and nobody else. In other

words, when a thing is to be done in a particular manner, it

can be done only in that way and not in any other way. In

the case on hand, even going by the Notification made

available by the learned counsel for the second respondent,

the person who is competent to lay the complaint is the

Chief Environmental Engineer. Annexure A1 complaint has

been laid by the Assistant Environmental Engineer. There is

nothing to show that he is authorised to lay the complaint.

<a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_9">Section 43</a> enables the Board or any authorized officer in

this behalf by it. The Board has only authorised the Chief

Environmental Engineer to lay the complaint.      The Chief

Environmental Engineer has no authority to delegate that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl.M.C.1451/208.                 5</span>

function      to   the    Assistant     Environmental     Engineer.

Therefore, the court could not have taken cognizance on the

basis of the complaint filed by the Assistant Environmental

Engineer.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             In the result, this petition is allowed, the impugned

proceedings are quashed and all further proceedings in C.C.

871 of 2003 before the JFCM, North Paravur shall stand

dropped.       However, this will not preclude the second

respondent from taking such steps as are available to them

in law.
