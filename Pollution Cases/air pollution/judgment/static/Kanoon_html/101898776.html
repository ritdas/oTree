:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner challenging the
Government Order in G.O(2D)No.91, Housing and Urban Development (Na.Va.4(i))   
Department, dated 30.06.2016, passed by the first respondent and for a
consequential direction to the first respondent to vary the classification of
the petitioner's land in S.F.No.469/1A1, 469/1A2 Part (old No.469/1A) and
496/1B1 of Suriyur Village, Thiruverumbur Taluk, Tiruchirappalli District,
from ?Mixed Residential Zone? to ?Controlled Industrial Zone?.
</p>        
<p id="p_2">        2.The case of the petitioner is that the petitioner company is
incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_2">Companies Act</a>, 1956.  The company had proposed to set  
up a plant/factory at Suriyur Village, Tiruchirappalli District.  This was to
function as a bottling unit for Pepsico India Holding Private Limited.  The
plant was planned to be constructed at S.Nos.469/469/1A2 and 469/1B1 of 
Suriyur Village over an extent of 24 acres.  The required land has been
purchased by the petitioner under the sale deed dated 04.10.2010 registered
as Document No.8347 of 2010 in the office of the Sub-Registrar, Tiruverumbur.
</p>
        
<p id="p_3">        3.According to the petitioner, the land in question is classified as
?Mixed Residential Zone?.  Since the petitioner was intending to put up
plant / factory in the said property,  the land in question was required to
be reclassified from ?mixed residential zone? to that of ?Controlled
Industrial Zone? and the competent authority, who is empowered to reclassify
the land, forwarded the same to the first respondent.  It  appears that an
application was made by the petitioner on 25.11.2010 for the change of land
use by changing its classification to ?Controlled Industrial Zone? along with
the necessary documents, fee, etc., to the third respondent which was
required to be forwarded to the first respondent for appropriate order.  On
receipt of the petitioner's application for change of land use by the third
respondent, the fourth respondent issued a notification in English and Tamil
Newspapers on the direction of the third respondent inviting objections and
suggestions for the proposed variation of the land use.  According to the
petitioner, no objection or suggestion was received in response to the
notification.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.The third respondent, however, wanted some more details from the
petitioner in respect of the application for change of land use and according
to the petitioner, the same was duly complied with by the respondent on
28.02.2011.  In the meanwhile, the petitioner as per the averment in the
affidavit have obtained the following documents as enumerated therein.
</p><p id="p_5">        ?a) ?No Objection? Certificate from the Fire Service Department, which
was dated 03.11.2010.

No.209. 
</p><p id="p_18">        n) The petitioner's industry has been classified as an ?Orange?
industry by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.  The petitioner applied
to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board for necessary approvals and
obtained the necessary consents for the operation of its new plant under
<a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_4">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and for
discharge of sewage under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_6">Section 25</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_19">        o) All requirements in respect of registration with the Tamil Nadu
Commercial Taxes Department and the Central Excise Department were done and    
the certificates were obtained by the petitioner from the said Departments.?
</p>        

<p id="p_20">        5.Since the petitioner's company was involved in the business of
bottling of  soft drink, mineral water, drinking water etc., in order to
facilitate their business, they entered into an agreement for ground water
utilization with the Executive Engineer, Public Works Department, Ground
Water Division, Trichy, on 12.11.2010 and the petitioner was permitted to
draw 1.50 lakh liters of ground water per day from three bore wells.
Subsequently, the permit for drawal of water was enhanced by a revised
agreement dated 19.07.2011 permitting the petitioner company to draw 2.40
Lakh liters per day, after taking into account the hydro-geological status of
the area.  Thereafter, the petitioner was also permitted to have  six bore
wells by the competent authority with increased drawal of water.
</p>
<p id="p_21">        6.In the above said circumstances, the petitioner had commenced their
operation of the plant in May 2011.  Except an order for change of land use,
all other required licenses and clearances had been obtained by the
petitioner and also due to the fact that they have not received any
suggestion or objection to the public notification and all the documents
required for the change of land use had been submitted by them, they were
under the impression that in a matter of course, their application would be
favourably considered.  According to the petitioner, they had employed about
150 persons both directly and indirectly from the local villages and invested
huge amount of money for the establishment of the plant / factory and post
operation of the plant / factory.  According to the petitioner, the Pollution
Control Board also has been taking samples of the water periodically and
there was no complaint of any harmful discharge of any chemical prohibited or
declared as hazardous by any authority concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_22">        7.All the while, according to the petitioner, their application for
conversion of land was under process with the first respondent. While matter
stood thus, there was a complaint from the Suriyur Village Panchayat Union in
2012 pertaining to the petitioner's drawal of water from the bore wells.  The
complaint is on the basis of the apprehension on the part of some of the
villagers that the drawal of the water for bottling Unit of the petitioner
company would deplete the ground water sources. In order to avoid unnecessary
confrontation between villagers and the petitioner company, a peace committee
meeting was held wherein, the Revenue Divisional Officer, Trichy, Block
Development Officer, Tiruverumbur, members of the public, representatives of
the petitioner etc. participated.  After the outcome of the meeting, the
petitioner agreed not to draw water from three of its six bore-wells.  While
so, the fifth respondent vide proceedings in Na.Ka.No.533.2013 dated
25.04.2013 ordered closure of petitioner company on the ground that the same
was being run without any approval. According to the said proceedings, the
factory lands were agricultural lands and as the petitioner was drawing water
from the bore-wells, agricultural operations were being affected.  The fifth
respondent invoked the provisions of Section 159 of the T.N Panchayats Act,
1994, for passing closure order.  It appears that the order has been
challenged by the petitioner in W.P(MD)No.4498 of 2014 and the an order of
interim stay was granted by this Court and the writ petition is still pending
for final consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_23">        8.The petitioner having obtained all required licenses and clearances
from the competent authorities but was not allowed to operate the
plant/factory for which the same was established. Inspite of the petitioner
satisfying all the authorities and fulfilment of the norms required for
carrying out their activities as proposed by them, still there was no
decision forthcoming from the competent authority, particularly, the first
respondent about the request of the petitioner for change of land use. In
this connection, the petitioner pointed out that the land in question is only
Mixed Residential Zone and there was no agricultural activities happening in
and around the area and therefore, there would not be any impediment for
considering the request of the petitioner for change of land use as it would
benefit 700 local villagers directly and indirectly in the matter of
providing employment to them.  After passage of considerable time, the third
respondent herein appears to have returned the petitioner's application by
proceedings dated 13.05.2014 on the basis of objections from the fifth
respondent as well as complaints from the general public of the area.
Therefore, the petitioner was constrained to challenge the said proceedings
in W.P(MD)No.9632 of 2014.  This Court, by an order dated 19.06.2014,
directed the petitioner to resubmit its application to the third respondent.
The third respondent was directed to forward the application to the first
respondent along with the objections received by him.  Thereafter, the third
respondent then directed to consider the same after affording opportunity of
hearing to the 6th respondent and pass appropriate orders thereon.      
</p>
<p id="p_24">        9.While matters are pending consideration before the competent
authority, on 28.01.2015 the Revenue Officials came to the factory and sealed
the factory without any notice to the petitioner.  This action by the revenue
officials, according to the petitioner, was invalid in view of the permission
granted by the competent authority, namely, Chief Engineer, Public Works
Department, for drawal of ground water in the subject land and ?No Objection
Certificate? issued by the authority was valid till 22.06.2015.  In the said
circumstances, the petitioner was once again  constrained to file
W.P(MD)No.1156 of 2015 seeking a direction to remove the seal from the bore-
wells and the said writ petition is still pending.  Simultaneously,  a notice
was issued by the Block Development Officer to the petitioner on 28.01.2015
under the provisions of Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act calling for the explanation
from the petitioner as to why action should not be initiated against the
petitioner factory as the same was functioning without permission.  This was
also challenged by the petitioner by filing W.P(MD)No.1334 of 2015.  This
Court, by an order dated 05.12.2015 was pleased to record the undertaking
given on behalf of the Block Development Officer, Thiruverambur, that he will
not proceed further till the disposal of W.P(MD)Nos.1156 and 1334 of 2015.
Both the writ petitions are pending.
</p><p id="p_25">        10.According to the petitioner, some vested interest from the local
villagers had been continuously interfering with the operational activities
of the factory and therefore, the petitioner was forced to approached this
Court by way of Crl.O.P(MD)No.2956 of 2015 and this Court, by an order dated
31.03.2015, granted police protection for running the petitioner's factory.
However, the operation of the factory could not be resumed in view of the
continued opposition from the 5th and 6th respondents, as averred by the
petitioner.
</p><p id="p_26">        11.As stated supra, the petitioner had earlier approached this Court in
W.P(MD)No.9632 of 2014 wherein, an order was passed by this Court on  
19.06.2014, directing the authorities concerned to pass orders on the re-
submission of the application by the petitioner, which was not complied with.
Therefore, a contempt petition in Cont.P(MD)No.502 of 2016 was filed and the
same directed to be listed on 01.07.2016.  Immediately before the contempt
application could be taken up for hearing on 01.07.2016, an order was passed
on 30.06.2016 in G.O(2D)No.91 rejecting the petitioner's application for land
conversion.  The said order is impugned in the present writ petition.
</p>        
<p id="p_27">        12.Having aggrieved by the impugned order passed by the first
respondent in G.O(2D)No.91, dated 30.06.2016, the petitioner is before this
Court assailing the same on several grounds that were enumerated in the
affidavit filed in support of the writ petition.
</p>        
<p id="p_28">        13.A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the first
respondent, dated 31.01.2017, resisting the writ petition filed by the
petitioner herein.
</p>
        
<p id="p_29">        14.When the matter was taken up for hearing, Mr.P.S.Raman, learned 
Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that he would give
up the 6th respondent as she is not a necessary party and she was no more an 
office bearer of the Panchayat Union.  In view of the submission, this Court
granted permission giving up the 6th respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_30">        15.On behalf of the petitioner, the learned Senior Counsel had also
submitted and filed an affidavit of undertaking that they would not draw
water from the subject lands and they would find alternative source of water
by other means.  The said affidavit of undertaking is taken on record.  Since
according to the learned senior counsel, the entire bone of contention is
only on the issue of drawal of water from the subject land which is going to
affect the so called agricultural operation of the nearby villages, in view
of the undertaking they would not be any further oppositions for operating
the plant.
</p>
<p id="p_31">        16.The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner would
further submit that the impugned order rejecting the request for change of
land use was primarily and principally on the basis that there was complaint
from the public and any consideration of the petitioner's request for change
of land use may lead to law and order situation and therefore, their
application cannot be considered in their favour.  Such conclusion by the
first respondent, according to the learned Senior Counsel, cannot be valid in
the eye of law, as these issues are extraneous and it cannot be the basis for
taking a decision in regard to the request of the petitioner for land
conversion for their legitimate business activity.  According to the learned
Senior Counsel, the application ought to have been considered within the
framework of relevant rules and regulations and the decision cannot be
coloured by such consideration of so called public opinion or their needless
intervention and their motivated complaints at the instance of some vested
interest.       
</p><p id="p_32">        17.The learned Senior Counsel appearing would therefore, submit that
the impugned rejection by the first respondent cannot be countenanced both on
law and facts as there was no proper consideration on the basis of the rules
and records that governed the situation.  Be that as it may, one Suriyur
Vivasayigal Pathukappu Sangam, which is a registered as society under the
Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1974, has filed an impleading petition
for impleading themselves the writ proceedings.  According to the said
sangam, the petitioner cannot be allowed to establish their factory in the
subject land as it would seriously affect the agricultural activities of
Suriyur village.  According to the proposed impleading party, the factory has
been running without proper approval and conversion of land use and such
illegal existence cannot be given any seal of approval.  They have also
averred that the village people are suffering due to acute water scarcity and
in such situation, the petitioner factory cannot be allowed to carry on its
operation and their main operation would depend on the availability of water
and sourcing of water in the land under their occupation.
</p><p id="p_33">        18.According to the counter affidavit filed by the first respondent,
without obtaining proper permission from the competent authority, the
petitioner had started the factory operation and Government considered the
request made by the petitioner with reference to the objection raised by the
public and the local body and passed final orders by proceedings dated
30.06.2016.  From the entirety of the averment in the counter affidavit filed
on behalf of the first respondent, it appears that the first respondent has
considered the objections from the public and the objections from the public
is primarily and principally ended in the decision against the petitioner
holding that agricultural activities of the villagers would be affected.  The
tenor of the impugned order dated 30.06.2016 and the counter affidavit would
show that  there was little application of mind on the part of the first
respondent while discharging his statutory.  The application filed by the
petitioner has not been considered with reference to the rules and
regulations governing the subject matter and de hors the same, the request of
the petitioner company has been considered only on the basis of public
perception and complaints without any critical examination whether such
public perception / complaint was well informed or well intention or
legitimate or otherwise.  Such summary disposal of the request by the
petitioner before the first respondent tantamount to abdication of the
statutory power vested in the authority and subordinating such power to
public measure and tactics which does not advance to rule of law, which alone
must govern the situation on hand.  Of course, this Court is conscious of the
fact that the public interest is paramount while considering any individual
request, but at the same time the rules of governance cannot be allowed to be
stifled or violated and the decision of the statutory authority cannot be
governed by mere objections from the public on the basis of street sentiments
who may driven by vested interest or camouflaged as public interest, beneath
lie a personal agenda of some pressure groups.
