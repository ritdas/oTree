THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
11.10.2018, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:

                                ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            This application is filed under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section 438</a> of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">     2.     The applicant herein is the accused in Crime No.104 of

2018 registered at the Kolathur Police Station.      In the aforesaid

Crime, he is accused of having committed offence punishable under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> BA:6534/18                            2</span>

43 of the Kerala Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control) Pollution Act</a>.



</p><p id="p_4">      3.     The applicant herein is a disabled man.    He is running a

chicken farm for the past several years. Prosecution allegation is that on

14.05.2018, the employees of the applicant herein dumped chicken

waste at Paravakkal in Kadungapuram and polluted the water source

causing danger to public health.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">      4.     The learned counsel appearing for the applicant referred to

Annexure A2 and submitted that the applicant is a person affected by

polio and is having 60 % disability. The waste was dumped by his

contract workers and it was without his knowledge or connivance. The

learned counsel submits that the accused Nos.1 to 3 have already been

released on bail by the jurisdictional court.



</p><p id="p_7">      5.     The learned Public Prosecutor has strenuously opposed the

prayer. It is submitted that the applicant herein is the proprietor of the

farm and the investigation conducted till date reveals that the applicant

herein had a major role to play. Crime No.98 of 2018 of the Kolathur

Police Station has also been registered on 14.5.2018 wherein the

allegations are identical.   He is a repeat offender and no sympathy is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> BA:6534/18                              3</span>




called for is the submission.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">      6.       I have considered the submissions advanced and have gone

through the materials made available.       Having regard to the facts and

circumstances, I am not persuaded to grant an order of pre arrest bail to

the applicant. However, taking note of the fact that the accused Nos.1

to 3 have already been released on bail and the applicant is a disabled

man, I am of the view that the applicant can be directed to surrender

before investigating officer within 10 days from 15.10.2018. He shall be

thoroughly interrogated and shall thereafter be produced before the

court having jurisdiction where he may seek regular bail. If an

application for bail is preferred with advance notice to the learned

Prosecutor, the same shall be considered and orders shall be passed

expeditiously and on its merits ideally on the same day itself.
