                           JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">Surendra Mohan, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          The petitioner in W.P.(C) No. 15311 of 2009 is in

appeal challenging the judgment dated 20.10.2009 of the

learned Single Judge dismissing the writ petition.

</p><p id="p_3">          2.    The appellant is a Government of India

undertaking and a unit of the Indian Rare Earths       Limited

engaged in activities like beach sand mining, mineral

separation and processing. The Company has an industrial

unit at Udyogamandal.      It is engaged in the extraction of

Uranium from Thorium concentrate. It has been functioning

for the past five decades. The activities of the appellant unit

are regulated by the <a href="/doc/715059/" id="a_1">Atomic Energy Act</a>, 1962 ( '<a href="/doc/715059/" id="a_2">Atomic Energy

Act</a>' for short). The industrial wastes generated in the factory

W.A.2884/2009.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span><p id="p_4">

are radioactive wastes coming within the purview of the

<a href="/doc/715059/" id="a_3">Atomic Energy Act</a>.     Therefore,    it is contended that, the

Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling and Transboundary

Movement) Rules, 2008 (hereinafter referred to as 'HW Rules')

do not govern the manner of disposal of such wastes. For

disposal of the wastes generated by the unit of the appellant,

they have the necessary authorization from the Atomic Energy

Regulatory Board.    For the purpose, they have established

disposal sites within their premises in terms of the licence

and plan approved by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board.

</p><p id="p_5">            3. While so, as per an order passed by the Supreme

Court in W.P.(C) No.657 of 1995, a Committee called        the

Supreme Court Monitoring Committee on Hazardous Wastes

('Monitoring Committee' for short) was constituted for the

purpose of ensuring that the directions issued by the Supreme

Court from time to time in the said writ petition were

implemented effectively and in a timely manner.            The

W.A.2884/2009.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               3</span><p id="p_6">

Monitoring Committee was given the liberty to co-opt a

representative of the State Government or the State Pollution

Control Board or any other person or authority as member of

the said Committee, as deemed fit.            The Monitoring

Committee was to file quarterly reports before the Apex Court.

The order appointing the Monitoring Committee is evidenced

in these proceedings by Ext.P2.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            4.  Pursuant to Ext.P2 order, the Monitoring

Committee conducted a number of visits to the State of Kerala,

inspected various localities and submitted reports to the

Court, as evidenced by Exts. P3, P4 and P5. The Monitoring

Committee assessed the situation in Eloor, Udyogamandal and

surrounding areas where large number of industries are

located and assessed the gravity of the pollution that the

residents were put to suffer. The Monitoring Committee noted

the disastrous condition of the Periyar River which is the life

line of Kerala. It was found that the river had been converted

W.A.2884/2009.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               4</span><p id="p_8">

into a vast Treatment Storage and Disposal Facility (TSDF). The

Committee also found that the pollution was caused to a great

extent by the activities of Government owned companies as

well.   The Regulatory Agencies like Kerala State Pollution

Control Board and State officials were found to be adopting a

willful and callous disregard to the directions of the Supreme

Court. Therefore, the Monitoring Committee issued directions

in Ext.P3 with the object of remedying the situation.

</p><p id="p_9">            5. As part of implementation of the said directions,

a Scheme to supply potable water to the residents of the

industrial area was proposed to be implemented.             The

Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Limited (FACT) agreed to

make available the required quantity of water for supply

through pipelines.     The cost for laying the pipelines was

ordered to be shared by the industries in the area.

Accordingly, the appellant paid an amount of Rs.35 Lakhs,

recognizing    its  Corporate   Social   Responsibility  (CSR).

W.A.2884/2009.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               5</span><p id="p_10">

However,      according to them, they were not polluting the

Periyar River in any manner and were not liable to pay any

recurring charges for the supply of drinking water. In view of

the above stand taken by the appellant, the 2nd respondent

Board, by a notice dated 27.4.2009 required them to show

cause why the authorization issued to them under the HW

Rules should not be amended by including a condition therein

making it mandatory for the Company to remit 1/4th of the

monthly recurring charges for the supply of drinking water.

The copy of the said notice is Ext.P8. The appellant objected

to the same by submitting Ext.P9.      Thereafter, a personal

hearing was conducted and by Ext.P10, they were directed to

make the payments.        Ext.P10 was followed by Ext. P11

pointing out that there were mistakes     with respect to the

recording of the minutes. Subsequently, a meeting with the

Minister for Health, State of Kerala was held on 18.5.2009

which was attended by the representatives of the appellant.

W.A.2884/2009.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                6</span><p id="p_11">

Thereafter, by Ext.P12 proceedings dated 29.5.2009 the

appellant was directed to pay Rs.1.25 Lakhs per month as their

share of the recurring charges for the Eloor Drinking Water

Supply Scheme. It was challenging Ext.P12 that the appellant

had filed the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_12">            6. According to the appellant, the industrial wastes

generated by it come within the general definition of

radioactive wastes under the <a href="/doc/715059/" id="a_4">Atomic Energy Act</a>. Such wastes

have been specifically excluded from the purview of the HW

Rules.    The Monitoring Committee was constituted for the

purpose of monitoring the discharge of wastes under the HW

Rules. Therefore, the Monitoring Committee has no authority

to initiate any action in relation to the wastes discharged by

the appellant. The proceedings Ext.P12 were issued by the 2nd

respondent in compliance with the order issued by the

Monitoring Committee. Therefore, this is a clear case of the

statutory authority, acting under dictation and without any

W.A.2884/2009.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               7</span><p id="p_13">

application of mind. The Monitoring Committee had no power

to issue the said direction to the 2nd respondent.       The 2nd

respondent has no power to compel the appellant to bear the

costs of establishing the water supply system and the

recurring charges for supply of water to the local residents.

Therefore, they sought for the issue of appropriate orders,

quashing Ext.P12.
</p>
<p id="p_14">            7.  The writ petition was contested by the

respondents.    A counter affidavit was filed by the 2nd

respondent refuting the contentions of the writ petitioner and

producing Exts.R2(a) to R2(n) documents in support of their

contentions.   According   to    the   2nd   respondent,     the

Udyogamandal - Eloor area is an industrial belt with a large

number of industrial units concentrated on the banks of river

Periyar, engaged in multifarious industrial activities.      The

industries have been functioning for a number of years. They

have been discharging their effluents into the river for the past

W.A.2884/2009.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                8</span><p id="p_15">

many years.      The acute pollution in the area as well as

contamination of the river Periyar is the combined effect of the

activities carried on by the various industrial units located

there. Only an exhaustive scientific study conducted over a

number of years would be able to pin-point the extent of

pollution that could be attributed to each industrial unit.

Further scientific data would be necessary to connect the

source of each pollutant to a particular industrial unit. As held

by the Apex Court, in the absence of such authentic scientific

data, the 'polluter pays' principle would justify casting of the

financial burden for averting the pollution, on all the industrial

units located in the area. As part of the clean up operation of

river Periyar, attempts are being made to reverse the effects of

pollution by regulating the activities of the industrial units.

The local residents of the locality have been deprived of their

perennial source of drinking water by the acute pollution. It

was therefore that a scheme for supply of clean drinking water

W.A.2884/2009.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               9</span><p id="p_16">

to the residents was proposed to be implemented by the 2nd

respondent with the co-operation of the Kerala Water

Authority and the industrial units involved.   The four major

chemical industries which includes the appellant were

requested to share the charges for laying the pipes carrying

drinking water.   The FACT had offered to supply drinking

water at a highly subsidized rate.     However, there was no

means of meeting the recurring charges for such supply of

water. It was the said recurring charges, that the industries

located in each locality were ordered to share. Thus recurring

charges for the supply of drinking water to Panchayat Wards

that are affected by the existence of the four major industries

were directed to be borne by the said industries including the

appellant. Accordingly, the appellant has been paying the said

amount, on a monthly basis. The Monitoring Committee has

in its report, Ext.P5 found that, the contamination of

Kuzhikandam Thodu and nearby areas was caused by effluents

W.A.2884/2009.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                               10</span><p id="p_17">

from the FACT, IRE (appellant), HIL and Merchem. Therefore,

the cost of clean up would have to be recovered from them.

The said finding has not been challenged by the appellant. It

was as part of implementation of the directions of the

Monitoring Committee to clean up the river that the impugned

order Ext.P5 has also been issued. The contention that, the

appellant does not discharge any effluents to Kuzhikandam

Thodu was disputed. According to the 2nd respondent, the

appellant discharges effluents to the Periyar River.    Waste

water from their Unit flows into the Kuzhikandam Thodu.

Since the same is discharged into the midstream of Periyar as

per the permission obtained by them years back, it is also not

possible to monitor the discharge, it was contended. It was

also contended that since the Monitoring Committee was

appointed by the Supreme Court, only the said court could

entertain a challenge against the action of the said Committee.

W.A.2884/2009.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                 11</span><p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">            8. The 3rd respondent, a local resident and activist

who got himself impleaded also contested the writ petition.

According to him, the pollution in the area was insufferable.

In view of the precautionary principle, the action of the 2nd

respondent was absolutely within its powers and fully justified

in the factual scenario obtaining in the locality. In view of the

acute pollution that is being caused, it is necessary that the

consent conditions with respect to the appellant's unit was

modified to insist on more stringent standards.         The total

pollution of the river Periyar and its surrounding areas is

attributable to the activities of the industries located there. In

view of the present permission to discharge effluents into the

midstream of the river, monitoring is difficult and for the said

reason, the condition is required to be suitably altered.

Therefore, it was contended that the writ petition was only to

be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_20">W.A.2884/2009.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                 12</span><p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">            9.   The learned Single Judge considered the

respective contentions, took note of the deleterious effects of

pollution in the locality, found that the prevailing scenario was

attributable to the activities of the industries located there and

held that, fastening of the liability to pay the recurring charges

for supply of drinking water to the residents was justified.

Therefore, according to the learned Single Judge, there was

nothing unjust in mulcting the appellant and other industries

with the liability for the recurring charges. Accordingly, the

writ petition has been dismissed. It is the said judgment that

is under challenge in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_23">            10.   According to the learned Senior Counsel

Sri. E.K.Nandakumar and Adv. Paulose Abraham, who appear

for  the    appellant,  the    judgment    appealed    against  is

unsustainable and liable to be set aside. The writ petition was

filed challenging Ext.P12 issued by the 2nd respondent. It is

contended that the 2nd respondent had no statutory power to

issue Ext.P12. No authority has found that the appellant's

industrial unit was a polluter. There is no finding in Ext.P12

regarding the violation of any order or condition imposed by

the 2nd respondent.     In the absence of any allegation of

infraction of any order, direction or statutory provision, it is

contended that, the appellant ought not to have been saddled

with a liability to pay the recurring charges for supply of

drinking water to the local residents. Referring to Ext.P12, it is

pointed out that the said order has been passed on the basis

of a direction issued by the Monitoring Committee. Therefore,

this is a clear case of the statutory authority acting under

dictation, it is contended. The initial demand for sharing the

infrastructural cost was accepted by the appellant recognizing

their Corporate Social Responsibility.    However, by Ext.P12

the recurring costs for supply of drinking water has also been

imposed on them.       Though the charges were demanded

initially only for a period of two years, the payments are

appellants cannot be compelled to continue the payments

indefinitely. The counsel also places reliance on decisions of

the Apex Court to support his contentions.
</p>
<p id="p_26">            11.  Adv. T. Navin, who appears for the 2nd

respondent, points out on the other hand that rehabilitation of

the residents affected by the pollution has been directed by

the Supreme Court in Ext.P2 order. The Monitoring Committee

had visited the area in August, 2004. Water supply to the

affected communities had been ordered by the Committee in

Ext.P3. In Ext. P5 report also, the Monitoring Committee has

directed recovery from the four industrial units including the

appellant. According to the learned counsel, just because the

radio active wastes generated by the Company are covered by

the <a href="/doc/715059/" id="a_5">Atomic Energy Act</a>, a conclusion that they are not

discharging any other hazardous wastes does not follow. It

also does not follow that their effluents do not contain

hazardous substances. Reliance is placed on Annexure R2(a)

consent, Clauses 3.2 and 3.3 in particular, to contend that

their effluents contain hazardous wastes.        Therefore, the

counsel seeks dismissal of the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_28">            12. Adv. Daisy A. Philipose, who appears for the 3rd

respondent, supports the contentions of the 2nd respondent.

According to the counsel, the residents of the locality are

leading a life full of misery because of the rampant pollution

caused by the industries located in the area. Their lives have

been rendered miserable by various ailments that plague them

constantly.    It is contended that, a vast majority of the

population is afflicted with diseases like Bronchitis, Bronchial

Asthma and Cancer. The incidence of Blood Cancer in the area

has been on the rise over the past three decades.          In the

absence of authentic scientific study, it is not possible to pin-

point the responsibility for the deleterious effects on any

industry in particular.   Their source of drinking water, the

Periyar   River, has   been   contaminated    with  hazardous

chemicals and pollutants. The seepage of industrial wastes

has contaminated the soil as well as the wells and the sources

of ground water. The flora and fauna of the area are also

adversely affected. In such a precarious situation, the project

to supply clean drinking water to them is only a small welfare

measure that the authorities have been persuaded to

undertake.    The pollution in the area is attributable to the

combined activities of the industries located there. Therefore,

it is contended that the appellant cannot shirk the

responsibility for the pollution that is caused.   The learned

Single Judge has, for the above reasons, found the impugned

action to be justified. There are no grounds to interfere with

the same, according to the learned counsel.

According to the first respondent, the Government has not

granted permission to any of the industries in the Eloor -

Edayar industrial area, particularly to the appellant herein, to

discharge effluents from their factories into the Periyar river.

The industrial department has also not given any such

permission. The power to regulate all matters relating to the

discharge of solid, liquid and gaseous wastes as well as noise

is vested in the 2nd respondent. The 2nd respondent has issued

Monitoring Committee on its visit to Kerala on 14.8.2004. The

Committee found that the authorities in Kerala had allowed

several industrial units to operate without authorization and

that hazardous wastes were being discharged into the

environment callously, by most of the industries concerned.

The Committee has noted with distress, the deplorable

condition of the Periyar River, the lifeline of Kerala. According

to the Monitoring Committee, the Periyar River has been

converted into a vast, illegal Treatment, Storage and Disposal

Facility (TSDF) for hazardous wastes that were being

discharged into it by the industries located in the area. The

Monitoring    Committee    has   in    Ext.P3   therefore  issued

directions for restoring the water quality of Periyar River by

adopting the various measures that are set out in the report.

industrial units. In the report of its second visit on October

13th and 14th, 2004, evidenced herein by Ext.P4, the

Committee found that the LAEC had stopped functioning and

therefore it was directed to be reconstituted. In Ext.P4 also,

the Monitoring Committee has noticed that the Periyar River

bed had been turned into an illegal hazardous waste dump by

various industries in the area with the full knowledge and

acquiescence of the 2nd respondent. Therefore, the LAEC was

directed to function in addition to the controls exercised by

with the object of ensuring an effective implementation,

<p id="p_43">alarming situation that the Monitoring Committee was directed

to submit quarterly reports to the Apex Court itself, with a

direction that no authority in the country shall entertain a

challenge against any action of the Monitoring Committee.

The Monitoring Committee was therefore not a mere fact

finding body constituted by the Apex Court for ascertaining

the factual scenario with respect to pollution. On the contrary,

it was intended to effectuate and implement the control

measures with the object of controlling the menace of

pollution, effectively. Rehabilitation of the affected populace

was also an aspect that was covered by Ext.P2 as well as

Ext.R2(n) orders. Therefore, the contention that the Monitoring

Committee had exceeded its authority in directing the

Pollution Control Board to implement the project of supplying

drinking water to the affected people, cannot be accepted. In

we are also not in a position to entertain the challenge against

The above contention also has to fail for the reason that it is

in such a situation, that the precautionary principle is

applicable. The above principle has found acceptance with the

Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_6">Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum v. Union of

responsibility on a particular industry should not deter the

authorities from taking action to remedy the damage that is

caused to the environment. This is for the reason that to wait

for authentic data may in many cases lead to disaster and

catastrophe. The combined pollution in a particular area is

therefore taken to be the result of the activities of industries

that are located in the area. They, being responsible for the

resultant situation, are liable not only to restore the quality of

the environment, but also to rehabilitate and compensate the

victims of their deleterious activities. In the present case, it is

worth noticing here that the industries in the Eloor-

Udyogamandal-Edayar area, have been functioning for the

past many decades causing adverse effects on the quality of

air, water, soil and the water sources. To permit them to shirk

responsibility for the damage on the ground that there is no

scientific data tracing the pollution to them or connecting

their activity and establishing a link between them and the

pollution, would make regulation, control and mitigation of

pollution, impossible.    Any such course would also permit

them to carry on their activities without being subjected to any

sort of regulation. Therefore, the contention that they have

not been found to have violated any statute, order, condition

etc, is held to be not of any significance in the context of the

action initiated by Ext.P12. The appellant has a further

contention that this is a case of the 2nd respondent, the

statutory authority, acting under dictation. We do not find any

substance in the said contention for the reason that, the

Monitoring    Committee,    as   already  found   by us,    was

constituted for ensuring proper implementation of the control

measures against pollution. The Supreme Court has directed

them to function in accordance with the stipulations contained

in Ext.P2 order. If any such stipulation has been violated as

Apex Court with such complaint. We are not satisfied that the

action taken pursuant to the direction of the Monitoring

Committee could be described as "acting under dictation".

Apex Court in Ext.P2 was only concerned with          hazardous

wastes coming within the scope of HW Rules. The radioactive

wastes generated by the appellant being exempt under the

said Rules, do not come within the scope of the authority of

the Monitoring Committee. According to the appellant, they

have obtained Ext.P1, authorization under the <a href="/doc/715059/" id="a_21">Atomic Energy

Act</a>.   Therefore, there is no justification for the liability

imposed on them by Ext.P12.        As already noticed above,

Annexure R2(a) is a copy of the consent issued to the

appellant by the 2nd respondent. A perusal of the said consent

shows that apart from radioactive wastes, the appellant was

also generating hazardous wastes. The quality of the treated

effluents shows the presence of a number of hazardous

wastes.    According to the counter affidavit filed by the 2nd

respondent, the storm water from the appellant's unit is

discharged directly into the river Periyar, which also contains

hazardous wastes.      Therefore, the appellant cannot be

permitted to shirk their responsibility for the pollution of the

Periyar river.  According to the counter affidavit of the 2nd

respondent, the appellant is storing the effluent treatment

plant sludge in unlined trenches in an area where the water

table is high.     Therefore, the chances of seepage of

contaminated water into the surface water, sub-surface water

and ground water is also high. In view of the above, according

to the 2nd respondent, the appellant has been identified as one

of the contributors to the combined pollution in the area. For

the above reason, the said contention of the appellant also has

to fail.

rehabilitate the affected communities as well as to provide

them with recompense for the damage caused was also part of

the directions contained in Ext.P2 order of the Apex Court.

The appellant has already contributed their share of the costs

of infrastructure for providing drinking water to the affected

areas. According to the 2nd respondent, since various Wards of

the Panchayat are affected, the industrial units located in

proximity to the affected Wards alone have been made liable

for the cost of supply of drinking water to the said locality.

Thus, the appellant and the other three industrial units have

been made liable for the recurring charges in respect of some

Wards alone. Other industries in the area have been similarly

made liable for supply of drinking water to the          Wards

surrounding their units.   Therefore, the allegation that the

appellant has been singled out as per Ext.P12 cannot be

discharge any effluents into the Kuzhikandam Thodu also

cannot be accepted for the reason that their storm water is

discharged into the said Thodu. Yet another contention is put

forward that, though initially    they were asked to bear the

recurring charges only for a period of two years, they have

been paying such charges continuously now for the past many

years. According to them, during the period from 2009 to

2017, they have paid a total amount of more than a Crore

rupees.     The payments cannot be permitted to continue

indefinitely, it is contended. In view of the above, according to

the learned counsel, it is necessary to issue directions limiting

such payments to some specific period.

the above contention, we are not satisfied that any specified

time limit could be stipulated, restricting such payments. This

is for the reason that, going by the reports, the water sources

in the area have been contaminated, the wells, ponds and the

deprived of all its natural water resources. They have been

deprived of their water sources, as a result of the industrial

activity in the area. The industries have been functioning for

the past many decades. They are continuing to function to

this date. The need of the community for potable drinking

water is only legitimate. Therefore, it is necessary that they

are supplied with potable drinking water, without any

disruption. The industries are carrying on their activities. The

appellant's unit has also been working throughout. Therefore,

there is no justification for the contention that they shall not

be directed to continue the payments. It shall of course be

open to the 2nd respondent or the Monitoring Committee to

review the situation and to modify the directions in Ext.P12

suitably, should there be any need for so doing.        There is

absolutely no evidence or material before us to justify a

conclusion that there has been an improvement in the quality

modification of the said directions.   We, therefore, find no

infirmity in Ext.P12 or the judgment of the learned Single

Judge, warranting an interference therewith.
