                                   JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">       The case set up in the W.P.(c.) is as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_2">       Ext.P1 is the copy of the consent issued by the 2 nd respondent for the

Establishment of petroleum outlet. Having found that the seepage from the

petrol tanks has an adverse effect on nearby groundwater and wells, the

National Green Tribunal appointed a Committee. Based on the Committee

report, the Central Pollution Control Board issued guidelines stipulating a

safe distance of 50 meters for the establishment of petrol pumps. Ext.P2 is

the copy of circular issued by the 1 st respondent, Kerala State Pollution

Control Board with regard to the same. The petitioner is residing within

50 meters from the said site. The petitioner made a representation

pointing out the above and requested the respondents 1 and 2 not to issue

consent to operate the same, in these circumstances. Hasty steps are being

taken to issue consent to operate without considering Exhibit.P2 circular

and Exhibit.P3.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       2.     It is in the light of these averments and ontentions that the

petitioner has filed the instant W.P.(C.) with the following prayers:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      i.     "To issue a writ, direction or order in the nature of mandamus or such
      other appropriate writ, direction or order commanding the respondents 1 and 2
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> WP(C).No.7167 OF 2020(U)                           3</span>


      not to issue consent to operate as contemplate by the Water (Prevention and
      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
      1981 to the petroleum outlet to which consent to establish was granted as per
      Exhibit.P.1;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      ii.      ii. To issue a writ, direction or order in the nature of mandamus directing
      the 1st respondent to consider Exhibit.P.4 representation within a reasonable time
      and till such time no consent to establish to be granted to the 3 rd respondent for
      the operation of petroleum outlet to which consent to establish was granted as per
      Exhibit P.1;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      iii.     iii. Such other relief's which this Hon'ble Court deems fit and necessary in
      the circumstances of the case and the costs of this case."</blockquote><p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">       3.     Heard Sri. P.B.Sahasranaman, learned counsel appearing for

the petitioner, Sri.T.Naveen, learned standing counsel appearing for the

Kerala State Pollution control Board, respondent Nos. 1 and 2. In the

nature of the orders proposed to be passed in this petition, the notice to

respondent No.3 will stand disposed with.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       4.     Taking note of the facts and circumstances of this case, it is

ordered that the 2nd respondent-Environment Engineer of the Kerala State

Pollution control Board will take the matters raised in Ext.P4

representation/complaint for consideration, without much delay, after

affording reasonable opportunity of being heard to the petitioner and 3 rd

respondent, will pass appropriate orders thereon, in accordance with the

law, without much delay, within a period of one month from the date of

production of a certified copy of this judgment.

</p><p id="p_7">       5.     It is made clear that in case the application submitted by the 3 rd

respondent for the statutory consent to operate the petroleum outlet is

pending consideration before the 2nd respondent, the 2nd respondent may

ensure that an appropriate inspection may be conducted with due prior
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> WP(C).No.7167 OF 2020(U)                 4</span>


notice to the 3rd respondent and thereafter, may ensure that copy of the

inspection report is given to the petitioner and the 3 rd respondent and

appropriate decision may be taken in accordance with the law, by the 2 nd

respondent on both the matters raised by the 3 rd respondent in this

application for securing consent to operate the unit as well as the

objections raised by the petitioner in Ext.P4 complaint, after granting

reasonable opportunity of being heard to both sides as stated hereinabove.

</p><p id="p_8">       6.     The Registry will forward a copy of this judgment to the 3 rd

respondent for necessary information, at the cost of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_9">       With these observations and directions, the above W.P.(C.) will stand

disposed of.
