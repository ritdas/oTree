      JUSTICE DR. P. JYOTHIMANI (JUDICIAL MEMBER)


</p><p id="p_2">1.    The applicant who is stated to be a public spirited person ,has filed the
      present application,praying for a declaration that the changing of
      natural flow and course of Baitarani River by respondents 4 to 6 is
      illegal with a further direction to the State Govt. to ensure that the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                              3</span>
     natural flow of water in the above-said river is not obstructed by       any
    one including the said respondents. That apart ,he has also asked for
    setting    aside the letters issued by the 2nd respondent no 4231 dt
    11-02-2009, no.34127 dt 24-12-2009 &amp; no.28834 dt 26-8-2008 in
    favour of respondents 3 to 6 respectively. It is the case of the applicant
    that Baitarani river originates from Guptaganga hills in Keonjhar
    District of Odisha. The Baitarani ,along with Mahanadi and the
    Brahmani forms the Middle        Coastal    Plain.   According    to      the
    applicant,Baitarani is the only robust source of water in the district,
    providing 95% of drainage of the district and the lifeline of the people,
    land and its ecology.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2. It is further the case of the applicant that the water of Baitarani is
    required for various projects like the Kanupur Major Irrigation        roject
    for irrigation of 48000 acres of lands, Anandapur Irrigation Barrage
    to irrigate 150,000 acres of lands in the north   Odisha     coastal areas,
    many minor irrigation projects, domestic water       supplies to 8 urban
    complexes apart from many water-based industries.While so, the 4th
    respondent ,M/S Baitarani River pellets Ltd. proposed to construct 4 .0
    MTPA iron ore beneficiation plant at Tanto village and a tailing dam at
    Nalda in Barbil Tahsil of Keonjhar District. A joint venture agreement
    was   entered with government of Odisha on 15-03-2007.The
    beneficiation plant will be connected by 220 km underground slurry
    pipes to a 4 million tonnes per annum      pellet plant under construction
    at Kalinga Nagar in Jajpur District, where the ore slurry will be balled



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                4</span>
     and fired in to pellets.
</p><p id="p_4">3. Likewise according to the applicant, the 5th respondent (M/S Essar Steel
    Orissa Ltd. with a view to establish customized    steel   plants,    has
    proposed to set up a 10.7 MTPA capacity iron ore beneficiation       plant
    and tailing pond at Dubuna of Joda in Keojhar District.    Likewise ,the
    6th respondent also proposed a pellet plant of 10.00 MTPA at Deojhar of
    District Keonjhar. An MOU is also stated to have been entered with the
    government of Odisha.
</p>

<p id="p_5">4. Similarly , the Respondent 6 , M/S Jindal Steel and Power has proposed
    a Pellet Plant of 10.0 MTPA capacity at Deojhar of Barbil Tahasil in the
    Distrct Keonjhar ,odisha along with a 9.0 MTPA beneficiation
    Plant .MOU for such projects was signed between the Respondent 6 and
    the Government of Odisha on 3.11.2005


</p><p id="p_6">5. It is stated by the applicant that the 2nd respondent has allowed the
    Respondents 4 to 6 to draw water from Baitarani River for their
    plants.By the impugned letter dt11-02-2009,the 4th respondent was
    allowed to draw 4.70 cusecs of water     ,while   respondent   5&amp;6were
    allowed 11.77 &amp; 8.33 cusecs under the impugned     letters dt.24-12-2009
    &amp; 26-08-2008.
</p>

<p id="p_7">6. According to the applicant, the EIA report of the 4th respondent shows
    that the   minimum flow of water in river Baitarani during lean season
    namely,December ,February,March ,April is less than 0.5m3/s ,while



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                            5</span>
     respondent 4 proposes to draw water @ 0.134m3/s for its beneficiaton
    plant and 0.087m3/s for tailing plant for the project.In addition to that,
    water intake well and pumping station are to be provided on the banks
    of the said river and it is transported through 220 km long underground
    slurry pipe line to the beneficiation plant.As per the MOU, the water
    requirement of the 4th respondent is 480 m3/hr(0.134m3/s) as per EIA
    Report. Likewise, in respect of the 5th respondent,as per its EIA Report
    the water requirement is 731m3/hr.i.e 6403560 m3/year. Out of this
    666m3/hr will be sent to Paradeep Beneficiation Plant in the form of
    underground slurry pipeline of 260 km.Again in respect of the 6 th
    respondent as per its EIA Report,the total water requirement of water is
    350kl/hr . According to EIA report of Respondent 6 the average water
    flow in the lean months is around 4.56m3/s where as EIA report of
    Respondent 4 states as 0.5 m3/s.
</p>

<p id="p_8">7. According to the applicant ,the EIA reports of the respondents 4 to 6 are
   not uniform    and contradictory and can not be trusted.Further,as per the
   the EIA Notification of    the Ministry of Environment and Forests dated
   14-09-2006,the projects being treated     under   category    A   of   the
   Schedule , it requires prior Environmental Clearance.    Therefore,    the
   conduct of the respondent no 4&amp;5 in unauthorizedly laying pipe lines in
   the reserve forest is illegal.The said illegal conduct has been deprecated
   by the District Collector who,by his letter dated 04-08-2012,has
   directed the said respondents to stop further laying of pipe lines. The
   applicant also relies upon a study conducted by Arnaud Cauchois and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                            6</span>
         Asian Development Bank on Baitarani River Basin, which has
        estimated dependable flow of water from surface water at 5149.47
million cubic           meters out of which 46% are used for irrigation, drinking
and         industrial purposes and therefore the scarcity of water is bound to
increase and in         such    circumstances         it    is   not   advisable     for   the
        respondents to permit       further release of water to respondents 4 to6.
It is       also the case of the    applicant that even as per the              Odisha State
Water Policy,2007, in           case there is public-private participation in water
resource         development        care will be taken to ensure that the riparian
and         traditional rights of   the      local     communities        are      adequately
protected .He would submit that               the public hearing held on 25-03-2008
at Barbil        has failed to consider       about the riparian rights of the local
        people.It is also the case of         the          applicant that in the public
        hearing ,sufficient number of         people have not participated except 96
        persons and therefore public hearing was only a farce. It is also stated
        that     the Zilla Parishad ,in the meeting held on 01-02-2010 has
        opposed the drawal of       water by         any company from upstream of the
        river.
</p>

<p id="p_9">8. Thus ,the applicant questioned the rights given to the said respondents
        on various grounds including the followings,
        i. that the drawal of such water will affect its natural flow and affect
            the steady supply of water to the villagers
        ii. that the conduct of respondents 4&amp;5 in laying pipelines even before
            grant of permission is illegal



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                                            7</span>
    iii. that by excess drawal of water ,there is a possibility alteration of
       the natural flow of the river water
   iv. that the state government has failed to adhere to its water policy
   v that there was no consultation the        Baitarani RBO for conflict
       resolution
   vi. that the common heritage of the people was ignored and that it
           involves   public interest.
</p>

<p id="p_10">9. Before adverting to the reply by the respondents, it is relevant to note
    that when the matter came up for admission, this Tribunal in the order
    dated 21-11-2012 has recorded the statement of the learned counsel for
    the Applicant, Mr Tripathi     that he is restricting in this case only
    against the 4th respondent,as he has realized that     one application is
    not maintainable against all the respondents 4 to 6 as cause of action are
    different.. Accordingly,in     the said order, the names of respondent no
    5&amp;6 are directed to be deleted. Therefore      in this case admittedly we
    are dealing with only respondent no. 4 as the project          proponent.
</p>

<p id="p_11">10. The 1st respondent MoEF,in its reply, has stated that the EIA report in
    respect of the    4th respondent has been prepared by the project
    proponent in accordance with the         EIA Notification 2006 and the
    Terms of Reference (TOR) prescribed by the MoEF. It is also stated that
    the EIA Report was prepared by the accredited EIA (Environment
    Impact Appraisal) Consultant , for consideration for the issuance of
    Environmental     Clearance. According to the first respondent, the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                                8</span>
     Environmental Appraisal          Committee      (EAC)      has    unanimously
    recommended for issuance of Environmental           Clearance for the 4th
    respondent. It is also stated that the permission for drawal of        water    is
    granted by the Department of Water Resources of the State
    Government.The           MoEF is only concerned about the monitoring and
    protection of riparian system, if the quantity of drawal of water is
    huge.The MoEF,states that Environmental Clearance was granted to
    the   4th   respondent     on    19-02-2009     imposing     certain    specific
    conditions. It is the further case of the 1st respondent, that there was no
    complaint         received against the 4th respondent of any violation of EC
    conditions. The MoEF is          also monitoring the 4th respondent through
    its Regional Office and in case of any       violation      action           under
    <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment Protection Act</a> 1986 will be initiated.It is also           stated by
    the 1st respondent that as per conditions of clearance, if there is a
    proposal for diversion of forest land, necessary permission must be
    obtained under the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_2">Forest        (Conservation)    Act</a>     1980   .     As     the
    environment clearance in this case has been granted         as early as on
    19-02-2009, which is much before the coming in to force of the
    <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_3">National Green Tribunal Act</a> 2010 which is effective from
    18-10-2010,the issue can not be raised before this Tribunal.

 respondent Company has applied to the Government, the Dept. Of Water
Resources ,for allocation of water in the prescribed form along with the
processing      fees and security deposit.The application was sent to the
Water Allocation Committee(WAC) which after careful consideration of
the views of the Chief      Engineer    and    the     Basin   Manager    has
recommended the case and accordingly the engineer-in -chief, Water
Resources recommended to the Government for allocation               of water
for the fourth respondent plant.Accordingly, the fourth respondent has
entered an agreement in the prescribed form with the concerned
Executive Engineer for drawal of water. It is also the case of the
second respondent Government of Odisha that in           Keonjhar     District
there are about       151 minor irrigation projects with the CCA of
27,553Ha (68,056Ac) and about 592 Lift Irrigation points with annual
irrigation of 8680 Ha (21,440 Ac) and the total CCA is 36,233
Ha(89496Ac). It is further stated that Baitarani Basin provides domestic
water supply to about 15 Urban Complexes,            in addition to riparian
rights along its 360 Km length.It is stated that the     transportation    of
Iron Ores in the form of slurry through pipelines reduces pollution .      It
is the categoric stand of the second respondent that the fourth respondent
has not      constructed any '' intake wall" till date ,except installing one
movable JIB crane near the bank of river Baitarani at the intake point
to help drawing water from the river.It is also stated that three pounds
of 37KW, two working and one standby with the            discharge    capacity
of 250 cum have been fixed to the JIB crane to deliver the approved
drawal of 480 Cum. Thus the State Govt denies the allegation that it has

    being taken for    effective,   efficient,     equitable     and    sustainable
    management of water resources of the         State.

<p id="p_13">12. The third respondent, the District Collector, in his reply, while denying
    the allegation raised by the applicant and adopting the reply filed by the
    State Government has admitted that by a letter dated 4.08.2011 the
    fourth respondent was      directed to stop laying of slurry pipelines and
    the construction work of beneficiation       plant over non-forest land till
    final order is obtained under the Forest (Conservation)Act. The Central
    Government has granted 1st stage clearance to the fourth respondent on
    2.11.2011 followed by the stage-II Forest Clearance on 9.07.2012. It is
    stated that on 17.08.2012 permission was granted to lay pipeline and
    the State Pollution Control Board has issued consent to operate to the
    fourth      respondent on 24.11.2012.It is also the case of the third
    respondent that for    establishing    the       plant      by     the     fourth
    respondent ,hearing is mandatory, By a notification dated 19.02.2008,
    the Odisha State Pollution Control Board,        Bhubaneswar has issued a
    public notice for a public hearing relating to the         establishment       of
    beneficiation plant of 4.08 Million Tonne per annum capacity at
    village-Tanto and Tailing Dam at Nalda under Barbil Tahsil of Keonjhar
    District,   Odisha. It is stated that        public hearing was held on
    25.03.2008 at Vikas Mahal, Barbil of Keonjhar and the proceedings
    were released. In the said meeting, large        number of local people have

<p id="p_14">13. The fourth respondent project proponent, in its reply while admitting the
    project of      the said respondent, has stated that the proposal of the
    project to process iron-ore fines, which are low grade iron ore fines
    which otherwise cannot be used in the steel industry , can be converted
    to high grade concentrate and used only for pelletization for further use
    in the steel making process. The project envisage use of unusable
    materials into usable products with the benefits of better utilization of
    mineral resources in India and facilitate mineral conservation, reduce
    high grade iron-ore mining which benefits the environment and that it
    reduces      environmental impact. It is the further case of the project
    proponent that many environmental friendly measures relating to the
    projects for conservation of water    have been taken including use of
    underground slurry pipeline instead of road and rail transport and there
    is totally negligible pollution and therefore the project is pollution free,
    that   the transportation of slurry comprising of 70% solids creates no
    noise, no dust, no smell, that    the transportation of slurry does not
    involve use of diesel, that the water drawn by   the beneficiation plan is
    recycled for re-use in the slurry pumping and that water     from     river

    remaining period water is used from the reservoir built up by the fourth
   respondent     itself.

<p id="p_15">14. It is stated by the fourth respondent that as per the Memorandum of
   Understanding        entered between the Government and the project
   proponent dated 15.03.2007, the         second respondent has to identify
   suitable water-source from river Baitarani for     drawal of water to meet
   the requirement of the project. And in-principle approval      was granted
   to the project proponent for laying iron-ore slurry pipeline on
   13.06.2007.The Odisha Infrastructure Development Corporation, a Govt.
   of Odisha      Undertaking applied to the Chief Conservator of Forests,
   Odisha on 5.07.2007 on behalf of the project proponent for diversion of

   stated that on 19.07.2007, the project     proponent obtained permission
   for laying pipeline along the State Highway. The       State      Pollution
   Control Board has granted consent to establish on 29.08.2007. On
    7.12.2007 the Chief Engineer, National Highways granted permission
   for laying     pipeline along NH-215. The Dept. of Water Resources of
   the State Govt has       allocated 4.70 cusecs of water from river Baitarani
   on 11.02.2009 with various conditions. On 19.02.2009, the Ministry of
   Environment and Forests, Government of         India granted environment
   clearance with various conditions. On 18.03.2009, the project

    Odisha through      the Executive Engineer on 14.10.2009 to draw 4.70
   cu-secs of water from river Baitarani. The Forest Range Officer, Barbil
   has sent a notice on 27.06.2011 to the       project proponent to stop work
   in and around forest area till forest clearance is received for diversion of
   forest land.The Government of India has granted stage-I Forest
   Clearance on 2-11-2011 followed by the stage-II clearance for the
   beneficiation     plant    on   09.07.2012    and      for     the    pipeline    on
   17.08.2012.Thereafter the        State Pollution Control Board has issued
   consent to operate on 24.11.2012. It is      further         stated     that      on
   07.12.2012 the agreement for supply of water from the river              was
   renewed for a further period of 3 years.

<p id="p_17">15. The Fourth respondent has raised a preliminary objection about the
   maintainability     of the application. It is their case that the order
   challenged by the applicant in so far        as it relates to the fourth
   respondent dated 11.02.2009 which is prior to the coming into                  force
   of the National Green Tribunal 2010. Further the issue involved do not
   pertain    to any of the Statutes enumerated in Schedule I of the NGT
   Act. That apart ,the      application is barred by limitation and is without
   merit, filed only to coerce the      fourth respondent. The water permitted
   to be drawn from the river by the State Government is as per the Orissa
   Irrigation Act, 1959. Even otherwise according to               the applicant, an
   order passed on 11.02.2009 is challenged in November 2012 which                   is
   even beyond the permissible discretionary power of the Tribunal to
   condone the delay. In addition to that it is the case of the project



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                                     14</span>
 proponent that the applicant has admitted about his knowledge of the
project even as early as 2010-11 when his    brother was arrested for
arson and destruction of property belonging to the contractor who was
carrying on work on the spot of the project carried on behalf of the
project    proponent. Further the applicant has given many statements
about the project which show that even in the year 2010, he was aware
of this project and in-spite of it, he has not explained as to why he has
chosen to approach the Tribunal in November 2012 .The NGT Act, has
come into existence on 18.10.2010 while the second       respondent    has
granted permission to draw water from river Baitarani on 11.02.2009.
According to the applicant, even if the said order has to be challenged,
the same can be only as an appeal u/s. 16 of the Act and therefore the
said application is not   maintainable.It is further stated that the matter
which is directly and substantially in   issue in the present application
is already pending in the Writ Petition No. 9118/2010 before the Orissa
High Court. Therefore this application is not maintainable.The
project proponent while denying all other allegations raised by the
applicant would state that the project proponent has followed all the
procedures established by law     and environmental clearance has been
obtained after following every steps     formulated by EIA regulation,
2006 framed by the Ministry of Environment and       Forests, Government
of India apart from obtaining consent to operate from the State
Pollution Control Board. Therefore the project proponent prays for
dismissal of the   Main Application NO. 60 of 2012.

<p id="p_18"> 16. Before adverting to the submission made by the learned counsel, it is
    relevant to      mention a few of the facts which mostly relate to the
    order passed by this Tribunal.      On 21-11-2012,while directing the
    deletion of the 5th and 6th respondent as stated   earlier in this order,the
    Tribunal has directed the 4th respondent not to go ahead with
    construction of the project without obtaining environment clearance. It
    was on        04-02-2013,the applicant has filed M.A.No13 and 14/2013
    for a direction to the Collector to ensure the compliance of the said
    order and to punish the 4th respondent     for disobeyance of the order.On
    04-03-2013, this Tribunal,on a representation of of the learned counsel
    for the applicant has dismissed M.A.No14/2013 as withdrawn           with
    liberty. The order is as follows:
</p><p id="p_19">      "M.A. No. 14 of 2013 in Application No.60 of 2012

</p><p id="p_22">17. In pursuant to the said order, the applicant has filed M.A.No73 of
    2013 ,on14-03-2013 ,praying for amending the prayer in the original
    application, seeking for a direction to the 4th respondent not to obstruct
    the natural flow of water in the river,to set aside the letter dated

       11-02-2009 and a subsequent letter dated 28-01-2013,renewing the
      water agreement, to direct the 4th respondent to reconstitute the natural
      flow of water in Baitarani River,to direct the 2nd respondent to consult
      with Baitarani RBO regarding conflict resolution and consensus
      building and riparian rights of local people,to set aside the Forest
      Clearance granted by respondent no. 1 dated09-07-2012 and 17-08-2012
      in favour of the 4th respondent. This application was opposed by the
      project proponent in its reply ,stating that ,while the main application
      itself is not maintainable, there is no question of taking up the
      amendment application at this stage,that by virtue of the proposed
      amendment,the applicant attempt to change the entire cause of action
      raised by him in the original application,that even if the applicant wants
      to challenge the Forest Clearance ,the same can be only by way of
      appeal, which is also hopelessly time barred and that this Tribunal has
      no jurisdiction to condone such a large number of days delay.
</p>

<p id="p_23">18. The 4th respondent , project proponent has also filed M.A.No229 of
        2012 ,to dismiss the Application No.60 of 2012 or in the alternative ,to
        clarify the order dated 21-11-2012 to the effect that the said order does
        not prevent the project proponent to carry on the project of the
        beneficiation plant in accordance with law. As the maintainability of
        the original application itself is in question, we have heard all the
        respective counsel on all issues.

 respondent,who has raised the question relating to the maintainability
of the Original Application,while the permission to draw water for the
project of the 4th respondent was on11-02-2009 and all other prayers
are linked to that order. According to him ,virtually the applicant has
challenged that order of the 2nd respondent which was passed before
the commencement of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_4">National Green Tribunal Act</a> 2010,which
came into effect from 18-10-2010 and the susequent order of the 2nd
respondent dated 28-01-2013 was only the continuation of the earlier
order dated 11-02-2009 extending the period of agreement and
therefore this Tribunal has no jurisdiction.He would further contend
that the permission granted to the project proponent to draw water is
not under any of the seven statutes mentioned in the Schedule I to the
NGT Act.It was the decision taken by the State Government which is
not within the purview of the Act.His further contention is that, when
an exactly similar matter is pending adjudication before the Hon'ble
High Court of Orissa , it may not be proper for for the fora to take
independent decisions.He would finally submit that even otherwise
the main application is totally barred by limitation even as per the Act
and therefore liable to be dismissed.Further ,he submitted that when
the applicant's own brother was involved in offences committed in the
project site he can not disown his knowledge. According to him there
is absolutely no cause of action and he would also rely upon the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in (2004)2 SCC 579. Insofar
as it relates to the amendment application, it his submission that even
on merit of the said application ,it is on a total and different cause of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                      18</span>
       action which cannot be raised in this main application.Mere liberty
      given to the applicant to file appropriate application does not mean
      that   it should be allowed without considering its merit.It is his
      vehement contention that the applicant having known that now he
      cannot maintain any appeal against the Forest Clearance ,as it barred
      by limitation,has chosen to file this application and therefore it is
      liable to be dismissed. He is categoric that the project proponent is not
      putting up any intake well.
</p>

<p id="p_25">20.   Per contra, it is the contention of the learned counsel for the original
      application that the entire issue relates to the preservation and regular
      flow of water in the Baitarani River which cannot be said to be
      outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.According to him,
      technicality can not stand in the way of rendering substantial
      justice.It is his further submission that the Writ Petition ,stated to
      have been filed in the High Court is not known to him and the
      applicant is not a party .In any event,there is no bar for this Tribunal
      to decide the issue if it is within its purview.
</p>

<p id="p_26">21.   We heard in detail the learned counsel for the applicant as well as the
      respondents, particularly the 4th respondent ,project proponent and
      having referred to all the papers filed and on application of our minds,
      we formulate the following issues for our consideration and decision
      thereon:
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                            19</span>
<p id="p_27">          A.Whether the applicant is entitled for the relief of setting aside
         the order of the respondent no.2 dated11-02-2009 and other
         prayers made by him?
</p>

<p id="p_28">         B.Whether the Original Application is maintainable?
</p>

<p id="p_29">         C.Whether the application for amendment of the Original
          Application can be entertained?
</p>

<p id="p_30">22.   As all the three issues are interconnected,we propose to consider all
          the issues together. On the admitted facts explained in detail
      above, we will now proceed to examine the maintainability of the
      main application.As stated above, the relief claimed by the applicant
      not only relates to the maintainance of the natural flow of River
      Baitarani but also challenging the letter of the 2nd respondent
      permitting withdrawal of water by the 4th respondent project
      proponent from Baitarani River to be used for the project of the iron
      ore beneficiation plant.In fact, it that letter impugned in this
      application which relates to the 4th respondent about which we are
      concerned in this application , that gives the cause of action for the
      main application itself.The said order dated 11-02-2009, has been
      issued by the Additional Secretary to Government of Orissa permitted
      the 4th respondent to draw 4.70 cusecs of water from river Baitarani
      for the proposed beneficiation plant at Tonto, Barbil District of
      Keonjhar for a period of two years subject to availability of water and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                               20</span>
       subject to various conditions. Therefore it is clear that the said order
      of permission has been passed by the State Government of
      Odisha.Clause no.8 of the impugned order makes it abundantly clear
      that the said order has been passed as per the powers conferred on the
      State under 'Orissa Irrigation Act 1959 and Rules1961.The said clause
      reads as follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          '8. The drawal of water is in accordance with the provision of
          Orissa Irrigation Acts 1959 and Rules,1961 and amendments
          made from time to time.'


      Therefore it is crystal clear from the very contents of the order
      impugned that ,the order challenged herein is not one passed under
      any one of the seven Acts enumerated in the Schedule 1 of the
      <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_5">National Green Tribunal Act</a> 2010 namely,The Water(Prevention and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                               21</span>
                  question (including      enforcement of any legal right relating
                 to environment), is involved and such question arises out         of
                 the enactments Specified in Schedule I.'


        In the light of the specific provision in the Act, which has created this
        Tribunal,restricting its jurisdiction only in respect of certain Acts,we
        are of the view that we have no jurisdiction in the matter.
</p>

<p id="p_32">24.     But the next question is in the light of the objects of the Act ,which is
         very wide as       stated in the Preamble as,
                     '<a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_11">An Act</a> to provide for establishment of a National Green
                     Tribunal for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases
                     relating to environmental protection and conservation of
                      forests and other natural resources including enforcement a
                       any legal right relating to environment and giving relief
                       and compensation for damages to persons and property
                           and for matters connected therewith or incidental
thereto.'


      Can this Tribunal act as a passive spectator ,when a complaint is      made
      that natural     flow of running water in a river is being illegally directed,
      especially when The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of            Pollution)
      Act</a> 1974, in its Preamble uses the word 'restoring of       wholesomeness
      of water',as the object? The answer in our view is in       the negative. But
      on the facts of this case ,it is the catagoric stand of the MoEF in its



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                                                   22</span>
       reply that it has not only given environment         clearance to the project
      of the 4th respondent but there are no complaint from any one about the
      breach of conditions by the project proponent.Moreover, the impugned
      order itself has made sufficient safeguards saying,
      "7.The Industry will not disturb the normal flow of water so that riparian
      rights in the down stream will be affected and the industry shall have no
      claim on that account.'
      Therefore it is always open to the applicant or any other person to
      obtain adequate remedy. We are fully satisfied that as on date there is no
      issue of environment by the conduct of the 4th respondent.
</p>

<p id="p_33">25.     There is one other issue ,as submitted by the learned counsel for the
        4th respondent namely, the order impugned is dated11-02-2009,
        which is before the NGT Act came in          to existence which is on
        18-10-2010.     On    this   score   also   we     cannot   entertain        this
        application.Even otherwise ,there is a question of limitation.An order
        passed in 2009 cannot allowed to be questioned in 2012.Apart from
        the fact that this Tribunal has no   jurisdiction, even as per the NGT
        Act the Tribunal can entertain only if an application is made within
        six months from the date of cause of action. However ,in the event of
        sufficient cause shown by the applicant that he has been prevented for
        sufficient    reasons to approach the Tribunal, a further period of sixty
        days can be condoned. Beyond that period the Tribunal itself has no
        powers to entertain any application for      any     reason,which       is     a
        settled law. That is also the purport of the proviso to <a href="/doc/86312185/" id="a_13">section 14(3)</a>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                                                      <a href="/doc/103424754/" id="a_14">23</a></span>
      which states:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">               'Provided that the Tribunal may,if it is satisfied that the
               applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the
               application    within the said period ,allow it to be filed
               within a further period not exceeding sixty days.'


   As held by the Hon'bls Supreme Court in N.C. Dhoundial Vs Union of
   India and others ,in the context of the jurisdiction of National Human
   Rights Commission, under the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_15">Protection of Human Rights Act</a>,the
   period of limitation which is basically procedural in nature,it can also
   operate as fetters of jurisdiction.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_34">26. Therefore , looking into any angle we are unable to accept the
   contention of the learned counsel for the applicant,except observing that
   it shall be the duty of the project proponent to scrupulously follow the
   conditions contemplated under the order of the 2 nd respondent
   dated11-02-2009 as subsequently extended as well as the conditions laid
   down in the environment clearance granted by the MoEF dated
   19-02-2009. Further,in addition to the catagoric stand of the project
   proponent in the reply stating that the project proponent is no
   constructing any intake well,the learned counsel for the project
   proponent on behalf of his client has made a statement that his client has
   not made any intake wall and has no plan of making the same in future
   also. The said statement is recorded and it is expected of the authorities
   concerned to ensure the strict compliance of the same. It is also relevant



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                             24</span>
     to point out at this juncture that the applicant has also not chosen to
    question the EC.
</p>

<p id="p_35">27. Now,coming to the application for amendment filed by the applicant, at
    the outset ,as we have already concluded that the main application is
    not maintainable, it goes without saying that the amendment application
    is also not maintainable and hence liable to be dismissed.Even otherwise,
    we fail to understand as to how the issuance of Forest Clearance by
    some other authority    under a different law can be even remotely
    connected with the issuance of permission to draw water for the project
    of the 4th respondent . As correctly submitted by the learned counsel for
    the project proponent,not only the entire cause of action is sought to be
    changed by the proposed amendment,but also the applicant is actually
    seeking to introduce a new case.If the applicant desires to challenge the
    Forest Clearance granted to the 4th respondent,the same has to be by a
    different process even if it is in the same forum.An appeal under the
    NGT Act is different from an application.An appeal and an application
    can be heard together,if the subject matter is the same.An application
    may even be converted to an Appeal in the interest of rendering
    substantial justice.Here,the case of the applicant cannot come anywhere
    near the said concepts.The applicant can not disown knowledge about
    this project from 2009, especially when there are records to show that
    his own brother was involved in a criminal case of riot in place of the
    project proponent and F I R has also been registered.

<p id="p_36"> 28.    For the reasons stated supra, we dismiss both Original Application No.
       60 of 2012 and M.A .No 73 of 2013. As the main application and
       amendment application are dismissed, M.A.No. 229 of 2012 and
       M.A.No.13 of 2013 filed by the project proponent is dismissed as
       nothing survives.We leave the Parties to bear their own cost.</p><pre id="pre_2">
