                This application under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal

   Procedure (for short 'the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">CrPC</a>') has been filed for quashing the order

   dated 16.05.2013 passed by the learned Sub Divisional Judicial

   Magistrate, Patna in Complaint Case No.04(M) of 2013 by which the

   petitioner, an Executive Engineer has been summoned to face trial for

   the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_3">Section 37</a> of the Air (Prevention and

   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (For short 'the Act').

</p><p id="p_5">                2. The allegation in the complaint petition filed by the Bihar

        State Pollution Control Board (for short 'the Board') is that on

        04.05.2013 a Member of the Board inspected the Hot Mix Plant

        located at Bariarpur at Motihari, East Champaran under National

        Highway (Mechanical Division), Road Construction Department,

        Muzaffarpur. During inspection, it revealed that the aforesaid Road

        Construction Department had established a Hot Mix Plant having the

        capacity to produce 30 to 35 tons of bitumen and stone chips mixture

        per hour. Though, at the time of inspection, the plant was found

        closed, the same was operational from before. The plant was devoid

        of any chimney or proper pollution control equipments. Further, the

        location of Hot Mix Plant did not conform to the minimum distance of

        200 meter from habitation and railway line. It has further been alleged

        in the complaint that the unit was established without prior consent of

        the Board as required under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_5">Section 21</a> of the Act. The complainant

        alleged that the petitioner was directly incharge and responsible for

        the affairs of the Hot Mix Plant in question.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                     3. On the basis of the aforesaid complaint, the learned Sub

        Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Patna, vide order dated 16.05.2013,

        took cognizance of the offence under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_6">Section 37</a> of the Act and

        summoned the petitioner in exercise of powers conferred under

        <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_7">Section 204</a> of the CrPC.

        Engineer, he was promoted to the post of Executive Engineer

        (Mechanical), vide notification of Road Construction Department,

        dated 25.02.2013. Subsequently, vide notification dated 17.04.2013,

        he was posted as an Executive Engineer (Mechanical), National

        Highway, Mechanical Division at Muzaffarpur. He submitted his

        joining at Muzaffarpur only after the aforesaid notification dated

        17.04.2013 was issued. The Hot Mix Plant at Motihari came within

        his jurisdiction only after he took charge on 18.04.2013 pursuant to

        the aforestated notification dated 17.04.2013. As he came to know

        that no objection certificate from Board has not been obtained, he

        immediately purchased two forms through money receipt nos. 20672

        and 20673 for applying and for obtaining no objection certificate from

        the Board. Since the Hot Mix Plant was in the premises of Road

        Construction Sub Division Office, Motihari, the petitioner was in the

        process of obtaining details from Road Construction Department,

        which was required to be filled up in the No Objection Form. He

        inspected the Hot Mix Plant on 30.04.2013 and immediately

        thereafter, vide letter dated 02.05.2013, he directed the Junior

        Engineer (Mechanical)- cum-Incharge Hot Mix Plant site, Motihari to

        suspend the work till the establishment of Secondary Pollution

        Control Unit. Thereafter, in view of the positive order passed by the

        petitioner on 05.05.2013, when the Hot Mix Plant was inspected by
 Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.47034 of 2013 dt.31-10-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           4/7</span>




        the officials of the Board, it was also found to be totally closed.

        However, on 09.05.2013, the instant case was filed against him.

</p><p id="p_8">                     5. Mr. Y. C. Verma, learned senior counsel for the

        petitioner submitted that the petitioner had no role at all in

        establishment of Hot Mix Plant at Motihari, which was done in the

        year 2011 itself. The memo of payment was entered in the

        measurement book on 28.03.2011, whereas the petitioner joined the

        post on 18.04.2013. Within 10 days of his joining, he obtained form

        for getting No Objection Certificate from Board and within 15 days of

        his joining he directed for closing the plant. He submitted that on the

        basis of the observations made by this Court in a writ proceeding a

        departmental proceeding was also initiated against the petitioner on

        the self same charges as levelled in the present complaint case. In the

        said departmental proceeding the enquiry officer submitted his report

        holding the petitioner to be not guilty of the charges. After going

        through the enquiry report, the disciplinary authority exonerated the

        petitioner from the charges levelled against him, vide order dated

        07.08.2015, as contained in Annexure-9 to the present application.

</p><p id="p_9">                     6. Mr. Shivendra Kishore, learned Senior Advocate

        appearing for the Board submitted that exoneration of the petitioner in

        the departmental proceeding would be of no consequence so far as the

        present complaint is concerned. He submitted that as far as the
 Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.47034 of 2013 dt.31-10-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           5/7</span>




        complaint is concerned, there is specific allegation against the

        petitioner that on 05.05.2013 when the inspection was made by the

        officials of the Board, the petitioner was incharge of the affairs of the

        National Highway (Mechanical Division), Road Construction

        Department, Muzaffarpur and according to the allegation made in the

        complaint though Hot Mix Plant was closed at the time of inspection,

        it was operational from before and had the capacity to produce 30 to

        35 tons bitumen and stone chips mixture per hour. He submitted that

        the said plant was devoid of any chimney or proper pollution control

        equipments and location of the plant did not conform to the minimum

        distance from habitation. He submitted that the plant was established

        without prior permission of the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                     7. I have heard learned Senior Advocates appearing on

        behalf of the parties and perused the record.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                     8. As far as installation of the plant is concerned, the

        petitioner cannot be held responsible for the same. From the

        submissions made on behalf of the parties, as also from the record, it

        would transpire that establishment of Hot Mix Plant was made at

        Motihari in the year, 2011 itself whereas the petitioner joined to the

        post upon transfer at Motihari on 18.04.2013. It would also be evident

        from the complaint that on the date of inspection the plant was found

        non-operational. As the petitioner himself was transferred and posted
 Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.47034 of 2013 dt.31-10-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                           6/7</span>




        at that place on 17.04.2013 and he submitted his joining on

        18.04.2013 he cannot be held responsible for installation of the plant

        without obtaining prior permission of the Board which was made in

        the year, 2011 or for the plant being operational prior to 18.04.2013

        when he submitted his joining in the Division. It is true that

        exoneration in a departmental proceeding in itself may not be

        sufficient to hold a person innocent in a criminal case, but if the

        charges are same and the enquiry officer and the disciplinary authority

        have found the petitioner to be innocent in the matter even on the

        basis of preponderance of probability, the same may be taken into

        consideration as one of the factors for appreciating as to whether the

        prosecution of the petitioner in the complaint case would be proper or

        not.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                     9. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case

        noted above, I am of the opinion that no mens rea can be attributed

        against the petitioner for committing an offence punishable under

        <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_8">Section 37</a> of the Act. In that view of the matter, the prosecution of

        the petitioner in the complaint case would amount to an abuse of

        process of the court.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                     10. Accordingly, the application is allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                     11. The impugned order dated 16.05.2013 passed by the

        learned Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Patna in Complaint Case
