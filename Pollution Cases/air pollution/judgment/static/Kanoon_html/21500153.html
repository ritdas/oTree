       These Criminal Petitions coming on for Admission this
day, the court made the following:

                          ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.

      These petitions are disposed of by this common order.

</p><p id="p_2">      2. The petitioner was an Executive Engineer of the

Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (BESCOM) and he was

stationed at Hebbal at Bangalore. It transpires that Accused

No.1 who had been granted a quarrying licence, was carrying

on quarrying activities and even after expiry of the licence, he
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   6</span>




was carrying such activity beyond six months of the expiry of

the licence. The Pollution Control Board having come to know

of such illegal quarrying activity being carried on, had

instructed the BESCOM to stop supply of electricity supply to

the quarry.     It further transpires that there was delay in

disconnection and on that count, a complaint has been lodged

for an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">Section 31-A</a> of the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. It is in that

background the court below having taken cognizance by a one

line order, the petitioner is before this court.

</p><p id="p_3">      3. The petitioner is common in all these cases and the

complaint is also a similar complaint in respect of inaction on

the part of the present petitioner - Accused No.2. It is pointed

out that the petitioner was stationed at Hebbal at Bangalore and

had nothing to do with the quarry or the supply of electricity to

the quarry, which was said to be situated at Devanahalli and

was certainly not within his jurisdiction. Hence, the allegation

that the petitioner had been notified to disconnect the electricity
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 7</span>




even if true, would not enable him to carry out such

disconnection. Hence, this glaring circumstance has been over-

looked in the court below not having applied its mind and

having ascertained as to the manner in which the petitioner

could be named as an accused. In the absence of any material

to indicate that there was any infraction committed by the

petitioner, no fault can be said to have been committed by the

petitioner.   Hence, the counsel seeks that the proceedings

against the petitioner be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4. However, the case is being tried as a summons case

and there is no provision under which the court could close the

proceedings. Even if it was possible for the court to examine

the matter as to the contention now taken up, there is no choice

but for the petitioner to stand trial. It is unfortunate that the

petitioner who has been retired from service has to go through

this process of criminal trial, notwithstanding his serious

complaint that he is not at all concerned with the alleged

offence and it is some other who ought to be prosecuted and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 8</span>




entire proceedings also would be an exercise in futility if

ultimately it is found that the petitioner was not the actual

accused.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5. There is no provision under which the court could

examine whether in fact the complaint is lodged against the

proper person and the entire proceedings may result in futility if

indeed the petitioner was not the concerned accused. Since

there is no provision under which the petitioner could be

compensated if it is ultimately found that he has been wrongly

named as the accused and wrongly prosecuted, in exercise of

power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_3">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C., this court directs that if

ultimately it is found that the petitioner has been wrongly

prosecuted, he shall be compensated at the rate of Rs.500/- for

every date of hearing he has been present and has attended the

court. Further, in respect of each individual case, he shall be

awarded the said compensation, which shall be collected from

the complainant, if it is ultimately found that petitioner has been

wrongly prosecuted. The petitions are disposed of.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             9</span>




</p><p id="p_6">      Since the cases are being tried as summons cases, the

court below shall expedite the proceedings and complete the

same at the earliest.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">                                       Sd/-
</p><p id="p_9">                                      JUDGE
