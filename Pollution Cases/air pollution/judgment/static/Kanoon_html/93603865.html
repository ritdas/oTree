       State at the time of submission of first report was on the

       assumption that Veneer Mills and Plywood Manufacturing Units

       would get their requirement of timber from the licensee Saw Mills

       and through import. Following refusal of the concerned authority

       to renew/grant license under the Saw Mills (Regulation) Act,

       several writ petitions were filed and they were dismissed by order

       dated 29.09.2000 as reported in 2001 (1) PLJR 468 Basudeo

       Yadav Vs. State of Bihar. Against the order passed by the learned

       single Judge, appeals were preferred by the Saw Mill owners.

       Those appeals were also dismissed. The LPA Bench, however,

       expressed concern over the way the State Government identified

       the sustainable Saw Mills, which were to be allowed to operate.

       The Court, however, advised the State Government to appoint a

       would be allowed to continue and those that would be closed down

       in the light of judgment passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in WP

       Mills, which were established after 12.12.1996. List of Veneer

       the Petitioner Veneer Mill (CWJC No.2862 of 2015) is in existence

       prior to 12.12.1996 and the said fact is also evident from the

       License No.237/1996 issued in the year 1996 and the Petitioner

       Veneer Mill (CWJC No.2711 of 2015) was granted license vide

       Registration No.67052/CHW/1996 dated 20.10.1996. The list so

       prepared was sent for its approval. Pursuant to the report, the

       government filed its Affidavit relating to the approved Veneer Mill/

       Plywood existing prior to 12.12.1996 before the Apex Court.

       Pursuant to that, the State Government published lists of Plywood/

       Veneer Mills in existence, interalia, in the various districts of the

       State of Bihar vide Letter No.5977 dated 30.11.2002. The name of

       established prior to 12.12.1996. The name of Petitioner of CWJC

       No.2711 of 2015 was mentioned at serial No.1 in Bettiah District.

       Thus, the Government of Bihar has accepted the position that the

       Plywood Mills/ Veneer Mills were established before the cut off

       date i.e. 12.12.1996. The Government of Bihar set up second

       Expert Committee vide Notification No.232 E dated 05.04.2002.

       only those Veneer Mills will be taken into account for preparation

       of seniority list which has been established before 29.10.2002. The

       Central Empowered Committee constituted, as per directions

       issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in T. N. Godavarman

       Tirumulpad case, convened meetings pursuant to the above on the

       subject matter regarding seniority list of wood based industries in

       the States as well as in Union Territory. One such meeting was

       convened on 16th March, 2011, wherein, minutes of the meeting

       were provided to the Standing Counsel appearing on behalf of the

       determined on the basis of date of registration as a SSI Unit, the

       date on which the land was purchased/lease entered, the date on

       which electric connection was given, the date of purchase of the

       relevant machines, the date on which commercial production

       started, the date of sales tax registration, the details of Veneer/

       Plywood sold by the Unit and the sales tax paid thereon, the sales

       tax assessment order etc. While preparing seniority list, date of

       establishment of Unit should not be decided merely on the basis of

       the production much later, then in that case the date on which the

</p><p id="p_49">                34.     The main contention on behalf of the Petitioners was

       that entire exercise taken up by the authority concerned raised

       doubt about the credibility of the respondents. The respondents

       have not considered the valued proposition as laid down by the

       Central Empowered Committee while preparing the seniority list

       of Veneer Mills/Plywood Industries.

<p id="p_50">                35.     Counsel for the Petitioners have submitted that it has

       recommendation of the Central Empowered Committee, the date

       of production shall be reckoned as the date of establishment for the

       of Veneer and its gross turnover became more than the required

       condition as per provisions of Bihar Finance Act, 1981. The

       Petitioner failed to understand as to how and on what basis

       Respondents have fixed his seniority at serial No.210 treating

       31.03.1997 as the date of establishment. The Respondents

       themselves have granted License No.237 in the year 1996 itself.

       mentioned as 10.10.1996 i.e. prior to date of registration under

       BST &amp; CST and Factory Inspection Department, Government of

       Bihar. The concerned Respondents even after having all

       information have deliberately not considered while preparing the

       seniority list. The case of the Petitioner is that he has been put at

       the bottom of seniority list in arbitrary manner.

       Industries), serial No.80 (M/s Shiv Traders), serial No.155 (M/s

</p><p id="p_66">                50.     Petitioner of CWJC No.2711 of 2015 has filed

       detailed supplementary Affidavit deprecating the action of the

       Respondents with regard to the Units as mentioned in para 62 of

       the writ petition having been placed above in the seniority list in

       arbitrary manner. The Petitioner has mentioned, in detail, in para

       10, 14 of the Supplementary Affidavit that no proper consideration

       was made by the Respondents in preparation of final seniority list.

</p><p id="p_67">                51.     By way of reply to the Counter Affidavit in CWJC

       No.2862 of 2015 in para 17, it has been stated that Petitioner is a

       partnership firm and its partner are Sri Ramakant Sah (Petitioner),

       Sri Mahendra Choudhary and Sri Dukha Rai. The Petitioner is

       running its Saw Mill in accordance with law. The Respondents in

       most illegal manner has shown favour to Veneer Mills, which were

       much below in rank and established after the Petitioner, and has

       been made senior to the Petitioner in the list prepared by the Office

       of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest contained in Office

       Order No.32 dated 22.07.2013. The petitioner in para 13 to the

       reply of the Counter Affidavit has stated that his name has been

       brought down in the seniority list as mentioned in para 52 of the

       writ petition in most arbitrary manner without any justification. It

       is mentioned in the aforesaid reply that no standard yardstick have

       been adopted while preparing the list. It is also unclear that on

       what basis the date of establishment has been reckoned and relied.

       Counsel for the petitioner in para 9 to the reply to Counter

       Affidavit has stated that Respondents have admitted that petitioner

       was granted License No.237/1996 by Memo No.512 dated

       11.03.1996. They have also admitted the fact that the application

       of renewal of license has sometime been submitted on behalf of

       the petitioner, Ramakant Sah, and sometime by Mahendra

       Choudhary. They have tried to mislead the Court that the firm is

       running in the name of Proprietor Mahendra Choudhary only.

       From the records, it will appear that firm is partnership firm and its

       partners are Ramakant Sah (Petitioner), Mahendra Choudhary and

       Dukha Sah.
