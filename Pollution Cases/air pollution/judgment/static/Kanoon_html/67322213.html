</p><p id="p_3">1.   This application has been filed under Section 18 read with <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_1">Section 14</a>,

     <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_2">15</a>, <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_3">16</a> and <a href="/doc/139918683/" id="a_4">17</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 by the applicant

     praying therein for cancellation of the pre-consent dated 01.04.2013

     (wrongly stated as 31.03.2013 in the Application)in respect of land

     bearing Khasra No. 156/01 and 156/03 vide consent no. COG GRT H-

     2044 granted to the respondent no. 9 by the MP Pollution Control Board

     for establishment of a petrol pump in the aforesaid land. The grievance

     raised with which we are concerned is that the land in dispute over

     which the petrol pump is being established by the respondent no. 9 is

     adjoining a tank by the name "Adhartal" in the city of Jabalpur in

     Madhya Pradesh and that in case the aforesaid petrol pump is

     commissioned, the water of the tank shall be polluted as a result of

     discharge and flow of water and other material like petrol, diesel, oil,

     etc. from the petrol pump into the lake. It is also contended that the pre-

     consent dated 01.04.2013 also deserves to be cancelled in view of the

     fact that no consent under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of

     Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 has been obtained by the Project Proponent.

</p><p id="p_4">2.   Other grounds with which this Tribunal is not concerned pertains to the

     petrol pump being located in the vicinity of the residential area and the

     risk to the residents as a result thereof, which do not fall within the

     jurisdiction of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_6">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010. Accordingly,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>
      Learned Counsel has confined his submission to the above stated issue

     only

</p><p id="p_5">3.   On the receipt of the aforesaid application vide order dated 01.07.2013,

     notices were ordered to be issued to the respondents. In response to the

     aforesaid notices, the respondents have put in their appearance and have

     filed their replies.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.   The respondent no. 3, 4 and 5 i.e. the MP Pollution Control Board and

     its officers submitted their reply wherein they have stated that the project

     proponent, respondent no. 9 applied to the District Collector for the

     concerned licence and the Collector, in turn, directed the project

     proponent to obtain No Objection Certificate from the concerned

     authorities including the MP Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_7">5.   It is submitted in the reply of the respondent no. 3, 4 and 5 that the

     respondent no. 9 project proponent applied to the MP Pollution Control

     Board authorities in the prescribed form and the authorities conducted an

     inspection and prepared their report which has been filed as Annexure R-

</p><p id="p_8">     4. The aforesaid inspection report which took into account the nature of

     the activity, the nature of the products including the make, specification

     of the storage tanks and all other relevant material came to the

     conclusion that the activity in question which was being installed by way

     of petrol pump falls within the green category, looking to the nature of

     business to be carried out which was only of a petrol filling station. It

     was noted that there would be zero consumption of water and zero




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                       4</span>
      discharge of waste water. Based upon the aforesaid, the respondent no.

     3, 4 and 5 have contended in their reply that on account of not emitting

     any air pollutant or discharge of any sewage or trade effluent, no consent

     under the provisions of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

     1981 and Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 were

     required.
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.   As regards permission for hazardous waste management, we find that the

     authorisation for the same has been duly issued by the Regional Officer,

     MP Pollution Control Board on 01.04.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.   In the reply, it has been stated that even after filing of the present

     application, the officers of the MP Pollution Control Board taking notice

     of all the objections raised by the applicant in the present application

     inspected the site again with a view to ascertain any possibility of

     pollution being caused to the Adhartal Tank as a result of the

     commissioning petrol pump by the respondent no. 9. The inspection

     report has been filed as Annexure R-5 alongwith the reply.

</p><p id="p_11">8.   It has been stated in the inspection report dated 23.08.2013 that the

     Adhartal Tank is situated about 50 meters away from the compound of

     the petrol pump. It has also been stated in Para 3 dealing with the

     "probability of pollution from establishing of petrol pump" that the

     "process, storage and distribution of petrol is non-polluting in nature.

     So there is no probability of ground water pollution and Adhartal water

     pollution due to working of the said petrol pump .......................




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      5</span>
      ....................."   In the final analysis under para 6 which has been

     recorded "............................. the working of petrol pump is non-polluting

     in regular basis. All safety precautions are taken by petrol pump dealer

     and petroleum companies to check the leakage of petrol/diesel from the

     underground storage tanks. They have prescribed mechanism for this.

     Only in case of accidental leakage or spillage of petrol/diesel may affect

     ground water but this happens very rarely. This is also a fact that

     previously a petrol pump was working at the same spot for about two

     years back and any complaint regarding ground water or Adhartal

     water pollution never came to the knowledge of the Board. So the issue

     raised by the applicant in the present Application No. 29/2013 that

     ground water of nearby area and Adhartal Tank water will be polluted

     due to establishment of petrol pump of respondent no. 9 seems

     hypothetical."
</p>
<p id="p_12">9.   The Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. has also submitted their reply

     wherein apart from raising objections regarding the maintainability of

     this application, a reply on merits has also been submitted wherein

     details of the steps taken for the installation of the present petrol pump

     have been stated. It has been stated that permission from the District

     Collector has been obtained in accordance with Rule 144 of Petroleum

     Rules, 2002 for "fuel filling station" at the site in question. It has clearly

     been stated that the present one is only a "fuel filling station" and not a

     "service station". Therefore, the question of generating any hazardous




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                           6</span>
       waste which may flow into the Adhartal Tank is ruled out. It has also

      been stated that all care has been taken and in accordance with Rule 126

      of the Petroleum Rules, 2002. Fully tested tanks are being installed to

      ensure that they are free from leakage and are suitable for the petroleum

      storage. It has also been stated by the respondent company that in fact

      the size of the lake has shrunk and the present location of the lake is

      about 500 meters from the boundary of the petrol pump. It has been

      contended that in view of the above and the fact that there would be no

      discharge of any untreated effluent/sewage or waste into the Adhartal

      Tank as a result of running the fuel filling station, since it is not a service

      station the provisions of <a href="/doc/140281/" id="a_9">Section 32</a> and <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_10">33</a> of the Water (Prevention and

      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 are not attracted. In the light of the

      above, the respondents have prayed for dismissal of the application.

</p><p id="p_13">10.   We have considered the aforesaid submission and perused the records

      produced before us. We intend to confine ourselves only to the question

      relating to the infringement if at all while granting the permission as to

      whether there is any violation of environmental laws more particularly

      the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.

</p><p id="p_14">11.   Admittedly, in the instance case, the respondent no. 9 has been granted a

      licence only for installation of a "fuel filling station" and not a petrol

      pump with "service station". The reply and the documents filed by the

      respondent Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. clearly indicates the

      above decision. Their reports and the inspection carried out by the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                         7</span>
       Pollution Control Board authorities are based upon the facts that since

      the activity shall be confined by the respondent no. 9 only to the

      establishment and operation of a fuel filling station where there would

      be zero discharge of water and effluent and no such waste would be

      generated on account of this limited activity of fuel filling station, we are

      of the view that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, no

      permission under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

      1974 and its rules was required.
</p>
<p id="p_15">12.   As such, the aforesaid submissions of the Learned Counsel for the

      application that the permission granted to the project proponent is in

      violation of the provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Control of

      Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 is devoid of any merit. In the facts and

      circumstances there was no necessity of seeking any permission under

      the provisions of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981

      and no such requirement could be pointed out by the Learned Counsel

      for the applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_16">13.   We find that the permission granted by the MP Pollution Control Board

      on 01.04.2013 under the Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling and

      Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008 is very comprehensive in nature

      and the general condition no.5 in Form No. 2 that "the authorisation is

      subject to the conditions stated below and such conditions as may be

      specified in the rules for the time being in force under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_16">Environment

      (Protection) Act</a>, 1986" is comprehensive enough and read with the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                         8</span>
       terms and conditions at para 7 which states that the authorized person

      shall be bound by any other conditions for compliance as per the

      guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests or the

      Central Pollution Control Board will take care of any future

      requirements.
</p>
<p id="p_17">14.   So far as "the memo of information" which has been filed by the

      applicant today, wherein some news items and the complaint regarding

      leakage of petroleum product into the wells and the water getting

      affected is concerned, we may only add that from the records and

      inspection report, it appears that up to 23.08.2013 when the inspection

      was carried out by the authorities of the Pollution Control Board, the

      present petrol pump had not even been established and the work of

      placing the tanks was going on. As such, the question of any leakage

      from the site of the disputed petrol pump to be installed by the

      respondent no. 9 does not arise.     The newspaper reports are dated

      04.06.2013 and 20.07.2013 and the representation by the residents was

      presented on 12.06.2013 at which point of time the storage tanks had not

      been installed.   In the inspection report dated 23.08.2013 at Annexure

      R-5 it is recorded as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "Petrol and diesel will be stored in Mild Steel made cylindrical

            underground tanks ..................... On inspection construction of

            02 Brick Masonary tanks with RCC base was in progress in which

            cylindrical storage tanks will be placed."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                       9</span>
</blockquote><p id="p_18">       Thus, the contention raised upon the above reports is hereby rejected as

      it cannot related to the activity of the project proponent in any manner.

</p><p id="p_19">15.   Looking to the totality of the facts and circumstances of the present case,

      we find no merit in the present application.
