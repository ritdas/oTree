<p id="p_2">                                             We have heard this matter for some time.
</p><p id="p_3">                                             We find that there have been prima facie
                               violations of the Wastes (Management &amp; Transboundary)
                               Rules, 2016. These violations have also been pointed out
                               in the recent show cause notice dated 9.8.2019, a copy of
                               which is taken on record and marked 'X' for identification.
                               Learned counsel for respondent No.1 seeks two months
                               time for rectification of these defects and removal of these
                               violations.    As a matter of record, we find that these
                               violations were identified more than a year ago and were
                               made known to the respondent No.1 and as such
                               respondent No.1 had sufficient time so far removal of
                               these violations.    Learned counsel for respondent No.1
                               submits that there were internal wranglings among the
                               managing directors which spilled over outside the Board

                             time is being taken for removal of the violations. But, he
                             further submits, now the respondent No.1 would take all
                             steps at its command and as expeditiously as possible for
                             rectification and, therefore, he prays for grant of at least
                             four weeks' time.
</p><p id="p_4">                                         We do not think that such a time could be
                             granted to the respondent No.1. We would only say that
                             the respondent No.1 has to remain itself bound to law and
                             requirements     of   the    Wastes       (Management            &amp;
                             Transboundary) Rules, 2016 read with relevant provisions
                             of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
                             1974, the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
                             1981 and also relevant provision of the Environmental
                             Laws and, therefore, within the time stipulated already by
                             the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board- respondent No.5
                             that the respondent No.1 has to make necessary
                             compliances. We would expect respondent No.1 to have
                             done this on or before next date.
