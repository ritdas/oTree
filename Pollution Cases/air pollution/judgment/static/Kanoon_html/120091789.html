                              The petitioners had imported consignments of “Used

                      Rubber Tyre Cut in Two Pieces”. According to the petitioners,

                      the said goods are freely importable and they are meant for

                      manufacturing “rubber crumbs” to be eventually used for road

                      laying.

                      goods in question on the ground that they have been classified

                      under CTH 40040000.         The respondents after examination

                      came      to    the   conclusion   that   the   goods   have   been

                      misdeclared.       Though they had been declared as used tyre

                      with one cut in bead wire, a random         examination of      the

                      goods revealed that there was no cut in the bead wires.

                      Therefore, it was referred to SIIB for detailed examination for

                      import assessment. As per the examination report of the said

                      officers, the cargo was found to be used rubber tyres in

                      pressed   bales.    But there was no cut in the bead wires.

                      Though import of used tyres with one cut in the bead wire is

                      free, import of used rubber tyres is restricted. Hence, on the

                      reasonable belief that the importer has mis-declared the cargo

                      in order to circumvent the import restriction imposed by the

                      extant Foreign Trade Policy, the entire cargo was seized for

                      further   investigation   under    the    <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_2">Customs     Act</a>,    1962.

                      Following such seizure, the petitioners made a request for

                      provisional release in terms of <a href="/doc/110078382/" id="a_3">Section 110A</a> of the Customs

                      Act, 1962.    Since the request was not complied with, these

                      writ petitions came to be filed.

                      in Alwar, Rajasthan.          In Paragraph Nos.7 and 8 of              the

                      counter affidavits, the respondents have taken a stand that the

                      seized goods have been restricted for import as per the

                      Foreign Trade Policy and that they could have been imported

                      only under due authorisation.           Since    the importer did not

                      obtain valid licenses from DGFT, the goods were rightly

                      seized.   It is further contended that since the goods also

                      constitute a hazardous waste, prayer for provisional release

                      is also not maintainable. It is finally contended that the writ

                      petitions have to be dismissed for non exhaustion of                   the

                      alternative remedy available under the statute.

                      Climate Change. It is not the case of the petitioners that such

                      permission was obtained.       Therefore, the import has to be

                      deemed illegal as per Rule 15. Rule 15(2) mandates that such

                      illegally imported wastes shall be re-exported.      The learned

                      standing counsel points out that the rules have been made

                      under the relevant provisions of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_6">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,

                      1986. The said Act has a overriding effect on other laws.       He

                      therefore would contend that the question of provisionally

                      releasing the goods cannot arise.

                          40040000 Waste, paring and Restricted Import of used
                                   scrap of rubber              rubber tyres with
                                   (other than Hard             one cut in bead
                                   rubber)       and            wire and import of

<p id="p_41">                      While the petitioners would claim that the import is free, the

                      original stand of the respondents was that it is restricted.     In

                      other words, when the seizure took place, the debate centered

                      on the question whether the import is restricted or free and

                      nothing else.    A mere look at the seizure mahazar          would

                      indicate that it was not the stand of the respondents that the

                      import of the goods in question is prohibited. In the written

                      arguments filed by the learned standing counsel, it has been

                      mentioned that though the petitioners claim that the imported

                      used tyres are with two cuts in the bead wires, an inspection

                      by the authorities, it was found that the said imported used

                      tyres are without any cuts.      The contention that the imports

                      have been made without authorisation/license from DGFT has

                      been reiterated in the written arguments.      If that be so, the

                      question is whether the request for provisional release of the

                      goods can be opposed. The decision of the Hon'ble Supreme

                                     under Clause 2.31. Indisputably, the Respondents
                                     did not possess the necessary authorisation for
                                     their import. The customs authorities therefore
                                     prima facie cannot be said to be unjustified in
                                     detaining    the        consignment.     Merely      because

                                     treatment for the present consignment also. The
                                     defence that the DGFT had declined to issue
                                     such authorisation does not appeal to the Court.

                             and the Tribunal did not advert to the provisions
                             of the <a href="/doc/21251996/" id="a_12">Foreign Trade Act</a>. The High Court dealing
                             with the same has aptly noticed that <a href="/doc/1797702/" id="a_13">Section
                             11(8)</a> and (9) read with Rule 17(2) of the Foreign

                             confiscation   of   goods      in    the     event   of
                             contravention of the Act, Rules or Orders but
                             which   may    be   released        on     payment   of
                             redemption charges equivalent to the market
                             value of the goods. <a href="/doc/104427768/" id="a_14">Section 3(3)</a> of the Foreign

                             MFDs were not prohibited but restricted items
                             for import. A harmonious reading of the statutory
                             provisions of the <a href="/doc/21251996/" id="a_18">Foreign Trade Act</a> and <a href="/doc/109772/" id="a_19">Section

                             is restricted. We therefore find no error with the
                             conclusion of the Tribunal affirmed by the High

                             the import of used MFDs with utility for at least
                             five years keeping in mind that they were not
                             being   manufactured     in   the   country.    The
                             Chartered    Engineer   commissioned       by    the
                             customs authorities had certified that the MFDs

                             without any major repairs. Considering that at
                             import they had utility, the High Court rightly
                             classified them as "other wastes" Under Rule

                             under the Rules and is required to be re-

                             provide for re-export. The Central Government
                             under   the     Foreign        Trade    Policy   has    not

                             held that the MFDs having a utility period, the
                             Extended Producer Responsibility would arise
                             only after the utility period was over. In any

                      Bench decision is clearly distinguishable.           The Division

                      Bench noted that the import of the second hand machines are

                      conditions which included registration with BIS and that the

                      said condition was not fulfilled.       This is evident from the

                                 25.06.2013 and 07.11.2014 issued by MeitY. We
                                 find that this issue did not arise in the case of
                                 Athul Automations Private Limited (supra) and
                                 the only common feature was non production of
                                 advance authorisation/import licence. Thus, in
                                 our considered view, the decision in the case of
                                 Athul Automations Private Limited (supra) is
                                 factually distinguishable apart from the fact that
                                 the said case arose out of an adjudicatory
                                 process in which          the factual   position was
                                 threadbare    analysed       by   two    fact    finding
                                 authorities. That apart, the Hon'ble Supreme
                                 Court left the ultimate decision to be taken by
                                 DGFT.”

                      As rightly pointed out       by the learned counsel for the

                      petitioner, both Atul Automations Pvt.Ltd., decision as well as

                      the aforesaid decision of        the Hon'ble Division Bench were

                      considered by a subsequent Division Bench in the order dated

                      10.09.2019 in WP Nos.16126 of 2019 etc batch. That was also

                      a case dealing with provisional release of the goods. When

                      the said order was challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme

                      Court in SLP (Civil) Diary No.3412 of 2020, the SLP was

                      dismissed on 17.02.2020.

</p><p id="p_53">                             9.The 2016 Rules contain as many as 8 schedules.

                      Schedule 3 is in two parts. Part A contains a list of hazardous

                      wastes applicable for import and export with prior informed

                      consent.   Part B contains the list of other wastes applicable

                      for import and export and not requiring prior informed

                      consent.   Schedule VI sets out hazardous and other wastes

                      prohibited for import.     It is not the case of the respondents

                      that the imported goods in the case on hand fall under

                      Schedule VI. Once the application of the Schedule VI of the

                      2016 Rules is ruled out, the only question is whether the

                      import of the goods is free or restricted.    Under either case,

                      in view of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Atul

                      Automations, provisional release is very much permissible.

                      The respondents have seized the goods under <a href="/doc/420314/" id="a_22">Section 110</a> of

                      the Customs Act, 1962.          Therefore, <a href="/doc/110078382/" id="a_23">Section 110A</a> of the

                      Customs Act, 1962 will automatically kick in. <a href="/doc/110078382/" id="a_24">Section 110A</a> of

                      standing counsel with reference to Rule 12 (4) r/w.Rule 15 has

                      to be answered.      Interestingly, this point has also been

                      considered in Atul Automations decision.               The     Hon'ble

                      Supreme Court after referring to Rule 15 points out that the

                      <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_26">Customs Act</a>, 1962 does not provide for re-export. There is

                      another decision reported in 2015 (316) E.L.T 199 (Mad)

                      earlier Hazardous Wastes Rules concluded that despite the

                      fact that the goods, whose import is restricted in terms of the

                      Foreign Trade Policy, should be construed to be prohibited

                      goods, there is no bar for the release of the goods.               The

                      learned Judge also noted that it is not open to the customs

                      authorities to insist on re-export. This was to be done only by

                      Wastes Rules for directing the petitioners to re-export the

                      bond from them in proper form with such security and

                      conditions as the adjudicating authority may require.           The

                      petitioners' counsel also prayed that they should not be levied

                      with any demurrage and container detention charges.             The

                      learned counsel for the petitioners pointed out that they are

                      entitled to waiver in view of the Handling of Cargo in Customs

                      Areas Regulations 2009.      They would also point out that the

                      Union Government has also instructed that in view of the lock

                      down declared by the Government of India, demurrage and
