 of   village   Pilangi   Delhi   in   any   manner   whatsoever   till   the

final disposal of the main suit in order to meet the ends of

justice.   It is stated that the impugned threatened action of

defendants in cutting the trees standing within the vicinity of

the dargah is illegal, arbitrary and without any jurisdiction as

the said trees are the private property of the plaintiff  Dargah.

According   to   the   plaintiff,   as   per   the   policy   of   the

Government no tree can be cut and the said threatened action

of defendants is also against the provisions of laws and bye

laws of the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Prevention of Pollution Act</a> (sic).  It is stated that

the threats for the said purposes were extended by defendants

firstly on 12.08.2007, who also visited the site for executing

their evil designs but could not succeed.  Further, they again

came   to   the   site   on   16.08.2007   but   could   not   succeed   and

lastly now they have come at the site on 16.03.2008 along

with heavy tools used for cutting the trees as there were 25

person   on   behalf   of   defendants,   they   started   breaking   the

down trees without any rhyme or reason as the said trees are

not hazardous nor create any sort of hindrance nor affect the

rights   of   any   person   or   individual   or   organization   or   same

violates the laws of the defendants.   It is stated that the said

trees are the properties of the plaintiff trust and are almost 70

years old and were grown on the dargah land by the Gaddi

concerned SHO and given a telephone call at No.100 pursuant

to   which   I.O   from   PS   Chanakayapuri   came   at   the   site   but

since there was no order from the court, the concerned SHO

guided the plaintiff to approach the court of law and get the

stay against the defendants.  It is contended that the plaintiff

and its devotees have many times requested the defendant to

desist from their evil motives and designs but their threats in

cutting the trees on the Dargah land are still subsisting and

continuing.     According   to   the   plaintiff,   in   case   if   the

defendants   succeed   in   their   nefarious   motives   and   designs,

then in the eventuality the devotees coming for Namaz to the

Dargah in large numbers, are bound to suffer irreparable loss

and injury and the purpose of filing the suit would become

infructuous.

plaintiff.  
</p>
<p id="p_14">               According to the defendant no. 6 they are the sole

owners   of   the   property   in   question   and   have   obtained   all

necessary   permissions   from   the   concerned   authorities   in

accordance   with   law.     It   is   submitted   that   the   order   dated

3.4.2008 has caused irreparable injury and undue hardship to

them due to which reason they have now sought the vacation

of stay.
</p>
<p id="p_15">               In their reply to the application under order 39 Rule

4 CPC the plaintiff has stated that they have already declared

and set out in the present suit that an injunction suit is pending

and there has been no suppressions as alleged. According to

the   plaintiff,   the   government   is   not   the   owner   of   the   suit

property which is a durgah/ shrine of a Panch Peer which has

long   been   held   in   veneration   by   the   public   as   wakf   for

religious   pious   and   charitable   purposes   recognized   by   the

Muslim law in the area of 3 bighas 6 biswas by measurement

shown as public wakf property and dedication recorded in the

Central Revenue record vide fard jama bandi.  It is stated that

the said property is wakf since since times immemorial for a

religious   purpose   for   celebrating   the   annual   urs   death


                                  ­:  10  :­
 anniversary/   barsi   of   the   settlor   of   Peer   Panch   Peer

performance of ceremonies by the Khadim Sharif and there is

regular burning of lamps in the Durgah day and night from

time immemorial over 150 year back performance of annual

Fateha of the settlor and the members of his family.  It is also

stated that the ceremony of the fateha consists in recital of

prayers   for   the   welfare   of   the   souls   of   deceased   persons

accompanied with distribution of alms of the poor and it had

constructed place for shelter of the visitors the Hujra Dhuna

etc. and had open space for annual urse ceremony and other

religious   function   and   offering   of   prayers   by   the   public   in

large   number   which   were   unfortunately   destroyed   by   the

Defendant no.6 against which reports have been lodged and

injunction suit is filed and now claim of possession of the said

area has been made out in the plaint and the application for

injunction.     According   to   the   plaintiff,   they   have   been

wrongfully   dispossessed   from   the   suit   land   and   they   are

claiming   the   possession   of   the   area   of   the   land   of   Dargah

Panch   Peer   back,   as   held   by   the   Dargah   for   the   time

immemorial in the revenue records and as on date and the

government cannot acquire the same for sale purposes.   It is

also     stated   that   the   DDA   in   its   written   statement   has

expressed that the land which is the property of the Durgah


                                  ­:  11  :­
 has been sold out to Defendant no.6 which land of Dargah

was   taken   by   DDA   without   notice   to   the   Plaintiff   and   all

activity   by   NDMC   and   DDA   was   carried   on   between

themselves   on   papers   only   and   knowing   the   fact   that   the

Durgah land cannot be acquired nor it is liable to be sold, yet

this has been done and hence this action of the Defendant and

NDMC has been challenged before this court.   The plaintiff

has   placed   its   reliance   on   the   letter   of   allotment   dated

03.12.1998 where in clause (xi) it has been mentioned that:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            xi) the Allottee shall construct the building

            on   the   area   measuring   0.352   acres   i.e

            1424.50   sq.mtr.   And   the   balance   area

            measuring 3.168 acres will be maintained

            as green.</blockquote><p id="p_16">



</p><p id="p_17">            According to the plaintiff, the green area has to be

kept as it is and no tree is liable to be cut or removed for the

reason   that   it   is   contrary   to   the   terms   of   allotment   and

contrary   to   the   interest   of   Plaintiff   as   green   area   is   the

property of the plaintiff Durgah and all the trees on the green

land of the property of the Durgah Plaintiff as built by the

plaintiff and no part of the green area in measurement of 3

bighas shown red in the application is liable to be interfered

                                  ­:  12  :­
 with or disturbed in any manner and has to be kept in the

same manner as originally existing.  
</p>
<p id="p_18">            I have considered the submissions made by the Ld.

counsels for both the sides.   It is argued by the Ld. counsel

appearing   for   the   plaintiff/applicant   that   the   Dargah   in

question is ancient being almost 200 years old and is situated

on land measuring 3 bighas as shown in the site plan filed

alongwith the suit and that the entire sale consideration has

wrongly been passed to the department.  It is contended that

the   Dargah   land   in   possession   of   the   defendant   no.   6

measuring   3   Bighas   is   liable   to   be   restored   back   and   no

construction activity can be carried out by the defendant no. 6

since   the   department   has   in   para   no.   IX   of   the   letter   of

allotment mentioned that this area is required to be kept as

green but the act of cutting trees by the defendant no. 6 with

the help of other defendants is diminishing the sanctity of the

green belt of the area and no cutting of trees can be allowed in

any   manner   which   is   contrary   to   the   terms   of   allotment.

According   to   the   plaintiff   any   permission   obtained   by   the

department has been procured illegally and by suppression of

material facts and is not implementable in view of the fact that

the user of land as provided in the Master Plan shows that the

area   is   otherwise   required     to   be   maintained   as   green   and


                                  ­:  13  :­
 therefore any permission obtained by the defendant no.6 is in

violation of the Master plan.
</p>
<p id="p_19">            It is also argued that the trees which are proposed to

be felled are  on the land of Dargah and no permission could

otherwise   have   been   granted   by   the   department   of

Environment, Forest and Wild Life, Government of Delhi for

cutting/felling  of trees as it is causing damage to the land of

Dargah   which   was   developed   200   years   ago   in   the

requirement of public.  
</p>
<p id="p_20">            I have considered the arguments advanced before

me at length and also the various authorities placed on record.

Further,   I   have   duly   gone   through   the   provisions   of   Delhi

Municipal Corporation Act, Delhi Development Act and also

perused   the   Master   plan   for   Delhi   2021   as   notified   on

7.2.2007 vide SO No. 141 published in Gazette of India Extra

Ordinary [Part - II - <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_2">Section 3</a> - Sub Section (ii)], Zonal plan

of the area and modified layout plan/ survey plan.   It is not

disputed that the plaintiff has filed the present suit challenging

the allotment made by the defendant no. 2 in respect of 3.52

acres land to the defendant no. 6 claiming that out of the said

land 3 bighas 14 biswas forming part of Khasra No.43 and 44

Arakpur Bagh Mochi Tehsil Mehrauli New Delhi with Old

Khasra   of   land   No.159/4   Mauja   Alipur   Palangi   Hassanpur


                                 ­:  14  :­
 Tehsil   Mehrauli   (Now   Tehsil   Kapashera)   claiming   that   it

belongs   to   the   plaintiff   Dargah   which   is   situated   in   the

vicinity.     Vide   its   suit   the   plaintiff   is   also   seeking   the

cancellation of the said allotment on the ground that the said

allotment is bad in law and is illegal.  It has been pointed out

in the pleadings that by way of notification in the year 1974 a

part of the land in question which has not been allotted to the

defendant no. 6 had been handed over to the DDA though a

part of the said land on which the plaintiff has claimed his

right was never been handed over to the DDA and is free from

acquisition.   According to the plaintiff, the defendant no. 6

without a proper demarcation has constructed a boundary wall

and included the land belonging to the Dargah by demolishing

and destroying the constructed portion of the Dargah.   It is

also   stated   that   earlier   a   suit   for   permanent   injunction   had

been filed against the defendant nos. 2, 3 and 6 seeking to

restrain them from raising any construction which suit is also

pending before the court of Ld. Civil Judge but now since the

land is reported to have been allotted to the defendant no. 6

the   present   suit   has   been   filed   for   recovery   of   possession,

cancellation   of   letter   of   allotment   and   damages.     It   is   also

pointed out that the plaintiff has already moved the court of

the Ld. District &amp; Sessions Judge, Delhi for consolidation of


                                   ­:  15  :­
 both cases filed by the plaintiff i.e. the present suit and also

the   earlier   suit   pending   before   the   Ld.   Civil   Judge   which

application is still pending consideration.

</p><p id="p_21">            The Ld. counsel for the Defendant no. 6 has raised

objections to the ad­interim relief granted to the plaintiff on

various grounds which are as under:
</p>
<p id="p_22">A)     That   no   prior   notice   has   been   given   either   to   the

       defendant   no.   2   L&amp;DO;   defendant   no.   3   DDA;

       defendant no. 5 MCD; defendant no. 7 CPWD and the

       defendant nos. 8 and 9 i.e Commissioner of Police and

       SHO PS Chanakyapuri as required under the provisions

       of   Code   of   Civil   Procedure;   Delhi   Municipal

       Corporation Act, Delhi Development Act, 1957 and the

       <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_3">Delhi Police Act</a>;
</p>
<p id="p_23">B)     That the plaintiff has not filed the adequate court fees as

       required under the law and hence the suit is barred by

       the provisions of Section 7 of the Suit Valuation Act

       and <a href="/doc/115767185/" id="a_4">Section 8</a> of the Court Fees Act;
</p>
<p id="p_24">C)     That   there   has   been   suppression   of   material   facts

       regarding the filing of the earlier suit and the present

       suit   filed   by   the   present   plaintiff   is   barred   by   the

       provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 CPC;
</p>
<p id="p_25">D)     That the order of the Civil Judge has attained finality


                                  ­:  16  :­
      and   the   plaintiff   cannot   file   a   subsequent   suit   to   re­

     agitate the aspects raised in the earlier petition wherein

     the relief has been denied to them;
</p>
<p id="p_26">E)   That the act of the defendant no. 6 in felling and cutting

     of trees is in accordance with the due process of law

     since the defendant no. 6 has a valid permission from

     the competent authority and in case if the plaintiff is so

     aggrieved   by   the   said   permission/   approval   the   only

     remedy   available   to   them   is   under   Section   14   of   the

     Preservation of Trees Act and this court will have no

     jurisdiction to look into the said aspect;

F)   That   the   defendant   no.   6   has   a   valid   right,   title   and

     interest over the land in question which has been validly

     allotted to them by following due process of law and the

     plaintiff would have no locus standi to either challenge

     the said allotment or to seek interim relief asked for by

     them.
</p>
<p id="p_27">G)   That no injunction can be granted to the plaintiff as the

     suit itself is not maintainable and also since there is no

     prima facie case or balance of convenience in favour of

     the plaintiff and no irreparable loss is being caused to

     them.

<p id="p_55">

</p><p id="p_56">           I have gone through the pleadings of the parties; the

various documents pertaining to the allotment of land to the

defendant no.6; the Revenue records placed before me by the

plaintiff and the detailed written synopsis of arguments filed

by the plaintiff and the defendant no.6.  I have also given my

consideration   to   the   oral   submissions   made   by   the   Ld.

Counsel and have duly perused the Master Plan­2001 &amp; 2021

Zonal plan and the Survey Plan/ Lay out plan of the area.  My

Prima facie observations on the various grounds raised by the

defendant no. 6/ applicant in the application under Order 39

Rule 4 CPC are as under:­


A.         That no prior notice has been given either to the 
           defendant no. 2 L&amp;DO; defendant no. 3 DDA; 
           defendant no. 5 MCD; defendant no. 7 CPWD 
           and the defendant nos. 8 and 9 i.e Commissioner 
           of Police and SHO PS Chanakyapuri as required 
           under the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure; 
           Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, Delhi 
           Development Act, 1957 and the <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_21">Delhi Police Act</a>.


</p><p id="p_57">                              ­:  20  :­
              It has been vehemently argued by the Ld.  counsel

for the defendant no. 6 that no prior notice under Section 80

of CPC, DMC Act and DD Act has been given by the plaintiff

to the defendants prior to the filing of present suit which has

been   denied   by   the   counsel   for   the   plaintiff.     I   have   gone

through the pleadings and it is evident that in the replication

to the written statement of defendant no. 1 and 2 the plaintiff

has   very   specifically   stated   that   the  legal   notice   has   been

duly served on all the defendants as required under the

law.     In  fact   the   defendant  no.   3  DDA   has   not   raised  any

objection this aspect regarding non service of the notice upon

them as per the <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_22">Section 53</a> B (1) of the DD Act in the written

statement.   Copy of the legal notice dated 19.3.2003 sent to

the Union of India, L&amp;DO, DDA. MCD and Delhi Police has

been placed on record alongwith the AD cards as a proof of

service.  The DDA in its written statement has not raised any

dispute regarding non service of the notice, therefore under

these circumstances the defendant no. 6 cannot be allowed to

raise this issue of non service of prior notice u/s. 53 B (1) of

DD Act upon DDA.  Even otherwise any dispute on the aspect

of   non   service   is   a   dispute   of   facts   which   can   only   be

determined   after   parties   have   lead   evidence   on   the   same.

</p><p id="p_58">                                   ­:  21  :­
 Merely because an oral objection has been raised by one of

the defendants now at this stage of arguments on application

U/o 39 rule 1 and 2 will be no ground to dismiss the claim of

the plaintiff at the preliminary stage. 
</p>
<p id="p_59">


B.           That the plaintiff has not filed the adequate court 
             fees as required under the law and hence the suit 
             is barred by the provisions of Section 7 of the Suit 
             Valuation Act and <a href="/doc/115767185/" id="a_23">Section 8</a> of the Court Fees 
             Act.
</p>
<p id="p_60">

             It is argued by the Ld. Counsel for the defendant

no.6   that   the   plaintiff   has   not   correctly   valued   the   suit   for

purposes of court fee.  I have gone through the pleadings and

it is evident from paragraph 13 and 14 of the plaint that the

plaintiff has valued the suit for pecuniary jurisdiction on the

basis of the damages which they are claiming and the court

fee has also been accordingly affixed.  In so far as the relief

no. (i) and (ii) are concerned a fixed court fee as required has

been affixed and for the relief no. (iii) ad­valorem court fees

is affixed.   In respect of the additional relief claimed by the

plaintiff   after   the   amendment   of   suit,   the   plaintiff   has   also

affixed additional court fee in respect of the relief no. (iv).

Even otherwise the objection raised by the defendant no. 6 in

                                    ­:  22  :­
 their written statement is vague and the defendant no. 6 has

not specified as to how the court fees affixed by the plaintiff

is inadequate or not proper.   Whereas on the other hand the

plaintiff in its pleadings in paragraph 13 and 14 of the plaint

has specifically given the valuation both for the purposes of

court   fees   and   jurisdiction/   which   court   fees   has   also   been

affixed.  
</p>
<p id="p_61">             Even   otherwise   whether   the   court   fee   affixed   is

proper or not is a mixed question of fact and law on which a

specific issue has already been framed.  It is also a settled law

that   in   case   of   deficiency   of   court   fee   an   opportunity   is

required   to   be   given   to   the   plaintiff   to   make   up   the   said

deficiency,   if   any   and   under   no   circumstances   an   order   of

rejection   of   plaint   can   be   passed   without   giving   such   an

opportunity.   Hence, I do not find any merit in the ground

raised before me.  
</p>
<p id="p_62">

C.           That there has been suppression of material facts 
             regarding the filing of the earlier suit and the 
             present suit filed by the present plaintiff is barred 
             by the provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 CPC.
</p>
<p id="p_63">

             It is also argued by the counsel for the defendant

no. 6 that firstly there has been a suppression of material facts

                                   ­:  23  :­
 from   this   court   regarding   filing   of   the   earlier   suit   for

permanent   injunction   which   is   still   pending   before   the   Ld.

Civil Judge and secondly that the present suit of the plaintiff

is barred as per the provision of Order 2 Rule 2 CPC.  The Ld.

counsel for the plaintiff has on the other hand pointed out that

there   is   no   suppression   as   alleged   since   the   fact   regarding

filing of the  earlier  suit for injunction before the Ld.  Civil

Judge has been very specifically mentioned in para 8 and 9 of

the plant.   He has also placed his reliance on para 12 of the

earlier suit pending before the Ld. Civil Judge wherein the

plaintiff has specifically contended that he would be raising

his other claims later.
</p>
<p id="p_64">            I have gone through the plaint and it is evident from

paragraphs 8 and 9 of the same that the plaintiff has in para 8

specifically   averred   that   on   5.11.2001   a   civil   suit   for

permanent injunction and mandatory injunction had been filed

by the Gaddi Nashin, Abdul Malik of the Dargah alongwith

the members of his family against the CSOI, DDA and L&amp;DO

from raising or permitting the raising of any construction at

the Dargah place of Dargah Panch Peer, Ground Floor, Near

Vinay Marg, Petrol Pump &amp; Football Ground, Chanakyapuri,

New Delhi.  
</p>
<p id="p_65">            Further, it is also evident from the pleadings that a

                                  ­:  24  :­
 specific   averment   had   been   made   in   paragraph   12   of   the

earlier   petition   filed   by   the   plaintiff   Dargah   for   permanent

injunction that the said suit was filed only in respect of the

limited relief of injunction which may not be treated as a bar

under   order   2   Rule   2   for   further   specific   relief   which   the

plaintiff may claim after due notice to the defendants no. 1, 2

and 3.  The relevant portion i.e paragraph 12 of the earlier suit

filed   by   the   plaintiff   before   the   Civil   Judge   which   finds   a

mention in the pleadings of the plaintiff, is as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           "....   The   suit   filed   is   limited   to   relief   of

           injunction and may not be treated as a bar

           under   Order   2   Rule   2   CPC   for   further

           specific which the plaintiffs claim after due

           notice to the defendants no. 1, 2 and 3 as

           required   by   law   or   for   invoking   the

           jurisdiction of the Hon'ble High Court of

           Delhi at New Delhi for a writ jurisdiction

           as   the   present   action   of   Defendants   is

           without service of prior intimation on the

           Plaintiff's are giving them with any prior

           show   cause   notices   as   required   by   law

           under   the   Delhi   Development   Act,   New

           Delhi,   Municipal   Council   Act   and

                                    ­:  25  :­
             Municipal   Corporation   of   Delhi   Act   as

            well as <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_24">Delhi Police Act</a>.</blockquote><p id="p_66">



</p><p id="p_67">             It is evident from the above that the plaintiff did not

relinquish any portion of his claim in the earlier suit filed by

him   for   permanent   injunction   rather   on   the   contrary   they

reserved their rights to claim the other reliefs after giving a

prior   notice   to   the   government   as   required   under   law   and

limited   their   claim   in   the   earlier   suit   only   to   the   relief   of

permanent injunction before the civil court.  In this regard the

law laid down in the judgments in the case of <a href="/doc/662310/" id="a_25">Meena Rani vs.

Ajaib Singh (Supra</a>) and in the case of <a href="/doc/1188173/" id="a_26">Ashoka Builders &amp;

Promotors vs. Edward and Keventer (Successors) P. Ltd.

(Supra</a>) is very clear. Once the suit for permanent injunction

has been filed only on a limited aspect wherein the plaintiff

has   specifically  reserved  his   right   to   file   a   separate   suit   in

respect of his other claims after due notice to government as

required under  law, then  there will  not  exit  any  bar to  the

subsequent suit as in the present case.  Therefore, under these

circumstances primafacie there is no suppression of material

facts regarding the earlier litigation since the fact has been

specifically pleaded in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the plaint and

also the provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 CPC apparently be not

                                     ­:  26  :­
 applicable.

<p id="p_68">

D.           That the order of the Civil Judge has attained 
             finality and the plaintiff cannot file a subsequent 
             suit to re­agitate the aspects raised in the earlier 
             petition wherein the relief has been denied to 
             them.
</p>
<p id="p_69">

             It is also argued by the Ld. counsel appearing for

the defendant no. 6 that the order of the Ld. Civil Judge has

attained finality and would operate as a rejudicata.   In this

regard the Ld. counsel for the defendant no.6,  has argued that

in the suit before the Ld. Civil Judge for permanent injunction

which   is  still   sub­judice   the   order   passed   by  the   Ld.   court

declining the interim relief to the plaintiff on the ground that

they   have   not   been   able   to   place   any   valid   documentary

records   in   respect   of   their   title   has   now   become   final   and

cannot be re­agitated.  The ld. counsel for the plaintiff has on

the other hand argued that any order passed on an application

under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC does not come in the way

of   seeking   a   fresh   order   of   injunction   on   a   fresh   cause   of

action and is not barred by the provisions of resjudicata.  It is

an admitted case that the initial suit for permanent injunction

filed by the plaintiff is still pending before the court of Civil


                                   ­:  27  :­
 Judge where the application U/o 39 rule 1 and 2 is yet to be

disposed off and the order of the Ld. Civil Judge declining to

grant relief was an order at the initial stage where the plaintiff

had pressed for the grant of an ad­interim injunction.   That

order is reproduced as under :

<p id="p_76">

            It is also not disputed that an application has been

filed before the Ld. District Judge, Delhi for consolidation of

both the cases i.e. the initial suit for permanent injunction and

the   present   suit   which   application   for   consolidation   is   still

pending disposal before the Ld. District Judge, Delhi.   It is

also admitted that the suit filed by the plaintiff is still pending

before the Ld. Civil Judge and there has been no final disposal

so much so that even the application U/o 39 rule 1 and 2 has

not been disposed off, therefore under these circumstances the

order of the Ld. Civil Judge refusing the grant of ad­interim

injunction would not act as resjudicata.   Even otherwise the

subsequent application is in respect of a fresh cause of action

which occurred in the year 2008.   Admittedly the cause of

action   in   the   earlier   suit   had   when   the   boundary   wall   was

being constructed by the defendant no. 6 on the disputed land

and one Abdul Wahid the resident of the Dargah was stated to

have  been abducted by  the   defendant   therein on  which  the

plaintiff only sought a limited relief of permanent injunction.

Now since the allotment of the land is under challenge in the

present suit where the plaintiff is asking for the cancellation

                                  ­:  29  :­
 of   the   documents   therefore   the   subsequent   act   of   the

defendant no. 6 in felling/ cutting down of trees standing on

the land whose allotment is under challenge before this court,

gives   rise   to   a   fresh   cause   of   action   having   subsequently

arisen and any observation made by the  Ld. Civil Judge in the

suit for injunction declining the ad­interim relief would not

come in the way of this court as resjudicate.  


E.          That the act of the defendant no. 6 in felling and 
            cutting of trees is in accordance with the due 
            process of law since the defendant no. 6 has a 
            valid permission from the competent authority 
            and in case if the plaintiff is so aggrieved by the 
            said permission/ approval the only remedy 
            available to them is under Section 14 of the 
            Preservation of Trees Act and this court will have 
            no jurisdiction to look into the said aspect



            It  has been argued by the learned counsel for the

defendant   no.6   that   there   is   an   exemption   vide   notification

dated 22.10.2007 regarding felling of 185 trees on the land in

question   and   a   valid   permission   has   been   granted   by   the

competent   authority  i.e  Dy.  Conservator   Forest   pursuant   to

which only the trees have been proposed to be felled.  On the

other hand the Ld. counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiff


                                 ­:  30  :­
 has argued that initially when the plaintiffs had approached

this court in the application under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC

they were not aware that any exemption or permission which

had been granted to the defendant no. 3 for felling/ cutting

down the trees on the property in question and it was only

when the defendant no. 6 filed the present application under

Order 39 rule 4 CPC and also their reply to the application

under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC that they came to know

about the said exemption and approval which the plaintiff is

now challenging.  It is also argued that the trees standing on

the land are the properties of the Dargah which were planted

by   the   Gaddi   Nassins   of   the   Dargah   for   greenry   purposes.

According   to   the   Ld.   counsel   for   the   plaintiff   that   the

permission has been obtained by the defendant no. 6 from the

competent authority by suppressing certain material facts and

also by furnishing incorrect and misleading information.  It is

also argued that the exemption and permission so granted is

not  in accordance with law by following the due procedure as

prescribed under Section 9 of the Preservation of Trees Act

and hence the same is liable to be set aside.  

</p><p id="p_77">            The   Ld.   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the

defendant no. 6 has advanced two fold arguments.   Firstly,

that  this court will have no jurisdiction to examine the aspect

                                 ­:  31  :­
 of   the   legality   or   illegality   of   the   permission/   approval   so

granted by the competent authority in view of the provisions

of Section 14 of the Preservation of Trees Act which aspect

can only be agitated before a separate authority so specified

under   the   Act.    Secondly  that   exemption/   permission   so

granted by the competent authority under the Preservation of

Trees   Act   has   been   validly   granted   after   following   due

process   of   law   and   that   nothing   has   been   concealed   or

suppressed as alleged.  
</p>
<p id="p_78">            I have considered the submissions made before me.

It is evident from the material placed on the judicial file and

also produced before this court by the Conservator of Forests,

NCT of Delhi that the  exemption / permission so granted was

pursuant   to   the   request   made   by   the   Union   of   India   on

13.7.2007.     It   is   also   apparent   from   the   record   that   on

23.7.2007   Sh.   J.K.   Dadoo,   Secretary   (Environment)   had

communicated to the Joint Secretary, Government of India,

Ministry of Personnel and Training of having got the matter

examined through the Conservator of Forest and he had asked

the Joint Secretary, Government of Ministry of Personnel and

Training to provide him with the following information:

defendant no. 6 the case was processed and the notification

dated 22.10.2007 was issued and the permission was granted

for removing of 185 trees on 27.2.2008.   Copy of the said

exemption   and   permission   has   been   placed   on   the   judicial

amending the plaint.

<p id="p_81">           It is evident that the Deputy Conservator (Forest)

Sh. R.S. Sinha an authority created under  Section 2 of the

Preservation of Trees Act had appeared before this court on

2.5.2008 and the Conservator (Forest) Sh. D.M. Shukla had

                                 ­:  33  :­
 also appeared on 6.5.2008 and informed this court that the

competent   authority/   NCT   of   Delhi,   Department   of

litigation regarding the land allotted by the Ministry of Urban

Development   to   the   CSOI   and   rather   on   the   contrary   the

General Manager, CSOI i.e defendant no.6 had written to the

Deputy   Conservator   (Forest)   on   25.7.2007   stating   that   the

land was free from all litigations.  Relevant extract of the said

communication is as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">           ".... As already informed, the land in question has

           been allotted by the Ministry of Urban Development

           procure stay order from the Court, which has been

           refused   by   the   Court   concerned.    This   is   further

           clarified  that   there  is  no  litigation   regarding  the

           land   allotted   to   CSOI   by   the   Ministry   of   Urban

           Development ........</blockquote><p id="p_82">

</p><p id="p_83">             This court has been specifically informed by the

                                ­:  34  :­
 counsel appearing on behalf of the Conservator Forest, NCT

of Delhi, that the Lt. Governor who is the competent authority

under the Act had granted the exemption on 22.10.2007 and

the subsequent approval dated 27.2.2008 on the basis of the

repeated information furnished by the CSOI i.e the defendant

no. 6 firstly on 25.7.2007 thereafter and 25.2.2008 alongwith

the supporting affidavit that there was no litigation pending in

any   court   and   had   the   NCT   of   Delhi/   competent   authority

been aware of the present litigation things might have been

otherwise.  
</p>
<p id="p_84">             It is further evident from the documents placed on

record that as per the terms and condition of allotment of the

land, the defendant no. 6 CSOI was also required to submit a

no objection certificate from the Airport Authority; CE (E)

NDMC;   CE   (C)   NDMC;   Tree   Officer   for   cutting   of   trees

alongwith   the   intimation   of   commencement   of   work

mentioned at serial no. 3 (regarding erection of building as

per by­laws).  On the date when the cause of action arose i.e

on 16.3.2008 there was no such objection and the the said No

Objection certificate was issued by the Dy. L&amp;DO only on

24.4.2008 while the application under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2

CPC and subsequent application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC

filed   by   the   defendant   no.   6   were   being   argued   and   were


                                 ­:  35  :­
 pending disposal before this Court.  This permission/ approval

which has been given by the L&amp;DO i.e defendant no. 2 to the

defendant no. 6 during the pendency of the present application

only after the issue regarding the acts of defendant no. 6  of

cutting and felling of trees came under judicial scrutiny before

this court.  
</p>
<p id="p_85">                It   is   further   evident   from   the   provisions   of   the

Preservation of Trees Act and it is apparent that the Act does

not specifically bar the jurisdiction of the civil court and only

an alternative forum is created under the Act for challenging

the order of the Competent Authority passed under <a href="/doc/1108359/" id="a_27">Section

9</a>,<a href="/doc/351007/" id="a_28">10</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/645655/" id="a_29">11</a> of the Act.  Therefore once the issues relating to the

jurisdiction   of   the   competent   authority,   grant   of   exemption

and of procedure adopted by the authority while passing the

order have been raised then under those circumstances there is

no bar to the jurisdiction of the civil court for entertaining

such   a   plea   and   the   extent   to   which   the   Civil   Court   can

thereafter exercise its jurisdiction becomes a mixed question

of both and fact which cannot be decided at this stage.  Even

otherwise in the present case the exemption notification dated

22.10.2007 is under the provisions of  <a href="/doc/311830/" id="a_30">Section 29</a> of the Act

which does not fall within the scope and ambit of Section

14   of   the   Preservation   of   Trees   Act  since   the   authority

                                    ­:  36  :­
 created under <a href="/doc/1530876/" id="a_31">Section 14</a> of the Act has a limited jurisdiction

of dealing with challenge to orders passed under <a href="/doc/1108359/" id="a_32">Section 9</a>,<a href="/doc/351007/" id="a_33">10</a>

and <a href="/doc/645655/" id="a_34">11</a> of the Act.  Therefore, there is no legislative intention

in the form of express indication of the statutory exclusion of

the jurisdiction of civil court and primafacie it is only a Civil

Court   who   would   have   the   jurisdiction   and   competence   to

examine the aspect of legality of the said notification granting

exception  issued   under  the   provisions  of   Section  29  of   the

Prevention of Trees Act.  
</p>
<p id="p_86">             Coming to the second limb of arguments advanced

by   the   learned   counsel   for   the   defendant   no.6   that   the

exemption   /   permission   has   been   granted   to   them   after

following due process of law, it is evident that Government of

NCT   of   Delhi,   Department   of   Forest   who   has   now   been

allowed to be brought on record as defendants No.9 after an

amendment   was   duly   heard   after   its   officers   i.e   the   Dy.

Conservator   Forest   and   the   Conservator   Forest   had   been

summoned by this Court alongwith their records during the

hearing which records revealed that the General Manager of

the   CSOI   i.e   defendant   no.6   had   furnished   incorrect

information to the Dy. Conservator Forest in respect of the

specific query sought to them by the concerned officer with

regard   to   the   pending   litigation   vide   their   communication


                                ­:  37  :­
 dated   25.7.2007   denying   that   there   was   any   litigation

regarding the land allotted to CSOI by Urban Development

Ministry.  The intent and object of the Preservation of Trees

Act   is   to   ensure   the   protection   and   preservation   to   the

environment and maintenance of the green.   The Court and

also the Competent Authority created under the Act are under

an   obligation   to   ensure   that   no   one   is   allowed   to   act   in   a

manner which is detrimental to the environment, society and

to the objectives enshrined under this special legislation i.e

Preservation of Trees Act.  Primafacie the exemption has been

granted   by  the   Competent   Authority  and  the   Lt.   Governor,

Delhi on the basis of incorrect information supplied by the

defendant   no.   6   regarding   the   pendency   of   the   present

litigation in which there is a challenge to the allotment made

by the defendant no.2 to the defendant no.6 and a prayer has

been   made   for   cancellation   of   the   same.   Misleading

information has been given by the defendant no.6 to the said

authority on 25.7.2007 and subsequently again on 25.2.2008

on affidavit on the basis of which the Govt. of NCT of Delhi

i.e the newly added defendant No.9 who is yet to file their

Written Statement appears to have been induced into granting

such an exemption and the subsequent permission.  Therefore,

I   do   not   find   any   merit   in   the   contentions   raised   by   the


                                    ­:  38  :­
 defendant  No.6  in their   application  under  Order  39 Rule   4

CPC   that   the   permission   and   exemption   was   given   after

following due process of law rather on the contrary it was

primafacie   given   on   the   basis   of   wrong   and   misleading

information   provided   to   the   competent   authority   by   the

defendant no. 6 on affidavit.
</p>
<p id="p_87">

F.            That the defendant no. 6 has a valid right, title 
              and  interest over the land in question which has 
              been validly allotted to them by following due 
              process of law and the plaintiff would have no 
              locus standi to either challenge the said 
              allotment or to seek interim relief asked for by 
              them.
</p>
<p id="p_88">

              It is also argued by the counsel of the defendant

no. 6 that they had have a valid right, title and interest over

the land in question being the valid allottees of the same.  It is

contended that the plaintiff himself is a trespasser/ encroacher

and has no locus standi to approach this court, much less seek

the relief as sought for in the plaint.  On the other hand it is

argued  by   the   Ld.   Counsel   for   the   plaintiff   that  firstly  the

plaintiff which is a Dargah in the area is claiming their right

over   3   bighas   14   biswas   out   of   the   land   allotted   to   the



                                  ­:  39  :­
 defendant   no.   6  which   is  stated   to   be   in   possession   of   the

Dargah   since   times   immemorial   a   fact   which   would   be

evident from the various revenue documents including the site

plan, Fard Jamabandi of the year 1908­09.  Secondly that the

allotment has been made illegally and without following due

process of law.
</p>
<p id="p_89">              Coming to the argument raised by the counsel for

respondent no.6 regarding the CSOI being legal allottee of the

land in dispute.   I have gone  through the master Plan, Zonal

Plan,   Layout   Plan   and  Survey  Report   on  which   documents

there is no dispute and all the parties are admitting the same.

It is necessary to highlight that in the Master Plan 2021 the

land   use   under   the   Head   Recreational   the   land   use   for

Category P­1 is for regional park; for Category P­2 is for City

park, District park, Community center and for Category P­3 is

for historical monuments.   Perusal of the  Master Plan for

Delhi   2021  shows   that   the   site   in  question   falls   under  P­2

Category, which land use is shown to be Recreational meant

for City Park, District Park, Community Center.   

</p><p id="p_90">              Similarly   in   the  Zonal   Plan  land   use   has   been

shown as recreation and includes the Children park, District

park, Play ground, Stadium, Sports complex, Regional park,

Historical monuments, Neighbourhood Play area/ green space

                                  ­:  40  :­
 and divisional sports center with a permissive user in the sub

zone   as   Recreational   Club.     In   the   General   lay   out   plan/

survey plan initially the area in question was shown as a green

area   but   I   am   informed   that   as   per   the   notification/

amendment the land has been shown to be allotted to CSOI

for Recreational Club.  
</p>
<p id="p_91">             Perusal of the letter of allotment bearing No. L­II

17 (45)/98/775 dated 3.12.1998 of the defendant no. 2 L&amp;DO

allotting the land measuring 3.52 acres to the defendant no. 6

shows that it has been given to the defendant no. 6 for setting

up of a Club in the Area.  By way of the said allotment the

defendant no. 6 has been allowed to construct a building and

the allottee has been asked to pay the cost of land @ Rs.80/­

lakh   per   acres   for   the   land   on   which   the   club   building   be

constructed and 2 ½ % Ground Rent per annum thereon and

further   the   allottee   will   pay   provisionally   a   license   fee   @

Rs.5,000/­   per   acres   per   annum   for   the   land  maintained   as

"green".   It is also clarified that the allottee would construct

the building on the area measuring 0.352 acres i.e. 1424.50

Sq.   meters   and   the   remaining   area   is   required   to   be

maintained as green.  
</p>
<p id="p_92">             I have gone through the annexure 6/H which is the

proposed building plan of the club which shows that there is a

                                   ­:  41  :­
 proposal   of   constructing   Squash   Courts,   swimming   pools

alongwith concrete building for the club.  Though in the plan

of   the   proposed   building   placed   before   this   court   by   the

defendant no. 6 which is Annexure 6/H it has been mentioned

that 20 trees are required to be felled in the area yet it is now

evident from the exemption given by the NCT of Delhi and

the permission of the competent authority that infact there are

185 trees existing in the area for which the exemption has

been taken for felling.  
</p>
<p id="p_93">            The issues involved before this court are two fold.

Firstly  whether a part of the land in question measuring 3

bighas 14 biswas belonging to the plaintiff Dargah or not and

secondly  whether the allotment of the land in question has

been legally and validly made by following due process of

law.  
</p>
<p id="p_94">            In   so   far   as   the  first  aspect   is   concerned   the

plaintiff has placed before this court the certified copy of the

various revenue documents to show his primafacie right over

the land in question.   At this stage it is not possible for this

court   to   comment   on   the   correctness   or   falsity   of   the   said

revenue   records   whose   certified   copies   have   been   placed

before this court since the same is a disputed question of fact

and a specific issue has already been framed in this regard.  

</p><p id="p_95">                                  ­:  42  :­
             However,   in   so   far   as   the  Second  aspect   is

concerned, in addition to and without derogation to the first

aspect even if presuming that the plaintiff has not been able to

show his right over the 3 bighas 14 biswas of the land being

claimed by it yet it is not disputed that the plaintiff Dargah is

in   existence   at   the   site   where   the   Khadims   and   Mujawars

reside.   Therefore,   being   the   users   of   the   land   in   question

which user in the Master Plan and Zonal Plan has been shown

for District Park the validity of the allotment can always be

challenged by them in the court of law in their capacity as the

beneficiaries/ stake holders of the land in question.  

</p><p id="p_96">            Now   examining   the   aspect   of   legality   of   the

allotment   made   to   the   defendant   no.   6  firstly  both   the

defendant no. 1 and the defendant no 3 admit that the land in

question had been handed over to the DDA in the year 1974

by way of Notification no. 1810 dated 12.7.1974 as site no.

46  measuring approximately 18.0 acres  for maintenance as

green.  During the course of arguments a specific query had

been   put   by   this   court   to   the   officers   and   the   counsels

appearing on behalf of the defendant no. 2 and 3 as to whether

any   subsequent   notification   had   been   issued   after   the   year

1974   superseeding   the   earlier   notification   no.   1810   and

replacing the land in favour of defendant no. 2 to which both

                                 ­:  43  :­
 the counsels have on specific instructions from their officers

stated that there is no such notification.   It is stated that the

land had been taken back by the defendant no. 2 from the

defendant   no.   3   i.e.   DDA   pursuant   to   an   office

communication.  
</p>
<p id="p_97">             Ld. counsel appearing on behalf of the DDA Sh.

K.D. Sharma has vehemently argued that the land in question

has   not   been   taken   back   in   accordance   with   the   statutory

procedure   established   by   law   and   hence   is   deemed   to   be

continuing under the control and maintenance of the DDA.

He has pointed out that the land in question being a Nazul

land once being placed under the disposal of the DDA can

only   be   taken   back   from   the   DDA   by   way   of   subsequent

notification   as   per   the   provisions   of   <a href="/doc/1442227/" id="a_35">Section   22</a>   (4)   of   the

Delhi   Development   Act   which   notification   has   not   been

issued till date pursuant to any agreement as required under

the law.  
</p>
<p id="p_98">             Ld. counsel appearing on behalf of the defendant

no. 2 has argued that land in question belong to L&amp;DO which

was given to the DDA only for the purposes of maintaining as

green   and   no   subsequent   notification   is   required.     It   is

submitted that even otherwise it was for the defendant no. 3

DDA to have issued a notification in the official gazette and


                                   ­:  44  :­
 not having issued the same they cannot now be allowed to

take a contrary stand before this court.
</p>
<p id="p_99">           I   have   considered   the   submissions   made   by   the

parties   and  also  the   provisions   of  Section  22  of   the  Delhi

Development Act are as under:

<p id="p_100">

          accordance with the provisions of this Act.</blockquote><p id="p_101">



</p><p id="p_102">           It is an admitted case that the land in question had

 the authority under Sub­Section (1) can only be replaced upon

            the Authority..............</blockquote><p id="p_103">



</p><p id="p_104">            It is also an admitted case between the parties that

there is no subsequent notification u/s. 22 (4) of the DD Act

replacing the land with the government nor the defendants no.

2 and 3 have placed before this court any terms and conditions

agreed   upon   between   them   for   replacing   the   land   at   the

disposal   of   the   defendant   no.   2.     This   being   the   case   the

procedure   as   prescribed   under   the   Delhi   Development   Act



                                  ­:  46  :­
 being of a mandatory nature not having been followed by the

defendants no. 2 and 3, I hold that the subsequent allotment of

the said land to the defendant no. 6 by the defendant no. 2 is

primafacie not in accordance with the procedure prescribed

under the Delhi Development Act.  
</p>
<p id="p_105">             Secondly it is not disputed that the land in question

is falling under the category P­2 in the Master plan which is

for the purposes of district park.  Even in the approved Zonal

Plan  placed   before   this   court   the   land   use   is   shown   to   be

Recreational under the category of a district park.  This shows

that   the   primary   prescribed   land   use   is   for   a   District   Park

intended for public under the head Recreational.  It is evident

from   the   records   of   the   defendant   no.   2   pertaining   to   the

allotment of  the land that as per note  sheet dated 5.2.2001

copy of which is placed on the judicial file that on 26.3.2000

the Urban Development Minister had alongwith the Director

(Civil)   CPWD   and   the   senior   officers,   Chief   Architect

CPWD, L&amp;O, EO, L&amp;DO visited the site during which the

Minster had inquired as to how the the allotment was made in

favour of the CSOI in the district park / open space area.   It

was indicated by him that the allotment of such clubs can be

made only in the area specifically earmarked as 'Club' in the

layout plan and the allotment made to the CSOI perhaps does

                                   ­:  47  :­
 not seem to be in order.   The Urban Development Minister

had   further   desired   that   the   vacant/   ground   area   between

Vinay Marg and Safdarjung airport be surveyed and a detailed

report submitted to him within 2­3 days which directions were

given by him to the DG, CPWD at the spot.  
</p>
<p id="p_106">           Since the record produced before the court did not

reflect  any survey  report  as desired  by the  Minister  hence,

directions were issued by this court to submit the same which

has now been placed before this court.  The said Survey plan

shows the area under dispute as green.   I am informed by

the counsel for the defendant no. 2 that as per the instructions

received by him from the NDMC, that the layout plan has

been modified and the area has now been shown as allotted to

CSOI as Club by the NDMC vide modification/ order dated

28.2.2007.  
</p>
<p id="p_107">           It is a settled principle of law that any amendment

or modifications in the layout plan which is in violation of the

Master Plan or Zonal Plan of the area is per­se illegal.  One of

the main intent of the Master Plan 2001 was to maintain the

ecological   balance.     Similarly   Master   Plan   2021   envisages

that a large no. of organized play fields and other ecological

wealth   could   be   developed/   saved   for   appropriate

environment and healthy living.   Both in Master Plan 2001

                                ­:  48  :­
 and   Master   Plan   2021   the   area   in   question   is   shown   as   a

District Park.   The intention of the framers of the Master

Plan 2001 and 2021 was to maintain the area in question

as   green   and   to   allow   its   maximum   use   by   the   general

public i.e. people/ residents of the area as a district park

under the Category P­2.  
</p>
<p id="p_108">            By   allotting   the   said   land   to   a   select   privileged

group of persons the land in question looses its character of

public use since it tends to limit and restrict the target group/

beneficiaries which is impermissible in law.  It is a settled law

that  the  land  use  conversion under  the  permissive  category

can be allowed subject to the condition that there is no change

in   the   ultimate   users/   beneficiaries/   stake   holders   which   in

case of P­2 Category under the head of District Park would be

the general public including the local residents (Clause 13.8

of the Master Plan 2021 according to which 5000 Sq. meters

land can be alloted for a Recreational Club for every 5 lac

population).   By virtue of its allotment to a select privileged

group and thereby limiting and restricting the area of use to a

limited   category   of   beneficiaries,   the   allotment   in   question

primafacie is bad in law since it frustrates the objectives of the

Master Plan which authorizes the use of the land as a District


                                  ­:  49  :­
 Park  whose stake holders are the residents of  the  area and

general public.
</p>
<p id="p_109">             Thirdly, it is evident from the constitution of the

defendant no. 6 and its aims and objectives of the CSOI that

the membership of the association is confined to the serving

and retired officers of the grade of Deputy Secretary to the

Government of India and above from All India Services and

Group   'A'   Officers   of   equivalent   status   working   under   the

Central   Government   and   those   on   deputation   to   PSUs   and

autonomous   institutions   located   in   Delhi   subject   to   the

approval   of   the   governing   Council/   Executive   Committee

which in itself shows that the beneficiaries are a select group

and limited in number and the allotment of the land is for a

club whose benefit does not reach out to general public or the

residents   of   the   area.     Therefore   the   mere   use   of   the   term

Recreational   Club  as   provided   under  Clause   13.8  of   the

Master Plan 2021 by the CSOI will not per­se have the effect

of bringing the  CSOI ­  Club within the  purview of  Clause

13.8 of the Master Plan 2021 so as to allow the conversion

and permissive use of land under the category 9.6 since as per

the provisions of Clause 13.8 of the Master Plan 2021 where

Planning   Norms   and   Standards   for   Socio­Cultural   facilities

provide that for   every 5 lac population  plot area is required

                                   ­:  50  :­
 to   be   5000   sqm.   per   unit   i.e.   approximately   1.25   acres.

Hence,   under   no   circumstances   can   the   use   of   the   land   be

restricted even if the conversion is allowed?    

</p><p id="p_110">            Fourthly the defendants have failed to place before

this court permission of land use change which is mandatory

without which no conversion or change of user is permissible.

</p><p id="p_111">            Lastly,   there   are   repeated   observations   by   the

Hon'ble Apex Court and by the various High Courts including

the Delhi High Court impressing upon the need to maintain

the green areas and parks in all the towns and cities to protect

environment   and   ecology.     Any   concretization   in   the   area

under   the   garb   of   construction   of   recreational   club   for   a

limited class of persons would per­se be violative of the said

directions of the Apex Court and the intent of the Master plan

and Zonal plan.  
</p>
<p id="p_112">            Harmonization   of   the   issue   of   ecology   and

development project is the order of the day and need of the

hour as  observed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/1898591/" id="a_38">Goa   Foundation,   Goa   vs.   Diksha   Holding   Pvt.   Ltd</a>.

reported in AIR 2001 SC 184.  Therefore, it becomes the duty

of the court to ensure that all efforts are made to reconcile and

harmonize the ecology with development so as to ensure that

the   environment   is   not   adversely   affected.     In   the   case   of

                                  ­:  51  :­
 <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_39">M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India</a>  in IA No. 34 Writ Petition

no. 4677/1986 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that

the permissive use of the parks being recreational under the

Master Plan cannot be permitted for any other use.  Recently

the   Delhi   High   Court   has   in   the   case   of  Green   Park

Extension   RWA   vs.   MCD  in  writ   petition   (Civil)   No.

1386/06 decided on 22.4.2008 by relying upon the directions

of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of M.C. Mehta vs.

Union of India  (Supra)  directed the demolition of Election

Commission   Office   which   had   come   up   in   the   green   area/

park.  
</p>
<p id="p_113">              The  Ld.   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the

defendant no.6 has also argued that the plaintiff has no locus

standi   to   seek   the   relief   of   injunction   as   he   is   himself   an

encroacher.  It is evident from the pleadings that the plaintiff

is staking his claim to the land in question on the basis of the

revenue  documents i.e Fard Jamabandi which is of the year

1908­09 certified copy of  which is present on record.  There

is also no dispute on the aspect that the Dargah has been in

existence at the site since long and the dispute is only with

regard  to  the  extend of   area   which  is  in  occupation  of   the

plaintiff Dargah.   According to the defendants the plaintiffs


                                    ­:  52  :­
 have encroached the additional land around the Dargah which

land already stood acquired which aspect has been denied and

therefore is a disputed question of fact and a triable issue.  

</p><p id="p_114">            It is also not disputed that the allotment of the land

to the defendant no. 6 was made on "as is where is" basis as

evident   from   from   the   allotment   record   placed   before   this

court by the defendant no.2 and it was only later that certain

constructions made by the plaintiff Dargah were demolished

and a boundary wall constructed by the defendant no.6 when

the plaintiff rushed to the court and filed the earlier suit for

injunction.  Therefore under these circumstances at this stage

of the disposal of the application U/o 39 rule 1 and 2 CPC and

application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC when this court is

confronted with two sets of documents it would be improper

for this court to  jump to any conclusion regarding the rights

and liabilities of the litigating parties.   However in so far as

the aspect of locus standi and maintainability of the suit are

concerned   it   is   prima   facie   evident   that   the   plaintiff   is

claiming   its   right   over   the   land   in   question   as   a   Dargah

covered under a Wakf on basis of revenue documents.  Even

otherwise the right of the plaintiff to challenge the legality of

the allotment of the land in question can  not be taken away

even if the issue of locus standi is ultimately decided against

                                  ­:  53  :­
 the   plaintiff   by   virtue   of   the   fact   that   the   plaintiff   Dargah

exists at the site and has a locus  to challenge the legality of

the allotment being violation of the Master Plan and Zonal

Plan.  Therefore, the plaintiff primafacie has the locus standi

to   file   the   present   suit   be   it   in   its   individual   /independent

capacity as the alleged owner or in alternative and without

derogation   to   the   first   in   its   capacity   as   neighbour/   user/

beneficiary of the land.  Further, since the challenge has been

made to the legality of the allotment of land, therefore under

these   circumstances   question   of   locus   standi   at   this   stage

would otherwise become secondary. 
</p>
<p id="p_115">             In view of the aforesaid the observations made by

the Urban Development Minister on 26.3.2000 during his site

visit that the allotment of the land to the defendant no. 6 by

the defendant no.2 does not seem to be in order, appears to be

correct and the said allotment primafacie  made in violation of

the   Master  Plan  and Zonal   Development  Plan and   also  in

violation of the established rules of law and procedure.


G.           That no injunction can be granted to the plaintiff 
             as the suit itself is not maintainable and also since
             there is no prima facie case or balance of 
             convenience in favour of the plaintiff and no ir­
             repairable loss is being caused to them. 
</p>
<p id="p_116">
</p><p id="p_117">                                    ­:  54  :­
              It   is   a   settled   law   that   injunction   is   a   matter   of

equitable jurisdiction for which plaintiff has to show a breach

of law of procedural matter warranting interference.   There

has to be a violation of a right which violation has to be by the

defendant pursuant to which there should be inconvenience

caused to the plaintiff and injury inflicted to his legal right.

The principle enunciated in the case of  Straight Vs. Burn

reported in LR 5 Cha. Ap 165 is that the first requisite to an

injunction is a material injury to a clear legal right.

</p><p id="p_118">             In   order   to   seek   the   relief   of   injunction   it   is

necessary   for   the   plaintiff   to   show   the   existence   of   a

primafacie   case,   balance   of   convenience   and   that   an

irreparable loss would be caused in case if the relief is not

granted.  
</p>
<p id="p_119">             It is a settled law that the proprietary of granting or

refusing injunction depends upon the facts of each case and

general principles of equity as related to injunctions is one of

the   fundamental   prerogative   of   the   courts   and   injunction

should not be made an instrument of oppression and injury

and should be refused when good conscious does not require.

Also, in a case where the grant of injunction is oppressive or

contrary to justice or where it promotes rather than prevent

fraud and injustice  should be refused.   However, in a  case

                                    ­:  55  :­
 where   the   court   is   assured   that   the   operative   effect   of   ad­

interim  would be  wholly without  injustice  or  oppressive  to

either parties and there is a breach of a specific or implied

obligation then this court has sufficient powers to pass any

interlocutory orders where it appears just or convenient.

</p><p id="p_120">             In   the   present   case   the   plaintiff   is   seeking

cancellation of allotment of the 3.52 acres land made to the

defendant   no.   6   by   the   defendant   no.   2   as   being   illegal.

Admittedly the pure questions of law need not be specifically

pleaded.  As already discussed herein above the allotment of

the land made to the defendant no. 6 by the defendant no. 2

appears to be primafacie irregular and illegal for the following

reasons:
</p>
<p id="p_121">

</p><p id="p_122">1.     That there is no notification under <a href="/doc/1442227/" id="a_40">Section 22</a> (4) of the

       DD   Act   replacing   the   land   with   the   defendant   no.   2

       pursuant to an agreement after the earlier notification

       under <a href="/doc/1442227/" id="a_41">Section 22</a> (1) of the Delhi Development Act of

       the year 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_123">2.     It is evident from the constitution of the defendant no. 6

       and their aims and objectives that the use of the land in

       question   has   been   restricted   to   a   select/   privileged

       group.
</p>
<p id="p_124">                                   ­:  56  :­
</p><p id="p_125"> 3.   That the use of land being for a District Park as per the

     Master Plan and the Zonal Development Plan, it cannot

     be allowed an exclusive use by select privileged group

     under the garb of use of term Recreational Club since

     beneficiaries   of   the   same   are   intended   to   be   general

     public/ resident of the area. 
</p>
<p id="p_126">4.   That   the   permission   of   land   use   change   which   is

     mandatory prior to modification of the layout plant has

     not been placed on record.
</p>
<p id="p_127">5.   That   the   land   use   which   is   governed  by  Master   Plan

     2021   and   the   Zonal   Development   Plan   cannot   be

     allowed for any other purpose except what is permitted

     which is for a district park under the P­2 Category or for

     purposes of a Recreational Club and as per the planning

     norms   and   standards   prescribed     in   case   of   5   lacs

     population   per   unit   to   the   plat   area   is   required   to   be

     5000 sq. meter (approximately 1.25 acres) according to

     Clause 13.8 of Master Plan 2021 under the head Socio­

     cultural facilities. In the present case 14,161 Sq. meters

     have been allotted for exclusive use of limited category

     of persons.
</p>
<p id="p_128">

</p><p id="p_129">          We in this nation are all subservient to the Rule of

                                 ­:  57  :­
 Law   and   the   law   of   this   land   would   apply   to   all   alike

howsoever high or powerful a person/ group may be.   The

courts of India are both courts of law and equity and under no

circumstances   this   court   will   allow   a   powerful/   privileged

group to invade any rights of the general public.   In a case

where the legal requirement is to allow the use of land by the

general public/ residents of an area for a particular purpose

which   in   the   present   case   is   for   a   District   Park   with   a

permissive conversion to a Recreational Club for every 5 lac

population (Clause 13.8 of the Master Plan 2021), then this

court has sufficient powers to pass any interlocutory orders to

grant ad­interim injunction against doing of anything which is

contrary   to   the   permissive   user.     No   group   how   so   ever

privileged/ powerful can be allowed and exclusive land use

more   so   when   the     user   as   envisaged   and   the   ultimate

beneficiary/ stake holders in the said land is general public.

</p><p id="p_130">             The   club   which   the   defendant   no.   6   proposes   to

construct   at   the   site   is   for   a   limited/   exclusive   use   of   its

members   seems   to   have   been   deliberately   and   deceptively

shown as a recreational club only to bring the same within the

ambit of the term Recreational Club so used in the Master

Plan in order to justify and legalize the allotment so made by

bringing   it   within   the   category   of   permissive   user   and   it


                                    ­:  58  :­
 appears   that   the   objections   so   raised   by   the   Urban

Development Minister during his site visit on 26.3.2000 was

not without any basis.  Use of the land has to be by the public

whether   as   a   District   Park   or   as   a   Recreational   Club   (as

provided   under   <a href="/doc/692913/" id="a_42">Section   13</a>.8   of   the   Master   Plan   2021)   for

every 5 lac population.
</p>
<p id="p_131">             Hence,  in view  of  the  aforesaid  observations and

the circumstances of the present case where the allotment of

the land made to the defendant no. 6 is under cloud and is

primafacie   irregular   and   illegal,   the   scale   of   equity   tilts   in

favour of granting ad­interim injunction rather than refusing

the same, more so in view of the fact that the environmental

loss caused in terms of felling/ cutting of 70­100 years old

trees   on   non­granting   of   injunction   which   loss   would   be

irreparable.  The balance of convenience lies in favour of the

stake holders/ beneficiaries/ users of the land as prescribed in

the   Master   Plan   and   Zonal   Development   Plan   and   not   in

favour of the allottees i.e. defendant no. 6 whose allotment is

under challenge and in case if the injunction is so refused, loss

in terms of environment and financial wastage is liable to be

irreparable.  This court has sufficient jurisdiction to pass any

interlocutory   orders   specifically   prayed   for,   or   even   if   not

specifically prayed as may be just and convenient in order to


                                   ­:  59  :­
 preserve   and   maintain   the   status   of   the   land/   property   in

dispute till the final adjudication of the issues involved in the

present case.  Hence, I accordingly confirm the interim orders

dated 3.4.2008 and 6.5.2008 and the defendant no. 6 i.e. The

Civil   Services   Officers   Institute   is   restrained   from   cutting

down/ pruning any trees in the disputed property which order

is directed to be implemented through defendants no. 8 and 9

and I also restrain the defendant no. 6 from carrying out any

construction at the spot till the disposal of the suit.
