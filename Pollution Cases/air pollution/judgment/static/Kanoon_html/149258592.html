      These Writ Petitions are filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India praying to quash the impugned order
vide Annx-A passed by the R2 dated 12.6.2014 to this W.P.

      These Writ Petitions coming on for preliminary hearing
this day, Chief Justice made the following:


                          ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">D.H.WAGHELA, CJ (Oral)

</p><p id="p_2">1.    Petitioner has sought to challenge the order dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  3</span>




12.6.2014 of the Karnataka State Pollution Control

Board directing the petitioner to close the industry

forthwith with further direction to disconnect the power

supply and "seize the industry" as also to stop water

supply.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">2. Petitioner has approached this Court on account of

the fact that the appellate authority under the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 is not

available.     It was found from the record and not

disputed that the impugned order was made pursuant

to    the    complaint   dated       16.12.2009   against   the

petitioner and the inspections held in the year 2010. In

spite of such proceedings initiated in the years 2009

and    2010,    petitioner   appears     to   have   continued

operation of their industry, which is admittedly located

within the residential area.         Petitioner only submitted

that they are in the process of shifting their industry to

an industrial area after January 15, 2012, even as a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              4</span>




mahazar was drawn and hearing was held on 10.8.2011

to shift the industry.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.    Under the circumstances, learned counsel for the

petitioner only submitted that petitioner require time of

two more months for shifting of their industry and in

the meantime, petitioner is required to be permitted to

operate at its existing location. No ground or legal basis

is made out for entertaining such request when

admittedly the industry was required to be closed when

it failed to comply with the directions issued to them

and had violated the provisions of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.


</p><p id="p_7">4.    Therefore, petitions are dismissed with liberty to

the petitioner to shift their industry and operate it at the

new location after obtaining necessary consents from

the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. As and

when necessary applications are made for consent, they

may be considered as early as practicable, for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            5</span>




petitioner to re-start their industry in accordance with

law.
