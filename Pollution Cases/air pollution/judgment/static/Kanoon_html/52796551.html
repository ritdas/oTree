</p><p id="p_5">    1. Petitioner claims to be unit holder of Bandsaw Machine
        Mill     situated    at   village    Takiya   Wagam        District
        Pulwama. Petitioner claims that he has been running
        aforesaid Unit right from the year 2003 under proper
        licence, issued by Forest Department. His licence was
        renewed from time to time till 2011. It is stated that he
        applied for renewal of licence after completing all
        requisite formalities, but respondents, instead of
        renewing his licence, directed petitioner to stop operation
        of said unit. This was done by Deputy Commissioner,
        Pulwama, vide his communication no.DCP/SH/11/283-85
        dated 30th July 2011, whereby Divisional Forest Officer,
        Shopian, was directed to stop operation of Bandsaw
        Machine. The aforesaid communication was challenged
        by petitioner in OWP no.1169/2011. The challenge
        succeeded and this Court vide order dated 4th October

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">OWP no.1209/2016                                                 Page 1 of 7</span>
c/w OWP no.1081/2017
       2013, quashed impugned communication dated 30th July
      2011, giving liberty to respondents to proceed in the
      matter in accordance with law, occupying the field after
      affording petitioner an opportunity to show cause against
      proposed action.
</p><p id="p_6">   2. It is further submitted that while OWP no.1169/2011,
      was pending consideration and interim order of status
      quo was in operation, respondent - J&amp;K Pollution
      Control Board, issued an order dated 30th August 2013,
      calling upon petitioner to close down the unit. Petitioner
      challenged aforesaid order passed by respondent Board
      in OWP no.1240/2013, which was disposed of by this
      Court vide order dated 24th September 2013, by providing
      that respondents will not give effect to order impugned
      dated 30th August 2013 and fate whereof will depend on
      the orders to be passed in OWP no.1169/2011. As noted
      above, OWP no.1169/2011 was subsequently disposed of.
</p><p id="p_7">   3. Apart from the petitions, reference of which has been
      made herein above, petitioner had also filed three more
      writ petitions, bearing OWP no.134/2008, 307/2014 and
      427/2014, with a view to avoid adverse orders from
      respondents with regard to closure of his unit. All these
      petitions were clubbed together and were dismissed by
      this Court vide order dated 8th May 2015. The order of
      dismissal, passed by this Court in aforementioned
      clubbed matters, was assailed by petitioner by way of
      three separate, i.e., LPAOW no.99/2015, 109/2015 and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">OWP no.1209/2016                                      Page 2 of 7</span>
c/w OWP no.1081/2017
       115/2015. A Division Bench of this Court vide its order
      dated 6th July 2015 dismissed all three appeals.
      However, the Division Bench, while dismissing the
      appeals, gave liberty to petitioner to apply to office of
      Pollution Control Board within two weeks, with a
      direction    to    respondent    Board     to    consider     such
      application and pass appropriate orders in accordance
      with law within two weeks thereafter. It is the grievance
      of petitioner that instead of considering his case as
      directed by the Division Bench of this Court, a
      communication dated 27th June 2015 was issued by
      Forest Department, directing petitioner to dismantle
      Bandsaw Unit, which was challenged by petitioner in
      OWP no.1296/2015, in which it was claimed that this
      Court passed a direction to the effect that petitioner's
      structure of Bandsaw Mill would not be demolished. It is,
      thus,    submitted     that     despite    petitioner       having
      approached        respondent    Board     with    all   requisite
      formalities having been completed, respondent Board is
      not considering the matter, as a result whereof petitioner
      has been made to suffer irreparable loss and injury and
      he has been deprived of running his Bandsaw Mill. It is
      in these circumstances that petitioner, feeling aggrieved
      of inaction on part of respondents, has filed instant
      petition.
</p><p id="p_8">   4. Respondents 3&amp;4 (J&amp;K Pollution Control Board) have
      filed their reply affidavit, in which it is pleaded that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">OWP no.1209/2016                                              Page 3 of 7</span>
c/w OWP no.1081/2017
       petitioner has set up and put in operation a Bandsaw
      Unit in a predominantly residential area of Village
      Takiya Wagam, without obtaining consent of respondent
      Board as warranted under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">Section 25</a> of Water
      (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, and
      <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution)
      Act</a>, 1981. It is further submitted that by respondents
      that in view of non-compliance with provisions of Act of
      1974 and Act of 1981, the unit was ordered to be closed
      by order no.193-SPCB of 2013 dated 30th August 2013,
      but in due deference to the order passed by this Court,
      the same was kept in abeyance, so as to enable petitioner
      to obtain requisite licence from Forest Department. It is,
      thus, submitted that since Forest Department is yet to
      grant him licence, as such, the stage for consideration of
      his request for grant of consent of respondent Board to
      operate, has not yet reached. It is, therefore, the stand of
      respondent Board that case of petitioner for consent of
      Board, shall be decided only after requisite licence in his
      favour is issued by Forest Department.
</p><p id="p_9">   5. So far as respondents 1,2,6 to 8 (Forest Department), are
      concerned, the stand taken in Reply Affidavit by them, is
      that pursuant to a complaint filed by one, Mohammad
      Ashraf Ganie of Takiya Wagam, the respondent Board
      examined the matter and found that unit of petitioner,
      established in residential area, was source of pollution
      for neighbouring inhabitants and accordingly took up the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">OWP no.1209/2016                                        Page 4 of 7</span>
c/w OWP no.1081/2017
       matter with Deputy Commissioner, Pulwama, for closure
      of the unit. It is stated that opinion/communication of
      Member Secretary of Pollution Control Board with
      regard to potential of the unit for causing pollution, the
      seizure of diesel engine of Bandsaw was effected by
      Deputy Commissioner. Regarding grant of licence, it is
      pleaded by respondents that case of petitioner in terms
      of SRO 103 of 2012 has already been submitted by
      Divisional Forest Officer, Shopian (respondent no.7) to
      Conservator      of   Forests,    Kashmir,   South      Circle,
      Bijbehara (respondent no.6) vide letter no.DFO/SPN/
      549/L dated 20th June 2016. It is, however, not clarified
      in the Reply Affidavit as to what action has been taken
      by    respondent      no.6   on   the   recommendations        of
      respondent no.7. This in nutshell is the stand of Forest
      Department taken in Reply Affidavit.
</p><p id="p_10">   6. Having heard learned counsel for parties, perused the
      record, I am of the considered view that only right, which
      petitioner has with regard to establishment and
      operation of Bandsaw Mill Unit, is right of consideration
      in terms of SRO 103 of 2012. It is admitted by
      respondents that case of petitioner for grant of licence to
      run Bandsaw Mill in terms of aforesaid SRO has already
      been processed and requisite recommendations have
      been made by DFO, Shopian (respondent no.7) vide
      communication dated 20th June 2016, to Conservator of
      Forests, Kashmir, South Circle, Bijbehara (respondent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">OWP no.1209/2016                                           Page 5 of 7</span>
c/w OWP no.1081/2017
       no.6). It is, thus, for respondent no.6 (Conservator of
      Forests,     Kashmir,    South   Circle,    Bijbehara)      and
      competent authority to take a final decision with regard
      to grant of licence in favour of petitioner. Respondent
      Forest Department cannot keep the matter pending
      inordinately, and a decision in this regard is to be taken
      without any further waste of time. So far as compliance
      with provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">Section 25</a> of Water (Prevention and
      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_7">Section 21</a> of Air
      (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, is
      concerned, the same will be looked into by J&amp;K Pollution
      Control Board, once licence is granted in favour of
      petitioner by Forest Department and matter is forwarded
      to Pollution Control Board for the purpose. Needless to
      say, that Bandsaw Mill, which has potential of creating
      air, noise and water pollution, cannot be allowed to be
      established and operated without the consent of J&amp;K
      Pollution Control Board. In these circumstances, this
      petition is disposed of by directing respondents,
      particularly, respondent no.6 (Conservator of Forests,
      Kashmir, South Circle, Bijbehara), to immediately and
      forthwith take a decision on the request of petitioner for
      grant/renewal of Bandsaw Mill Licence of petitioner in
      light of recommendations received by him from DFO,
      Shopian, vide letter no.DFO/SPN/549/L dated 20th June
      2016. Let a final decision in this regard be taken by
      Conservator      of   Forests,   Kashmir,    South      Circle,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">OWP no.1209/2016                                           Page 6 of 7</span>

       Bijbehara, or by competent authority within a period of
      six weeks from the date certified copy of this order is
      made available to them. It is further provided that in
      case petitioner fulfils requirements as laid down in SRO
      103 of 2012, and is otherwise found entitled to issuance
      of licence, requisite order in this regard shall be passed
      and matter shall be referred to J&amp;K Pollution Control
      Board for grant of its consent. Needless to say, that J&amp;K
      Pollution Control Board, immediately after grant of
      licence issued in favour of petitioner is conveyed, shall
      consider the case of petitioner for grant of consent under
      the provisions of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of
      Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of
      Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, within a period of six weeks
      thereafter. Disposed of.
