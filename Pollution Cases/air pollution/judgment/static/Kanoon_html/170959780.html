</p><p id="p_3">      The aforesaid appeal of the Department is directed against the

order dated 16th August 2013, passed by the learned Commissioner

(Appeals)-4,        Mumbai,    for    the      assessment     year      2010-11.       The

Department has raised following effective grounds:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                            M/s. Nagpur Power &amp; Industries Ltd.

<p id="p_4">2.   As could be seen, grounds no.1 and 2, are on the common issue

of addition of ` 11,19,877, made by the Assessing Officer and deleted

by the first appellate authority.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.   Briefly the facts are, the assessee is a company engaged in the

business of ferro manganese, silico manganese and value added ferro

alloys, ferro manganese slag and similar other products. For the

assessment year under consideration, the assessee filed its return of

income on 18th September 2010, declaring total income of                    `

13,61,10,940. During the assessment proceedings, the Assessing

Officer, on going through the financial statements, noticed that during

the relevant previous year, the assessee apart from paying salary to
                                              M/s. Nagpur Power &amp; Industries Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_7"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                             3</span>

the executive, chairman and director of the company Shri Gautam

Khandelwal, has also paid commission to him for an amount of `

11,19,877, which has been claimed as deduction. The Assessing

Officer being of the view that commission paid is not an allowable

expense under section 36(1)(ii) of the Act, proposed to disallow the

same. Objecting to the proposed disallowance of the commission

payment, the assessee submitted an explanation stating therein that

the commission paid to Shri Gautam Khandelwal, is actually part of

salary paid to him which amounts to 5% of the net profit of the

company and the said payment is also in terms with the provisions of

<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 1956 It was also submitted that the commission

payment was authorised by board resolution dated 30th June 2009.

The Assessing Officer, however, was not satisfied with the explanation

of the assessee. He was of the view that the assessee in the garb of

commission has distributed its profit to the shareholders without

treating it as dividend and paying dividend distribution tax thereon.

Following a decision of the Tribunal, Mumbai Bench, in Dalal Brocha

Stock Broking Pvt. Ltd., [TS-287-ITAT-2011 (MUM.)], he ultimately

disallowed the commission paid and added it back to the income of the

assessee. Being aggrieved of such addition, the assessee challenged

the same in an appeal preferred before the first appellate authority.


</p><p id="p_8">4.   Before   the   learned   Commissioner    (Appeals),      the   assessee

reiterated the stand taken before the Assessing Officer. The learned
                                             M/s. Nagpur Power &amp; Industries Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_9"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                            4</span>

Commissioner (Appeals) considering the submissions of the assessee

in the light of the facts and materials on record, found that the

assessee is a public limited company wherein Shri Gautam Khandelwal

holds only 4.28% of the shares. He was, therefore, of the opinion that

even if the company would have declared dividend to Shri Gautam

Khandelwal, he would have received a very negligible amount towards

such dividend. Whereas, the major portion of the dividend would go to

others, therefore, the apprehension of the Assessing Officer that by

paying commission to Shri Gautam Khandelwal, the assessee has

avoided paying dividend distribution tax was without any basis.

Further, as far as the Assessing Officer's reliance on the Tribunal

decision in Dalal Brocha Stock Broking Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the learned

Commissioner (Appeals), after going through the same noticed that

not only the said company is a private limited company, but 100%

shareholders of the company are the father and sons to whom

commission has been paid. He, therefore, was of the view that in that

case, there is linkage between dividend and commission.


</p><p id="p_10">5.   On the other hand, the learned CIT(A), relied upon the decision

of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Hive Communication Pvt. Ltd. v/s

CIT, ITA no.306 of 11, order dated 8th July 2011, and in the case of

CIT v/s Convertech Equipments Pvt. Ltd., ITA no.669/2012, dated 3 rd

December 2012, wherein it was held that if commission is paid

towards   services   rendered   by   the   director   as   per    terms     of
                                             M/s. Nagpur Power &amp; Industries Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_11"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                            5</span>

appointment, then no disallowance could be made by treating it as

dividend. Accordingly, he deleted the addition.


</p><p id="p_12">6.   While the learned Departmental Representative relied upon the

reasoning of the Assessing Officer, the learned Counsel for the

assessee strongly supported the findings of the first appellate

authority.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">7.   We have considered the submissions of the parties and perused

the material available on record. As can be seen, the Assessing Officer

has disallowed the commission paid to Shri Gautam Khandelwal,

shareholder and director of the company on the ground that it is

actually dividend. However, as recorded by the learned Commissioner

(Appeals), Shri Gautam Khandelwal, is only 4.28% of the shareholder

of the company and distribution of dividend, if at all, it is declared by

the company would be very negligible, hence, it is hard to believe that

for avoiding payment of distribution tax on such negligible amount of

dividend, the assessee would have paid dividend to Shri Gautam

Khandelwal in the garb of commission. Moreover, the assessee has

produced material on record to show that commission payment is in

terms with the terms of appointment and towards services rendered

by the director. Nothing has been brought on record by the Assessing

Officer to controvert the aforesaid claim of the assessee. That being

the case, the disallowance of commission paid, in our view, is without
                                             M/s. Nagpur Power &amp; Industries Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_15"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                            6</span>

any valid reason. Accordingly, finding no infirmity in the order of the

learned Commissioner (Appeals), we uphold the same by dismissing

the ground raised by the Revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">8.    The next issue, as raised in ground no.3, relates to disallowance

of ` 12,21,098, by the Assessing Officer but deleted by the learned

Commissioner (Appeals).
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">9.    Briefly the facts are, during the assessment proceedings, the

Assessing Officer noticed that the assessee has debited an amount of `

22,88,993, towards miscellaneous expenses which included plantation

expenses of ` 12,21,098. The Assessing Officer disallowed the

plantation expenses of ` 12,21,098, opining that the expenditure is

going to get enduring benefit to the assessee. He further observed, as

the assessee is not into plantation business the expenditure cannot be

considered as revenue in nature. The assessee challenged the

disallowance before the first appellate authority.


</p><p id="p_20">10.   The learned Commissioner (Appeals) having considered the

submissions of the assessee in the light of the facts on record, found

that the expenditure incurred was primarily for the purpose of

environmental safety and pollution control. He found that the assessee

had to incur such expenditure for planting citrus tree to reduce

pollution caused by the factory to the environment. He also noticed

that such expenditure has to be incurred by the assessee in terms with
                                                  M/s. Nagpur Power &amp; Industries Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_21"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                                 7</span>

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Prevention of Pollution Act</a>. He also observed that in the earlier

assessment years, the Assessing Officer has allowed such expenditure

fully.    Relying   upon   some   High   Court     judgments,      the    learned

Commissioner (Appeals) finally deleted the addition made by the

Assessing Officer.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">11.      We have considered the submissions of the parties and perused

the material available on record. As could be seen the only reason on

which the Assessing Officer disallowed the expenditure is it is of

enduring benefit, hence, is a capital expenditure. Having held so,

strangely enough, the Assessing Officer did not allow any depreciation.

However, as could be seen from the submissions made by the

assessee right from the assessment stage, the expenditure incurred

was not merely for beautification of the factory premises but for

Prevention of Pollution Control and Environment Safety. It is also

evident, the assessee has to incur such expenditure as mandated by

pollution control and environmental safety laws. It is also evident that

the allegation of the Assessing Officer that such expenditure is not

recurring in nature is without any basis as the learned Commissioner

(Appeals) has recorded a finding of fact that the assessee had been

incurring such expenditure from earlier assessment years and the

Assessing Officer has allowed such expenditure fully. Considering the

aforesaid facts and circumstances, we do not find any reason for

disallowance of the plantation expenditure claimed by the assessee.

Accordingly, we uphold the order of the learned CIT(A) by dismissing
