</p><p id="p_5">2)   This     appeal   is   directed   against   the   order   dated

29.11.2004 passed in Crl. Misc. Case No. 1347 of 2001 of the

High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench

quashing the Complaint Case No. 44 of 1988 filed by the U.P.

Pollution Control Board, Lucknow through its officers against

M/s Modi Carpets Ltd. Raebareli and 12 others under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_1">Section
44</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974

(hereinafter referred to as "the Act") pending in the Court of

Special Judicial Magistrate (Pollution), Lucknow.


</p><p id="p_6">3) Background facts, in a nutshell, are as follows:


</p><p id="p_7">     The State Board for Prevention and Control of Water

Pollution was constituted on 03.02.1975 by the Government

of U.P. and it has been named as - U.P. Pollution Control

Board (hereinafter referred to as "the Board") which is the

appellant herein vide notification No. 2179/9-2-100-74 dated

13.07.1982.    On the application submitted by M/s Modi

Carpets Ltd., Raebareli, seeking consent to discharge effluent,

the appellant-Board granted conditional consent to discharge

their trade effluent in the river Sai. Since the conditions of

consent were not being complied with by M/s Modi Carpets

Ltd., a letter dated 30.4.1983 was sent by the appellant-Board

to M/s Modi Carpets Ltd., Raebareli informing that non-

compliance of the consent conditions is an offence under

<a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_3">Section 44</a> of the Act. On 07.06.1983, the inspection of unit

of M/s Modi Carpets Ltd. was done by the officers of the Board



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                             2</span>
wherein it was found that polluted trade effluent was being

discharged into the river Sai through drain without any

treatment and construction of effluent treatment plant was yet

to be started. On 19.01.1984, the Board again sent a letter to

M/s Modi Carpets Ltd. that conditions of the consent order

dated 22.1.1983 were not complied with.           Again it was

reiterated that non-compliance of the conditions of consent

would be an offence under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_4">Section 44</a> of the Act.             On

13.09.1984, the unit was again inspected by the officers of the

Board and it was found that effluent was being discharged

without any treatment.     For this, Modi Carpets Ltd. sent a

reply    dated   18.10.1984   to   the   appellant-Board   giving

clarifications for not complying with the consent conditions

and the same was considered and rejected by the Board on

31.10.1984 on the ground that the unit was not complying

with the prescribed standards, consent conditions and also

the application was incomplete in various aspects.


</p><p id="p_8">4)      Since M/s Modi Carpets Ltd. was not complying with the

provisions of the Act and there was violation of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">Sections 25</a> &amp;



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                               <a href="/doc/1081844/" id="a_6">3</a></span>
<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_7">26</a> of the Act, a complaint under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_8">Section 44</a> was filed by the

Board through its Assistant Environmental Engineer against

respondent No.1 as well as other persons namely, Chairman,

Vice-Chairman, Managing Director, Joint Managing Director,

Directors,   General    Manager,    Commercial       Manager   and

Company Secretary of M/s Modi Carpets Ltd. before the

C.J.M., Raebareli.      It was specifically mentioned in the

complaint that the aforesaid persons are responsible for the

conduct of the business of the company and for their

monetary     benefits   continued   to   discharge   noxious   and

polluting trade effluent of the company without complying

with the conditions of consent and mandatory provisions of

law. A petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_9">Section 482</a> of the Criminal Procedure

Code was filed before the High Court of Judicature at

Allahabad being Criminal Misc. Petition No. 14119 of 1985 by

M/s Modi Carpets Ltd. &amp; Ors. for quashing the aforesaid

complaint and also for other reliefs. Vide order dated

5.11.1985, the High Court stayed further proceedings in the

complaint case.      On the objection of the Board that the

Principal Bench at Allahabad had no territorial jurisdiction to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                4</span>
decide the petition, the first respondent herein filed a petition

under Section 482 of the Crl.P.C. before Lucknow Bench of

the High Court being Crl. Misc. Case No. 1347 of 2001. In the

said petition, it was alleged that the first respondent, Dr.

Bhupendra Kumar Modi, Joint Managing Director was not

concerned with day-to-day business of the company and

cannot be prosecuted for the offence committed by the

Company, hence, it was prayed that Complaint Case No. 44 of

1988 filed by the appellant-Board be quashed.


</p><p id="p_9">5)   The appellant-Board filed a counter affidavit before the

High Court wherein it was stated that the complaint could not

be quashed at the initial stage and whether a person is

responsible   for   conduct   of   day-to-day   business   of   the

Company or not, is a question which has to be decided by

evidence. In any event it was stated that the complaint

discloses materials to proceed further.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">6)    By impugned order dated 29.11.2004, the High Court

quashed the complaint so far as it related to respondent No.1

on the main ground that there was no material on record to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                 5</span>
show that respondent No.1 was, at the relevant time, incharge

and responsible to the company for conduct of its business.

Aggrieved by the said judgment of the Lucknow Bench, the

appellant-Board has filed the above appeal by way of special

leave.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">7)   Heard Mr. Rakesh K. Khanna, learned Senior Counsel,

appearing for the appellant-Board and Mr. L.N. Rao, learned

senior counsel, appearing for the 1st respondent.


</p><p id="p_14">8)   The only point for consideration in this appeal is whether

the complaint of U.P. Pollution Control Board discloses any

material against the first respondent i.e., Dr. Bhupendra

Kumar Modi, Joint Managing Director, particularly, his control

over the decision making process of the Company and whether

the High Court was justified in quashing the same in so far as

Dr. Bhupendra Kumar Modi in a petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_10">Section 482</a>

Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">9)   The   High   Court   while   accepting   the   case   of Dr.

Bhupendra Kumar Modi perused the complaint of the Board.

According to it, nowhere it is specifically stated in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                               6</span>
complaint and there is also no material on record to show that

Dr. Bhupendra Kumar Modi was, at the relevant time, in-

charge and responsible to the Company for the conduct of the

business. The High Court also concluded that there was no

specific allegation that at the relevant time, respondent No.1

was in-charge of the Company or was looking after the day-to-

day affairs of the company or that the offence has been

committed with his consent or connivance. By arriving such

conclusion the High Court quashed the prosecution in so far

as the first respondent herein is concerned.      In the same

order, the High Court made it clear that the prosecution is free

to proceed against other persons mentioned in the complaint.


</p><p id="p_17">10)   In order to answer the questions raised, we verified the

complaint (Annexure - 8) of the Board laid under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_11">Section 44</a> of

the Act. <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_12">Section 25</a> (1) of the Act makes it mandatory for every

new industry to obtain consent of the "Board" for bringing into

use any new or altered outlet for the discharge of its trade

effluent into the stream or well or on land as defined in

<a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_13">Section 2</a> of the Act read with its amending Act [Act No. 44 of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                              7</span>
1978]. The Company and all the persons in-charge of the day-

to-day affairs are required to abide by the mandatory

provisions for operating their industrial establishment.   The

complaint further shows that the Company had applied for the

grant of consent of the Board for the discharge of its trade

effluent on 29.09.1982 which was received by the Board on

04.10.1982 and after considering all aspects the conditional

consent order No. 83/170 dated 22.01.1983 was issued in

favour of the Company.    According to the Complainant, the

Company had not sent the report for proper compliance of the

condition which was imposed.     Accordingly, the site of the

Company at Raebareli had been inspected by the officers of

the Board on 07.06.1983 and on 13.09.1984 in the presence

of representatives of the Company. According to the Board,

the accused persons intentionally failed to comply with the

conditions of consent order dated 22.01.1983 and to construct

proper effluent treatment plant and discharging without

consent of the Board. This has been asserted in para 15 of

the complaint.   In para 16, it is stated that the accused

persons,   namely,     2-13    are    Chairman,     Managing


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                            8</span>
Director/Joint Managing Director, Directors, Secretaries and

Managers of M/s Modi Carpets Ltd., Raebareli, who are

responsible for the conduct of the business of the Company

and also for not complying the conditions and for not

constructing proper plant for the treatment of their highly

polluting trade effluent so as to conform to the standard laid

down by the Board.       In the same paragraph, it is further

asserted that the accused persons are deliberately avoiding

the provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_14">Section 25</a> of the Act for which they are

punishable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_15">Section 44</a> read with <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_16">Section 47</a> of the Act.

In para 17 of the complaint, it is specifically stated that at the

time of commission of offence all the persons were in-charge of

the business of the Company and responsible for the day-to-

day working of the Company and also for conducting of the

business of the Company and continuous commissioning of

offence under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_17">Section 44</a> of the Act and the construction of

effluent treatment plant can be taken up only when these

senior authorities resolved to do so. It is further stated that

the offence mentioned in the complaint is being continuously

committed against the society at large, animals and aquatic


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                9</span>
life in particular because of their personal monetary gains. In

para 21, it is specifically stated that the Chairman, Directors

and Secretaries are the brain and nerve centre of Modi

Carpets and conducting the business of the Company which

has been discharging its trade effluents into stream for which

they are to be punished under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_18">Section 44</a> read with <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_19">Section 47</a>

of the Act. In para 22, it is asserted that under the provisions

of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_20">Section 47</a> of the Act where an offence has been committed

by a Company every person, who at the time of commission of

the offence was in-charge of and responsible to the Company

for the conduct of the business shall be deemed to be guilty of

the offence and liable to be proceeded          and punished

accordingly.

out trade effluent into a stream or a river has to satisfy certain

conditions in terms of the provisions of the Act and the order

of the authorities concerned. It is also not in dispute that

without a consent order by the Board the Company cannot let

out untreated effluent into a land or stream or river. Though

a consent order was issued by the Board it has been

specifically stated in the complaint that those conditions have

not been fulfilled by the Company. In those circumstances, in

the interest of the public health, the appellant-Board through

its officers laid a complaint against the persons, who are in

charge of the day-to-day affairs and in the decision making

process.     There is no need to place all the materials at the

threshold.     However, on perusal of the complaint and the

relevant materials in the form of documents, the learned

Special Judicial Magistrate (Pollution) entertained the same

and issued summons to the named persons in the complaint.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                 1</span>

Inasmuch as the High Court quashed the complaint against

the first respondent herein who is a Joint Managing Director

of    the    Company,     we        are   concerned     about    the

averments/allegations against him in respect of his concern in

the day-to-day affairs and in the decision making process. We

have already referred to the relevant averments/materials

adverted to in the complaint. Before going into the reasoning

and conclusion of the High Court for quashing the complaint

against the first respondent herein, let us consider various

decisions of this Court with reference to the very same

provisions, namely, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_29">Sections 44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_30">47</a> of the Act as well as

the jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_31">Section 482</a> of Cr.PC.


</p><p id="p_26">14)   It is settled legal position that at the stage of issuing

process,    the   Magistrate   is    mainly   concerned   with   the

allegations made in the complaint or the evidence led in

support of the same and he is only to be prima facie satisfied

whether there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against

the    accused.     <a href="/doc/56823/" id="a_32">In    Smt.       Nagawwa      vs.     Veeranna

Court has held that it is not the province of the Magistrate to

enter into a detailed discussion on the merits or demerits of

the case. It was further held that whether a process should be

issued,    the   Magistrate     can     take    into    consideration

improbabilities appearing on the face of the complaint or in

the evidence led by the complainant in support of the

allegations. The Magistrate has been given an undoubted

discretion in the matter and the discretion has to be judicially

exercised by him. It was further held that once the Magistrate

has exercised his discretion, it is not for the High Court or

even this Court to substitute its own discretion for that of the

Magistrate or to examine their case on merits with a view to

find out whether or not the allegations in the complaint, if

proved, would ultimately end in conviction of the accused.

This Court has held that in the following cases, an order of the

Magistrate issuing process against the accused can be

quashed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     "(1) where the allegations made in the complaint or the
     statements of the witnesses recorded in support of the same
     taken at their face value make out absolutely no case against

     ingredients of an offence which is alleged against the
     accused;

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                     4</span>
<p id="p_27">      (2)    where the allegations made in the complaint are
      patently absurd and inherently improbable so that no
      prudent person can ever reach a conclusion that there is
      sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused;

      (3)    where the discretion exercised by the Magistrate in
      issuing process is capricious and arbitrary having been
      based either on no evidence or on materials which are wholly
      irrelevant or inadmissible; and

      (4)   where the complaint suffers from fundamental legal
      defects, such as, want of sanction, or absence of a complaint
      by legally competent authority and the like."


No doubt the grounds mentioned above are purely illustrative

and it provides only guidelines to indicate contingencies where

the High Court can quash the proceedings. Though argument

was advanced based on the decision in <a href="/doc/443284/" id="a_33">State of Karnataka

vs. Pratap Chand and Others</a>, (1981) 2 SCC 335, it was

decided in a case relating to conviction under Drugs and

<a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_34">Cosmetics Act</a>, 1940 and not quashing of a complaint based

merely on a petition or an affidavit. Hence, the said decision

is not applicable to the case on hand.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">15)   Though reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in

<a href="/doc/1860679/" id="a_35">Municipal Corporation of Delhi vs. Ram Kishan Rohtagi

and Others</a>, (1983) 1 SCC 1, a perusal of the said decision

makes it clear that the complaint in that case was vague as

regards the Directors and the Court has concluded that no

offence revealed against them, hence the High Court was

justified in quashing the proceedings against the Directors.

respondent is <a href="/doc/60342456/" id="a_36">State of Haryana vs. Brij Lal Mittal and

Others</a>, (1998) 5 SCC 343. In the said decision, after finding

that except a bald statement in the complaint that the

respondents therein were Directors of the manufacturers,

there is no other allegation to indicate, even prima facie, that

they were in charge of the Company and also responsible to

the Company for the conduct of its business.        This Court

agreed with the High Court in quashing the prosecution

against the three Directors.

adverted to the specific averments/assertions in the complaint

of the Board with reference to all the officers i.e. named

circumstances, we are of the view that the above-mentioned

the stand taken by him. It is useful to refer the decision in

the case of <a href="/doc/885425/" id="a_38">U.P. Pollution Control Board vs Messrs Modi

Industries Limited, the company owning the industrial unit

called M/s Modi Distillery could be proceeded against on a

complaint against the said industrial unit.    Learned Single

Judge of the High Court found that there was no sufficient

ground against the respondent inasmuch as the allegations

made in the complaint do not constitute an offence punishable

under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_41">Section 44</a> for the admitted contravention of <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_42">Sections

case on hand.     This Court taking note of the provisions

particularly, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_45">Sections 25</a> (1) (2) and 26 as well as <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_46">Sections 44</a>

dealt with by the Judicial Magistrate at the time of trial, set

aside the order of the High Court interfering with the order of

Court as well as the order of the Sessions Court quashing the

satisfying the averments in the complaint of the Board issued

process against the accused at the first instance.        The

respondents/Company and its Directors desired the trial

Court to discharge them without even making their first

appearance in the Court.    When the attempt made for that

failed, they moved for exemption from appearance in the

Court.   In the meanwhile, the Sessions Judge, Lucknow

entertained a revision moved by the accused against the order

issuing process to them and quashed it on the erroneous

ground that the Magistrate did not pass a speaking order for

issuing such summons. The CJM before whom the complaint

was filed thereafter passed a detailed order on 25.04.1984 and

again issued process to the accused.    The order was again

challenged by the accused in revision before the Sessions

Court and the same Sessions Judge again quashed it by order

dated 25.08.1984. The Board moved before the High Court in

a revision against the said order.   Though the revision was

moved in 1984 itself it took 15 years for the High Court to

dismiss the revision petition as per the order passed by a

learned Single Judge on 27.07.1999. Questioning the same,

ultimately leave was granted by this Court. It is useful to refer

the facts and other details stated in the complaint as noted by

this Court.    Thomas, J. (as he then was) speaking for the

Bench in paras 10 and 11 observed thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     10. ... ... ... In the complaint filed by the appellant before the

     described as the Directors of the said Company. The 11th
     person arrayed in the complaint as accused is described as
     the Manager of the Company. The averments in the
     complaint show that the Distillery Unit of the Company at
     Daliganj, Lucknow, has been discharging noxious trade
     effluents into River Gomti and causing continuous pollution
     of the river. It was further averred in the complaint that on
     19-9-1982, samples of trade effluents were collected by the
     officers empowered in this behalf, from the drain "just
     outside the plant inside the factory", and from the irrigation
     plant out of which the effluents were pumped into the river.
     When the samples were analysed in the Industrial Toxicology
     Research Centre, Lucknow, it was revealed that the quality
     of effluents was beyond the standard laid down for the
     purpose. Therefore, it is alleged that the Company has
     violated <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_50">Section 24</a> of the Act* and thereby the Company is
     guilty of the offence under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_51">Section 43</a> of the Act.

      the complaint by which the Managers or Directors of the
      Company can also be proceeded against, when the Company
      is alleged to be guilty of the offence. Para 12 of the complaint
      reads thus:

Taking note of the averments in the complaint against the

nonetheless lapse of such long period cannot be a reason to

absolve the respondents from the trial.    In a matter of this

nature, particularly, when it affects public health if it is

ultimately proved, courts cannot afford to deal lightly with

cases involving pollution of air and water. The message must

go to all concerned persons whether small or big that the

courts will share the parliamentary concern and legislative

intent of the Act to check the escalating pollution level and

restore the balance of our environment. Those who discharge

noxious polluting effluents into streams, rivers or any other

water bodies which inflicts on the public health at large,

should be dealt with strictly de hors to the technical

objections. Since escalating pollution level of our environment

affects on the life and health of human beings as well as

animals, the courts should not deal with the prosecution for

offences under the pollution and environmental Acts in a

causal or routine manner.

quashed the complaint arising in an environmental matter in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                             2</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                                             3</span>
a casual manner by exercising power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_58">Section 482</a> of the

Cr.P.C. This Court has held exercise of power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_59">Section

482</a> of the Code is the exception and under the rule there are

three circumstances under which the inherent jurisdiction

may be exercised i.e. (a) to give effect to an order of the Court;

</p><p id="p_43">(b) to prevent abuse of the process of the Court; (c) to

otherwise secure the ends of justice.       It is true that it is

neither possible nor desirable to lay down any inflexible rule

which would govern the exercise of inherent jurisdiction.

While exercising inherent powers either on civil or criminal

jurisdiction, the Court does not function as a Court of Appeal

or Revision. The inherent jurisdiction though wide has to be

exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution. It should be

exercised to do real and substantial justice and if any attempt

is made to abuse that authority so as to produce injustice, the

Court has power to prevent abuse.          When no offence is

disclosed by the complaint, the Court may examine the

question of fact. When complaint is sought to be quashed, it

is permissible to look into the materials to assess what the

complainant had alleged and whether any offence is made out


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                                                2</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                                4</span>
even if the allegations are accepted in toto. When exercising

jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_60">Section 482</a> of the Code, the High Court

could not ordinarily embark upon an enquiry whether the

evidence in question is reliable or not or whether on a

reasonable appreciation of it accusation would not be

sustained. To put it clear, it is the function of the trial Judge

to do so. The Court must be careful to see that its decision in

exercise of its power is based on sound principles.          The

inherent power should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate

prosecution. If the allegations set out in the complaint do not

constitute offence of which cognizance has been taken by the

Magistrate, it is open to the High Court to quash the same in

exercise of the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Crl.

Procedure Code.     However, it is not necessary that there

should be meticulous analysis of the case before the trial to

find out whether the case would end in conviction or acquittal.


</p><p id="p_44">22)   In the light of the above discussion and in view of the

specific averments in the complaint as referred to by us in the

earlier paragraphs coupled with the statutory provisions,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                               2</span>

namely, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_61">Sections 25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_62">26</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_63">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_64">47</a> of the Act, we are unable

to share the view expressed by the High Court in quashing the

complaint insofar as the first respondent herein. Accordingly,

we set aside the same.      The Special Judicial Magistrate

(Pollution) is directed to proceed with the complaint and

dispose of the same in accordance with law.                If the first

respondent herein applies for dispensing with his personal

presence in the Court, after making the first appearance, the

Special Court can exempt him from continuing to appear in

the Court by imposing any condition which the Court deems

fit.   Subject to the above observation, we set aside the

impugned judgment of the High Court and direct the Special

Judicial Magistrate (Pollution) to proceed with the case in

accordance with law and dispose of the same as expeditiously

as possible.   We make it clear that we have not expressed

anything on the merits of the contents of the complaint and it

is for the Special Court to decide the same in accordance with

law. The Criminal appeal is allowed.
