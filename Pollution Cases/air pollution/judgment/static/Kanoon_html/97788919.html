<p id="p_2">        Facts leading to file this writ petition before this

Court    are   that    Bhartiya        Kisan   Sangh,    Rajasthan

Pradesh filed D.B.Civil Writ Petition (PIL) No.718/2009

before this Court raising grievances regarding issue of

pollution of water in A minor canal, which passes

through Srigangangar district. In that writ petition

several directions were issued by the Division Bench of

this Court from time to time, however, ultimately the

said D.B.Civil Writ Petition (PIL) No.718/2009 was

transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for

adjudication vide order dated 21.04.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            In the meantime, Bhartiya Kisan Sangh,
Rajasthan Pradesh filed Original Application Nos.86 to
89 of 2014 in relation to other minor canals of
Sriganganagar district claiming that water in those
minor     canals    are   being        polluted   and,   therefore,
necessary directions be issued. Circuit Bench of NGT at
Jodhpur on 10.07.2014 passed the following order in
the above mentioned four original applications:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "July,10.2014

          point out that in respect of A- Minor Canal of Shri
          Ganga Nagar, the Hon'ble High Court of Jodhpur has
          passed certain interim directions after getting
          reports from Rajasthan Pollution Control Board and
          these four applications relate to similar four minor
          canals and the water in those minor canals are being
          polluted and in such circumstances, necessary
          directions be issued. Let Notice be issued to the

        documents today itself. Considering the allegations
        raised in the applications and the seriousness of the
        pollution being caused, we direct the Respondent
        No. 9 Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board to
        depute a team headed by a of senior officer to
        inspect the four minor canals and report about the
        nature of the canal, the pollution being caused, the
        sources of pollution and the remedial measures.
           Let the report be filed by the next date of hearing;
        List the matters on 11th September, 2014."</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">     The NGT thereafter in the above mentioned four
original applications passed the various orders, wherein
certain directions were have been issued. Some of the
orders are reproduced hereunder:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        "November 27, 2014
           Heard. Perused.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">           Replies have been tendered by the Rajasthan
        Pollution Control Board along with the inspection
        report. The main grievance of the applicant is that the
        pollution is being caused in drinking water flowing
        through the minor canals namely Karnijavi, Baby
        distributaries of Ganga Canal, Mandi Minor Canal and
        Gharsana Canal.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">           Perusal of the inspection reports tendered by he
        Rajasthan Pollution Control Board reveals that the
        canals are flanked by strips of land having width of
        60ft. each on both the sides which have been occupied
        by human habitation for the purposes of residence and
        commerce and their presence is contributing to the
        pollution of drinking water flowing through canals. It
        also reveals that at some places along these canals the
        inlets to discharge filthy water into the canals have
        been made and the platforms have raised over the
        canal. We also find from the reports that canal water is
        being used along the canal for washing purposes and
        the discharge there from again meets the canal water.
        There are also instances of throwing of garbage/solid
        waste in the canal quoted in the report.</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">           State has yet to respond to the application
        Rajasthan Pollution Control Board shall handover
        copies of the inspection reports to Learned Counsel for
        the state. It shall be the obligation of the state to go
        through the observations which have been noted in
        the inspection reports and to suggest measures to
        check the pollution of the canal water. However, in the
        meantime we direct the state to take all such effective
        measures to remove all the inlets discharging filthy
        substances or water into the canal and to remove all
        such platforms raised on the canal. This shall be a
        small step for curbing the pollution at this stage and
        we will consider the major remedies on getting the
        response from the state to the application. Compliance
        Report regarding the compliance of directions shall be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                          4.</span>

filed by the State on the next date.
</p><p id="p_6">    List the matter on 23rd January, 2015."
</p>
<p id="p_7">January 23, 2015
   In the earlier order of this Tribunal dated 27 th
November, 2015, the Tribunal relied upon a report filed
by the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board. We have
issued a direction to the State to go through the
observations made by the Pollution Control Board in
the inspection report and suggest the measures to be
taken to check pollution of the canal water which
relates to Karni (G.B.) Minor Canal, B.B. canal, Mandi
Minor Canal and Gharsana (Anupgarh Bharnch) Canal.
   Today on behalf of the State a reply has been filed
and the Learned Counsel appearing for the applicants
has also filed an affidavit stating that the direction
given by the Tribunal to take all effective measures to
remove all inlets discharging filthy substances or water
into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised
on the canal has not been carried out at all. In the
absence of compliance of the earlier direction by the
Tribunal it is the contention of the Learned Counsel
appearing for the applicant that some effective
directions to be issued to the State to take appropriate
measures. He has also produced the latest
photographs to show that the earlier situation is still in
existence. On seeing the photographs we are certainly
alarmed the way in which the Canal is maintained by
the state and filthy water is treated as water for
drinking for the poor people of village. It is unfortunate
that in spite of earlier direction, no compliance has
been made by the State so far. However, the Learned
Counsel appearing for the State would plead that due
to certain election of panchayat, effective actions could
not be taken and if a short time is given, a time bound
scheme will be produced before the tribunal for its
approval.
</p><p id="p_8">   Considering the facts and circumstances of the case
in order to give one more opportunity to the State
government finally we pass the following order:
</p><p id="p_9">1. The State shall prepare a comprehensive and short
term scheme with time frame for the purpose of
preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the
Canal.
</p><p id="p_10">2. The long term scheme for the purpose of removal of
encroachments situated on the water bodies and the
time frame.
</p><p id="p_11">3. In the mean we direct the State Pollution Control
Board to inspect to find out as to whether the drinking
water stated to have been supplied after treatment
meets the standard of drinking water and file a status
report.
</p><p id="p_12">   We direct the State which includes the Revenue
Department and District Collector to provide safe
drinking water to all the affected village by
transporting drinking water, as the claim that raw
water supplied to the PHED from the canal is treated
before being supplied to people is not supported by
any document about treatment measure provided in
the area. Interim order passed by the Tribunal dated
27th November, 2015 shall continue to be in operation.
   The learned Counsel appearing for the applicant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                         5.</span>

brought to the Notice to this Tribunal that one Public
Interest   Litigation   in   W.P.    No.718/2009  was
transferred by the Hon'ble High Court of Rajasthan at
Jodhpur in the order dated 21-04-2014. The registry
shall find out the status of the said case and if the
papers are transferred from the High Court in the
mean time the said W.P. may be numbered as
application and listed along with these matters.
   Stand over to 20th March, 2015."
</p><p id="p_13">"May 15,2015
   Heard. Perused.
</p><p id="p_14">   Grievance that has been raised in the present
applications is regarding the pollution caused in the
water running through the distributories of Ganga
Nahar Canal and Ganga Nahar itself. One of the WP
No. 718/2009 which concerns the main Ganga nahar
Canal and would have much to say on the larger
perspective has been transferred from the High Court
to us for its final disposal. However, the record has
not yet reached us.
</p><p id="p_15">   Considering the factors which have contributed to
the pollution/ contamination of the canal waters in its
distributories in question, we had directed the State to
come out with the comprehensive shot term as well as
long term schemes for the purpose of rendering the
canal and its distributories free of encroachments on
the water bodies and consequent contamination in
given time frame. We had also directed the State
Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from
the distributories as well as the potable water rendered
there-from, analyse the same and place before us the
analysis reports.
</p><p id="p_16">   Today, we have before us the compliance report
dated 11th May, 2015 of the District Collector, Ganaga
Nagar, analysis report filed by the Rajasthan State
Pollution Control Board and additional affidavit of Mr.
Rakesh Chander Mathur officer in charge Rajasthan
State Pollution Control Board dated 15th May, 2015. It
is revealed that the samples of water from the
distributories could not be collected as there was no
water in the distributories due to ongoing maintenance
work and the analysis reports of the water samples
drawn from the clean water reservoir are normal. It is
also revealed that water in the clean water reservoir is
the water which is treated and stored water collected
from the water drawn from the distributories. No
wonder, therefore, the analysis report would indicate
that everything in the clean water reservoir is normal.
However, it will be of use to know what is the standard
of the water running through the distributories,
particularly, at the points where the water enters the
populated area and leaves it. We therefore, direct the
SPCB to collect water samples upstream the
distributories in question where there is no population
around and the water samples of downstream where
the population is there around the banks of the
distributories.
</p><p id="p_17">   The state has come out with the long term planning
to free distributories and canal from the menace of
contamination. According to the State it will take six
months time to construct waste water drains i.e.
interceptor drains along the distributories of canal and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                6.</span>

       would take one and a half years for removal of
       encroachments along the banks of the distributories
       and canal. Let the State place before us the steps they
       have taken for construction of waste water drains and
       removal of the encroachments before us on the next
       date of hearing.
</p><p id="p_18">          In the meanwhile we direct the State/local
       authorities to impose damages or compensation of Rs.
       1,000/- on a person found throwing waste or
       contaminating any distributory or canal water in any
       manner whatsoever per incidence and recover the
       same from such person by invoking polluter pays
       principle. If anyone resists the payment of such
       damages or compensation the case of such person
       shall be referred to us and such person shall be made
       to appear before us. Citizens shall be made aware of
       this direction imposing the compensation or the
       damages for contaminating water through publication
       of notices on Boards at prominent places, in news as
       well as on radio and T.V media.
</p><p id="p_19">          Compliance report regarding publication of such
       notices shall be placed before us on the next date of
       hearing. The State and local authorities shall place
       before us the action taken report in respect of
       enforcement      of   the    direction  imposing    the
       compensation or damages.
</p><p id="p_20">          We request the Hon'ble High Court of Rajasthan
       judicature at Jodhpur to ensure the despatch and
       handing over of the records of WP No. 718/2009 to us
       before the next date of hearing. Our Registrar General
       to convey our request to the Hon'ble High Court.
          List the case on 10th July, 2015."
</p>
<p id="p_21">         In the meantime, the record of the D.B.Civil
Writ Petition (PIL) No.718/2009 was received by the
NGT   and   the    same     was     registered     as    Original
Application No.323/2015 and the following orders were
passed by the NGT in the Original Application Nos.86 to
89 of 2014 and 322/2015 filed by Bhartiya Kisan
Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">        "August 21, 2015
          The learned Counsel appearing for the RSPCB and
        the learned Counsel appearing for the State of
        Rajasthan were heard.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">          Learned Counsel appearing for the applicant
        submitted that he was not furnished with the
        compliance report dated 11-05-2015 submitted by
        the State of Rajasthan. The State of Rajasthan is
        directed to furnish copy of the report to the
        Applicant within two
        days from today.</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">          By order dated 23.01.2015, the State was directed
        to prepare a comprehensive short term and long
        term scheme with the timeframe for the purpose of
        preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the
        Canal and a long term scheme for the purpose of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                        7.</span>

removal of encroachments situated on the water
bodies and the time frame. In the meanwhile, SPCB
was directed to find out as to whether the drinking
water stated to have been supplied after treatment
meets the standard of drinking water and file a
status report. This order was necessitated because
of the pollution being caused on the Canal water
relating to Karni (G.B.) Minor Canal, B.B. Canal,
Mandi Minor Canal and Gharsana (Anupgarh
Bharnch) Canal.
</p><p id="p_23">  On 20.03.2015, it was represented by the learned
Counsel appearing for the State of Rajasthan that
the entire inlet to the canal which are causing
pollution were plugged but the submission was
disputed by the learned Counsel appearing for the
applicant. Vide order dated 20.3.2015, the State
was, therefore, directed to survey the entire area of
the canal, identify the inlets and the platforms
existing and demolished or removed and to file
compliance/Status report on the next date.
  Though, the learned Counsel appearing for the
State submitted that such status report was
submitted and relied on the compliance report dated
11.5.2015 submitted before the Tribunal on
15.05.2015, on perusing the report (no translated
copy is submitted). Learned Counsel appearing for
the State and the learned Counsel appearing for the
RSPCB submitted that the said report does not
contain the details as directed by the order dated
20.03.2015. The long term and short term plans
were also not submitted on that day.
</p><p id="p_24">  On 20-03-2015 it was observed that State should
have come out with the comprehensive short term
and long term scheme for the purpose of rendering
the    canal   and    the    distributaries free   of
encroachments and consequent contamination in a
given time frame and also for the purpose of
removal of encroachments on the water bodies
within the timeframe. Finding that the scheme as
directed was not presented, it was directed to
submit the same on the next date, warning that on
failure "we will be constrained to impose a cost of
Rs. 50,000/- to begin with".
</p><p id="p_25">  Though, the case was listed on 15.05.2015 on that
day also the comprehensive short term and long
term plans were not submitted. Though, a
compliance report dated 11.05.2015 was submitted
on 15.05.2015 stating that it will take six months
time to construct waste water drain i.e. drain along
with the distributaries of the Canal and would take
one and a half year for removing of encroachments
along the banks and the distributaries of the Canal,
the State was directed to place the steps taken for
construction of the drains and removal of
encroachments on the next date of posting. Though,
today the learned Counsel appearing for the State
submitted that the report dated 15-05-2015 is the
long term and short term plan, we find that it is not
the long term or short term plan as directed by the
previous order. Except stating that it will take six
months and one and half years, what is actually the
work to be carried out and what are the expenses
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                         8.</span>

and the details of the work are all absent in the said
compliance report. Still the State was directed to
place before the Tribunal the steps they have taken
for construction of waste water drains and removal
of the encroachments on the next date. The case
was listed on 10.07.2015. On that day also the
action report was not submitted and the State and
local authorities were directed to place the action
taken report on record on the next date of listing.
Today also no report or action plan is produced.
  The learned Counsel appearing for the State
submitted that it is because of the pre-occupation of
the staff in election work the report could not be
submitted. As no action report was submitted in
spite of the order passed by the Tribunal as early as
on 23.01.2015, we find no justification for the failure
based on the Panchayat/Municipal elections in the
State.
</p><p id="p_26">  In such circumstances, this is a fit case where the
cost directed by the previous order should be
awarded. Still at present, we do not direct payment
of cost hoping that atleast on the next date, the
State would submit the long term and short term
scheme as well as a report on the action so far
taken. We find from the records that as early as on
13.02.2015, when the matter was pending before
the Hon'ble High Court of Rajasthan, the learned
Additional Advocate General had reported to the
Court that 3.5 crores have been allotted to the
project in respect of A-minor Canal. There is no
report what on the works so far done. The State is
bound to explain what happened to this 3.5 crores
and how the amount was spent.
</p><p id="p_27">  On the facts and circumstances of this case, we
find that the presence of the District Collector,
Ganga Nagar is necessary for issuing necessary
direction on the next posting date. We direct the
District Collector, Ganga Nagar to be present with all
the relevant records
on the next date on 9.10.2015.
</p><p id="p_28">  We also make it clear that if the State atleast now
is not ready with the short term and long term
scheme and the action taken report and make them
available on the next date of posting. The cost which
is deferred at present would be imposed.
  List the matters on 9th October, 2015."
"December 04, 2015
  The Learned Counsel appearing for the Applicant
and the Learned Counsel appearing for the state and
the State Pollution Control Board were heard. The
Learned Counsel appearing for Applicant submitted
that in-spite of the earlier directions, copy of the
compliance report dated 11th May, 2015 has not
been furnished and though another compliance
report was filed on 08th May, 2015, its copy was
also not served on the Applicant. We find there was
specific direction in the order dated 21st August,
2015 to furnish copy of the compliance report dated
11th May, 2015 to the applicant. Even if there is no
direction, when any petition or report is filed in a
pending matter, that party is expected to give a
copy to the opposite side. It is unfortunate that in-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                        9.</span>

<p id="p_29">spite of the directions, the State of Rajasthan has
failed to comply with the directions. The Learned
Counsel appearing for the State is directed to
furnish copy of all the compliance reports to the
Learned Counsel appearing for Applicants in the
course of the day, without fail.
</p><p id="p_30">  By the order dated 08th October, 2015 certain
directions were issued. Firstly the State was directed
to
remove all the encroachments and fence the
boundary of the land abutting the canal passing
through the municipal areas. The Learned Counsel
appearing for the State submits that a compliance
report is being filed today, wherein it is disclosed
that out of 1237 encroachments, 637 encroachers
approached the Hon'ble High Court, and steps are
being taken for removal of the remaining
encroachments. The Learned Counsel appearing for
Applicant points out that the Division Bench of
Hon'ble High court of judicature of Rajasthan at
Jodhpur in Civil Writ Petition (PIL) No. 12876/2011
(Ved Prakash Joshi Vs. State of Raj. &amp; Ors.) by order
dated 10th September, 2015 considered this aspect,
in the light of the order passed by the Tribunal on
08th October, 2015. The order of the Hon'ble
Division Bench reveals that it was represented by
the State, before the Division Bench with regard to
the removal of encroachment submitted that
necessary order has already been passed by the
National Green Tribunal (evidently order of this
Tribunal dated 08th October, 2015) with regard to
the removal of encroachments in Sriganganagar and
in respect of the encroachments in other area,
necessary steps to mark encroachment and
removing the same is being taken. It is seen from
the order that committee was constituted by the
Divisional Bench to demarcate the encroachments
and for removing the same and also to monitor the
entire issue of removing encroachments from the
city of Sriganganagar. It is clear that Division Bench
has not passed any directions with regard to the
encroachment being considered by the Tribunal. The
Learned Counsel appearing for the Applicant submits
that he is not aware of any independent petition
stated by the Learned Counsel appearing for the
State. A copy of the order passed by the Single
Judge in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 11579 of 2015
dated 05th October, 2015 where under respondents
are restrained from taking any coercive action
against the petitioners therein, subject to condition
with the petitioners shall undertake before that they
shall not pollute and contaminate water flowing in
B.B. Miner within one week was made available.
  The compliance report sought to be filed today by
the Learned Counsel appearing for the State does
not disclose out of 639 encroachers who approached
the Hon'ble High Court, order of stay was passed in
how many cases. Though it is stated that stops as
against the remaining encroachments are in
progress, the Learned Counsel appearing for the
state disclosed that a single encroachment was
removed so far. Therefore, even if the cases of 639
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                        10.</span>

encroachment are taken as subjudice, there is no
effective action as again the remaining encroachers.
In view of the lethargic attitude and the in-action, it
is necessary to give appropriate directions to see
that the order passed by the Tribunal is
implemented.
</p><p id="p_31">  The Respondents are directed to remove all the
encroachments within one month from today. We
direct    the   District   Collector,   Sriganganagar,
Superintendent        of    Police,     Sriganganagar,
Commissioner, Municipal Council, Sriganganagar and
the Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust and
Superintendent to provide all assistance and also to
monitor the removal of encroachments. We found
that similar order was passed by the Division Bench
in Civil Writ Petition (PIL) No. 12876/2011 (Ved
Prakash Joshi Vs. State of Raj. &amp; Ors.). The
compliance report shall be submitted by 29th
January, 2016 with advance copy to the Learned
Counsel appearing for the Applicant in advance, so
that the Applicant can put forth repose, if
any to the compliance report.
</p><p id="p_32">  The Order dated 08th October, 2015, further directs
the State to issue show cause notice as to why the
persons who are contributing to the pollution shall
not be directed to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/-
for causing pollution and recover and amount and
deposit the same in the Environmental Relief Fund.
It was also directed that persons resisting the claim,
shall be directed to be present before the Tribunal
and a report is to be filed by the respondents on
those aspects. The compliance report by the State
only disclose that 261 Notices have been issued to
the persons causing pollution on B.B. Distributary,
228 Notices were issued to those in Karniji Branch
(GB Mr.), 231 Notices were issued to those in Baror
Minor, 119 Notices were issued to those in Mandi
Minor and 392 Notices were issued to those in
Gharsana Minor. But the report does not disclose its
result. The Learned Counsel appearing for the state
submits that compensation was not paid by any
notice though notices dated 16th October, 2015,
were served. The copy of the Notice made available
shows that it was a notice issued just to show that
the order had been complied without complying the
directions in letter and spirit. Notice does not
disclose what the Noticees shall do and even if he is
willing to pay, when the amount, is to be paid and if
he is disputing when he has to appear before the
Tribunal. We have no hesitation to hold that the
Notice is not in compliance of the directions issued
by the Tribunal. We are sorry to note this attitude.
The state is directed to comply with the directions in
letter and spirit, without failure as otherwise we will
be constrained to take appropriate action.
  The order further directs removal of the existing
structures in the area meant for maintenance of the
canal finding that they cause contamination of the
canal water. The state was directed to remove those
structures and to place compliance report on the
next date. The compliance report claims that there
is no structure meant for canal maintenance
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                         11.</span>

contributing to contamination of drinking water. The
Learned Counsel appearing for the Applicant
disputes this fact. In the light of the factual findings
in the previous order we cannot agree with the said
statement in the compliance report. We direct the
Chief Engineer, WRD who is present today before
the Tribunal to inspect the area on 11th December,
2015 at 10:30 A.M. The Applicant shall be present in
the office of the Superintendent Engineer, WRD,
Ganganagar the Chief Engineer along with applicant
shall inspect the area. It is the duty of the Applicant
to point out the alleged structures now disputed by
the state. If the work is not over on that day it shall
continue on the next day. If there is any such
structure      contributing    the     pollution     and
contaminating drinking water as found in the order
dated 08th October, 2015, or interfering the
maintenance of the canal, they shall be removed
immediately.
</p><p id="p_33">  An exhaustive compliance report shall be filed on
the next date of hearing.
</p><p id="p_34">  List on 29th January, 2016."
</p>

<p id="p_35">"April 07, 2016
  In view of the fact that certain serious issues were
involved in this case, as for instance encroachments
on the canals providing drinking water, the State
Government       was    directed    to    prepare    a
comprehensive short term and long term scheme
with a time frame for the purpose of preventing
discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for
removal of encroachment situated on the water
bodies.
</p><p id="p_36">  Thereafter the State Government had filed an
affidavit on 08th October, 2015. Learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the State Government had,
on receiving of instructions from the Chief Engineer
concerned, submitted that the portion where canal
passes through densely populated localities, the
canal could be covered with an arch type concrete
covering so as to discourage any construction on it
and protect the pollution of water flowing through it.
It was also stated that on both sides of canal, the
State had acquired land in order to have service
road on one hand and an open space for the
purpose of maintenance of the said canal on the
other.
</p><p id="p_37">  Further it was stated that the said land would be
made free from of all encroachments and a fence
along with its boundary would be raised to prevent
further encroachments along the canals passing
through the municipal areas.
</p><p id="p_38">The State Counsel on instruction submitted that all
inlets into the canal have been plugged. Considering
the aforesaid facts and submissions made by the
parties, Tribunal had directed the State Government
to issue notice to the persons from whose premises
or where abouts these inlets originated, to show
cause as to why they should not be made to pay
compensation of Rs. 25,000/- for causing pollution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                        12.</span>

and the same be collected and deposited in
Environment Relief Fund. Persons resisting these
notices be asked to remain present before the
Tribunal on the next date.
</p><p id="p_39">  As the existence of the structures on the area
meant for maintenance of the canal are also
contributing to pollution and contamination of the
drinking water, the State Government was directed
to take immediate measures for removal of the such
encroachments and a report in this regard was to be
filed before the next date of hearing.
  But when the matter came up on 4 th December,
2016 not much improvement had been seen in the
matter. Another bench of the Tribunal had given a
detailed direction owing to incomplete compliance of
the earlier order passed by the Tribunal. Compliance
report filed on that day revealed that some of the
encroachers had approached the Hon'ble High Court,
apprehending that steps would be taken for their
remove.
</p><p id="p_40">  However, the Counsel for the applicant had
brought to the notice of the Tribunal that a Public
Interest Litigation is pending before the Division
Bench of Hon'ble High Court of judicature of
Rajasthan at Jodhpur in Civil Writ Petition (PIL) No.
12876/2011 (Ved Prakash Joshi Vs. State of Raj. &amp;
Ors.) and the same was considered on 10th
September, 2015, in the light of the order passed by
the Tribunal on 08th October, 2015. From the said
order of the Hon'ble Division Bench it is revealed
that the State Government had represented before
the Hon'ble High Court with regard to the removal of
encroachment by submitting that necessary orders
has already been passed by the National Green
Tribunal. By the order of the Hon'ble Division Bench,
a committee was constituted to demarcate the
encroachments for removal of the same and to
monitor it.
</p><p id="p_41">  Therefore, it was observed that the Hon'ble
Division Bench has not passed any directions with
regard to the encroachments issue which was being
considered by the Tribunal. A copy of the order
passed by the Single Judge in S.B. Civil Writ Petition
No. 11579 of 2015 dated 05th October, 2015, where
under respondents were restrained from taking any
coercive action against the petitioners therein,
subject to the condition that the petitioners shall
undertake that they shall not pollute and
contaminate water, was made available to the
Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_42">  It was observed by the Tribunal that in the
compliance report, State did not disclosed as to out
of 639 encroachers who had approached the Hon'ble
High Court and how many had obtained interim
relief by way of stay orders. Considering the overall
facts and submissions made by the State
Government, the Tribunal had observed that the
even if case of 639 encroachers are taken as
subjudice no effective action had been taken against
the remaining encroachers.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                        13.</span>

<p id="p_43"> In view of the lethargic attitude adopted by the
State, it was felt necessary to pass appropriate
order to see that Tribunal's order is implemented.
  Thus it was ordered on 04th December, 2015, that
all encroachments shall be removed within one
month. The District Collector, Sriganganagar,
Superintendent      of   Police,     Sriganganagar,
Commissioner, Municipal Council, Sriganganagar and
the Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust were to
provide all assistance and also to monitor the
removal of encroachments.
</p><p id="p_44"> It was noticed by the Tribunal that similar order
bad been passed by the Division Bench in Civil Writ
Petition (PIL) No. 12876/2011 (Ved Prakash Joshi
Vs. State of Raj. &amp; Ors.)
 The compliance report was to be filed by 29 th
January, 2016. The State Government was also
directed to issue notice to the persons who were
contributing to the pollution as to why they should
not pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/- and the same
be deposited in Environment Relief Fund. It was also
ordered that those who resist such claim, shall be
directed to be present before the Tribunal.
  The learned counsel for the applicant made
available the copy of the notices issued to the
persons causing pollution, to show that order of the
Tribunal has not been complied with in letter and
spirit. Tribunal observed that the notices do not
disclose as to what the noticees had to do and even
if he is willing to pay, where the amount was to be
paid and if he is disputing then when he has to
appear before the Tribunal. The Tribunal clearly
observed as under that the notices issued are not in
compliance of the directions of the Tribunal.
 "We are sorry to note this attitude. The state is
directed to comply with the directions in letter and
spirit, without failure or otherwise we will be
constrained to take appropriate action."
 Directions were further given for removal of
existing structures in the area meant for
maintenance of the canal as they were causing
contamination of canal water. Again the State was
directed to file a compliance report.
  Today also a compliance report has been filed by
the Executive Engineer, Water Resources, North
Division, Sri Ganganagar. Being concerned with the
gravity of the matter as well as past directions given
by the Tribunal and in the manner in which
compliance had been made by the respondents, as
reflected from various compliance reports, we
thought it proper to have an affidavit in the matter
from the senior responsible officer who was present
in the court, namely Chief Engineer, Water
Resources so as to give us the complete details. We
believe that when the Executive Engineer had filed
the compliance report based on official record that
the relevant record must also be with him.
  However, on the perusal of the affidavit filed by
the Chief Engineer today, it is reflected that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                        14.</span>

complete details in respect of the action taken by
the Government in pursuance to the directions
issued by the Tribunal, are falling short then what
was required. In respect of collecting the
compensation from the encroachers, one of the
methods that could have been adopted by the
Administration was under Public Debt Recovery.
  Before proceeding further in this matter and
observing in respect of the compliance report placed
before us, we deem it just and proper to give one
more opportunity to the Counsel for the State, who
has made a request for filing another response to
the compliance report submitted today.
  Learned Counsel for the applicant may file the
counter affidavit to the affidavit filed by the officer
today, positively by the next date of hearing.
Thereafter, the question of compliance of directions
passed by the tribunal as well as the present matter
would be considered and if need arises appropriate
action shall be taken against the concerned, where
upon consequence under law shall follow. It may be
noted that in respect of both the compliance reports,
the respondents were clearly asked and to which
they agreed, the same bas been filed with full
responsibility.
</p><p id="p_45"> List this matter on 26th April, 2016 at Principal
Bench, New Delhi."
</p><p id="p_46"> "July 22, 2016
  In view of the facts of the case and seriousness of
the matter, detail orders were passed on 7 th April,
2016 and 26th April, 2016 for the purpose of
removing encroachments from Indira Gandhi Canal,
Ganganagar and recovering penalties from for
polluting the water meant for drinking. The Tribunal
was compelled to order for appearance of the
District   Collector,  in    the   month    of  May.
Subsequently, steps in regard to the earlier
directions passed by the Tribunal were taken and
additional affidavit has been filed on behalf of the
respondent which reveals that some steps for taking
action against such encroachers were taken in the
first week of July, 2016 and thereafter the schedule
was redrawn for 20th July, 2016. On the strength of
the aforesaid schedules framed by the respondent it
is being submitted before us that steps are being
taken by the District Administration for removing the
encroachments. It is an admitted position that no
recovery of compensation has been made so far
from the encroachers. In all, there are 1000 odd
encroachers on the site in question and it is
submitted that about 100 odd have approached the
Court for seeking interim orders. About 300
encroachers are said to have been removed from
the site. The question is whether such encroachers
have resettled on the site in question or not. The
response by the counsel concern is not very
convincing.
</p><p id="p_47">  Such being the state of affairs in a serious matter
like this where drinking water of the public at large
is being polluted and the banks of the canal are

         being encroached, the District Administration is still
         moving at snail's speed. This Tribunal therefore, has
         no other option but to call the head of the District
         Administration. Accordingly, the District Collector,
         Ganga Nagar is directed to appear before the
         Tribunal on the next date of hearing with complete
         information and record which is relevant to the
         present proceedings.

<p id="p_50">          Pursuant to the directions issued by the NGT
from time to time, the Authorities of Water Resources
Department, Government of Rajasthan issued notices
to   several   persons     including     petitioner(s)      in    this
petition with a direction to remove encroachments from
the area of the water body. Against the said action of
the respondents, this writ petition has been filed.
</p><p id="p_51">          After hearing learned counsel for the parties
at length, this Court is prima facie of the view that
since the State Authorities are taking action pursuant

hereinabove, it would be appropriate for the persons
aggrieved with the action of the respondents to
approach the NGT, which has already ordered that any
person resisting the action of the State Authorities be
directed to present before the NGT. The Court has
expressed the above prima facie view looking to the
fact that in the matters regarding the pollution and
environment protection, as per <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_1">section 14</a> of the
National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, the NGT has

         submission of learned counsel is that availability of
         statutory remedy under the Act of 2010 does not bar
         writ jurisdiction as the Tribunal exceeded its
         jurisdictional authority by issuing the interim
         directions without examining the question pertaining

         cultural and educational rights. Some of the rights

<p id="p_53">         irrespective of their citizenship. The other parts of
         the Constitution confers several constitutional rights
         to the citizens of India. All these rights would have
         been of no meaning, if adequate safeguard would
         have not been given to enforce and protect such
         rights. Under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_4">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of India,
         remedy to ensure and protect fundamental rights is
         given as a fundamental right, but a very broad

treated at par or alike other statutory remedies. A
prominent self-imposed restriction in exercise the
discretion given under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
is the principle of exhausting all other statutory
remedies before approaching writ court. It is a rule
of convenience and discretion and does not oust the
jurisdiction of a writ court, but indicates a caution in
exercising extraordinary constitutional authority. The
deviation from this principle is permissible if the
relief is sought with well founded allegation of
violation of fundamental rights, if the right has been
or being threatened to be infringed by a law which
itself is ultra-vires, if there is a complete lack of
jurisdiction in the officer or the authority issuing
impugned order or action, if there is flagrant
violation of principles of natural justice, if the
prevention of public injury and vindication of public
justice requires the extraordinary recourse and if the
court is satisfied that the remedy available is not
efficacious enough to protect the injury caused or
may be caused. This principle applies with more
vigour, if a party is seeking a writ in the nature of
certiorari to get an order passed by judicial or quasi

    on its decision an indelible stamp of infirmity
    or vice which cannot be obliterated or cured
    on appeal or revision. If an inferior court or
    tribunal of first instance acts wholly without
    jurisdiction or patently in excess of
    jurisdiction or manifestly conducts the
    proceedings before it in a manner which is
    contrary to the rules of natural justice and
    all accepted rules of procedure and which
    offends the superior court's sense of fair
    play the superior court may, we think, quite
    properly exercise its power to issue the
    prerogative writ of certiorari to correct the
    error of the court or tribunal of first
    instance, even if an appeal to another
    inferior court or tribunal was available and
    recourse was not had to it or if recourse was
    had to it confirmed what ex facie was a
    nullity for reasons aforementioned. This
    would be so all the more if the tribunals
    holding the original trial and the tribunals
    hearing the appeal or revision were merely
    departmental tribunals composed of persons
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                       18.</span>

   belonging to the departmental hierarchy
   without    adequate    legal    training   and
   background and whose glaring lapses
   occasionally come to our notice. The
   superior court will ordinarily decline to
   interfere by issuing certiorari and all we say
   is that in a proper case of the kind
   mentioned above it has the power to do so
   and may and should exercise it."

<p id="p_55">       The petitioner herein seeks a deviation
from the doctrine of exhausting all other
remedies before approaching writ court with
allegation that the tribunal under the orders
impugned exceeded jurisdiction vested with it as
the original applicant is barred by limitation and
further the issue agitated in this regard has yet
not been decided.
</p><p id="p_56">       True it is, an objection about filing of the
original    application    within    the   limitation
prescribed is pending consideration before the
Tribunal and in light of the law laid down by
Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/38360473/" id="a_10">Foreshore Cooperative
Housing Society Limited v. Praveen D. Desai &amp;
Ors</a>. (supra), a plea of limitation concerns the
jurisdiction of court that tries the proceedings. A
writ court, if arrives at the conclusion that the
order passed by the subordinate court or tribunal
lack jurisdiction, then deviate from the principles
to avail alternative remedy, but it is always
within the discretion of the court and the court
even on arriving at the conclusion that the order
is without jurisdiction and is also in breach of
fundamental right may insist upon a party to
avail alternative remedy, if that is efficacious.
The eventualities given to deviate from the
principle under discussion does not put any
obligatory duty to invoke writ jurisdiction, but a
discretion only.
</p><p id="p_57">       In the case in hand original applicant Shri
Digvijay Singh, preferred a petition for writ
before a Division Bench of this Court with an
allegation of violation of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_11">Article 21</a> of the
Constitution of India, but looking to the remedy
provided under the Act of 2010 the same was
transferred to the tribunal. Chapter-III of the Act
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                       19.</span>

of 2010 relates to jurisdiction, powers and
proceedings of the Tribunal. As per <a href="/doc/159242890/" id="a_12">Section 14</a> of
the Act of 2010, the Tribunal have original
jurisdiction to hear all civil cases in which a
substantial question relating to environment in
respect of the acts mentioned in Schedule-I is
involved. The Tribunal acts as the first fact
finding authority and exclusively hears all
applications raising concerned with respect to
substantial question relating to environment. The
jurisdiction vested with the Tribunal is very wide
and that covers not only damage already caused,
but even the matter proposed to prevent any
damage i.e. expected to be caused in case
certain activities resulting in degradation of
environment are not stopped immediately. In
view of <a href="/doc/159242890/" id="a_13">Section 14</a> of the Act of 2010 there is no
doubt that the cause agitated by the original
applicant is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.
The only question is with regard to filing of the
application within the limitation prescribed. The
Tribunal possess ample power to condone the
delay specially in the circumstance that the case
of original applicant is that his cause is of
recurring nature. In view of it, it shall be too far
fetched to say that the Tribunal lack jurisdiction
patently. The Tribunal passed the orders
impugned after hearing the parties and,
therefore, there is no allegation of violation of
principles of natural justice. The Tribunal is
headed by the persons having deep knowledge of
law and also having expertise in relation to the
environmental issues. The allegation of the
petitioner while questioning correctness of the
orders impugned is based on violation of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_14">Article
19</a> of the Constitution of India, but in our opinion
i.e. yet to be adjudicated and that, in the case in
hand, is in confrontation with the fundamental
right enshrined under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_15">Article 21</a> of the
Constitution of India as claimed by the original
applicant. The remedy given by the legislature to
the Supreme Court as per <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_16">Section 22</a> of the Act
of 2010 is with a caution that even appeal may
be filed on any one or more of the grounds
specified in Section 100 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 and that indicates intention of
the legislature for minimal interference with the
orders passed by the Tribunal. The remedy given
under <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_17">Section 22</a> of the Act of 2010 by no stretch
of imagination can be termed and treated as not
efficacious to meet the injury, if any caused to
the petitioner, and if that involves any ground as
required to invoke Section 100 of the Code of
Civil Procedure.
</p><p id="p_58">       The most important aspect of the matter is
that the remedy provided under the Act of 2010
is before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of this
country. The Tribunal as per <a href="/doc/95877183/" id="a_18">Section 20</a> of the Act
of 2010 is under statutory obligation to apply the
principles of sustainable development, the
precautionary principle and the polluter page
principle. Instant one is a case where an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                  20.</span>

           admitted polluter is demanding the shield of
           fundamental right to protect his business which is
           subject to statutory conditions. It is also relevant
           to notice that <a href="/doc/159582911/" id="a_19">Section 29</a> of the Act of 2010 puts
           a bar upon civil courts to entertain any appeal in
           respect of any matter which the Tribunal is
           empowered to determine. Though a writ court is
           not subjected to <a href="/doc/159582911/" id="a_20">Section 29</a> ibid, but the
           underline principle suggests that even the writ
           court should be extremely slow in entertaining
           any issue which is under the jurisdiction of the
           Tribunal, as such, we do not think that the
           instant one is a case where a deviation from a
           well settled rule of policy is desirable.
</p><p id="p_59">                  Having considered all these aspects of the
           matter we are not at all inclined to invoke writ
           jurisdiction vested with us in the instant matter.
           The writ petition is dismissed accordingly."

application/representation.           It   is    also    prayed      that
sufficient time be granted to the aggrieved persons to
approach the NGT and till that time, the respondents-
State authorities be directed not to take any coercive
action against them.

that the delay has been caused in approaching to it as
the writ petition was pending before this Court. It is
requested that the NGT may consider the application/
