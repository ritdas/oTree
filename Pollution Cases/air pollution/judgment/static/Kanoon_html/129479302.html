</p><p id="p_100">8)    The Board of Officers had undertaken the

      process of evaluation of answer scripts of the

      candidates    who      had    appeared      in    the

      examination for the posts of Pos. The said

      officers   have    recorded   as    to   from    1734

      candidates who had qualified the physical test,

      how many candidates appeared for written test.

      Then it has been recorded as to how the papers

      were evaluated. It is also recorded therein that

      during the course of scrutiny of Section I of the

      question paper (multiple choice question) a key

      was prepared by the Board Members under the

      supervision   of    Chairman.      During   scrutiny,

      clerical mistakes were detected in five questions

      i.e. question No.8, 26, 28, 35 and 39 of series "A"

      and these questions posted in respective series

      i.e. B, C &amp; D. Then it is further recorded that vis-

      à-vis essay type question, the candidates have
      been assessed on the basis of their proficiency

     in   English     writing,     general      awareness,

     knowledge of law and latest case laws. General

     essay type question of 25 marks was got

     evaluated only by the field Police officers

     whereas Section III i.e. writing of short notes on

     know-how of law subjects was got evaluated by

     the officers of the Prosecuting Cadre nominated

     in the Board. It is based on proper assessment

     and evaluation marks have been awarded,

     based on which list of candidates who have

     made the grade for being called for interview

     have been called and admitted to interview.


</p><p id="p_101">9)   Learned counsel for the petitioners along with

     some of the petitioners while referring to Section

     I of the question booklet firstly pointed out that

     question No.4 is wrongly formulated. Question

     No.4 as formulated reads as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">          Q. No.4. No Magistrate shall authenticate the
          detention of an accused person in custody
          for a total period exceeding 90 days, if the
          investigation is not completed in relation to
          an offence punishable:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          a) With death
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">          b) With life imprisonment
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">          c) With imprisonment for a term of not less than
          10 years.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">          d) All the above.</blockquote><p id="p_102">
</p><p id="p_103">             Learned counsel for the petitioners would

      submit that 90 days has been wrongly recorded,

      it should have been 60 days but this contention

      is repelled by the counsel for the respondents by

      inviting attention of this Court to <a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_46">Section 20</a> of

      the     Jammu      and        Kashmir    Criminal

      Laws<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_47">(Amendment) Act</a>, 2013, in terms whereof

      <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_48">Section 167</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure

      has been amended providing that "in case          of

      offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_49">sections 326A</a>, <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_50">326B</a>,

      <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_51">376</a>, <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_52">376A</a>,<a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_53">376C</a>, <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_54">376D</a> and <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_55">Section 376E</a>, the

      period of "fifteen days" and "sixty days" be read

      as "thirty days" and "ninety days" respectively"

      which would mean that the Power of the

      Magistrate under    <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_56">Section    167</a> Cr.   P.   C   to

      authorize detention up to 90 days is permissible

      relatable to the punishments prescribed, for

      above referred offences.
</p>
<p id="p_104">
</p><p id="p_105">10)   Regarding question No.8, clear stand of the

      respondents is that one marks for this question

      has been awarded to all candidates.


</p><p id="p_106">11)   Question Nos.10 to 13, according to learned

      counsel for the petitioners, pertains to the
       Constitution of India which was not in the

      syllabus. This contention too is repelled by

      learned counsel for the respondents by referring

      to the note as appended to Annexure-A of the

      advertisement      notice     prescribing      syllabus,

      wherein note 3 reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_107">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">           The relevant issues(especially current affairs)
           pertaining         to         laws,       their
           implementation....reaction      from  society,
           Judiciary, Media and other pressure groups,
           and critical analyses thereof."</blockquote><p id="p_108">

</p><p id="p_109">           In addition thereto, it is also highlighted

      that the preamble of the Constitution of India is

      also referred to in various minors act as are

      included in the syllabus notified. Then the nature

      of questions is such which even otherwise fall

      within the ambit of current affairs pertaining to

      laws and their implementation.


</p><p id="p_110">12)   Next learned counsel for the petitioners referred

      to question No. 23 which pertains to offence

      under Section 376-C RPC. According to learned

      counsel all the four answers were not correct but

      same    is   repelled    by   learned     counsel      for

      respondents by stating that answer (a) i.e.

      "sexual intercourse committed by a person in

      authority"   was     the    right   answer.     In     this
       connection, learned counsel referred to <a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_57">Section

      12</a> of the Jammu and Kashmir Criminal Laws

      (Amendment) Act, 2013. <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_58">Section 376-C</a> begins

      with the heading "sexual intercourse by a

      person in Authority".
</p>
<p id="p_111">
</p><p id="p_112">13)   Next learned counsel referred to question No.26

      as according to him none of the answers was

      correct because an Executive Magistrate can

      order a person who is likely to commit breach of

      peace to execute a bond under <a href="/doc/1871365/" id="a_59">Section 112</a> Cr. P.

      C. The question No.26 reads as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">           "An Executive Magistrate can order a person
           who is likely to commit breach of peace to
           execute a bond under ___ <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_60">CrPC</a>.
</blockquote><p id="p_113">      a)   Sec 107
</p><p id="p_114">      b)   Sec 109
</p><p id="p_115">      c)   Sec 109
</p><p id="p_116">      d)   Sec 151."
</p>
<p id="p_117">           The Board which has been constituted for

      evaluation   of   answer     scripts   has    clearly

      indicated in the decision that answer to the

      question i.e. option (a) was the appropriate

      answer, whosoever has ticked marked the same,

      has been awarded one mark. It being so,

      contention is correctly repelled.
</p><p id="p_118"> 14)   Learned counsel next referred to question No.2,

      which reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_119">
</p><p id="p_120">           "The provision of hostile witness is provided
           under___ of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_61">Evidence Act</a>:-
</p><p id="p_121">      a)   Sec 155
</p><p id="p_122">      b)   Sec 133
</p><p id="p_123">      c)   Sec 154
</p><p id="p_124">      d)   Sec 154."
</p>
<p id="p_125">           According to him from amongst the options,

      option (c) and (d) were the correct answering.

      The Board who had scrutinized the papers have

      taken a conscious decision that whosoever has

      answered (c) or (d), has been given one mark

      rightly because <a href="/doc/1646837/" id="a_62">Section 154</a> is the correct

      answer,     therefore,     no    reason      for     the

      candidate/law graduate to get confused.


</p><p id="p_126">15)   Next learned counsel while highlighting question

      No.30 would submit that the answers were not

      correct. Question No.30 reads as under:


</p><p id="p_127">          "In case of death of a complainant while trial is
          pending:
</p><p id="p_128">      a)  Trial ceases automatically,
</p><p id="p_129">      b)  Trial does not cease automatically,
</p><p id="p_130">      c)  Trial is left to the discretion of Judge,
</p><p id="p_131">      d)  Trial is left to the discretion of family
      members of complainant."
</p>
<p id="p_132">           The contention is rightly repelled by the

      counsel for respondents by stating that out of

      four options, option (b) was the correct answer.
</p><p id="p_133"> 16)   Next learned counsel for the petitioners referred

      to question No.31. Two answers i.e. (b) and (c)

      from amongst four answers were correct but the

      position has been dealt with i.e. whosoever has

      answered (b) or (c) has been considered for

      award of marks.
</p>
<p id="p_134">
</p><p id="p_135">17)   Learned counsel next referred to formulation of

      question No.36 i.e. "who can take the plea of

      ignorance of Indian Law". The answer to this

      question lies in four options as given, therefore,

      no issue.
</p>
<p id="p_136">
</p><p id="p_137">18)   Learned counsel next referred to question No.38

      which reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_138">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">           "In a civil Suit, the person who files suits and
           the person against whom the suit is filed are

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">           d)   Plaintiff, defendant."</blockquote><p id="p_139">

</p><p id="p_140">           Learned counsel would submit that CPC

      was not in the syllabus but if a law graduate

      does not know as to who can be the plaintiff and

      defendant in a civil suit, that shall be too much

      for a law graduate because it is a general

      knowledge question.
</p><p id="p_141"> 19)   Then learned counsel referred to question No.39.

</p><p id="p_142">      Same reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_143">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">              "In a criminal case, an accused person, who in
              consideration of his non-prosecution offers to

</p><p id="p_145">              Due to typographical error in the word

      "Approve" "R" has not been recorded but the

      Board has examined this issue and have taken a

      decision that a person who has answered option

</p><p id="p_146">      (c) has been awarded marks. The typographical

      mistake is not that which would disable the

      candidates in answering the question.


</p><p id="p_147">20)   Next learned counsel referred to question No.40

      by highlighting that written statement is a

      concept under Civil Procedure Code which was

      not within the syllabus but same contention is

      repelled by learned counsel for the respondents

      by stating that written statement can be filed in

      other cases also and when same is filed after

      having been voluntarily singed and sworn, can

      be filed even in other criminal proceedings as

      well.
</p><p id="p_148"> 21)   Next learned counsel referred to question No.42

      which reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_149">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">           "Who is the final authority to appoint judges in
           the District

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25">           d) The Legislative Assembly."</blockquote><p id="p_150">

</p><p id="p_151">           There is no question of any ambiguity. The

      question has been formulated in a manner so as

      to test ability of the candidates, same cannot be

      said to be out of syllabus or incorrectly framed.


</p><p id="p_152">22)   Next learned counsel while referring to question

      No.44 and 45 claimed that these were out of

      syllabus. Question No.44 and 45 are reproduced

      here-under:
</p>
<p id="p_153">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">           "Q. No.44.When a bill becomes an Act:

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_33">           c)   Council Representatives;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_34">           d)   None of these."</blockquote><p id="p_154">


</p><p id="p_155">           The contention is rightly repelled by the

      learned counsel for respondents by stating that

      these question fall within the ambit of note 3 of

      the syllabus.
</p><p id="p_156"> 23)   Next it has been contended by some of the

      candidates that in Section-II of the question

      paper, 25 marks have been awarded for Essay

      but there is nothing wrong in it and the essay

      has been asked to be written on issues which fall

      within the ambit of syllabus. Same is the

      position about Section-III for which 10 marks

      have been earmarked. The petitioners cannot

      claim that the marks earmarked for Section-II

      and Section-III have been earmarked so as to

      leave scope for medaling with the merit, unless

      otherwise proved or established.


</p><p id="p_157">24)   Whether       answers   have    been   correctly    or

      improperly evaluated is not known at this stage,

      further neither mala fides have been attributed

      nor     it   is   anywhere   highlighted   that    any

      candidate has been favoured. Unless there are

      specific charges, such position cannot be looked

      into.
</p>
<p id="p_158">
</p><p id="p_159">25)   Apart from afore-stated position, an interim

      relief has been granted in two petitions that the

      petitioners in those petitions shall be admitted

      to interview, however, their result has been
       directed to be produced in a sealed cover

      whereas in another petition direction has been

      issued that the process of selection shall not be

      finalized until further orders from this court.


</p><p id="p_160">26)   Judgment relied upon by the petitioners in

      support of their contentions rendered by the

      High Court of Orissa in WP(C) Nos.10842 &amp;

      13086 of 2015 decided on 28.07.2015 is of no

      help to the petitioners as the said judgment has

      its own peculiar facts and features i.e. in the

      said judgment it has been stated that 24

      questions out of 100 as set by Odisha Public

      Service Commission were wrong. Later on an

      Expert Committee had been constituted by the

      OPSC.       The    said     Committee       noticing

      typographical errors as well as ambiguity in

      questions had concluded that 76 questions were

      in order, therefore, on the basis of that Expert

      Committee report, Commission had taken a

      decision that the performance of the candidates

      on 76 questions would reflect their true merit, as

      such, it was decided that 76 questions would be

      evaluated    and   the    marks   secured   by    the
       candidates will be pro-rated to arrive at the total

      marks to be awarded out of 100 marks to the

      candidates.     In   the    said   background,       the

      preliminary    written     examination       of   Odisha

      Judicial Service, 2015 for recruitment to the post

      of Civil Judges under the Odisha Judicial Service

      was set aside and fresh preliminary written

      examination was directed to be conducted.


</p><p id="p_161">27)   Reverting     back   to    the   case   in   hand,   the

      circumstances are not similar as noticed in detail

      hereinabove. The position in the context of the

      objections raised vis-à-vis questions being out of

      syllabus, wrong options of answers and wrong

      formulation of questions, stands threadbare

      discussed and clarified. Furthermore, the High

      Level Committee as was constituted by the

      respondent-authority has clarified the matter,

      therefore, the judgment of Orissa High Court, as

      relied upon by the petitioners does not cover the

      case of the petitioners in view of having its own

      facts and circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_162">
</p><p id="p_163">28)   Keeping in view the afore-stated facts and

      circumstances, it would not be appropriate at
       this stage to interfere with the process of

      selection as is in progress nor there is any

      ground available at this stage for so doing.

      However, the petitioners who have failed to

      make the grade are at liberty to re-agitate if any

      ill treatment, mala fides or any favouritism shall

      be discernible or any other valid ground shall be

      or will become available on completion of

      selection process. In that eventuality, the final

      selection/appointment shall be open to question

      on any such or other grounds as may become

      available.
</p>
<p id="p_164">
</p><p id="p_165">29)   Viewed thus, all the petitions in the aforesaid

      backdrop shall, accordingly, stand disposed of.
