3                 The grievance relates to the grant of mining permission on 7 th 

May 2010 in favour of Respondent No.5 for conducting mining activity in 

the private land bearing Gat Nos. 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505 

and 510 situate at Village Bhilarewadi, Taluka Mulshi, District Pune.   The 

total  area  of   the  property  is  stated  to  be   9  Hectares  and  73  Ares.     The 

property   belongs   to   Respondent   No.5-Babanrao   Dattatraya   Bhilare.     On 

consideration of an application tendered by Respondent No.5 on 7 th  May

conducting mining activities for a period of 10 years.  At the relevant time, 

the village Panchayat was pleased to adopt the resolution on 26 th February 

2008, granting no objection in favour of Respondent No.5 on fulfillment of 

certain   conditions.     According   to   the   Petitioner,   since   the   terms   and 

conditions have  not been satisfied, the  resolution adopted by the  village 

Panchayat   earlier,   was   revoked   and   the   NOC   and   the   consent   granted 

earlier,   came   to   be   terminated   on   26th  January   2014.     A   complaint   was 

made   by   the   Petitioner   to   the   Regional   Officer,   Maharashtra   Pollution 

Control   Board   on   24th  February   2014,   alleging   that   the   activities   of 

Respondent No.5 are creating harmful impact on the environment.  Similar 

complaint was also made to the Tahasildar, Taluka Mulshi on 25 th November 

2011 and 15th March 2012.  The Additional Collector was pleased to grant 

stay to the permission accorded earlier in favour of Respondent No. 5 and 

directed   him   to   stop   the   work   by   an   order   dated   24 th  March   2014. 

Respondent No.5 preferred a revision challenging the order passed by the 

Collector.  The Revisional Authority stayed the order passed by the Collector 

and directed him to dispose of the application tendered by the Petitioner on 

its own merit.  The Additional Collector passed the final order on 30 th June 

2014.   The Additional Collector was pleased to direct the cancellation of 

mining lease granted in favour of Respondent No.5 on 7 th  May 2010 and 

further directed that no excavation of Minor Minerals, such as stone and 

murum, should be done.  Aggrieved by the order passed by the Additional

preferring an Appeal.  However, the Appeal came to be disposed of by the 

Additional   Commissioner,   holding   that,   he   does   not   have   jurisdiction   to 

entertain the Appeal.   Respondent No.5, aggrieved by the Judgment and 

order   passed   by   the   Additional   Commissioner,   approached   the   State 

Government by preferring a Revision Application  seeking stay to the order 

passed by the Additional Collector. The Hon'ble Minister, by an order dated 

9th  September 2014, was pleased to stay the order passed by the Additional 

Commissioner.

<p id="p_7">

4                 The Petitioner, being aggrieved by the order directing the stay 

of the operation of the decision of the Additional Collector, approached this 

Court by preferring a Writ Petition bearing No. 8537 of 2014, which came 

to   be   disposed   of   by   the   learned   Single   Judge   of   this   Court   on   24 th 

September 2014.  Respondent No.5 made a statement before the Court that 

he shall not conduct mining activities in Gat Nos. 504, 505, 509 and 510. 

Considering the statement made, this Court was pleased to dispose of the 

Writ Petition with a direction to Hon'ble Minister to decide the  Revision 

Application finally on its own merit, within a period of two months from 

the date of the order.  The Respondent  opted to make a statement before

Certificate   from   the   Ministry   of   Environment   and   Forest   Department, 

Government of India, is mandatorily required.   Since there was no such 

clearance   secured,  the  Respondent  opted  to   make   the   statement  that  he 

would restrict the mining activity in less than 5 Hectares area.  In fact, the 

Respondent tendered a proposal for Environmental Clearance Certificate to 

the   State   Level   Impact   Assessment   Committee.     The   State   Level   Impact 

Assessment Committee has granted necessary certification in favour of the 

Respondent.   It is the  contention  of the  Petitioner that since  the  mining 

license itself is in respect of an area of 9 Hectares and 73 Ares, it was not 

permissible for Respondent No.5 to make a statement and exclude certain 

area with a view to escape from the mandatory requirement of securing and 

obtaining   of   a   Environmental   Clearance   Certificate   from   the   Ministry   of 

Environment and Forest, Central Government.   It is further contention of 

the Petitioner that even if the area, which Respondent No.5 claims is to be 

excluded, still the total area of the activity of Respondent No.5 exceeds 5

projects of minor minerals with less than 50 Hectares of mining lease area 

are sub-classified as category "B1" and "B2" projects.   It is provided that 

Brick earth or Ordinary earth mining projects having lease area less than 5

</pre><p id="p_14">unacceptable for the reason that the mining lease granted by the Additional

mining   license   granted   on   7th  May   2010,   has   not   been   amended   or 

substituted.     It   was   impermissible   for   the   Additional   Collector   to   grant 

mining lease in respect of 9 Hectares and 73 Ares area, without observing 

the procedure and without securing prior environmental clearance. 



12                 It is the contention of the Respondent that after the decision of 

the State Government, the Respondent has obtained consent dated 9 th June 

2016, to operate under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of 

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. The consent is granted for the period upto 30 th April 

2021.     It   is   contended   that   the   consent   obtained   from   the   Maharashtra 

Pollution Control Board by the Respondent No.5 is valid upto 2021 and as 

such,   the   objection   raised   by   the   Petitioner   do   not   survive.     It   is   the 

contention of the Respondent that the decision in respect of mining lease 

shall have to be ascertained on consideration of the decision of the State

Board.  It is the contention of Respondent No.5 that by a letter dated 14 th

appropriate directions to provide/upgrade pollution control device within 

stipulated time.  It is contended that those conditions have been complied 

with.  It is the contention of the Respondent that around the area of mining 

activities, there is no locality inhabiting the villagers. 



13                 The village Bhilarewadi is situate more than 546.5 yards away 

and village Ambegaon is situate at 1862 yards from the mining activity.  It is 

contended that for conducting blasting activity, necessary precautions have 

been taken.   The Respondent has also planted various trees in the nearby 

vicinity.  The Respondent regularly sprinkle water on the road, approaching 

to the said mine, so as to avoid environmental pollution and to minimize 

the dust particles.   It is contended that Respondent is using water spray 

during the blasting activity and while transporting the minor minerals.  It is 

contended that since the Respondent is observing the conditions provided 

under   the   Bombay   Minor   Minerals   Excavation   Rules   and   also   under   the 

Maharashtra   Minor   Minerals   Excavation   Rules,   there   is   no   warrant   to 

interfere in the matter.   So far as maintenance of the road is concerned, 

according   to   the   Respondent,   construction   of   permanent   road   is   already 

sanctioned by the District Council and the funds are also made available for 

the same.  However, due to the obstruction of the Petitioner, the funds could 

not be utilized by the District Council.

present water level is 6.30", and  there are almost 10 to 12 boring wells in 

operation and drawing water for agriculture and drinking purposes.   The

17                 It   must   be   noted   that   even   if   the   area   of   4.79   hectares   is 

</pre><p id="p_20">excluded out of the total area of 11.10 hectares, the mining activity being 

conducted by Respondent No. 5 relates to 6.31 hectares, which is more than 

5 hectares.  The another factor that needs to be considered is whether the 

contention  of  the  Respondent that he restricts his mining activity for  an 

area   less   than   5   hectares,   can   be   accepted     without   there   being   any 

amendment or issuance of a fresh authorization   by the Collector to the 

Respondent.  The authorization issued on 7th   May 2010,  records the area 

of     various   Gat   numbers   to   be   9.73   hectares.     In   fact,   the   said   area 

comprising of all the Gat numbers, recorded in the order, ought to have 

been computed at 11.10 hectares.  Even assuming that the authorization is 

in respect of 9.73 hectares, it would not be permissible for the Respondent 

to contend that, since he restricts the activities of mining, excluding certain 

Gat numbers, he shall not be required to obtain Environmental Clearance 

from   the   Central   Government   which   requires     application   of   stringent 

procedural norms.  The whole exercise undertaken by the Respondent and 

permitted   by   the   State-Authority,   is   aimed   at   giving   go-bye   to   the 

procedural requirement of securing Environmental Clearance from Central 

Government by application of stringent  norms.     It was impermissible for 

the   authorities   to   rely   upon   the   Environmental   Clearance,   given   by   the 

State agency, contrary to the relevant policy norms.

18                 The Additional Collector, Pune while directing the cancellation 

</pre><p id="p_22">of permission accorded on 7th   May 2010, has taken into consideration the 

aspect of environmental pollution.   It is recorded in the order that, as a 

result   of   the   atmospheric   pollution,   the   villagers   were   required   to   close 

down the school, which is situated at a proximate distance from the mining 

site.  The report of the Medical Officer, Primary Health Centre, Mutha dated 

12th   May 2014, discloses that as a result of atmospheric pollution, large 

number of senior citizens, women and children are suffering from throat 

and respiratory ailments.   The  Maharashtra  Pollution  Control Board also 

took cognizance of the complaint lodged by the villagers and issued notice 

on  28th  February   2014   to  Sunny   Stone  Group  directing  the  said   crusher 

operator to show cause as to why activity of stone crushing shall not be 

prohibited.  A doubt is also raised as regards the NOC issued by the village 

Panchayat on 2nd February 2014.  The report in respect of the Air Pollution 

dated 14th February 2014, discloses that the Air quality in the vicinity does 

not satisfy the requisite benchmark.   The RSPM level was noticed to 147 

whereas,   SPM   level   was   542   which   indicates   that   the   air   quality   in   the 

vicinity was quite poor.   It is also recorded in the order, referring to the 

report   of   ground   water   survey   dated   24th    April   2014,   that   there   is 

depletion   of   underground  water  level.    Thus,  the   adverse   environmental 

factor, which is directly linked to   mining activity, permitted in favour of 

Respondent No. 5, has not at all been dealt with by the State Government

has been recorded in the order that it would be open for the Maharashtra

the correctness of the complaint made by the Villagers.  A reference is made 

to   the   minutes   of   the   meeting   of   the   State   Expert   Appraisal   Committee 

dated 28th  and 29th  April 2014, in respect of repairs of the metal road.  The 

Revisional Authority has further recorded in the order that an appropriate 

decision as regards the grant of environmental consent, shall have to be 

taken   by   the   State   Level   Expert   Appraisal   Committee.   The   Revisional 

Authority has not referred the reports of the Medical Officer, as well as, by 

the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, concerning the air quality.   The 

detailed reasonings of ill-effect on the environment, recorded in the order 

passed   by   the   Additional   Collector,   have   been   brushed   aside,   without 

recording   any   convincing   reasons.     The   order   passed   by   the   Revisional 

Authority is quite cryptic and passed without  application of mind to record 

of the case.   The order impugned, passed by the Revisional Authority on 

24th December 2014, therefore, deserves to be quashed and set aside.

20                 The learned counsel appearing for Respondent No. 5 contends 

that the decision rendered by the Supreme Court in the matter of  Deepak

The   Supreme   Court   in   the   matter   of  Deepak   Kumar   &amp;   Ors.   (Supra)  has

recommendation made by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in its 

report of March 10 and model guidelines framed by the Ministry of Mining 

within a period of 6 months from the date of the order and to sub0mit the 

compliance   report.    In  the   instant  matter, since  the  authorization  of   the 

lease in respect of an area more than 5 Hectares, the procedure prescribed 

for award of mining lease beyond 5 Hectares and the necessity of public 

hearing before issuance of environmental clearance, could not have been 

avoided.  Though the authorization in the instant matter was issued on 7 th 

May 2010, the same was recalled by the Additional Collector, Pune on 30 th 

June 2014.  The Environmental Clearance in the matter has been issued by 

the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority on 1 st   January 

2015.     The   clearance   issued   by   the   State   Level   Environmental   Impact 

Assessment Authority is questionable in view of the fact that the area of 

mining   activity   is   more   than   5   Hectares   and   without   there   being   public 

hearing, the environmental clearance ought not to have been issued.  It also 

needs to be emphasized that the State Government did not consider the 

vital aspect relating to the damage of the environment, as a result of the 

mining activities in the village and proximate to the residential locality of 

the village, the impact on the flora and fauna of the region, the fact that the 

school   operating   in   village   was   required   to   be   shifted   on   account   of

21                 So far as the objection raised by the Respondent relating to the 

maintainability   of   the   Petition   is   concerned,   it   has   to   be   noted   that   the 

Petition does not relate to only the environmental issues falling within the 

jurisdictional   area   of   the     National   Green   Tribunal.     The   Petitioner   has 

objected   to   the   order   passed   by   the   State   Government   and   has   also 

questioned the clearance issued by the Environmental Impact Assessment 

Committee.     If   the   issue   brought   before   the   Court   covers   some   of   the 

aspects falling within the jurisdiction of the NGT Act, as well as, the issues 

which are required to be dealt with in exercise of writ jurisdiction, it cannot 

be said that the jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article 226</a> is excluded. 

The Division Bench of this Court while dealing with a  PIL No. 49 of 2013  

decided on 8 May 2013 (Mr. Parshuram Uparkar Vs. Union of India) has dealt

for the petitioner to approach the alternate forum and the petition shall not

our view, from the aforesaid observations, it is clear that only such cases which  

fall within the purview of the aforesaid sections and Schedule-I, would have to  

be filed before the NGT.   However, in our humble view, in cases where apart  

from environmental issues, other reliefs are claimed by the Petitioner which  

are not covered under the said sections and the matters covered under the NGT  

Act or Schedule-I and the said issues are inseparable then such cases will have  

to be considered by this Court if a composite Petition is filed where other reliefs  

claimed are not covered under the NGT Act."

matter of  Shri Gangadhar Narsingdas Agrawal Vs. Ministry of Environment

behalf of the Petitioner before the Court that they cannot be relegated to 

two remedies, one before the Tribunal and another before the High Court

challenge is essentially to the order passed by the State Government, setting 

aside the order passed by the Additional Collector.  For the reasons recorded
