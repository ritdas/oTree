                        W.P.(C.) No. 24088 of 2019
                      -----------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 26th day of February, 2020


                                 JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">       The case set up in the above W.P.(C.) is as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_2">       That the petitioner is owner and in possession of 4 cents of property

in survey no.32/4B/1 within the 1st respondent panchayat. The petitioner's

husband had inherited 21 cents of property and the property possessed by

the petitioner is the part of the 21 cents. The petitioner had constructed a

residential building within the property possessed by the petitioner in years

back and her family is residing there. There is drinking water well also

within the property for drinking and other purposes and this is only water

course for the petitioner's family.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       The 4th respondent is the owner of 2 cents of property in the same

survey number, lying contiguously, wherein the 4 th respondent started

construction of two storey building in violation of prevailing building

Rules. Against the illegal construction of building by the 4 th respondent the

petitioner made several complaints before the 2 nd respondent from 2018

onwards, but till date neither any action nor any decision has been taken by

the 2nd respondent on the complaint. Now the 4 th respondent started
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> WP(C).No.24088 OF 2019(I)                         3</span>


construction of septic tank and waste water disposal pit near to the

drinking water well of the petitioner in clear violation of Rule 85 of Kerala

Panchayat Building Rules, 2011. As per provisions under Kerala Panchayat

Building Rules, 2011 and Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 the 2nd respondent are duty bound to prevent contamination of water

and violation of building Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       It is in the light of these averments and contentions that the

petitioner has filed the instant W.P.(C.) with the following prayers :

</p><p id="p_5">  (i) "Issue a writ of mandamus or appropriate order or direction directing the 2 nd
  respondent not to issue occupancy certificate to building constructed by the 4 th
  respondent in the property having survey no.320/4B/1 of Elanji Village.
</p><p id="p_6">  (ii) Issue a writ of mandamus or appropriate order or direction directing the
  respondent 2 to demolish the illegal construction of building by the 4 th respondent in
  the property having survey No.320/4B/1 of Elanji Village.
</p><p id="p_7">  (iii) Issue a writ of mandamus or appropriate order or direction directing the 3 rd
  respondent to measure and demarcate the boundary of the property of the
  petitioner.
</p><p id="p_8">  (iv) Grant such other orders as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper
  considering the facts and circumstances of the case and
</p><p id="p_9">  (v) Grant the costs of this writ petition."
</p>
<p id="p_10">       2.     Heard Sri.James Abraham (Vilayakattu), learned counsel

appearing for the petitioner, Sri.Jestin Mathew, learned Government

Pleader appearing for R3 and Sri.Kaleeswaram Raj, learned counsel

appearing for R4. Though notices have been duly served on R1 and R2,

Grama Panchayat, the same will stand dispensed with.

</p><p id="p_11">       3.     After hearing both sides, this Court is of the considered view

that the main matters raised by the petitioner in this case would

predominantly fall within the domain of the private law. It is for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> WP(C).No.24088 OF 2019(I)                 4</span>


petitioner to approach the civil court for ventilating for the redressal of the

grievances in this regard. The cases of this nature are increasingly being

filed by resort to writ proceedings and entertaining of such matters which

predominantly would fall within the zone of the private law, would not be

conducive         to the interest of administration of    justice as the writ

proceedings are essentially for the purpose of adjudication of the matters

which would call for the intervention through public law remedies.

</p><p id="p_12">       4.     The counsel for the petitioner would point out that the

petitioner would approach the civil court for venitilating of the main

grievances and that the limited direction sought for by the petitioner in this

case is to ensure that the 3rd respondent Tahsildar and the Taluk Surveyor

concerned takes necessary action on Ext.P5 application filed by the

petitioner for survey and measurement of the subject property to ensure

that the boundary of the petitioner's property and that of the 5 th respondent

are duly demarcated and also to ascertain as to whether the 4 th respondent

has encroached into the property of the petitioner etc.

</p><p id="p_13">       5.     Per contra, Sri.Kaleeswaram Raj, learned counsel appearing for

the 4th respondent would point out that the 4th respondent has not made

any encroachment into the petitioner's property and the construction has

been made strictly in terms of the provisions contained in the Kerala

Panchayat Building Rules concerned and that if a proper survey and

measurement is conducted, it can be easily established that the abovesaid
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> WP(C).No.24088 OF 2019(I)                5</span>


allegation of the petitioner that the 4 th respondent has encroached into the

property of the petitioner for making the instant construction etc. is

absolutely false and misconceived etc.

</p><p id="p_14">       6.     Sri.Jestin Mathew, learned Government Pleader would submit

on the basis of instructions that the 3rd respondent Tahsildar has acted

upon Ext.P5 application dated 26.8.2019 and has sought the aid and

assistance of the Taluk Surveyor concerned for conduct of the survey and

measurement. Accordingly, in respect of the said limited aspect, it is

ordered that the 3rd respondent Tahsildar will ensure that the aid and

assistance of the Taluk Surveyor is obtained to ensure that the survey and

measurement of the subject property is conducted, so as to ascertain and

demarcate the boundaries between the properties of the petitioner and the

4th respondent and also to ascertain the correctness of the petitioner's

allegation that the 4th respondent has encroached into petitioner's property

for making the construction in question. The 3 rd respondent Tahsildar will

ensure that the Taluk Surveyor concerned conducts the survey and

measurement of the subject property with due prior notice to the petitioner

and the 3rd respondent and after examining the prior title deeds of both the

parties as well as the old survey records and re-survey records etc. and also

ensure that the boundary of the petitioner and that of the 4 th respondent's

properties are duly demarcated and identified in accordance with the

provisions contained in the Boundary and Survey Act and the Rules
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> WP(C).No.24088 OF 2019(I)                 6</span>


framed thereunder. Such survey and measurement shall be conducted by

the Taluk Surveyor with due prior notice to the petitioner and the 4 th

respondent and the Taluk Surveyor will ensure that survey report and

survey sketch is also prepared accordingly and in the survey sketch, it is

clearly shown as to whether the 4th respondent has made any encroachment

into the petitioner's property. The copies of the said survey report and the

survey sketch shall be given in advance to the petitioner and the 4 th

respondent and thereafter, the 3rd respondent Tahsildar will hear the

petitioner and the 4th respondent and then may pass appropriate

proceedings for finalising the request made in Ext.P5 in terms of the

provisions contained in the Boundary and Survey Act and the Rules

framed thereunder. The steps in this regard should be duly completed by

the 3rd respondent Tahsildar and the Taluk Surveyor within 1 month from

the date of production of a certified copy of this judgment.

</p><p id="p_15">       7.     Thereafter, in case any of the parties concerned have any

grievances in relation to the said survey and measurement process, then it

is for them to work out the remedies in accordance with the law. The liberty

is accorded to the petitioner to approach the civil court for ventilating her

grievances relating to the other issues raised in this petition. This court has

passed an interim order on 20.9.2019, wherein it has been directed that

the 2nd respondent Panchayat to ensure that no construction is carried out

by the 4th respondent overlooking the provisions of the Kerala Panchayat
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> WP(C).No.24088 OF 2019(I)                   7</span>


Building Rules. The said interim order dated 20.9.2019 issued by this Court

in this W.P.(C.) shall continued to be in force for a period of 6 weeks and

this order has been passed only for the purpose of ensuring that the subject

matter of the lis is preserved. It is for the petitioner to file a civil suit along

with appropriate interlocutory application before the civil court concerned.

It is made clear that the abovesaid order shall not be construed in any

manner as an expression on the part of this Court regarding the merits of

the controversy, which is to be considered by the civil court concerned.

</p><p id="p_16">       With these observations and directions, the above W.P.(C.) will stand

disposed of.
