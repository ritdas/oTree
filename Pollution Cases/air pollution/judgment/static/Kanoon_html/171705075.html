given a written complaint to SDM, West and SHO, PS Uttam

Nagar in respect of industrial activities being carried out by

the defendants no.1 to 3 on 06.12.2010 but no concrete

action was taken by the defendant no.5 and SHO PS Uttam

Nagar. Defendants no. 1 to 3 are doing the work of making

hammers, chisels and for that purpose, they have also

installed heavey machines in their premises and also used

to burn heavy quantity of coals and also used to heavy force

on hot iron rods and thereby they create so much pollution

i.e. noise as well as air pollution in the locality. Thereafter,

plaintiff's husband filed a civil suit against the defendants

no. 1 to 5. Hon'ble Court had allowed the application under

Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 CPC and thereby restrained the

defendants no. 1 to 3 from doing any illegal and unlawful

industrial activities from their premises. Later on, the

husband of plaintiff and his counsel could not look after

properly the case. Therefore, the civil suit filed by plaintiff's

husband has been dismissed in default and the restoration

application has also been dismissed by by the Court vide

defendants no. 1 to 3 have again started illegal &amp; unlawful

industrial activities form their abovesaid premises. Plaintiff

is in the clutches of various types of elements and she is not

having good health and on account of the illegal and

unlawful industrial activities carried out by the defendants

no. 1 to 3, the health of the plaintiff is also deteriorated day

by day. Plaintiff has also personally requested to defendants

no. 1 to 3 on various dates i.e. 25.06.2016, 15.07.2016 &amp;

24.07.2016, but defendants no. 1 to 3 clearly refused to

stop the illegal industrial work carried out by them.

Therefore, plaintiff has filed the present suit. Cause of action

to file the present suit firstly arose when defendants no.1 to

3 started running illegal &amp; unlawful industrial activities and

it further arose when husband of the plaintiff requested

them no to to so but in vein. It further arose on 06.12.2010,

when plaintiff's husband made a complaint to the defendant

no.5 and SHO, PS Uttam Nagar and when plaintiff's husband

arose on 24.07.2016, when plaintiff requested to defendants

no. 1 to 3 no to do illegal &amp; unlawful industrial activities but

they clearly refused to do so and the cause of action is still

subsisting. Plaintiff had requested to pass a decree against

defendants no.1 to 3 restraining them from doing illegal &amp;

unlawful industrial activities from their aforesaid premises

without obtaining prior permission or valid license from

competent authorities and defendants no.4 to 6 may be

directed to ensure the removal of heavy machines as well as

WS also filed on behalf of defendant no. 6 stating that the

suit of the plaintiff is not maintainable by virtue of Section

41 (h) of <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_1">The Specific Relief Act</a>; present suit is devoid of any

merits and is liable to be dismissed; present suit is an

attempt of plaintiff to settle his personal scores with

himself as DW1 and tendered his affidavit Ex.DW1/1 and he

their evidence and accordingly, DE was closed and matter

was fixed for final arguments.
</p>
<p id="p_18">6.          Final arguments heard. Ld. Counsel for plaintiff

argued that the plaintiff is a peace loving person and is

resident of C-805, Shiv Vihar, J.J. Colony, Hastsal, New Delhi.

The defendants are residing in her neighbourhood. The

defendants are running industrial activities by way of doing

the work of making hammers etc. and for that purpose, they

also used to burn heavy quantity of coals and further they

used heavy force on iron rods. In this process, the

defendants are creating air as well as noise pollution which

is deteriorating the health of the plaintiff and the defendants

are also creating nuisance for the residents of the locality.

The defendants are having no any permission or license

from the concerned authority for running the industrial

activity of making the iron instruments. The plaintiff had

proved her case with oral &amp; documentary evidence.

Therefore, suit of the plaintiff is liable to be decreed in her

favour and against the defendants.

<p id="p_20">7.          On the other hand, Ld. Counsel for defendants

no. 1 to 3 argued that there is no any industrial activity is in

existence at the spot. The defendants were doing their

traditional work as they belong to "Lohaar" community.

They were doing their work without using any machinery

used to industrial activity. The plaintiff is having no locus-

standi to file the present suit. The plaintiff himself is neither

allottee nor owner of the premises where she is residing as

same belongs to J.J. Colony which were allotted to the needy

person by the concerned department for their use along

with their family members. The plaintiff is residing in that

premises in unauthorized manner and therefore, she has not

come before the Court with clean hands. Plaintiff has failed

to prove her case and suit of the plaintiff is without any

merit and therefore, same is liable to be dismissed. Ld.

Counsel for defendant no.6 argued that the present suit is

regarding dispute between the plaintiff and defendants no. 1

to 3. There is no role of defendant no.6. The cause of action

or relief sought by the plaintiff does not come under the

purview of defendant no.6 and therefore, the suit against

defendant no.6 filed by the plaintiff is liable to be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_22">8.          I have considered the submissions of both the

parties and perused the record. I have also gone through

the evidence placed on record by both the parties. First of

all issue no. (iii) is taken up for adjudication of the suit. Issue

no. (iii) is that Whether suit of the plaintiff is liable to be

dismissed u/O VII R 11 CPC? Onus to prove these issue is

upon defendants no. 1 to 3. The defendants no. 1 to 3 have

not produced any evidence in this regard. However, it is

settled law that to decide the question that whether suit is

liable to be rejected u/O VII R 11 CPC, Court has to see only

the contents of the plaint. In the body of the plaint, plaintiff

has alleged that defendants no. 1 to 3 are doing industrial

activity in her neighbourhood and because of the pollution

created by the defendants, the health of the plaintiff is

deteriorating    day-by-day.   The    plaintiff   has    prima-facie

disclosed the cause of action. Court does not find that in

view of the statement made in the plaint, the plaint is liable

to be rejected u/O VII R 11 CPC. Hence, issue no. (iii) is

decided against defendants no. 1 to 3 and in favour of

plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_24">9.           Issue no. (iv) is that Whether present suit is not

maintainable against defendant no.6? Onus to prove this

issue is upon defendant no.6. Defendant no. 6 is Delhi

Pollution Control Committee. The plaintiff in her plaint raised

objection    upon   the   alleged    pollution    created    by   the

defendants no. 1 to 3. In prayer clause, plaintiff is seeking

mandatory injunction against defendants no. 4 to 6. No any

evidenced led by defendant no.6 to discharge its onus. In

view of the material available on record, Court finds that

defendant no. 6 is failed to prove this issue through

for decree of permanent injunction in her favour and against

defendants no.1 to 3, as prayed for? Onus to prove this

issue is upon plaintiff. During evidence, plaintiff had

examined herself as PW1. In her affidavit Ex.PW1/A, she had

stated that she is residing at C-805, Shiv Vihar, J.J. Colony,

Hastsal, New Delhi since last many years. She has not

clarified that in which capacity, she is residing at the given

address. She had not placed on record any other evidence

regarding    her    possession/residence      at   the   aforesaid

premises like electricity bill, water bill etc. She had filed her

Aadhar Card Ex.PW1/6. But same cannot be considered as a

conclusive proof that she is in possession and is residing at

the address given in Aadhar card.

to this document one Sh. Radhey Shyam entered into

agreement to sell the aforesaid plot to one Sh. Kailash. This

document is also accompanied with other document i.e.

General Power of Attorney according to which Sh. Radhey

Shyam appointed to Sh. Kailash as General Power of

Attorney regarding the aforesaid plot No. C-805. During

evidence, plaintiff had placed on record only one page each

of General Power of Attorney and Agreement to Sell i.e.

Ex.PW1/1. If the proved page of agreement to sell is seen

separately from the page of general power of attorney, then

it is not clarified in agreement to sell &amp; purchase that

regarding which plot it is talking. Further plaintiff had placed

on record only part of general power of attorney, therefore,

admitted by PW1 that the Government of India has not

allotted the property in her name and it is stated by her that

document regarding purchase of the property as she had
