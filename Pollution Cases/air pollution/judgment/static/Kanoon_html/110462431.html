      THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY HEARING,
THIS DAY, NAGARATHNA J., MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                            -: 3 :-




                        ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1. Sri R.G.Kolle, learned AGA takes notice for Respondent

Nos.1 and 2, Sri D.Nagaraj, learned counsel takes notice

for Respondent No.3 and Sri Harikrishna S.Holla, learned

counsel takes notice for Respondent No.5.


</p><p id="p_2">2.   In this writ petition, the petitioner has sought a

direction to the respondents to consider the petitioner's

application dated 19/04/2013 (Annexure "D") and direct

the first respondent - authority to issue temporary licence

to run his stone crusher unit in the safer zone.


</p><p id="p_3">3.   It is the case of the petitioner that he has a stone

crusher named as Sri Annapoorneshwari Jelly Crusher

Udyam     in   Sy.No.102/P2    of    Shambhuhally    village,

Pandavapura Taluk, Mandya Dist.       That petitioner is the

Class-I Civil Contractor and he has been undertaking

several   Government    infrastructure   projects   such   as

formation of Road and Highways and has been successfully

executing Government works for more than 25 years.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               -: 4 :-</span>



That petitioner is the successful bidder for the project

named as "Namma Grama Namma Raste Yojane" Phase-II,

the project initiated by the executive engineer R D P R,

Project   Division   Mysore      wherein   the   petitioner   is

undertaking the contract for the improvements of the

roads in Nanjangud Assembly Constituency to the tune of

Rs.12,26,75,000/- (twelve Crore twenty six lakhs seventy

five thousand only) which work has to be completed within

11 months from the date of commencement for which he

has entered into an agreement with the executive engineer

R D P R Project Division, Mysore.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">4.    That pursuant to the directions of this Court as well

as the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of           Obayya

Pujari, safer zones for location of stone crushing units had

to be notified and the same have been notified. That the

petitioner has made application for grant of licence to the

stone crushing unit in the safer zone but the said licence

has not yet been granted. Therefore, the grievance of the

petitioner is that on the one hand the allotments in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            -: 5 :-</span>



safer zones have not been made by the respondent -

authorities and on the other hand he would not be able to

pursue stone crushing activity in the existing location, as a

result, his business would be adversely affected.


</p><p id="p_6">5. Having regard to the prayers made in the writ petition,

we are of the view that this writ petition can be disposed of

in terms of the order passed in the earlier writ petition in

W.P.No.75970/2013.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">6. In terms of sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the

Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers Act, 2011 ("Act",

for short), the applications have to be considered within a

period of three months from the date of receipt of the

application by the Licencing Authority. On grant of a

licence by the Licencing Authority as per sub-section (3) of

Section 3 of the Act, sub-section (4) of Section 3 provides

that the existing stone crusher unit shall shift to the safer

zones within six months.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               -: 6 :-</span><p id="p_9">



</p><p id="p_10">7. In fact, Section 3 of the Act which prescribes the time

frame is extracted for felicity of reference:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "3.   Stone crushers to obtain license:- (1)
      No person shall carry on the business of stone
      crushing in the State except under and in
      accordance with the terms and conditions of a
      license issued under this Act.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      (2) Any person who is carrying on the business
      of stone crusher on the date of commencement
      of this Act with a license issued by any
      authority shall apply to the Licencing Authority
      for a license under section 4 of the Act within
      three months from the date of declaration of
      safer zone under section 6.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (3) On receipt of the application made under
      sub-section (2), the existing stone crusher
      units may be allowed to function till the grant
      or refusal of the license under the provisions of
      this Act or till three months from the date of
      receipt of application within which time the
      licensing   authority    shall    dispose   of   such
      application after due verification of the location
      and fulfillment of other conditions of licence.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            -: 7 :-</span>



<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      (4) On grant of licence under sub-section (3),
      the existing stone crushers shall be shifted to
      the safer zone within six months."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_11">8.   The purpose of the said section is to ban all stone

crushing units in the State, except those which carry on

the business of stone crushing as per the terms and

conditions of the licence issued under the Act. Section 4

speaks about the application for licence, Section 5 says

that the term of licene is for a period of three years and

may be renewed for a further period of three years,

subject to fulfillment of conditions laid down under the Act

or the Rules made there under. The explanation states that

where a licence has been granted in the middle of a year,

for the purpose of computing the term of licence, the

remaining part of the year shall be deemed to be a year.


</p><p id="p_12">9. Sub-section (2) of Section 3 states that if any person is

carrying on the business of stone crusher on the date of

commencement of this Act with a licence issued by any

authority shall apply to the Licencing Authority for a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    -: 8 :-</span>



licence under Section 4 of the Act within three months

from the date of declaration of safer zone under Section 6.

So, within a period of three months the application would

have to be made. Section 7 of the Act reads as follows:


</p><pre id="pre_2">      "7.   License          for     stone      crushers        for
      Government             projects:-         Notwithstanding
</pre><p id="p_13">      anything contained in this Act, license for
      temporary        stone       crushers     exclusively      for
      construction      of     National        Highway,       State
      Highway      or        any      other         infra-structural
      Government project and Government approved
      Public Private Partnership Projects may be
      granted for the project period on their fulfilling
      the provisions of the Air (Prevention and
      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control     of     Pollution)          Act</a>,      1981     and
      Environmental Protection Act, 1986 and Rules
      made thereunder."
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">10.   In the circumstances, the respondent - authorities

are directed to consider the representation made by the

petitioner, which is at Annexure "D", strictly in accordance

with <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_2">Section 7</a> of the Act and to pass necessary orders on

the same expeditiously and within a period of 15 days from
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                             -: 9 :-</span>



the date of receipt of certified copy of this order. In case

the petitioner's unit falls within the scope of <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_3">Section 7</a> of

the said Act, then to pass orders in terms of the said

section and also having regard to the other provisions of

the said Act. The writ petition is accordingly, disposed of.
