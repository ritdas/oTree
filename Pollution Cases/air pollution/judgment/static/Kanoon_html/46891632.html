</p>
<p id="p_5">    3.         It is the submission of the learned Senior Counsel





    appearing for the petitioners that the impugned Show Cause

    Notices have been issued by the Board in terms of <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_5">Section 33A</a>

    of the Water Act, which empowers the Board to issue any

    direction or notice, whereas the impugned Show Cause Notices


    in the instant writ petitions have been issued by the Member

    Secretary of the Board, who is only an Officer/Authority of the

    submits that the resolution, dated 10 th June, 1996, as





    submitted by the Board, authorizing the Member Secretary of

    the Board to issue notices/directions under the provisions of

    Water and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_6">Environment Protection Act</a>s, is impermissible and

    Tribunal wherein the petitioners are not a party.

    the Show Cause Notices that the petitioners have emitted the

    treated effluent into the river and in case the reply is not given

    within the time stipulated, the respondent­Board would close


    down the effluent plant by exercising powers under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_8">Section

    Protection Act and also that Environment Compensation to the





    tune of ₹ One Crore will be imposed on the petitioners for





    polluting the river, however, there is no such provision under

    the Acts mentioned (supra) and moreover, before imposing any

    Environment Compensation and passing the orders exercising

    the powers under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_11">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act, the petitioners

    should have been given an opportunity of hearing in this

    regard.

    the Member Secretary of the Board. Apart from the grounds

    taken in the Grounds of Defence submitted on maintainability,

    learned counsel for the respondent­Board, in order to

    substantiate his submissions, has referred to the judgments in

    Pradesh Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules,

    as employment opportunities.

    some orders on merits of the cases, permission be granted to

    the State Government to make an endeavour to make
