                             Claiming himself to be a public interest litigant, Mr.P.Sundaraj,

                      Agriculturalist, residing at Kinar Kandigai Village, Maduranthagam

                      Taluk, Kancheepuram District, has filed a writ of mandamus,

</p><p id="p_2">                             2. Supporting the prayer sought for, petitioner has contended

                      that Tamil Nadu Waste Management Limited/seventh respondent has

                      started a Bio-Medical Waste Management and disposal factory, in the

                      year 2009, at the above said survey numbers, by furnishing false

                      information in the application submitted to the Pollution Control

                      Board, while applying for consent, under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of the Prevention

                      of Control Act, 1981 as amended <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_4">(Central Act</a> 14/91).

</p><p id="p_3">                            3. According to the petitioner, in column No.17, regarding land

                      use classification of the site, the seventh respondent has furnished

                      false information, “unclassified”, wherein, as per patta issued for the

                      property – S.Nos.29/3 and 29/4, with patta No.696 issued by the Tamil

                      Nadu Government, land has been classified as 'punja' which shows that

                      it is an agricultural land where such Bio-Medical Waste Management

                      and disposal factory is located.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">                            4. It is the further contention of the petitioner that as against

                      column No.20, in the application submitted to the Pollution Control

                      Board, under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">Sections 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_6">26</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of

                      respondent, has falsely stated that there are no specified water body

                      nearby and the same is completely false, baseless. Village map of

                      Kinnar Village clearly shows that Bio- Medical Waste Management and

                      disposal factory, situated in S.Nos.29/3, 29/4, 30/2 and 31 are

                      located near S.No.255, which is classified as “uppu-aru” river, which

                      serves as water resources for thousands of people. According to the

                      petitioner, the entire river is spoiled by the wastage being dumped in

                      the soil and the ash being spread in the air which moves down, so

                      close and spoils in the river and crops.

                      has contended that people residing in and around Kinar Kandigai

                      Village, where the bio-medical waste management and disposal

                      factory is situated, are suffering from diseases. Further contention

                      has been made that since no steps have been taken by the respondent

                      Nos.1 to 6, intervention of this Court is required, by issuing a writ of

                      mandamus, as prayed.
