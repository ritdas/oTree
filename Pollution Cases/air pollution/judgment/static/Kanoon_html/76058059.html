                compliance     of   noise    standards    for   the    vehicles     at

                manufacturing stage, as prescribed under Schedule VI, Part

                followed by the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, (CMVR) 1989.

                The Applicant submits that somewhere in 1988, a Committee

                constituted by the Indian Standard of Institutes (ISI),

                approved and specified IS: 3028-1988, in respect of method of

                namely; the Respondent Nos.1, 3 and 4 and said standards

                have been updated from time to time. He further submits that

                the said test procedure has neither been approved nor

                10thFebruary, 2004 for the noise standards, as under:

<p id="p_18">                 7.   The main contention of the Applicant is that the said IS:

                 3028-1988, while specifying the measurement of sound from

                 moving vehicle at a distance of 7.5 meters from the vehicle,

                 did not provide for compensation/adjustment of noise levels

                 due to distance from source i.e. the vehicle and therefore, it

                 is contention of the Applicant that IS:3028-1988 is in

                 violation of the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control

                would like to lay emphasis on fact that increasing noise levels

                in the urban areas, is posing a serious threat to health of the

                people in general and especially to the children and old, in

                particular. The Hon'ble Supreme Court and various High

                Courts, have time and again emphasized the need to control

                noise pollution and we do not wish to reproduce all such

                catena of Judgments, as importance of maintaining noise

                levels within urban areas was generally agreed by the learned

                Counsel appearing in the present Application too. It is also an

                admitted fact that automobiles, due to its engine (auto

                mechanism) noise and also, noise generated by blowing of

                horns contribute significantly to ambient noise levels in urban

                areas. Needless to say that various reports available in the

                public domain, record that ambient noise levels in most of the

                 urban areas in the country are exceeding the ambient noise

                level standards as set out in the Noise Pollution (Regulation

                problem in many urban areas. This problem has not been

                adequately addressed and remedied despite the fact that it is

                growing in developing countries. This widespread non-

                recognition of noise pollution problem, in a similar fashion as

                to air and water pollution problems, could be attributed to

                reasons such as; by the definition and perception of noise as

                a subjective experience, short decay time, and difficulty to

                associate cause with effect when it comes to health impacts.

                Depending on its duration and volume, the effects of noise on

                human health and comfort are divided into four categories;

                physical effects, such as hearing defects; physiological effects,

                such as increased blood pressure, irregularity of heart

                rhythms and ulcers; psychological effects, such as disorders,

                sleeplessness and going to sleep late, irritability and stress;

                and finally effects on work performance, such as reduction of

                productivity and misunderstanding what is heard.

                of implementation of noise standards of automobiles as

                defined under Environment Protection Rules. We have noted

                that Govt. of India has already notified such standards under

                the provisions of Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, Part-

                 E. These standards have two phases of implementation of

                noise limits, for vehicles at manufacturing stage: (1) for the

                vehicles manufactures from 2003 and (2) for the vehicles

                manufactured from 1st April, 2005. The standards also

                stipulate that test method to be followed for enforcing such

                noise limits, shall be IS: 3028-1998. These standards are

                mentioned in paragraphs (5) and (6), as shown herein above.


</p><p id="p_54">                22.          It is grievance of the Applicant that though such

                standards are in place since year 2002, however, the MoEF

                has not issued any guidelines for enforcing such standards,

                nor have delegated any powers for enforcement of these

                standards to the any local authority. The MoEF has countered

                such arguments by stating that revised noise limits for

                automobiles at the manufacturing stage, have been identified

                by the MoEF vide Notification dated 5.5.2005. However, MoEF

                mentions that these noise limits were notified at Sr.No.46,

                under Schedule-I of the Environment (Protection) Rules,

                1986, are within Part-E of Schedule-VI. The MoEF further

                contends that these noise limits are implemented under the

                Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, by the Respondent No.2

                i.e. MoRTH. In order to get clarity on the issue, , we directed

                the MoEF, vide order dated July 2nd, 2014, to clarify as to

                under what provisions, such implementing agencies, are given

                       and that what is the mechanism to ensure that violations are to
                       be dealt with. It is stated in paragraph 3 of the reply affidavit that
                       noise limits were notified at Sr. No.46, under the Schedule-I, of
                       the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, rather than part-E of
                       the Schedule-VI. It is vaguely stated that these noises are
                       implemented under the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, by
                       the Respondent No.2. However, it needs clarification as to under
                       what provisions, the implementing Agencies are given powers

                       the relevant Rules, indicated under the Environment (Protection)

                       the implementing machinery is the local authority i.e. RTO, and it
                       is stated that implementation has to be done under the Central

                       additional affidavit in this behalf. The Counsel seeks time to
                       clarify the position. The Automotive Research Association of
                       India (ARAI) also shall bring the relevant files for perusal of the

                Rule 120(2) sets out noise standards for automobiles at

                manufacturing and operating stage to be measured as per IS:

                3028-1998. Rule 126 prescribes Type Approval to be granted

                by any of the six identified agencies, but the interesting part

                 is that the procedure given for such Type approval is AIS:017-

                2000, and does not refer to IS-3028-1998. It is therefore not

                clear whether such type approval includes any verification of

                compliance of the noise standards as specified in Rule 120 (2)

                of the said rules, which have adopted the noise standards

                prescribed under the Environmental protection Rules. This

                aspect of implementation of such noise standards further gets

                more clarified by the response of Respondent-5 to RTI query

                dated 2/12/2013, related monitoring of standards prescribed

                in rule 120 (2) of the MVR. The response clearly says that

                conducting the test as per noise standards specified in rule

                120(2) at the stage of manufacturing is out of scope and

                purview of the institute.

                under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 have been

                adopted for every motor vehicle at construction stage and also

                while it is put to use. Therefore it is necessary that

                compliance of such standards, need to be independently

                verified and assessed by the concern agencies while granting

                Certificate of Test, under the Rule 126 of the Central Motor

                IS: 3028-1998, shall be strictly adhered to while testing noise

                limits from the automobiles. This is very important, as we

                 such certificate and on perusal of certificate granted to Ashok

                Leyland dated 29th May, 2013, what we found is that there is

                total absence of mention of vehicle noise as monitored under

                IS: 3028-1998. We have also perused the copy of such

                certificate produced by the CPCB along with affidavit, where

                one certificate issued to M/s Umbrella Corporation and in the

                said certificate, noise level measurement has been made as

                per IS: 3028-1998, though measurement parameters are

                different than as specified in the standard for RPM and also

                speed.

                incorporated under rule 120(2) of the Motor Vehicle rules,

                1989. In our opinion, all the concerned agencies are tossing

                the responsibility on other agencies, with the result, the

                prescribed noise standards are not being implemented

                resulting in unabated noise pollution. And, therefore, we

                record our finding on Issue-I in NEGATIVE.

                Committee of Experts, we do not wish to enter into arena of

                evaluating the correctness or otherwise, of the standards.

                However, we would like to appreciate the point raised by the

                Applicant that as these standards deal with the noise

                standards, it will be prudent to include the Environment

                Regulatory Authorities like CPCB or SPCB, which are also

                technical organizations, on such Committee for review and to

                ensure   that    environmental   regulations   are     holistically

                considered while revising such standards. It is also open for

                MoEF/CPCB/SPCB to prepare their own test procedure for

                measurement of noise form automobiles, if required. The

                Issue (2) is accordingly answered in NEGATIVE, with above

                            "98. Not that the Legislature and the Executive in India are
                           completely unmindful of the menace of noise pollution. Laws
                           have been enacted and the Rules have been framed by the
                           Executive for carrying on the purposes of the legislation. The real
                           issue is with the implementation of the laws. What is needed is
                           the will to implement the laws. It would be useful to have a brief
                           resume of some of the laws which are already available on the
                           Statute Book. Treatment of the problem of noise pollution can be
                           dealt under the Law of Crimes and Civil Law. Civil law can be
                           divided under two heads (i) The Law of Torts and (ii) The General
                           Civil Law. The cases regarding noise have not come before the
                           law courts in large quantity. The reason behind this is that many
                           people in India did not consider noise as a sort of pollution and
                           they are not very much conscious about the evil consequences of
                           noise pollution. The level of noise pollution is relative and
                           depends upon a person and a particular place. The law will not
                           take care of a super sensitive person but the standard is of an
                           average and rational human being in the society."

                effective mechanism for implementation of noise standards for

                automobiles. Though the Respondents have taken some

                steps, but they are pointing fingers towards others in the

                context of duty to perform the Rules. There is lack of synergy

                and coordination amongst the Respondents. This cannot be

                allowed to continue, in view of the serious impacts of noise

                pollution.        The        Apex   court    has     clearly      focused      on

                implementation of existing regulations and also, need of

                 ambient air quality under the provisions of <a href="/doc/607216/" id="a_51">section 16</a> (1) of

                 national level initiative. We do not agree with the stand taken

                 by CPCB that SPCBs are solely responsible for setting the

                 standards. The <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_54">section 16</a> of Air Act, gives a mandate to

                 CPCB to maintain the desired air quality in the country and

                 empowers it to take all necessary measures for that. Besides

                 this <a href="/doc/1067037/" id="a_55">Section 18</a> gives powers to CPCB to issue specific

                 directions to SPCBs to perform functions as specified in the

                 Act. And therefore, we are of the considered view that CPCB

                 has an important role to play when national level air quality

                 related issues needs to be addressed. It cannot just shirk the
