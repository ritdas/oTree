        identify alternate site for shifting the dairy hub from the banks of river

        Gaur around Jabalpur and the said alternate site be transferred to the

        Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur so that the dairies existing alongside the

        river Gaur could be shifted to the newly created dairy hub and the problem

        with regard to water pollution in the river Gaur and river Narmada could

        be checked. It was further submitted that the District Collector, Jabalpur

        had identified a site measuring an area of 19.40 hectares and had

        recommended its transfer to Jabalpur Municipal Corporation free of cost

        letter that there is no provision under the existing statutory rules for

        transferring Government land to the Municipal bodies free of cost.

</p><p id="p_17">    10.Learned Standing Counsel for the State sought time on a specific query put

        to him as to whether it was possible for the Government in the Revenue

        Department to transfer the land as proposed, to the Department of Animal

        Husbandry instead of Municipal Corporation for the aforesaid purpose if

        the Government is willing to do so. During the course of hearing today,

        letter of the Deputy Secretary in the Revenue Department dated 22nd

        February, 2014 as also the letter dated 12th March, 2014 of the District

        High Court is already seized of the matters since 1998 and several orders

        in this behalf have been issued from time to time, we are of the opinion

        that the matter now got sufficient attention and seems to have achieved

        some kind of resolution with the Government being sensitized with the

        aforesaid issue and since the Hon'ble High Court is seized of the matter,

        we would not like to pass any direction in this behalf.

        generated by their dairy farms, the Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 i.e. MPPPC

         particularly of those dairies which were found to be defaulting and to

        whom notices have already been issued. In case the concerned dairy

        owners have failed to rectify and remove the deficiencies and irregularities

        and failed to check the discharge of waste and untreated sewage, the

        Regional Officer shall take immediate action in accordance with law. The

        Pollution Control Board should regularly monitor the standards of

        parameters prescribed for dairy farms listed in Schedule -I under

        Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 and take action against the

        defaulters till they are relocated at the proposed alternate site. The action

        taken report by way of compliance of our order shall be filed before the

        Tribunal within four weeks from today.

<p id="p_23">    16.Another issue that has been raised in the Application is on account of the

        alleged encroachment by the Respondent No. 7, the owner of Sripal Dairy

        on the banks of the river Gaur of more than 20 acres of Government land.

        This issue does not strictly fall within the purview and jurisdiction of this

        Tribunal. However, learned counsel for the State submitted that since no

        reply has been filed before the Tribunal by the State/Respondent No. 6

        Collector, Jabalpur and the reply of Respondent No. 3 and 4 has been

        adopted, this issue was not examined. He would get the factual report and

        place the same for record of the Tribunal and in case any action is required

        to be initiated he would inform the District Collector to take action in

        accordance with law.

        provisions of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 causing pollution

        the Revenue Department seeks to transfer to it, frames a proper scheme in
