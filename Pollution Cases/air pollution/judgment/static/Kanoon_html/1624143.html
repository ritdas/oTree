               -----------------------------------------------------
         DATED THIS THE 31st DAY OF AUGUST, 2010

                                 JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       In this Writ Petition, the petitioners who are residents of

Vilichikala within Nedumpana Grama Panchayat is aggrieved by

the pollution caused by the industry run by the 1st respondent. It

is pointed out that quarrying of clay is done by the 1st respondent.

</p><p id="p_2">      2.   Mainly, it is pointed out that the 1st respondent has

violated the provisions of Environmental Protection Act, Air

(Prevention and Control of Pollution)Act and Water (Prevention

and Control of Pollution)Act and respondents 2 to 6 are not taking

any effective steps in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.   Initially, this Court had passed an interim order which

was modified as per order dated 17.1.2008 in I.A.No.858/08. It

was clarified that they can operate the clay manufacturing unit

with the licence of the Panchayat and it was clarified that the order

will not stand in the way of the Pollution Control Board taking

appropriate decision pursuant to Exhibit P14.

</p><p id="p_4">      4.   Exhibit P14 produced along with the Writ Petition is a

provisional notice issued by the Pollution Control Board alleging

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C)No.941/08           -2-</span>


various omissions on the part of the 1st respondent.

</p><p id="p_5">      5.    The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

in spite of passage of time and issuance of fresh directions by the

Pollution Control Board, even now the Company has not installed

any Effluent Treatment Plant, which is denied by the learned

counsel appearing for the Company.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6.    The 1st respondent has filed a counter affidavit as well

as an additional counter affidavit. Various measures taken by

them in compliance with the directions issued by the Pollution

Control Board have been detailed in the counter affidavit.

</p><p id="p_7">      7.    The learned Standing Counsel for the Pollution Control

Board invited my attention to Exhibits R4(d) and R4(e)

proceedings. The counter affidavit filed by the Pollution Control

Board shows that the 1st respondent has taken over the business

of the Company M/s Wolkem Clay Pvt. Ltd. Initially, consent to

operate was issued to the said Company, which was renewed

under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a> with

validity upto 31.12.2007 and under the Air(Prevention and

Control of Pollution)Act with validity upto 31.12.2008.         On

inspection, it was found that the unit has not complied with the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C)No.941/08             -3-</span>


directions issued by the Pollution Control Board. Exhibit R4(a)

notice was issued and later an inspection was conducted on

8.1.2008 and based on the result of the inspection additional

control measures were directed as per Exhibit R4(b).            It is

pointed out that the Unit was again inspected on 25.3.2008 and

found that the unit is on the way of complying with the directions

of the Pollution Control Board under Exhibit R4(b). For some

period, it was under lock out and the inspection conducted on

12.3.2010 shows that unit has complied with most of the

conditions directed in Exhibit R4(b), but augmentation of effluent

treatment plant including facility for safe storage and recycle of

treated effluent, one of the additional control measures

suggested is yet to be done.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      8.    In the additional counter affidavit, it is mentioned that

the consent is renewed upto 30.6.2012 and further direction was

issued to comply with certain conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      9.    Evidently, the Pollution Control Board has been

conducting various inspections and they have been issuing

various directions to the Company to comply with certain

conditions. It is not as if the Company has not complied with any

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C)No.941/08             -4-</span>


of the conditions. Evidently, the consent to operate is valid upto

30.6.2012. Therefore, what remains is to find out whether the

directions issued by the Pollution Control Board have been fully

complied with by the Company. Since there is a dispute raised

by the petitioner that the directions are not at all being complied

with, it is only proper that the Pollution Control Board is directed

to conduct an inspection with notice to the petitioner and the

Company and find out whether all the directions issued by the

Pollution Control Board have been complied with.          They can

suggest further measures, if any, to ward off the alleged

pollution caused by the Unit.     The same shall be done within a

period of one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this

judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      10. The further complaint of the petitioner is regarding the

alleged encroachment. It is upto the petitioner to prosecute the

same before the statutory authorities concerned.

</p><p id="p_11">      The Writ Petition is disposed of as above.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
