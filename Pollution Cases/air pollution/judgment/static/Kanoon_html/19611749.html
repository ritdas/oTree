Judgment on                   :      15/07/2016
</pre><p id="p_1"> Subrata Talukdar, J.: The central issue in this writ petition is the

proposed shifting of the bus stand commonly known as Band Stand,

also Babughat, to a new Inter-state Bus Terminus (for short ISBT) at

Santragachi, Howrah.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      The writ petitioners are all Inter-state Bus Operators whose

services both commence from and terminate at Band Stand. In the

writ petition under challenge is the resolution of the High Power

Committee (for short HPC) dated 11th August, 2015 by which it was,

inter alia, decided to proceed with the phase-wise shifting of ISBT to

Santragachi.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      The principal arguments advanced by Sri Hirak Mitra, Ld.

Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners are as follows:-


</p><p id="p_6">   a) That under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_2">Motor Vehicles Act</a>, 1988 (for

      short the 1988 Act) the operations of inter-state buses take

      place on the basis of reciprocal agreements entered into between

      States.    Such reciprocal agreements become final after the

      period invited for receiving objections closes and, in terms of

      such agreements the routes as well as the termini of the said

      routes cannot be subsequently superseded by any other

      methodology such as adopted by the HPC at its meeting dated

      11th August, 2015.
</p><p id="p_7"> b) That the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court had the occasion

  to deal with the policy decision of the State Government

  connected to grant of new permits in respect of stage carriages

  on both notified and non-notified routes.     Pursuant to the

  judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench In Re: <a href="/doc/146968307/" id="a_3">Sujata Ganguly

  vs. The State of West Bengal &amp; Ors. (FMA</a> 604 of 2004) vide

  judgment and order dated 27th September, 2005, the policy and

  procedure for granting new permits, including the exclusion of

  the Central Business District (for short CBD) from the purview

  of the grant of new permits was notified by the State

  Government and pursuant to such notification the bus

  operators, including the present petitioners being inter-state

  operators are using Band Stand/Babughat as a terminus.


</p><p id="p_8">c) Sri Mitra submits that the primary reason for shifting the bus

  terminus to Santragachi is the purported pollution being caused

  to the Victoria Memorial (for short VM). Pointing out that the

  aspect of pollution falls within the purview of a Central

  Legislation under The Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution)

  Act</a>, 1981, Sri Mitra argues that therefore the State Government

  has no role to play.   Relying the recognized legal principle of

  Occupied Field, Sri Mitra submits that since the matter of

  pollution lies within the eminent domain of the Central

  Government, on the ground of pollution no shifting of the bus
    stand can be ordered by the HPC functioning under the State

   Government.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">d) Sri Mitra takes the next point that in the event there is a threat

   of pollution caused to VM by the inter-state buses, there ought

   to have been a representative of a body dealing with pollution in

   the HPC. However, while discussing the issue of the pollution

   hazard to VM the Hon'ble Apex Court makes specific mention of

   a body such as the National Environmental Engineering

   Research Institute (for short NEERI), no representative of NEERI

   is found in the HPC.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">e) Sri Mitra submits the additional point that the order impugned

   of the HPC dated 11th August, 2015 is without reasons. Also

   referring to the orders passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court and

   the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court from time to time, Sri

   Mitra points out that reference has been made to Esplanade

   Bus Stand only and, there is no reference to Band Stand.

   Therefore, the judicial intention was clear which is to reduce the

   pollution caused to VM because of the functioning of the

   Esplanade Bus Terminus. In this connection Sri Mitra argues

   that a large number of local buses ply daily on routes bordering

   VM and, are major emitters of pollutants.
</p><p id="p_13">            However, in the case of the present writ petitioners the

  buses merely park for some time at Band Stand. Such parking

  at Band Stand does not at all affect the pollution level at VM

  and, the HPC instead of tackling the plying of local buses

  around VM is diverting the issue by ordering the inter-state

  buses out of Band Stand.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">f) Further arguing that the petitioners are operating their inter-

  state buses from Band Stand for a long time and such

  operations touch the issue of their livelihood, Sri Mitra submits

  that there is no conflict of jurisdiction in moving this writ

  petition before this Hon'ble Court although a Public Interest

  Litigation (for short PIL) on the issue is already pending before

  the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court.          In support of his

  argument Sri Mitra relies upon the judgement of an Hon'ble

  Single Bench of this Court in WP 22586(W) of 2014 dated 25th

  August, 2014 which, inter alia, granted leave to the writ

  petitioners to approach the competent Court at the appropriate

  stage.    Sri Mitra points out that by the said order dated 25th

  August, 2014, the Hon'ble Single Bench found the writ petition

  to be pre-mature and therefore observed, inter alia, as follows:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "In the event in future the petitioners have grievance on this
           point, they shall be at liberty to apply afresh before this
           Court or such other forum as they may be advised.
           As no affidavit has been filed on behalf of the respondents,
          allegations made in the writ petition against them shall be
          deemed to have not been admitted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">          The writ petition shall stand disposed of in the above
          terms."</blockquote><p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">          Having regard to the above noted direction of the Hon'ble

   Single Bench Sri Mitra argues that the present writ petition is

   maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">g) The next point taken by Sri Mitra is that the findings of the HPC

   dated 11th August, 2015 are de hors the principles of natural

   justice.   Although the writ petitioners are vitally affected

   because of the shifting directed to take place to Santragachi

   none of the grievances raised by the writ petitioners as

   canvassed through their representations dated 5th of August,

   2015 and 19th of August, 2015 were addressed by the HPC.

   Therefore, on the point of violation of the principles of natural

   justice, Sri Mitra submits that the decision proposed vide the

   impugned resolution of the HPC dated 11th August, 2015

   requires to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">h) In support of the principles of law elucidated in his arguments,

   Sri Mitra relies upon the following judicial authorities:-


      •   On the doctrine of occupied field: 1991 (4) SCC 243;
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">           •   On the point that the order impugned dated 11th August,

              2015 does not contain any reasons: 1968 AC 997;
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">          •   On the point that the State-respondents cannot improve

              their case through affidavit: AIR 1978 SC 851;
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          •   On the principle of natural justice: 1981 (1) SCC 664.</blockquote><p id="p_22">


</p><p id="p_23">              Sri Mitra reiterates the point that an authority visited with

       powers to do certain functions is required to exercise such

       powers on its own without delegating such powers to some other

       authority. Therefore, when the power is conferred for doing a

       particular act in a particular manner, such power must be

       exercised in the manner conferred and, not in any other

       manner.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
       Appearing on behalf of the State-respondents, Sri Amal Kumar

Sen, Ld. Senior Government Advocate raises the following points:-


</p><p id="p_25"> i)    That adequate reasons are evident from the order of the HPC.

</p><p id="p_26">       Therefore the argument of lack of sufficiency of reasons cannot

       be raised on behalf of the writ petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28"> ii)   Relying on the affidavit-in-opposition filed on behalf of the

       State-respondents, Sri Sen points out that the HPC filed several

       reports before the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court hearing

       the PIL in connection with the pollution caused to VM. At the
     time of filing of the First Report a Sub-committee constituted

    under the HPC took a hearing of the inter-state as well as

    private stage carriage operators. From the First Report of the

    Sub-committee, Sri Sen points out that the removal of pollution

    within a 3 km area of VM was taken notice of. The HPC, under

    the direction of the Hon'ble Division Bench, was required to

    submit quarterly reports addressed to the Registrar General of

    the High Court.    The Registrar General would then place the

    report before the Hon'ble Division Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">iii) From the Second Report of the HPC, Sri Sen points out that the

    North   Bengal    State   Transport   Corporation   (NBSTC)   had

    confirmed that the Esplanade Bus Terminus was being utilized

    as a pick up point as well as a ticket booking point. Similarly,

    the Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) had submitted

    before the HPC that the long distance services of CSTC which

    were originating earlier from Esplanade are now touching

    Esplanade for a maximum of 10 minutes for boarding of

    commuters and, in no circumstances more than one vehicle is

    standing there at a time ordinarily.    Even the city services of

    CSTC are not being operated from Esplanade.
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">iv) Sri Sen further argues that the Third Report of the HPC

    submitted before the Hon'ble Division Bench detailed the steps

    taken for relocation of the bus termini both from Esplanade and
      from Band Stand. The Fourth Report of the HPC mentions the

     shifting of the terminus from Band Stand to Santragachi also

     called as the Kolkata Central Bus Terminus (for short KCBT).

     Sri Sen submits that from time to time the Hon'ble Division

     Bench in the PIL being WP 7987(W) of 2002 had directed the

     HPC to periodically keep the Hon'ble Division Bench informed

     by way of placing the above noted quarterly reports on the steps

     taken to minimize pollution qua VM.           The said PIL is still

     pending before the Hon'ble Division Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_33">
</p><p id="p_34">            The specific point is therefore taken by Sri Sen, both in

     his arguments and in the affidavit-in-opposition filed on behalf

     of the State-respondents, that there is no infraction of the

     principles of natural justice.   The bus operators were given

     adequate opportunity to present their case before the HPC and,

     upon    taking   into   consideration   all    aspects,   the   HPC

     recommended shifting of the inter-state bus terminus from

     Band Stand to KCBT in the first phase.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">v)   On the ground that the matter of pollution to VM and the

     consequent shifting of the bus termini both from Esplanade and

     from Band Stand is in seisin of the Hon'ble Division Bench, Sri

     Sen argues that the present standalone writ petition is not

     maintainable. The writ petitioners cannot be allowed to air the

     same grievances by way of this parallel proceeding when, the
     entire issue is pending before the Hon'ble Division Bench in a

    PIL filed prior in time.    Sri Sen submits that the issue of

    relocating the bus terminus arising out of the pollution hazard

    to VM has its genesis in the PIL. Therefore, Sri Sen argues that

    if the present writ petition is entertained then the same would

    amount to an example of judicial overreach.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">vi) The next point taken by Sri Sen is that the regulation of traffic

    is a State subject covered under the State List of Schedule VII of

    the Constitution of India. On the point taken by Sri Mitra qua

    the Occupied Field Theory, Sri Sen submits that the number of

    permits which could be issued as well as the future regulation

    of such permits falls under the control of the State Government.

    The issue of pollution qua VM is amenable to the regulation of

    the State Government and received its stamp of approval from

    the Hon'ble Division Bench. Sri Sen points out that originally

    the area of discussion connected to pollution to VM was

    restricted to Esplanade.    On remand of the matter from the

    Hon'ble Apex Court it was, inter alia, directed that the State is

    required to explore the feasibility of clearing VM of any pollution

    hazard in respect of a 3 km radius around VM.
</p>
<p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">          Sri Sen therefore clarifies that since the radius of 3 kms

    was brought into the focus of the State' examination by the

    Hon'ble Apex Court, such 3 km area includes Band Stand.
     Therefore, the argument advanced by Sri Mitra that the zone of

    consideration to keep VM free of pollution centred only on

    Esplanade is not sustainable since, it is obvious on facts and, in

    this connection Sri Sen relies upon a Google map, to make the

    point that Band Stand also falls within the area required to be

    sanitised to keep VM pollution free.
</p>
<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">vii) The next point argued by Sri Sen is that the principle of natural

    justice or, in other words, affording an opportunity of hearing to

    the respective classes of bus operators has been complied with

    in the facts of the present case. Sri Sen points out that it is an

    admitted position that pursuant to the orders of the Hon'ble

    Division Bench in the PIL, opportunity of hearing was extended

    to members of the Bus Associations and, steps were taken as

    directed by the Hon'ble Apex Court from time to time.          No

    objection was taken by the petitioners or any of the members of

    the Bus Associations with regard to the fixing of the 3 kms

    radius for protecting VM from pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">viii) Placing each of the four reports submitted by the HPC, Sri Sen

    submits that the absence of certain members from the HPC,

    including the members responsible for overseeing aspects of

    pollution, does not vitiate State action inasmuch as the HPC is

    solely entrusted with the task of relocating the bus terminus
     under orders of Court which have already examined the issue of

    pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">          Taking this Court to the orders of the Hon'ble Apex Court

    and the Hon'ble Division Bench passed from time to time, Sri

    Sen submits that it is only upon examination of the issue of

    pollution    that   the   Hon'ble   Courts   have   directed   further

    management of route traffic including the relocation of the bus

    stand.      In the light of their above noted observations, the

    Hon'ble Courts have set up the HPC with the mandate to submit

    quarterly reports from time to time.           While issuing such

    mandate upon the HPC the Hon'ble Courts have taken notice of

    the threat of pollution to VM and, on the touchstone of such

    threats, directed that steps be taken to relocate the bus stand.


</p><p id="p_47">          Accordingly, Sri Sen submits that to now raise the issue

    of pollution de novo on behalf of the writ petitioners is no more

    res integra.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">ix) Referring to the attendance at the hearing held by HPC, Sri Sen

    argues that several of the writ petitioners have appended their

    signatures in the record of attendance. The decision of the HPC

    dated 11th August, 2015 impugned in the present writ petition

    is in favour of phase-wise shifting of the bus stand.           Such

    phase-wise shifting of the bus stand does not mean that the
      other aspects required to be considered such as shifting of the

     bus stand from Esplanade have been ignored. The phase-wise

     shifting of the bus stand means that other phases connected to

     the shifting and directed to be considered by the HPC under

     orders of Court shall be taken up in due course and quarterly

     reports submitted before the Hon'ble Division Bench.        The

     exercise of powers by the HPC is not suo moto but within the

     framework created by the Hon'ble Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_50">
</p><p id="p_51">x)   Sri Sen highlights the point that the outer time limit conferred

     on the HPC for executing its action to keep VM pollution free is

     three years. Therefore, as the first step the HPC has directed

     shifting of the inter-state bus terminus to KCBT from Band

     Stand.
</p>
<p id="p_52">
</p><p id="p_53">           Sri Sen also points out that the decision impugned dated

     11th August, 2015 is not drastic and provides the petitioners as

     well as other inter-state operators having their terminus at

     Band Stand with the necessary window for briefly halting to

     load/unload passengers.    The modalities of shifting the bus

     stand lie entirely within the executive domain and under Rule

     182 of the West Bengal Motors Vehicle Rules, 1989 (for short

     the 1989 Rules) the District Magistrate (DM) is empowered to

     issue a notification qua setting up of the new bus stand. Sri

     Sen argues that such notification having the force of law as
       issued by the DM, Howrah dated 21st May, 2015 is not under

      challenge in this writ petition. Sri Sen therefore points out that

      due process stands satisfied.
</p>
<p id="p_54">
</p><p id="p_55">            Sri Sen submits that the HPC was set up in obeisance to

      the judgement of the Hon'ble Apex Court in 1997 (8) SCC 770

      In Re: <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_5">M. C. Mehta vs. Union of India</a>. Sri Sen argues that

      there is no conflict in laws between the State action and the

      Central Legislation on the issue of pollution which has been

      monitored by the Constitutional Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_56">
</p><p id="p_57">            Ld. State Counsel further argues that the rights of the

      private operators such as the present petitioners cannot

      override the larger public interest.    Following the letter and

      spirit of the decision reported in 1997 (8) SCC 770 (supra), the

      Hon'ble Division Bench has issued orders from time to time in

      the PIL. Sri Sen therefore questions the maintainability of this

      writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_58">
      Appearing for the Respondent No. 15 being, the Hooghly River

Bridge Commission (for short HRBC), Sri Subrata Banerjee, Ld.

Counsel makes the preliminary submission that the role of HRBC is

limited to the point raised by HPC to the effect that HRBC ought not

charge toll fees in respect of the buses of the petitioners operating out

of Band Stand and relocated at KCBT, Santragachi.
</p><p id="p_59">       Sri Banerjee further argues that at the first stage of the

litigation the aspect of pollution to VM was settled right up to the

Hon'ble Apex Court. At the second stage of litigation which is now

under consideration by the Hon'ble Division Bench in the PIL, the

relocation of the bus stand consequent to the pollution aspect being

settled is being examined. The composition of the HPC must therefore

be understood qua such aspect.
</p>
<p id="p_60">
</p><p id="p_61">      Sri Banerjee argues and, in the opinion of this Court correctly

so, that at the second stage of litigation the Hon'ble Division Bench is

considering to ease the threat of pollution to VM by directing HPC to

take steps to relocate the bus stand. In the above aspect of the matter

there is no further requirement of experts on pollution in the

composition of the HPC.
</p>
<p id="p_62">
</p><p id="p_63">      The final point made by Sri Banerjee is that both the inter-state

bus operators and the local operators are being treated at par by the

HPC since none of the two classes of operators will be allowed to park

within a 3 km radius of VM.
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><p id="p_65">      Upon hearing the parties and considering the materials relied

upon, this Court at the very outset is required to notice the several

orders passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court and the Hon'ble Division

Bench of this Court on the issue of the pollution threat to VM:-
 A) By order dated 12th September, 2011 in Civil Appeal No. 7785

   of 2011 arising out SLP (C) No. 9154 of 2008 in the matter of

   <a href="/doc/265995/" id="a_6">State of West Bengal vs. Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik

   Samity &amp; Ors., the Hon</a>'ble Apex Court arrived at the following

   conclusions:-
</p>
<p id="p_66">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">         "7. We have considered the submissions made on behalf of
         the appellant and the respondents and we find that NEERI
         has suggested some long term measures for preservation of
         the Victoria Memorial Hall in Para 5.2 of its report. The
         relevant portion of Para 5.2 of the report of NEERI is quoted
         hereinbelow:</blockquote><pre id="pre_3">

         "5.2 LONG-TERM MEASURES

         Diversion      of   Heavy   Road      Traffic   on    the       Road
         Encircling the VM Monument.

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_7">         The pollution from auto exhaust is the most important
         causative factor when the Victoria Memorial protection from
         atmospheric environment is considered. Therefore, the
         traffic on roads around the VM should be minimum
         particularly    complete    banning     of   heavy   traffic.    Bus
         terminus at Esplanade Area (Commercial) should also be
         shifted from the existing location.""
</blockquote>
<p id="p_67">B) Next, this Court is required to notice the order dated 5th March,

   2013 passed by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in the

   pending PIL being WP 7987(W) of 2002. The relevant portion of

   the said order dated 5th March, 2013 reads as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">          "The substantial part of the controversy stood resolved by
         the order of the Division Bench passed on April 19, 2012.
         Yet, there are some areas that would need further care.
         The Apex Court already observed, the Esplanade Bus
         Terminus being cause of pollution and threat to the
         greeneries within the heart of the city, must be removed
         away from the place where it is now situate. The Apex
         Court, however, did not make a time-frame and left it open
         to the State to do the needful. Mr. Pal would contend, the
         State, on principle, agreed with the direction and are eager
         to comply with the same. However, the place is yet to be
         identified. We feel, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in their
         wisdom left it to the Government without making a time
         frame, that would not give licence to the State to keep it
         pending for eternity. The State must find out ways and
         means to comply with such direction."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_68">C) Thereafter, this Court is required to notice the order dated 13th

   September, 2013 of the Hon'ble Division Bench in the pending

   PIL being WP 7987(W) of 2002 with CAN 5591 of 2013.           The

   Hon'ble Division Bench was pleased to, inter alia, hold as

   follows:-

         concerned at the appropriate level to assist this Court to

         Victoria Memorial but also to have a clean heart of the city
         free from pollution.</blockquote><p id="p_70">

everyone would pray before this Court to have a 'High
Power Monitoring Committee' to address the problem
and have a ready solution.
</p>
<p id="p_72">The Transport Secretary has already apprised us about the
Government's future plan with regard to bus terminus.
Those are time consuming. Since the problem is knocking at
our door, we have to address it at the earliest.

We, thus, appoint a committee to have deliberations with
all   concerned   and   prepare   a   comprehensive   report
suggesting the modalities to be adopted for the purpose of
removal of the pollution hazards in the heart of the city
within three kilometers radius of the Victoria Memorial. The
'High Power Committee' would also suggest the measures
to be adopted by any particular department.

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">        It is for the transporters to seek hearing from the High
        Power Committee and we leave it to them."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_79">D) Pursuant to the order dated 13th September, 2013 (supra)

  constituting the HPC, periodically the HPC submitted its reports

  as directed by the Hon'ble Division Bench. The HPC, inter alia,

  specifies that the State Transport Authority (STA), West Bengal
    has already decided not to issue any inter-state bus permit with

   Band Stand/Babughat as the terminal point.          The Second

   Report specifies at point No.5 that the Transport Department,

   Government of West Bengal requested the Kolkata Port Trust

   (for short KPT) vide memo No. 1287-WT/85-50/2007 PT(ii)

   dated 21st March, 2014 to take steps for handing over a land so

   that the Band Stand/Babughat bus terminus may be relocated

   without further delay.
</p>
<p id="p_80">
</p><p id="p_81">         In its Third Report the HPC underscored the point that

   the Transport Department vide its letter No. 2353-WT/85-

   50/2007 PT(ii) dated 10th June, 2014 informed the Chief

   Executive Officer of the Kolkata Metropolitan Development

   Authority (for short KMDA) that for shifting of the bus termini

   both from Esplanade and Band Stand/Babughat a joint

   inspection was held on 30th March, 2014 for selection of an

   alternative side at Santragachi, Howrah.       The KMDA was

   requested to initiate the process of handing over possession of

   the said land at Santragachi in favour of the Transport

   Department.
</p>
<p id="p_82">
E) Noticing further the reports of the HPC this Court finds that the

   Third Report mentions the fact that the Transport Department

   vide memo No. 2763-WT/85-50/2007 PT(ii) dated 4th July, 2014

   informed the KMDA that HRBC has been asked to develop the
    land at Santragachi expediously for use as a bus terminus by

   shifting buses from the existing termini at Esplanade and Band

   Stand respectively. On 3rd July, 2014 KMDA handed over the

   possession of the said land measuring approximately 11.02

   acres at Santragachi to the Transport Department for taking

   further steps to develop the same as a bus terminus.


</p><p id="p_83">         It will also be useful to mention that the First Report of

   the HPC clearly mentions the fact that on 9th December, 2013

   the Sub-Committee constituted under HPC took a hearing of the

   following entities:-
</p>
<p id="p_84">
</p><p id="p_85">a) Kolkata Bus Operators Welfare Association, West Bengal;


</p><p id="p_86">b) Inter-Regional Bus Owners' Association; and


</p><p id="p_87">c) All Private Stage Carriage Long Route Bus Workers' Union.


</p><p id="p_88">         The hearing was held in the chamber of the Principal

   Secretary, Transport Department.       The author of the said

   pending PIL, Sri Subhas Dutta was also heard on the same

   date, i.e. on 9th of December, 2013.
</p>
<p id="p_89">
F) This Court significantly notices that after the hearing on 9th of

   December, 2013 the Sub-committee of the HPC arrived at the

   following findings:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">         "i) The aforesaid operators of Long Distance Buses have
        undertaken     to   ensure   that   their   buses    would   use
        Esplanade Bus Terminus as a halting place only and not
        as a terminus and no maintenance works would be
        undertaken there. Accordingly, the halting time mentioned
        in the permits issued by the State Transport Authority,
        West Bengal may be curtailed to half of the existing time.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">        ii) The aforesaid operators of Long Distance Buses have
        also assured that they would use other places of the city as
        parking place for their buses. When the State Government
        would develop other terminuses in place of Esplanade Bus
        Terminus, they would shift their buses to such new
        terminuses.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">        iii) Necessary steps would be taken so that the area around
        Esplanade Bus Terminus would be declared as "Zero
        Tolerance Pollution free Zone".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">        iv) The time-keepers of the Inter-City buses would be
        shifted to other places."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_90">G) In the Fourth Report of the HPC it was, inter alia, observed at

  the meeting dated 6th August, 2014 for shifting the bus

  terminus   from     Santragachi,   that   KMDA      will   hand    over

  additional land to the Transport Department on the northern

  side of Kona Expressway for accommodating long distance

  buses. It was further decided at the meeting of the HPC dated

  6th August, 2014 that the buses will be shifted in a phased

  manner from Band Stand/Babughat and Esplanade to KCBT at
   Santragachi.   Notifications shall be issued by the competent

  State Authorites for operationalising the KCBT at Santragachi.


</p><p id="p_91">        Accordingly, in furtherance of all the decisions as above

  taken by the HPC vide Notification of the DM, Howrah dated

  29th September, 2015 under Rule 182 of the 1989 Rules (supra)

  the KCBT at Santragachi was notified to be fully functional

  w.e.f. 28th May, 2015. It is factually relevant to note that the

  present writ petition was thereafter filed in September, 2015.


H) Having regard to the above noted conspectus of facts this Court

  does not find any infirmity in the decision making process. On

  the contrary this Court finds adequate substance in the

  arguments of Ld. State Counsel that the reports of the HPC

  followed the mandate of the Hon'ble Apex Court as well as the

  Hon'ble Division Bench.     This Court is of the further clear

  opinion that in its order dated 12.09.2011 the Hon'ble Apex

  Court took deep notice of the suggestions made by the expert

  pollution control body, NEERI, on the steps suggested for the

  preservation of VM. Quoting para 5.2 of NEERI's suggestion, the

  Hon'ble Apex Court held that it would be necessary to ban

  heavy traffic from the Esplanade area. The diversion of heavy

  traffic would necessarily involve shifting of the bus terminus.

  The Hon'ble Apex Court took specific notice of the fact that even

  though the bus terminus at Esplanade is located two kilometers
    away from VM, the automobile exhausts will cause pollution to

   the atmosphere around VM.      Therefore, the Hon'ble Supreme

   Court modified the order impugned of the Hon'ble Division

   Bench and directed the State Government to take appropriate

   action on the NEERI report.
</p>
<p id="p_92">
I) This Court is further required to notice that the solemn order of

   the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 12.09.2011(supra) found its

   evolution in the subsequent orders of the Hon'ble Division

   Bench in the pending PIL, i.e. WP 7987(W) of 2002. As already

   recorded hereinabove in this judgement the Hon'ble Division

   Bench by its order dated 13.09.2013 set up the HPC to carry

   forward the recommendations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

   The HPC was directed to take steps on removal of pollution

   hazards within a radius of three kilometres of VM.


</p><p id="p_93">         Therefore, this Court finds adequate substance in the

   submissions of both the Ld. Counsel for the State Respondents

   and HRBC to the effect that the Band Stand bus terminus

   which is located within the three kilometres radius as directed

   by the Hon'ble Division Bench is in sync with the order of the

   Hon'ble Apex Court (supra) to be relocated in the first phase for

   preserving VM from pollution hazard.
</p><p id="p_94"> J) This court cannot be also oblivious of the fact that the orders of

   the Hon'ble Apex Court and the orders of the Hon'ble Division

   Bench (supra) have attained finality. This Court is conscious of

   the fact that the petitioners, although aware of the orders

   passed from time to time qua the shifting of the bus stands

   within a three kilometres radius of VM, have not questioned the

   same before the appropriate fora. On the contrary, this Court

   finds that the representatives of the bus operators, including

   the present petitioners, participated in the hearing before the

   HPC, a fact which is recorded in its First Report.


</p><p id="p_95">         Therefore, this Court finds no reason to intervene in this

   collateral challenge mounted by the writ petitioners by way of

   the present writ petition on the self-same issue which is long

   sub judice before the Hon'ble Division Bench in the pending PIL.


K) This Court is also of the considered view that the argument of

   Occupied Field is no longer available to the writ petitioners post

   the orders of the Hon'ble Apex Court and the Hon'ble Division

   Bench (supra).    The order of the Hon'ble Apex Court dated

   12.09.2011 settles the law under <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_7">Article 141</a> of the Constitution

   of India linking the preservation of VM from pollution to the

   shifting of the bus termini. The directions of the Hon'ble Apex

   Court were cemented further by the Hon'ble Division Bench

   through its successive orders regulating the steps to be taken by
    the State Government within a 3 kms radius of VM, which

   includes within its ambit the Band Stand bus terminus.


</p><p id="p_96">         To the mind of this Court the theory of Occupied Field

   read in the light of the distinctive legislative powers of the

   Centre and the State as sought to be argued by Sri Mitra stand

   on a different footing while applying the Doctrine of Merger qua

   the orders of the Hon'ble Apex Court and the Hon'ble Division

   Bench (supra) to the facts in issue.    This Court is therefore

   persuaded to hold that the Occupied Field argument is no more

   res integra which can be taken by the writ petitioners de novo by

   way of this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_97">
L) In the light of the facts and the law discussed above, this Court

   finds that the decision making process adopted by the HPC

   under the aegis of the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and

   the Hon'ble Division Bench passed from time to time followed a

   nuanced procedure and, cannot be faulted.        The resolution

   impugned of the HPC dated 11.08.2015 is, in the opinion of this

   Court, an appropriate step in the nuanced decision making

   process calling for a phase wise shifting of the bus terminus to

   KCBT, Santragachi. It is pertinent to mention that the HPC has

   not hurried its decision and, the successive reports filed by HPC

   have been capped by the Notification of the District Magistrate,

   Howrah dated 29.09.2015.
</p><p id="p_98">             In support of its above noted reasoning this Court finds it

      useful to rely upon the Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in

      1992 Supp (2) SCC 312 in the matter of H.B. Gandhi, Excise

      and Taxation Officer Cum Assessing Authority, Karnal &amp;

      Ors. vs. M/s. Gopi Nath &amp; Sons &amp; Ors. wherein at Paragraph

      8, it was held as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_99">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">            "8. But here what was assailed was the correctness of
            findings as if before an appellate forum. Judicial review, it
            is trite, is not directed against the decision but is confined
            to the decision making process.        Judicial review cannot
            extend to the examination of the correctness or review is to
            ensure that the individual receives fair treatment and not to
            ensure that the authority after according fair treatment
            reaches, on a matter which it is authorized by law to
            decide, a conclusion which is correct in the review of the
            manner in which the decision is made. It will be erroneous
            to think that the Court sits in judgment not only on the
            correctness of the decision making process but also on the
            correctness of the decision itself."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_100">      Before parting with this case this Court is required to notice the

fact that the issues raised in this writ petition lie in the realm of

expert bodies. It is trite law that this Court sitting in its Writ

jurisdiction must refrain itself from interfering in the detailed exercise

conducted by such expert bodies.
</p>
<p id="p_101">
</p><p id="p_102">      In the backdrop of the above discussion the resolution

impugned dated 11.08.2015 deserves no interference.
</p><p id="p_103">       WP 23439(W) of 2015 fails and stands accordingly dismissed.
