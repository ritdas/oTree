 JUSTICE

1.</pre><p id="p_1"> The whole
controversy pivots around the question, Whether the consumer fora can poach
into the jurisdiction of Delhi Debt Recovery Tribunal?. M.O.H. Leathers Ltd., a partnership
concern, approved as SSI
Unit and
100% Export Oriented Unit, was formed in the year 1986. UCO Bank
was the Banker of the said firm.
</p><p id="p_2">In the year 1990, Indian Bank
became the Banker of the Partnership firm.
The aforesaid Partnership
firm was converted into a Private
Limited Company, i.e., the
complainant and the Indian Bank, OP, in this case, was retained as its Banker.  
</p>
 

  

 

  

 

<p id="p_3">2. In the year
1991-92, the turnover of
the complainant was
Rs.11,05,46,874.00. The Bank took into
consideration the above said turnover and performance and enhanced the credit limits, w.e.f. 21.05.1992. The said limit was further enhanced on the
basis of turnover of Rs.16,11,02,131/- and performance by the Bank on
16.08.1993. During the year 1994-95,
there was decline in Leather Industry because of (1) Global Recession (2) Central Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, Air Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986. 
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_4">3. During the year 1994-97, the complainant, with its
own resources, was able to achieve turnover of Rs.9.00 crores, approximately,
every year. At the top of the above said Enactments, the Honble Supreme Court of India, issued
Directives which added more burden resulting in many of the tanneries
being closed down and the turnover of tanned
leather diminished. The export
trade was hard hit. 
</p>
 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

<p id="p_5">4. In the meantime,
the Indian Bank,
OP, wrote a letter
dated  

 

03.02.1997, under the Caption
Your Overdue Packing Credit, Overdue Export Bills and Advance Bills
Liabilities. The Indian Bank requested
the complainant to regularize the
facilities, detailed in the said letter, immediately and submit compliance report on doing the same. It was further requested to arrange to submit necessary papers immediately to
enable the Bank to put up renewal proposal to their higher authorities as
operations cannot be allowed, without a proper renewal sanction. The complainant approached the OP. It was informed that under the Guidelines of
RBI, the OP would help the Unit under
the Rehabilitation Programme and asked the representatives of the complainant
to give proposal for rehabilitation on the lines as contained in the complainants
proposal dated 21.04.1997. 
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_6">5. OP agreed to
rehabilitate the complainant in principle and asked the complainant for additional
security, vide letter dated 17.05.1997. In
June, 1997, the complainant furnished additional security. Vide letters
dated 11.08.1997 and 20.08.1997, the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd (hereinafter referred to as
ECGC, in short), allowed the sanction relating to post-shipment and pre-shipment
credit facility with certain conditions.
As desired by ECGC, the complainant
submitted the Schedule
of Shipment, on 20.08.1997.
</p> 

 

  

 

  

 

<p id="p_7">6. The complainant
submitted a Bill for DM 1,41,440 (equivalent to Rs.28,60,724/-) as part
shipment against order of Rs.2.5 crores
from M/s. Arma Leather (Holland) to the OP for discounting the same but
the same was not discounted and was sent on collection basis, on
13.08.1997. The complainant paid Rs.5,00,000/- as compensation as it was
the case of part-shipment and the complainant was unable to confirm that the
remaining order will be supplied in full as per the Schedule. The payment
received in respect of the Bill was adjusted against the old packing credit and
in turn new packing credit was not released. The complainant submitted Bill and LC at site from Space 2000
Italy, being part shipment of USD 22,787 against the whole LC amount of USD 83,681, valid till 31.08.1997 for shipment.
The said Bill was not discounted
as agreed by OP. Even after the receipt
of the payment, the same was not released
in contravention to the terms of the Rehabilitation Programme. The Bank
accepted the Bill, but did not discount
the same and sent the said Bill to the Foreign Buyer on collection basis. Even after receiving the money on collection
basis, which normally takes about 30-40 days for the money to come to the
account, the Bank adjusted the said
amount in the old account, but even at this stage of the matter, did not
release the packing credit to the said extent.  
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_8">7. It is alleged that the
said act of the OP, amounted to chocking
out of the entire function of the organization.
In the meantime, M/s.
</p><p id="p_9">Arma Leathers Placed order supply of goods worth Rs.2.5 crores with the
complainant. Goods worth Rs.68.00 lakhs were dispatched
but other goods could not be prepared because the amount could not be
released by the OP Bank. The Complainant
had to pay Rs.5.00 lakhs as compensation
to the Buyer. The complainant had to
loose the offer of Rs.2.5 crores. The amount was not released despite the fact that another LC from Space 2000 of
the value of USD 83,681.50 and another
LC from Court International, London, the total being Rs.43 lakhs,
approximately. The complainant dispatched merchandise to the extent of USD 22,787 as a partial shipment against order of
Space 2000. The said Bill was
lodged
by the complainant with the OP in August, 1997. The OP
did not discount the said Bill, also in violation of the terms
and conditions of the rehabilitation
programme. The said Bill was accepted
under the LC and sent the same on collection basis and on receipt of the
amount, adjusted in the old account and even at that stage of the matter, the OP did not release the packing
credit for further
consideration. The balance amount in LC was expiring in August,
1997 and because of the default of the OP, further goods could not be
manufactured and shipped. The
complainant suffered huge loss due to
expiry of the LC. Both the Buyers
cancelled the shipment for the balance
goods. Space 2000, was a client of the
complainant for the past more than 10
years. The complainant was earning a lot
of money. 
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_10">8. The grouse of the complainant
is that the Bank after approving the rehabilitation programme, sanctioned the
recommendation of the same to the ECGC and after
getting the positive directions from
ECGC, failed to release the funds for
further production for the export purposes.
The complainant had to suffer huge losses. In order to cover up its
default, OP, on or about 04.11.1997 and
10.11.1997, came out with a plea that the complainant should get its viability study
conducted by IndBank Merchant Banking Services Ltd, which
is a Sister Concern of the OP and intimated that it will cost a sum of
Rs.98,000/- and thereby a person, who is in a position to dominate the Will of the company, the OP
undertook to rehabilitate the complainant company which was showing signs of
sickness and dictated its arbitrary terms
to the complainant, which had no choice but to
obey and accept. It is alleged that the Bank did not fulfill
its own self-serving agreement in
time and played for illegal gains at the cost of the
complainant company and to its detriment.
The complainant had to suffer loss of Rs.148 lakhs, detailed in the
complaint. 
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_11">9. Again, the OP
has charged penal interest over overdue PC.
The amount of Rs.1.15 crores was charged
excess, as being own claim. In between, there was a compromise between the parties. Vide Notice dated
18.12.1997, calling back the loan amounts, the OP should have applied
to ECGC for claiming amount due from the complainant and should not have charged
any interest.
</p><p id="p_12">Consequently, the complainant is not liable to pay
the sum of Rs.1,16,67,434/-. The beneficiary under the ECGC policy is
OP itself. They are supposed
to pay premium for the said policy out of their own pocket. The OP had charged the complainant every month, premium paid to
ECGC on their account but debited to the complainants account, unlawfully. The amount charged was Rs.28,26,414/-. Due to fluctuation in exchange rate for USD
and D.MARKS against rupees, the OP charged extra amount in the sum of
Rs.1.48 crores.  
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_13">10. Ultimately, the
complainant company had to close the
shutters and send away 450 employees
from the job who were directly employed by it.
Vide Registered AD Notice, dated 02.12.1998, the complainant claimed an amount of Rs.7,15,93,848/- but it did not evoke any
response from the OP. Ultimately, this
complaint, dated 05.01.1998 was filed with the following prayers:-  
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_14"> a) Direct the Opposite Party to pay a sum
of Rs.7,15,93,848/- as detailed in para 35 hereinabove; 
</p>
 

<p id="p_15"> b) Direct the
Opposite Party to pay a sum of Rs.1 crore to the Complainant on account of
mental pain and agony suffered by the complainant; 
</p>
 

<p id="p_16"> c) Direct the
Opposite Party to pay interest @ 18% per annum from the date of filing of the
complaint till the date of payment of the amount awarded; 
</p>
 

<p id="p_17"> d) Direct the
Opposite Party to pay cost of this litigation; 
</p>
 

<p id="p_18">e) Pass such other or
further orders as this Honble Commission may deem fit and proper under the
circumstances of the case. 
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_19"> 11. DEFENCE:- 
</p>
 

<p id="p_20"> The Indian
Bank, OP, has enumerated the following
defences in its reply. It is contended that the
complainant is not a consumer. No rehabilitation programme was ever granted or even agreed to by the
OP. As a matter of fact, the OP asked
certain clarifications/details and additional security from the complainant, but the complainant could not pass on the same and hence rehabilitation package was
never agreed or granted by the OP to the
complainant. The complainant did not
fulfill the requirements for considering the rehabilitation programme by the OP. The
complainant has filed the present complaint
due to frustration and as a counter
blast in view of the application filed by
the OP before the Debts Recovery
Tribunal, Chennai, for recovery of loan
dues against the complainant, its
Directors, Guarantors, etc., which was pending at the time of filing of the
Written Statement. The complainant could agitate the points before the Debts Recovery Tribunal,
Chennai, and as such, the present complaint is not maintainable.  
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_21">12. It is explained that during the year 1993-94, the Bank had
released packing credit advances
and it had
enabled the complainant to achieve approximate turnover of Rs.9.00 crores. It is explained that the complainant did not submit its proposal for rehabilitation
programme vide their letter dated
21.04.1997. It is explained that by that
time, the accounts of the complainant Company had already become irregular and
the OP had been requesting the complainant to regularize the accounts. The Final
statements, stock statements, sealed projections and details
of security offered by the complainant to take up for the rehabilitation programme to the concerned authority, the complainant
could not give the additional securities in the form of mortgage by deposit of
title deeds. The title deeds submitted by the complainant were not clear
for the acceptance of mortgage. The Bank never assured or promised to grant
or sanction loan, by way of rehabilitation programme or
otherwise. The overdues of the complainant were alarming.
The affairs of the complainant were not
handled in a professional way and were mismanaged
and mishandled by the management of the complainant company.
As per proposal for re-phasement/renewal
of credit facilities, the Bank was asked
to produce documents vide order dated 25.09.1997,
but the needful was not done.  Vide letter dated 25.09.1997,
the complainant was asked to
produce the following documents :- 
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_22">a)    Conducting
an audit by outside agency preferably by
Indian Bank Merchant Banking Service Limited.
</p> 

 

<p id="p_23">b)   Conducting
of turn around viability by  

 

 IBMBS  

 

</p><p id="p_24">c)    Creation
of equitable mortgage of properties offered
as security 

 

</p><p id="p_25">d)   Company
to bring their own funds for adjustments of advance bills liabilities. 
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_26">13. It is explained that the proposal of the
complainant for rehabilitation recommending the same
to Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India
Ltd, was never accepted. The bank
never gave any understanding that the amount of the bills mentioned would
be purchased and adjusted against the previous old packing
credit and to that
extent, new packing credit would be released
in order to make further
production. The rehabilitation programme was never approved nor sanctioned by the Bank. It is explained that the OP was entitled to
charge penal interest as per RBI Guidelines since the
accounts of the complainant company became irregular. Whatever amount received from ECGC by the Bank under the guarantee taken by OP
and that payment has to be repaid to
ECGC on recovery from Borrowers and Banks. The conversion from foreign
currency to Indian rupees is to be assessed as per RBI Rules. All other allegations have been denied. 
</p>
 

  

 

  

 

<p id="p_27">14. Both the
parties have adduced evidence, by way of
affidavits.  
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_28">15. We have heard the learned counsel for the
parties and perused their written synopses. It was argued by the counsel for the complainant that
OP, in principle, agreed to
rehabilitate the complainant as is
apparent from their letter dated
17.05.1997 wherein the complainant was requested to furnish certain documents and the
OP also asked the complainant to give details of additional security.
The complainant offered the
security of a City flat of 4-Bed rooms, in a posh locality valued around Rs.60.00 lakhs and in addition thereto, collateral security of 50 acres of land valued around Rs.90.00 lakhs
had already been furnished. It was mentioned that the complainant was trying to arrange
security of one more flat. OP accepted
the proposal of rehabilitation programme
and recommended to ECGC of India
Ltd. ECGC also considered the said
proposal. Vide letter dated 11.08.1997, ECGC allowed the sanction relating to post-shipment and vide letter dated 20.08.1997, allowed the
pre-shipment. When the OP assured the complainant that its proposal
for rehabilitation programme has been approved by
it as well as by ECGC, the Complainant Company
submitted a Bill under its packing credit limit for DM 1,41,440 vide
Bill No.2, dated 08.08.1998 equivalent to Indian Rupees 28,60,724/- and gave the assurance that the money released against the said Bill
would be utilised for further
production for the export purposes for which the limit had been granted and for
which the rehabilitation programme had been approved.  
</p>
 

  

 

  

 

<p id="p_29">16. The learned
counsel for the complainant submitted
that the complainant was taken
for a ride. The Bank has been, long in
promises but short in
performances. Due to Banks inaction,
the complainant had to lose 2-3 big Buyers.
It was explained that if the Bank did not want to help the complainant it should
have
informed it from the very start that they are not going
to do the needful, in that event, the complainant would have made an
attempt to deal with another Bank. Although, in the written arguments, it is
submitted that the rehabilitation programme was approved and sanctioned by the Bank as well as the ECGC
in order to rehabilitate the Unit, but at the stage when the Company needed
funds urgently, the Bank failed to provide the
much needed credit. However,
at the time of the final
arguments, counsel for the complainant admitted that there was no sanction
order either from the Bank or from any
other authority.  
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_30">17. The plea raised by the learned counsel for the complainant is
mere palliative and does not delve deep to
the roots of malady. To top it
all, the complainant has kept the main facts under the hat. We fully agree with the
arguments advanced by the learned
counsel for OP that the present
complaint has been filed due to frustration and as a counter blast, in view of the application filed by the OP, before the DRT, Chennai, for recovery of loan dues against the
complainant, its Directors, Guarantors,
etc., and the same has already been decided in favour of the OP in a hotly
contested case. The DRT, Chennai, has directed the complainant to pay a sum of
Rs.104,90,82,386.83. The said complaint
was filed in the year 1998. First of
all, the counsel for the
complainant submitted that the said
complaint was filed in the year
2002 but
when his attention
was invited to the
fact that the said application pertains to
the year 1998 by the counsel for the OP, he did not
pick up a conflict with this point.
</p><p id="p_31">These facts found no mention in the complaint. The complaint is conspicuously silent about
it.  
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_32">18. Secondly, the matter was pending before the
DRT, Chennai, for recovery of debt.
</p><p id="p_33">Consequently, the consumer fora do not have jurisdiction to try this case. While we were dealing with a case of <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_4">SARFAESI
Act</a> in Shri Yashwant G. Ghaisas &amp; Ors.
</p><p id="p_34">Vs. Bank of Maharashtra, on 06.12.2012, in Consumer Complaint No.302 of 2012, this Commission, dismissed the case in limine, on the ground that consumer fora have no jurisdiction to try
this case. Against this order Special Leave
to Appeal (Civil) No.1359 of 2013 was preferred by the complainant, before the
Honble Apex Court. The Honble Apex
Court, vide order dated 01.03.2013, was pleased to approve our following
observations:- 
</p>
 

<p id="p_35">19.The
National Commission is not empowered to arrogate to itself the powers which
come within the jurisdiction of Debt Recovery Tribunals. This matter is purely
covered within the jurisdiction of DRT or DRAT.
If there is any grievance against the notice under <a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_5">Section 13(2)</a> of the SARFAESI Act, that
should be brought to the notice of the concerned authority. It is well settled that main Creditor and the
Guarantors are equally responsible. There lies no rub for the Bank to take action
against the Guarantor directly. It cannot be alleged that he is adopting the
policy of pick and choose. From the allegations stated above, there appears to be no deficiency on the part of the
opposite party. In case the Bankers are
working within the ambit of <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_6">SARFAESI
Act</a>, it cannot be said to be deficiency
on the part of the Bank. It must be
established that there is deficiency on the part of the Bank. In that case, this Commission can take
action. For the reasons stated above,
the complaint is dismissed at the stage of its admission. Nothing will preclude the complainants from
approaching appropriate Forum as per law. 
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_36">19. In a case decided by four Members Bench of
this Commission, comprising of Honble
Mr.Justice D.P.Wadhwa, Honble President, Mr.Justice J.K.Mehra, Mrs.Rajyalakshmi
Rao &amp; Mr.B.K.Taimni, Honble Members, titled as Traxpo Trading Ltd., Vs. The
Federal Bank Ltd., (Original Petition No.116 of 2001, decided on
15.10.2001) I (2002) CPJ 31 (NC), it was held :- 
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_37">Under
<a href="/doc/11945171/" id="a_7">Section 18</a> of the Act, jurisdiction of this Commission is barred where the Bank
has filed suit. Defendant in that suit
can claim set-off or even counter claim against the Bank under <a href="/doc/16071438/" id="a_8">Section 19</a> of
the Act. Complainant would have ample
opportunity to raise all the issues presented in the present complaint. That apart, when we examined the complaint,
it raises complex questions both of facts and law which is not possible to
decide in our summary jurisdiction. Then
we also feel that this complaint has been filed more as a counter blast to the
proposed action of the Bank. No doubt
this complaint has been filed four months earlier of filing of the suit by the
Bank before the Debt Recovery
Tribunal. But from that we cannot
lose sight of the fact that the Bank
would have threatened the
complainant for filing a suit and when such suit was imminent, complainant
chose to file this complaint. We, therefore, decline to entertain this
complaint and return the same to the complainant to seek remedy, if any, elsewhere. This complaint is disposed of
accordingly. Opposite Party  Bank shall
be entitled to costs of these proceedings which we quantify at Rs.5,000/-. 
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_38">20. Thirdly, the complainant should have
ventilated all his grievances before the learned DRT,
Chennai. He could have claimed
set-off against the Bank. There lies no rub.
It appears that the present complaint was filed in order to
harass the Bank authorities and to take revenge against them.
The order passed by the DRT, Chennai in favour of OP dated
22.07.2010 and the Appeal, if any, have attained
finality. It cannot be
challenged in a consumer fora.  
</p>
 

  

 

<p id="p_39">21. The complainant has made a
vain attempt to make bricks, without straw.
Vide notice dated 03.02.1997, the complainant was called upon to clear the outstanding
dues. The rehabilitation package
was never mooted.
</p><p id="p_40">The complainant was asked to complete the formalities, but it did
not. The complainant had
only submitted its proposal for rehabilitation which could not
proceed further due to the fact that the
complainant could never give the additional securities and the assurance to provide all additional securities
in the form of mortgage by deposit
of title deeds which was
never fulfilled because it
transpired that the additional securities were
not clear to accept the mortgage.
</p><p id="p_41">Legal opinion dated 31.03.1998
goes to confirm this fact. All the alleged promises
were made orally.
</p><p id="p_42">There was nothing in black and white.
</p><p id="p_43">Such like excuses can be made at
any time. The proposal sent by the
complainant was never accepted. The Bank
was already aware of the fact that the
complainant is bordering to be the sick
company. Under these circumstances,
to accept that the Bank will come to its rescue is
unacceptable. The story created
by the complainant does not just
stake up. On 02.12.1997, the talks of
negotiations for compromise took place.
</p><p id="p_44">As a matter of fact, all these
points should have
been put up before the DRT, Chennai, if the same were
not put, in that case, the complainant had
missed the bus. It will be deemed to have been given up under
Order II, Rule 2 of CPC. Last, but not the least, counsel for the
complainant candidly admitted that there
was no sanction order in favour of the complainant. Is it this Commissions duty to write definitions on
invisible blackboard with non-existent chalk?.
The complainants tilt at windmills, does not ring
the bell.
</p><p id="p_45">The complaint is, therefore, dismissed. No costs.
