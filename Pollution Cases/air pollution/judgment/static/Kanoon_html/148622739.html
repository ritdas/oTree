</p>
<p id="p_15">1.4   Since the issues involved in both the appeal are
identical both are taken up together.
</p>
<p id="p_16">2.1   Appellant had taken the credit on certain items
declaring them as capital goods, Revenue has sought to
disallow the said credit for the reasons as stated below:
</p>
<p id="p_17"> i.   Appellants had leased out a plot/ premises to M/s
      Indo Rama Petrochemicals Ltd, (2nd Party). 2nd party
                                  4                      E/526,1101/2008




       had erected a thermal Power Plant on the said
       premises, through a work contract on turnkey basis.
       Both appellant and 2nd Party are separate legal entity
       having separate CST No, BST/MST No and Separate
       PAN No etc.
ii.    The balance sheet of 2nd Party for the year 2005-06
       showed that they would sell/ supply power to
       Appellants and other group companies at mutually
       agreed tariff an terms.
</p><p id="p_18">iii.   Certain     expenses    have      been   debited     by    the
       appellant and an amount of Rs 1,50,90,000/- has
       been shown against re-imbursement of CENVAT
       Credit from Appellant, which clearly showed that
       power plant was not the property of appellant. The
       goods against which the appellant has taken the
       credit were used by the 2nd Party for setting up the
       power plant. These goods were actually never
       received by the appellants in their factory premises.
       Even the payments for goods/ raw material, erection
       and installation of the power plant were made by the
       2nd Party. Thus the CENVAT Credit taken by the
       appellants was irregular and inadmissible in view of
       <a href="/doc/177794098/" id="a_8">Section 2(d)</a> of Central Excise Act, 1944 read with
       Rule 2 (a) of Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004.
iv.    The final output of power plant is electricity, steam
       and ash which are not chargeable to excise duty or
       are exempt from payment of Central Excise Duty and
       thus the credit of duty paid on the goods used in
       erection of the power plant is not admissible in view
       of Rule 2(a) and 2(h) of CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004.
v.     The credit has been taken in respect of certain goods
       namely-
</p><p id="p_19">          a. Bunker used temporarily in the boiler for
             storage of crushed coal;
</p><p id="p_20">          b. Ash handling system used for disposal of ash;
          c. The supporting structures used for platform
             and    for   installation   of   various    parts    and
                              5                    E/526,1101/2008




           components are in nature         of    construction
           material for support;
</p><p id="p_21">        d. Supporting columns of the boiler which are
           fabricated goods of iron and steel and are
           neither machinery or components nor in the
           nature of spares and accessories of machine;
        e. Miscellaneous materials not described in detail
           in invoice;
</p><p id="p_22">        f. Brought out items such as resin etc, not
           specified as capital goods;
</p><p id="p_23">           is inadmissible as these goods do not qualify to
           be capital goods as defined under CENVAT
           credit Rules, 2004
2.2   Thus a show cause notice dated 05.02.2007 was
      issued to the Appellant and 2nd Party proposing to-
        a. Recover    CENVAT     Credit   amounting      to   Rs
           3,63,05,053/- [Rupees Three Crore Sixty Three
           Lakhs Five Thousand and Fifty Three only]
           from the Appellants in terms of Rule 14 of
           CEVAT Credit Rules, 2004 read with proviso to
           <a href="/doc/85233116/" id="a_9">Section 11A</a> of Central Excise Act, 1944 with
           interest under <a href="/doc/23088775/" id="a_10">section 11AB</a> ibid.
</p><p id="p_24">        b. Impose penalty on appellant under Rule 15 of

      issued to the Appellant and 2nd Party proposing to-
         a. Recover   CENVAT     Credit   amounting      to   Rs
           3,97,70,621/-   [Rupees Three         Crore   Ninety

           terms of Rule 14 of CEVAT Credit Rules, 2004

</p><p id="p_28">         c. Impose penalty on 2nd Party under Rule 26 and
            27 of Central Excise Rules, 2002.
</p><p id="p_29">2.3   Both the show cause notices have been adjudicated
      by the Commissioner vide his order in originals as
      referred to in para 1.2 and 1.3, supra.
2.4   Aggrieved by the order of Commissioner, appellants
      have filed these appeals.
</p>
<p id="p_30">3.1   In their appeal, appellants have challenged the order
of Commissioner stating that-
</p>
<p id="p_31">Appeal No E/526/2008

  a. The capital goods against which they have taken the
      credit are covered by the definition of capital goods
      and   were   used   in   their   factory   premises    for
      manufacture of final products namely polyester yarn,
      polyester chips etc. Hence the credit has been
      correctly taken by them.
</p><p id="p_32">  b. Ownership of capital goods is not relevant for taking
      the Cenvat Credit. As per Rule 4 of the CENVAT
      Credit Rules, 2004, the ownership of capital goods
      has not been prescribed as criteria for taking the
      CENVAT Credit. Reliance is placed on the decisions in
      case of German Remedies Ltd [2002 (144) ELT 606
      (T), Maruti Udyog Ltd [2004 (165) ELT 226 (T)],
      Sharda Motor Industries Ltd [2002 (150) ELT 759
      9T)], Hongo India (P) Ltd [2003 (160) ELT 470 (T)]
      &amp; Iljin Automotive Pvt Ltd [2004 (175) ELT 169 (T)].
  c. All the goods on which the credit has been taken by
      the appellants were used in their factory since the
      thermal power plant is within their factory premises
      without any boundary wall or any fence demarcation.
      The fact that certain portion of the land within their
      premises has been leased out for setting up the said
                                 7                      E/526,1101/2008




     power plant will not mean that the said portion of
     land is not the part of their factory premises.
     Decision   relied   upon       by   the    commissioner      viz
     Majestic Auto Ltd [1999 (107) ELT 133] has been
     differed by the tribunal in case of Dalmia Cements
     (Bharat) Ltd. [2008 (224) ELT 484]
d. Neither the power plant nor the electricity is final
     product since electricity generated is entirely used
     within the factory for the manufacture of final
     products. Reliance is placed on the decisions in case
     of Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd [2001 (130) ELT
     129],   NCR     Limited        [2001   (135)      ELT   1012],
     Chemplant Sanmar Ltd [2004 (177) ELT 446],
     Vasavadatta     Cement         [2002      (148)   ELT   1046],
     Rajarambapu Patil SSK [2007 (208) ELT 372], Nava
     Bharat Ferro Alloys Ltd [2004 (166) ELT 72]
e. The fact that thermal power plant is immovable
     property cannot be reason to deny the credit on
     capital goods used in setting up of such thermal
     power plant. Reliance placed on Mahalakshmi Glass
     Works Ltd [1999 9113) ELT 558], United Phosphorus
     Ltd [2002 (150) ELT 650}. HEG Ltd {2004 (177) ELT
     605], Bellary Steel and Alloys Ltd. [2005 (177) ELT
     605}, Lloyds Metals &amp; Engineers Ltd [2002 (50) RLT
     109}
f.   The fact that 2nd Party, is a separate entity cannot
     be the reason for determining the eligibility of
     CENVAT credit to the appellants. The decision of the
     tribunal in case of Ruby Mills [2007 (6) STR 178],
     relied upon by the Commissioner would not apply in
     present case.
</p><p id="p_33">g. The demand made by the first show cause notice is
     barred by limitation as they had taken the credit as
     early as in April 2005 against the invoices showing
     them as consignee and the capital goods were
     received in the factory premises and used in their
     factory premises. Thus it cannot be said that they
                                   8                    E/526,1101/2008




       had suppressed any facts from the department for
       which extended period of limitation can be invoked.
  h. For the various reasons as stated in the appeal since
       the demand itself cannot survive on merits the
       demand, and further the issue whether the credit in
       present case would be admissible to them or not is
       pure question of legal interpretation, penalty is not
       imposable on them.

a. Goods on which the credit has been taken by the
  appellants were all used in their factory since
  thermal power plant (TTP) is situated within the
  factory premises of the appellants and there is no
  boundary wall fence/ demarcating TTP from the
  factory premises. Merely for the reason that the
  place within the premises where TTP has been set up
  is leased to 2nd Party will not mean that the capital
  goods used in such place are not in their possession.
b. The issue involved is no longer res-integra and
  covered by the decision in case of JSW Steel [2014
  (307) ELT 929 (T)]. In view of the fact that issue on
  similar    facts   have   been   decided   holding    the

   l. The fact that 2nd Party has merged with the

v. 2nd Party has also not received the said capital goods
   for manufacture of final products. The electricity
   generated by it is not used in the factory for
   production of finished goods. Hence 2nd Party is also
   not entitled to the credit.

       aa.     A thermal power plant is not excisable goods.
         The plant is built/ erected by using components and
         machinery received. Hence there can be no credit
         available on goods received, by considering them as
         parts and components of capital goods.

         credit claimed by them. This credit has been availed
         by them by suppressing the fact that goods were not
         received in their factory. They are also liable to

5.3.2     Para 9 of the Show Cause Notice dated 5.02.02007
reads as follows:

"9.     Inquiries   were      caused      the    Regional      Officer,
</pre><p id="p_91">Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation, Nagpur
to ascertain the title of the land on which the power plant
is being set up. The Regional Officer, MIDC, vide letter
issued     under    F   No    MIDC/RO/Butibori/112/2007            dtd
08.01.2007 informed that M/s Indo Rama Synthetics Ltd
having plot No A-31, in Butibori Industrial Area has applied
for sub letting of plot area 46219 sq mtr to M/s Indo Rama
Petrochemicals Ltd., for manufacturing of Co-generation
Thermal Power Plant. It was also reported vide the same
letter that as per norms of the Corporation, the said land
for period from 01.04.2006 to 31.03.2007 was sanctioned
on sub lease basis. He also enclosed copies of letters
written by M/s Indo Rama Synthetics Ltd., approval letter
dated 29.03.2006, copy of confirmation letter dated
                              19                E/526,1101/2008




31.03.2006 and copies of letters/ no objection certificates
of UTI, SBI, ICICI, BOU, PNB &amp; OBOC conveying their no
objection to granting of sub lease rights to the Noticee No
2 for the said piece of land admeasuring approx. 11.50
acres earmarked out of Plot No A-31, MIDC, Industrial
Area Butibori. This indicates that Noticee No 2 has
acquired the piece of land from the Noticee No 1 for
erection of Thermal Power Plant."
</p>
<p id="p_92">5.3.3     Commissioner has in para 6.09.01 to 6.09.04 has
discussed this issue as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_93">"6.09.01     The Noticee No 1, has contended that the
power plant is located within their factory premises. This
argument is not acceptable in as    much as the land has
been leased out to Noticee No 2, M/s Indo Rama
Petrochemicals Ltd., Noticee No 1 has no locus standi as
regards the interest/ possession of the leased premises. In
terms of the lease agreement, the Noticee No 2 enjoy the
leased premises and therefore the claim of Noticee No. 1
that the said leased premises is part of factory is not
legally valid.
</p>
<p id="p_94">6.09.02      "The normal connotation of the term "lease" is
the preservation of the demised estate to be in occupation
and enjoyment thereof for a specified period or in
perpetuities for consideration; the corpus by user thereof
does not disappear and at the expiry of the term or on
termination then same is handed over to the Lessor
subject to the terms of the contract express or implied" as
held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of
Karnataka Vs Subash Rukmayya Guttedar AIR 1993
SC 860; 1993 supp (3) SCC 290, 294: AIR SCW 3492
dated 16.02.1992.
</p>
<p id="p_95">6.09.03.     A "lease" is transfer of a right to enjoy the
property as held by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
Tirth Ram Gupta Vs Gurbachan Singh AIR 1987 SC
770; 1987 (1) SC 712; 1987 (2) SCR 190; 1987 (1)

(2) RCJ 369.
</p>
<p id="p_96">6.09.04    From the above judgments, it is clear that
a lease is a document which effects an actual demise
and operates as lease and must create a present and
immediate interest in land. When there is interest and
complete possession by the Noticee No 2, on the leased
land, the Lessor i.e. Noticee No 1 cannot be held to be in
possession of the leased portion of land and cannot
have the right on the said land. Hence the contention of
the Noticee No 1 that the power plant is located in their
factory premises is untenable."
</p>
<p id="p_97">5.3.4   In our view once the plot of land which has been
leased out by the Appellant to 2nd Party, the same cannot
be said to be in possession of the appellant, for enjoyment
and undertaking any commercial or production activities.
The claim of the appellant that the said plot has not been
segregated by the fence or boundary wall do not has any
merits because the said plot of land has been clearly
identified and earmarked in the land records as has been
stated by the MIDC (Copy of the letter dated 31.03.2006
of MIDC reproduced below):
</p><pre id="pre_6">                            21                E/526,1101/2008




5.3.5      The fact that the plot of land on which the
</pre><p id="p_98">Thermal Power Plant was located belonged to 2nd Party and
is not part of the factory premises of the Appellant, is
                                     22                 E/526,1101/2008




evident from the para 02.01 of the impugned order
wherein it has been recorded:-
</p>
<p id="p_99">"02.01         The Noticee No 1 submitted a revised ground
plan of its factory premises to the Range Superintendent,
Central Excise Range, Butibori on 16.10.006. During the
course    of    verification   of    the   same   by   the    Range
Superintendent, Butibori the authorized representative of
the Noticee No 1 informed that the area where the thermal
power plant is being erected belongs to Noticee No 2. He
further admitted that there was no board displaying the
name of Noticee No 2 in the area of power plant. The
above proceedings were recorded under a panchnama
dated 24.10.2006 before the authorized representative of
the Noticee No. 1."
</p>
<p id="p_100">5.3.6          Thus we have no hesitation in holding that the
plot of land on which the power plant was erected was the
premises of 2nd Party and Appellant had no right to use
that plot for any of their production activities. There is no
dispute to the fact that this plot has been carved out of the
Plot No        A-31 MIDC Industrial Area, Butibori District
Nagpur. No separate identification has been assigned to
the plot leased by Appellant to 2nd Party and even no board
identifying the plot with the 2nd Party has been put.
</p>
<p id="p_101">5.3.7          The fact 2nd Party is paying for all the services
provided by the Appellant to them in respect of their
operations at carved out plot, clearly establishes the
distinction between the two and the fact that Appellants
themselves do not for any purpose treat this plot as part of
their premises. The Memorandum of Understanding dated
26th May 2005 signed between Appellants and 2nd Party
clearly states-
</p>
<p id="p_102">"i)     46219 sq Meter out of 809457 Sq Meter, situated at

mentioned under this agreement on mutually accepted
terms."
</p>
<p id="p_110">5.3.8       Commissioner       has    examined   the    Power
Purchase Agreement in his order in para 06.10.01 and
06.10.02 stating as follows:
</p><p id="p_111">"06.10.01 A perusal of the power purchase agreement
indicates that the Noticee No 2 has entered into an
agreement with Noticee No 1, for sale of electricity
generated in its power plant on negotiable basis. At <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_39">Article
5</a> of the said agreement it is clearly mentioned that in case
the parties do not arrive at a mutual agreement on the
tariff, the Noticee no 2 would be free to sell power to third
parties. In the <a href="/doc/691208/" id="a_40">Article 8</a> of the said agreement a provision
has been made to allow the Noticee no 2 to sell power to
third parties in the event of payment default by the
Noticee no. 1 for a continuous period of three months. It is
seen from the letter dated 17.10.005 issued by the Notice
No 2 to the Director, Steam Boiler Maharashtra State, 3rd
Floor, Tardeo Road Mumbai that the Noticee no 2 has
requested for permission to install boiler for erection of
power plant at Butibori Nagpur. From the copy of letters
from the Banks cited in para 02.08 supra it is observed
that the Noticee no 2 had taken loans from the banks for
setting up power plant at Butibori.
</p><p id="p_112">6.10.01     Thus it is seen that the noticee No 2 is
separate legal entity with liberty to sell the power
generated in power plant to third parties and has erected
the power plant on leased out land of Noticee No 1."
5.3.9       To all the statutory authorities for seeking the
clearances the owner and operator of the power plant is
shown as 2nd Party and not the Appellant as is evident
from following correspondences:

5.3.10     One question that needs to be answered is
whether the entire plot covered by A-31, MIDC Industrial
Area, Butibori Nagpur on which the factory of Appellants is
located needs to be considered as factory for manufacture
                               31                     E/526,1101/2008




of finished goods. The ground plan of the plot A-31, MIDC
Industrial Area, Butibori Nagpur is reproduced below:
</p>



<p id="p_114">From perusal of the ground plan it is quite evident that on
the said plot marked as A-31 MIDC Industrial Area,
Butibori Nagpur, apart from factory of Appellant, quite a
good number of other things including the leased out land
to 2nd Party, Plot identified as Indo Rama Textiles Ltd.,
residential complex, temple etc are located. Just because
these facilities are located on the same plot they cannot be
called   the   factory   premises   of   the    Appellant.      The
contention that what so ever is located on the said plot
needs to be considered as part of their factory of
manufacture     has   been   rejected    by    the   Tribunal    in
appellants own case reported at [2006 (199) ELT 0175
(T)] and affirmed by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in
[2007 (219) ELT 122 (Bom)]. Hon'ble Bombay High Court
held-
</p>
<p id="p_115">"21. The fact that the residential complexes are situated
within the licensed premises would not entitle the assessee
to avail credit of duty paid on furnace oil used in the
manufacture of electricity supplied to the residential
complexes. It is necessary to establish that the electricity
                               32                   E/526,1101/2008




is used for any purpose connected with or related to the
production of final products. In our opinion, supply of
electricity to the residential complexes situated within the
factory premises are neither connected with or related to
the production of the final products. In this view of the
matter, we hold that the finding recorded by the Tribunal
that the assessee is not entitled to the credit of duty paid
on the furnace oil used in the generation of electricity
supplied to the residential complexes cannot be faulted.
</p>
<p id="p_116">22. The decision of the Apex Court in the case of Grauer
and Weil (I) Ltd. v. CCT (supra) and the case of <a href="/doc/1958936/" id="a_41">South
Eastern Coalfields Limited v. CCE</a> (supra) relied upon by
the assessee do not support their case. What is held in
those cases is that the words "any premises including the
precincts thereof" in <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_42">Section 2(m)</a> of the Central Excise Act
are wide enough to cover any activity carried on within the
licensed premises. In both the above cases, the Apex
Court was not called upon to consider the issue which is
raised in this appeal. In any event, it is pertinent to note
that in both the above cases, the activity in question
related to the production of excisable goods or an activity
connected with or related to the production of the final
products. In the present case, supply of electricity to the
residential complexes is wholly unconnected with or
related to the final products produced in the factory of the
assessee.    Therefore,   reliance   placed   on   the    above
decisions of the Apex Court is wholly misplaced."
</p>
<p id="p_117">5.3.12       Further Hon'ble Supreme Court has in case of
South Eastern Coalfields Ltd. [2006 (200) ELT 357 (SC)]
held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_118">"11.The     question, therefore, in this case is that "whether
the workshop in question can be said to be situated within
the precincts of the mine".
</p>
<p id="p_119">12.Before the      Tribunal reliance was placed by the
learned counsel for the assessee on an earlier order of the
Tribunal in Central Coalfields Ltd. v. CCE, Jamshedpur
                                    33                 E/526,1101/2008




dated 16-9-1997, in which it was held that the word
"precincts" cannot be restricted to an area of four Kms. In
that case the Tribunal held that the workshop in question
was situated within the precincts of the mines to which it
was catering, even though it was situated at a distance of
50 Kms. from the said mine.
</p>
<p id="p_120">13.In    the    present     case    the   Tribunal   rejected     the
assessee's claim for exemption on the ground that since
the mine was registered under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_43">Factories Act</a>, it cannot
have the benefit of exemption in the Notification No.
63/95-C.E. since as per <a href="/doc/1395133/" id="a_44">Section 2(m)</a> of the Factories Act a
factory means any premises including the precincts thereof
but does not include a mine subject to the operation of the
<a href="/doc/1814464/" id="a_45">Mines Act</a>, 1952.
</p>
<p id="p_121">14.In our      opinion the registration of a mine under the
<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_46">Factories Act</a> has nothing to do with the assessee's claim
for exemption under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_47">Central Excise Act</a>. In fact the
reference to the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_48">Factories Act</a> itself was wholly irrelevant
and we fail to see what the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_49">Factories Act</a> has to do with the
present case. The present case is covered by the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_50">Central
Excise Act</a> and has nothing to do with the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_51">Factories Act</a>.
Hence the view taken by the Tribunal is, with due respect
to it, clearly erroneous.
</p>
<p id="p_122">15.It has to     be considered in the present case whether
the workshop in question is said to be a workshop within
the precincts of a mine.
</p>
<p id="p_123">16.The word        'precincts' is not a word of clear import
which has a single, clear-cut meaning. Collin's English
Dictionary defines 'precincts' to mean "the surrounding
region or area".
</p>
<p id="p_124">17.In the      New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, the
word 'precinct' is shown to have several meanings among
which are the following :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">        "The   area   within   the      boundaries   (real   or
        imaginary) of a building or place; the grounds;
        the interior; esp. an enclosed or clearly defined
                                     34                    E/526,1101/2008




        area around a cathedral, college, etc. Also, the
        surroundings or environs of a place."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_125">18.In the          Advanced Law Lexicon, 3rd Edition, by P.
Ramanatha Aiyar, the word 'precinct' has been shown to
have several meanings including a space enclosed by walls
or other boundaries.
</p>
<p id="p_126">19.In      Black's Law Dictionary, 7th Edition, the word
'precinct' is defined as follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">        "A geographical unit of government, such as an
        election district, a police district, or a judicial
        district."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_127">20.From a          perusal of the above definitions, it appears
that the word "precincts" does not have a single meaning,
rather it has several meanings.
</p>
<p id="p_128">21.One word            can have several meanings, and one
meaning      can      have      several    words    (synonyms).     For
instance, the word 'ball' can mean a round object for
playing games like cricket, football, etc.; it can also mean
a dance; it can also mean having a nice time, etc.
Similarly,    in     Sanskrit     the     words    "kamal",   "pankaj",
"rajeev", "neeraj", "jalaj", "saroj", etc. have the same
meaning i.e. Lotus.

<p id="p_129">22.According         to the literal rule of interpretation, if the
meaning of a word or expression is clear, there is no scope
for interpretation and we have to follow the plain and
grammatical meaning.
</p>
<p id="p_130">23.However,          where the meaning of a word or expression
is not clear, obviously the literal rule of interpretation
cannot be applied, and hence we have to take resort to
other rules of interpretation e.g. the Heydon's mischief
rule, the purposive rule, etc. In our opinion in the present
case the purposive rule should be applied. Under this rule,
we have to see the purpose for which the provision was
made. Looking at it from this angle, we are of the opinion
                               35                 E/526,1101/2008




that the word 'precincts' has to be given the broader
meaning and not the narrower meaning.
</p>
<p id="p_131">24.In other      words, we have to interpret the word
'precinct' in the exemption notification to mean the
surrounding region or area, as defined in Collins English
Dictionary or the surroundings or environs of a place as
defined in the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. This
is because the purpose of the exemption notification is to
grant exemption from excise duty to goods produced in a
mine so as to encourage the mining industry. A workshop
which is in an area in the environs of a mine and is
existing solely for the purpose connected with the mine
and under the same management, is obviously directly
serving the mining operations. Hence, we have to interpret
the notification so as to include such a workshop within the
definition of a mine for the purpose of grant of exemption,
as that would encourage the mining industry."
</p>
<p id="p_132">Even in the above referred decision benefit after adopting
the principle of purposive interpretation was given only
after noting that the workshop was under the same
management. In our view since the thermal power plant at
material time at least before the merger of 2nd Party with
Appellant was under a distinct management and was
owned by the distinct company, even if located on the
same plot cannot be said to part of the manufacturing
operations of Appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_133">5.3.13       From the above it is quite evident that the-
i.     Thermal power plant erected at A-31 MIDC Industrial
Area, Butibori District Nagpur, has been erected on the
plot which do not form the part of factory premises of the
Appellant.
</p><p id="p_134">ii.    Appellant neither owns that thermal power plant nor
operates and maintains the same.
</p><p id="p_135">iii.   All the statutory permissions required for setting up

have been obtained by and granted to 2nd Party.

iv.     2nd Party has constructed, erected, owns, operates
</pre><p id="p_136">and maintains the thermal power plant strictly in a
commercial manner and is free to sell the power generated
on acceptable and agreeable commercial terms.
v.    Appellant purchase the power generated in the power
plant. They have priority in purchase and only after
fulfilling their needs can 2nd Party sell the surplus power to
third party. The thermal power plant at A-31 MIDC
Industrial Area, Butibori District Nagpur is not the captive
power plant of the appellant.

have supplied the goods to them at the premises located
at A-31, MIDC Industrial Area Butibori Nagpur. Copies of

</pre><p id="p_145">From the above facts as mentioned in the balance sheet of
the 2nd Party it is quite evident that the Thermal Power
Plant Project at Butibori was being implemented by them
and all the expenditure towards the procurement of the
goods etc was incurred by them on their own account and
not on the account of Appellants. It is also evident that
these expenses were being met by them through the funds
mobilized by them through bank loans etc. Also they were
the fixed assets of their and were used to secure the loans
taken by the banks. In view of above we do not have any
hesitation in holding that capital goods in question were
being procured by the 2nd Party for use by themselves for
erection of the Thermal Power Plant at Butibori. Thus
mention of consignee as "M/s Indo Rama Synthetics
Limited, A-31 MIDC Industrial Area Butibori Nagpur" on
invoices was nothing but an attempt to create entitlement
to CENVAT Credit for the Appellant, without passing the
actual ownership/ possession or right to use the said goods
in their favour.
</p>
<p id="p_146">5.4.6         Further these capital goods were capitalized in

Ans.- It is because the power plant is located in the
premises of Indo Rama Synthetics Ltd which have been
leased to Indo Rama Petrochemicals Ltd. and the power
that will be generated will be sold to Indo Rama Synthetics
Ltd. and group companies and that will be used in the
manufacture of their excisable goods

Q.    When the power project is being installed by Indo
Rama Petrochemicals Ltd. and Indo Rama Petrochemicals
Ltd. is also incurring expenditure for the setting up of the
same for commercial purpose the invoices for the project
should have been in your name. Only for allowing Indo
Rama Synthetics Ltd. to take CENVAT Credit because Indo
Rama Petrochemicals Ltd. cannot utilize the same, the
whole system is generated, please explain.
</p>
<p id="p_167">Ans.- We reiterate that the sole purpose of power project
is to supply power to Indo Rama Synthetics Ltd and group
companies for manufacture of excisable goods and hence
name of Indo Rama Synthetics Ltd is appearing as
consignee in the invoices.

<p id="p_168">Q.    Whether Indo Rama Petrochemicals Ltd. has directed
the suppliers of capital goods of power plant to specifically
mention the name of Indo Rama Synthetics Ltd., as
consignee and account/ customer's name as Indo Rama
Petrochemicals Ltd. on the invoices at the instance of Indo
Rama Synthetics Ltd.?

<p id="p_169">Ans. Indo Rama Petrochemicals Ltd. being the company
setting up the power plant within the premises of Indo
Rama Synthetics Ltd. and the power generated is solely for
consumption by Indo Rama Synthetics Ltd and group
companies the documents were drawn as consignee as

<p id="p_174">Ans.- No. We have not paid any Service Tax on the goods
received for power plant. It is the sole responsibility of the
vendor."
</p>
<p id="p_175">5.4.8        The fact that the capital goods received for
installation in of the power plant, will be/ have been
capitalized in the book of accounts of M/s Indo Rama
Petrochemicals Ltd. and depreciation claimed is evident
from the Profitability Statement and Projected Balance
Sheet submitted by them to Yes Bank for seeking certain
loans for execution of this project. The said statements are

5.4.9        From the facts as discussed above it is quite
</pre><p id="p_176">evident that 2nd Party was constructing, installing erecting,
owning, operating and maintaining the said Thermal Power
Plant as its own business asset for generating profits for
itself by way of sale of power. Appellant had no role,
authority over the 2nd Party or over the Thermal Power
Plant. They were purchasing the power generated in the
Thermal    Power   Plant   on    commercially   and   mutually
agreeable terms and conditions from the 2nd Party. Thus
the goods covered by the invoices on which they were
shown as consignee were never received by them in their
factory premises but were but were received by the 2nd
Party on the plot leased out to them by Appellants. 2nd
Party has not only received the said goods but have
reflected the same in their book of accounts as capital/
fixed assets.

<p id="p_177">5.4.10.      Since the goods were never received by the
Appellant's in their premises the and were not installed,
operated or used in any process of manufacture of final

specifically in case of JSW Steel [2014 (307) ELT 929 (T)]
argued that the CENVAT Credit cannot be denied to them
as Goods on which the credit has been taken by the
appellants were all used in their factory since thermal
power plant (TTP) is situated within the factory premises of
the appellants and there is no boundary wall fence/
demarcating TTP from the factory premises. We do not find
the merits in submission of the Appellants and the facts of
case    relied   upon   by   the     appellant   are   clearly
distinguishable. Facts as recorded by the tribunal in its
order are as follows:

<p id="p_209">"8. Earlier, the main appellants were known as M/s.
Southern Iron and Steel Company Ltd. ('SISCOL' - in
short), which was established in 1996 and was in working

'Restructuring    Scheme'         under   Corporate      Debt
Restructuring ('CDR' - in short). Thereafter, M/s. SISCOL
was declared a sick company and was brought under BIFR.

'CPP', M/s. SISCOL leased out a portion of their factory
premises of 50.14 acres to M/s. JSWPL for the purpose of
setting up of 'CPP' on 17-1-2005, for a nominal amount of
Rs. 10,000/- p.a. M/s. JSWPL pledged the land with the
UTI Bank Ltd., to raise fund to the tune of Rs. 62 crores,
for the purpose of setting up of the 'CPP' in the leased
factory land for captive use of M/s. SISCOL in the
manufacture of their final product i.e., iron and steel. M/s.
JSWPL also used the funds to procure capital goods for the
purpose of setting up the 'CPP'. They had instructed their
suppliers to indicate in the invoice as "M/s. JSWPL,
Consignee of M/s. SISCOL" and on the strength of these
                               58                    E/526,1101/2008

goods. As per CDR proceedings during August, 2004, M/s.
SISCOL merged with M/s. JSWSL with effect from 1-4-
2007. On 31-8-2006, M/s. SISCOL terminated the lease
agreement with M/s. JSWSL and (M/s. JSWPL merged with
M/s. JSWPL with effect from 1-4-2005) took over the 'CPP'.
The loan of UTI Bank was also taken over by M/s.

<p id="p_211">"13. The    learned    counsel     Shri   Shiva   Dass   for   the
appellants submitted that -
</p>
<p id="p_212">(a)   The 'CPP' is an integral part of steel plant;

<p id="p_218">In para 32 and 33 distinguishing the facts of that case
from the case of Majestic Auto, it has been recorded

"32. The case law relied upon by the learned JCDR in the
case of M/s. Majestic Auto Ltd. (supra) is also not relevant
to the facts of this case. As in that case, M/s. Hero Briggs
&amp; Stratton Auto Pvt. Ltd., had taken on lease a part of the
factory premises of M/s. Majestic Auto Ltd., who have also
sold the machines and equipments on which they have
availed MODVAT credit and M/s. Majestic Auto Ltd., have

JSWPL for installation of 'CPP' which is being used by the
appellants for manufacturing of their final products. There
is no contract between the appellants and M/s. JSWPL for
generation of electricity in the 'CPP' by M/s. JSWPL and
was to be sold to the appellants. In fact, M/s. JSWPL was
leased out land for installation of 'CPP' only. Therefore, the
decision in the case of M/s. Majestic Auto Ltd., cannot be
relied on in the facts of this case and the decision of M/s.
Majestic Auto Ltd. (supra) was also dealt with by that
Tribunal in the case of M/s. Steel Authority of India Ltd. -
2007 (219) E.L.T. 960 (Tri.-Del). Further, we find that the
learned JCDR also relied on the decision of M/s. Chemplast
Sanmar Ltd. - 2004 (177) E.L.T. 446 (Tri.-Chennai), this
Tribunal hold that although M/s. Chemplast Sanmar Ltd., is
not the manufacturer of power plant but finally credit on
the capital goods was allowed. Therefore, as in this case
also the final product is iron and steel. For manufacturing
of that final product, 'CPP' was to be installed. Therefore,
following the decision of M/s. Chemplast Sanmar Ltd.
(supra), the appellants are entitled to Cenvat credit on
capital goods used in the manufacture of 'CPP' by M/s.
JSWPL.
</p>
<p id="p_220">33. In view of the above discussions, we find that the
land has been leased to M/s. JSWPL only to set up a 'CPP'
to take care of the power requirements of M/s. SISCOL on
payment of annual rent of Rs. 10,000/- only. The said
lease deed has been executed for raising the finance for
setting up the 'CPP' as per CDR scheme. Further, M/s.
JSWPL    and M/s. SISCOL       merged with     M/s. JSWSL,
therefore, and relying on the case laws of M/s. Steel
Authority of India Ltd. - 2007 (219) E.L.T. 960 (Tri.-Del.),
M/s. Chemplast Sanmar Ltd. - 2004 (177) E.L.T. 446 (Tri.-
Chennai) and M/s. Vikram Cement - 2006 (197) E.L.T. 145
(S.C.), we find that the appellants are entitled to Cenvat
credit on the capital goods which were being used for
manufacturing of 'CPP' by M/s. JSWPL, which is being used
                              60                 E/526,1101/2008




by the appellants to manufacture their final product i.e.,
iron and steel."
</p>
<p id="p_221">From the facts as recorded by the Tribunal in case of JSW
Steel, it is evident that the portion of the land was leased
out by M/s SISCOL to M/s JSWPL, not on any commercial
terms but for the purpose of getting the loan. Further the
CPP which was to be set up, was not to operate on
commercial basis as an entity selling the power to M/s
SISOL but was setup as captive power plant, integral part
of the manufacturing unit. This fact is further strengthen
by the fact that invoices were made stating "M/s. JSWPL,
Consignee of M/s. SISCOL", which clearly showed that the
goods were procured by M/s SISCOL, but were consigned
in the name of M/s JSWPL. These facts clearly distinguish
the case in hand from the case under consideration by the
tribunal in case of M/s JSWPL.
</p>
<p id="p_222">5.5.4       Counsel    for   appellants   in   his    written
submissions in respect of the decision of Majestic Auto
Limited [[1999 (107) ELT 133 (T)] mentioned wrongly
should have been [2004 (173) ELT 145 (T-Del)            relied
upon by the Commissioner in para 6.14.02 has been over
ruled by the Allahabad High Court. Para 6.14.02 of the
impugned order is reproduced below:
</p>
<p id="p_223">"6.14.02    Where any premises in which the capital goods
are installed has been leased out to another company, say
"X" by "Y company, who are now in possession of the said
premises, it cannot be claimed by "Y" company that the
capital good are used in their factory. The capital goods
are no more installed in the factory of the "Y". In this
regard I place reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble
Tribunal in the case of <a href="/doc/945228/" id="a_55">Majestic Auto Ltd vs CCE Ghaziabad</a>
reported in 2004 (173) ELT 145 (tri-Del)], wherein it has
been held in para 6.1 to 6.3 as under;-
</p>
<p id="p_224">"6.1 We have considered the submissions of both the
sides. It is not disputed by the learned Advocate that both
the appellants are separate limited companies and as such
                                 61                 E/526,1101/2008




they are two different legal entity, though they may belong
to same group. It is also not in dispute that the Appellant
No. 1 have taken the Modvat credit of the duty paid on the
capital goods in question and the premises in which the
said goods are installed had been given on lease to the
Appellant No. 2. This is also very clear from the Lease
Agreement that the Lessee i.e. Appellants No. 2 shall enjoy
the Demised Premises during the lease period without
interruption by the lessor (i.e. Appellant No. 1). In terms
of the Lease Agreement, the Appellants No. 2 enjoy the
said premises and therefore it cannot be claimed to be the
part of factory premises of the Appellants No. 1.
</p>
<p id="p_225">6.2 Rule 57Q of the Central Excise Rules empower a
manufacturer to take the credit of the duty paid on the
capital goods used in the factory of the manufacturer of
final products. Rule 57S deals with the "manner of
utilization of the capital goods." As per sub-rule (1) of Rule
57S, the capital goods "may be (i) used in the factory of
the manufacturer of the final products; or (ii) removed,
after intimating the Assistant Commissioner of Central
Excise having jurisdiction over the factory and after
obtaining dated acknowledgement of the same, from the
factory for home consumption or for export on payment of
appropriate duty of excise leviable thereon or for export
under   bond,   as   if   the    capital   goods   have    been
manufactured in the said factory."
</p>
<p id="p_226">6.3 As the premises in which the capital goods are
installed has now been leased to the Appellants No. 2 who
are now in possession of the said premises, it cannot be
claimed by the Appellants No. 1 that the capital goods are
used in their factory. The capital goods are no more
installed in the factory of the Appellants No. 1........"
</p>
<p id="p_227">06.14.03    Thus the irresistible conclusion based on the
above decisions is that as soon as a factory premises are
leased to another person, the lessor cannot claim the legal
premises to be within the lessor's factory. Hence the
contention of Noticee No 1, that the leased premises are
                               62                  E/526,1101/2008




still with their factory does not hold water."
</p>
<p id="p_228">Hon'ble Allahabad High Court has in case of Hero Motors
[2014 (310) ELT 729 (ALL)] stated as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_229">22. In the present case we find substance in the
contention of Shri Bharat Ji Agarwal that at the time of
obtaining registration HBSA Pvt. Ltd. had submitted a
ground lay out plan, which was approved by the
Superintendent, Customs and Central Excise, Range-
6, Division-III, Ghaziabad on 21-8-1998 and in
which the engine assembly on ground floor in the
premises    of   Majestic    Auto    Limited     was   clearly
demarcated. The plant and machinery was installed
and was never removed from the premises. The I.C.
Engines manufactured by HBSA Pvt. Ltd. in the same
premises were used by the appellant. Once it was
admitted that the capital goods, on which Modvat
Credit was taken by the appellant remained installed
in the same premises, which was leased out and
continued to be engaged in the manufacture of I.C.
Engine, which was further used in the manufacture
of two wheelers and that a separate registration
certificate was obtained by HBSA Pvt. Ltd., there was
no removal of goods. The capital goods remained
installed in the same premises and thus even if the
premises were transferred on lease, the capital goods even
if they were deemed to be installed in the premises of
HBSA Pvt. Ltd., Rule 57-S, would not be attracted."
</p>
<p id="p_230">We do not find merits in submissions of the Counsel. It is
not disputed that the decision of tribunal in case of
Majestic Auto has been set aside by the Allahabad High
Court, however the issue of relationship of lessor and
lessee has not been set aside. It is seen that in the
premises of leased out, when registration was granted the
plant and machinery which was owned and installed by the
Lessor was clearly demarcated, and never removed from
that premises, for that reason High Court has set aside the
order of tribunal stating that since machinery continued to
                                 63                 E/526,1101/2008




be installed within the factory premises provisions of Rule
57S shall not be applicable. However High Court was not
dealing with the case where the plant and machinery was
procured by the person on his own account, to whom the
plot of land was leased for setting up a thermal power
plant to be operated on commercial basis. When the
ownership of the said plant and machinery was vested
throughout with the 2nd Party, how can the Appellant claim
the CENVAT Credit of duty paid on Capital Goods, installed
on the leased out land on the basis of this decision of
Allahabad High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_231">5.5.5 Similarly the reliance placed by the appellants on the
decision of Madras High Court in case of Dalmia Cement
[2015 (323) ELT 290 (Mad)], Steel Authority of India
Limited [2016 (332) ELT 825 (T)] and Bhilai Steel Plant
[2017 (1) TMI 293 (T)], cannot justify their stand. The
issue under the consideration was in respect of removal of
goods. The question that was being addressed was
whether the goods which were already there on which
credit has been taken, stood removed when they were
handed    over   to   another    entity   in   terms   of   lease
agreement. On contrary issue in the present case is vis a
vis the admissibility of credit in respect of the goods
procured by the lessee [person to whom a plot of land has
been leased out] on his own account for commercial
exploitation, to the lessor. We find the decisions to be
clearly distinguishable. Just because the Thermal Power
Plant has been set up on the plot leased out by the
Appellant, it would not entitle them to the CENVAT Credit
in respect of the inputs and capital goods procured by the
lessor.
</p>
<p id="p_232">5.5.6       We find that the decision of the Karnataka High
Court in case of Associated Cement Limited [209 (236) ELT
240 (Kar) to be squarely applicable in the present case.
Relevant excerpts from these decisions are reproduced
below:
</p>
<p id="p_233">Associated Cement Limited [209 (236) ELT 240 (Kar)
                              64                 E/526,1101/2008




"5. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and
on perusal of the agreement dated 14-3-1999 entered into
between the assessee and M/s. Tata Electric Company we
have no hesitation to hold that the transaction thereunder
between them was an absolute sale of the power unit for a
valid sale consideration of Rs. 90 crores and that the entire
unit came to be handed over to the purchaser and since
then the purchaser has been running the power unit at the
same premises of the assessee by taking the premises in
which the power unit was installed on long term lease and
generating the power. Therefore, it is clear that the said
purchaser, after purchasing the power unit from the
assessee, has been enjoying the same as its absolute
owner and has been supplying to the assessee the power
generated from the said power unit on payment basis. This
being so it is quite evident that the assessee-company lost
its ownership and also control over the said power unit by
selling it to the said purchaser for valid consideration and
by giving to the purchaser on long term lease the premises
in which the said unit is installed so as to enable the
purchaser to run the unit at the same premises of the
assessee as its absolute owner, generate power and sell
the power so generated to the assessee-company itself.
</p>
<p id="p_234">6. Therefore, in our considered view though there had
been no physical removal of power unit the above
transactions between the assessee-company and M/s. Tata
Electric Company certainly amount to nothing short of
physical removal of the power unit of the assessee in
respect whereof MODVAT credit was availed by the
assessee so as to attract the penal provisions of the said
Act and the Rules. The said transactions of sale of power
unit and simultaneous lease of premises are wisely
resorted to by the assessee as a device to avoid the tax
liability on it on the ground that the power unit was not
physically removed from the premises of the assessee.
Therefore, we are of the considered opinion that the
Tribunal without application of mind and without proper
                                 65              E/526,1101/2008




appreciation of the said transactions in the light of the
relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_56">Central Excise Act</a> and the Rules
has allowed the appeal of the assessee-company and set
aside the Order-in-Original passed by the Commissioner of
Central Excise, Belgaum. In the circumstances, we answer
the above question of law in the 'negative' and against the
assessee."
</p>
<p id="p_235">5.5.7 Appellants have relied upon various decisions as
stated at para 4.2 (i), supra to argue that ownership of the
capital goods is not relevant for determining the eligibility
to CENVAT Credit. We have no dispute with the said
preposition. However the issue under consideration is not
vis a vis the ownership, but one of receipt and usage.
When we hold that the said Capital Goods were not
received in the manufactory of the manufacturer nor used
by him for the manufacture of finished goods, the issue of
ownership is irrelevant. CENVAT credit in present case is
sought to be denied on account of non receipt of the goods
within the factory premises and their usage in the process
of production of the said goods. In case of KCP Ltd. [2013
(295) ELT 353 (SC)} Hon'ble Apex Court held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_236">24.     ......... Thus, the appellant did not use the purchased
machinery in its premises or in its factory and therefore,
necessary condition incorporated in the Rules for availing
credit of the MODVAT had not been complied with. To avail
the MODVAT credit, the input on which excise duty is paid
must be used in the manufacture of the final product in the
factory of the assessee. ....."
</p>
<p id="p_237">5.5.8        We also do not find merits in the submissions
of the appellant that subsequently 2nd Party and Appellants
were merged with effect from 1.02.2007. It is now settled
law that admissibility of CENVAT Credit is to be determined
at the time when the Capital Goods were received by the
appellant and subsequent events and restructuring or
changes in law cannot change the admissibility of credit. In
case Spenta International [2007 (216) ELT 9Tri-LB)] it has
been held
                                66                  E/526,1101/2008




"7. In the case of <a href="/doc/472617/" id="a_57">Binani Cement Ltd. v. CCE</a>, 2002 (143)
E.L.T. 577, the Tribunal held that vested right of taking
credit arises on the date of receipt of the goods and that
the date of installation of capital goods being only a
deferred date of taking credit, for administrative reasons,
credit is eligible on the date of receipt of the goods. <a href="/doc/322870/" id="a_58">In CCE
v. Sengunthar Spinning Mills</a>, 1998 (99) E.L.T. 409, it was
held that the availability of Modvat credit on capital goods
has to be determined at the time of receipt of capital
goods in the factory and if no modvat credit was available
at   that   time,   the   question   of   subsequently    making
available any Modvat credit would not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_238">8. The recent decision of the Tribunal in <a href="/doc/37398/" id="a_59">CCE            v. Precot
Mills Ltd</a>., 2007 (212) E.L.T. 483 follows the Surya Roshni
decision and the Grasim Industries decision as well as the
Sengunthar decision, to hold that the relevant date for
determination of availability of Modvat credit is the date of
receipt of capital goods in the factory and if on that date
no credit was available, it cannot be allowed subsequently.
It was held that when the machinery in respect of which
the capital goods had been taken, were not used for
manufacture of dutiable goods on the date of receipt in the
factory, capital goods credit is not available on such
machinery.
</p>
<p id="p_239">9. The ACE Timez decision reported in 2004 (170) E.L.T.
371, which takes a contrary view from those set out
above, considers Rules 4(2)(a) &amp; (b) of the Cenvat Credit
Rules, 2002 and holds that these rules do not provide for
denial of credit on the ground that it is not taken in the
same financial year in which capital goods were received,
and only restricts credit to 50% of the duty paid, in the
financial year of receipt of capital goods, and do not
provide for lapsing of credit if the balance 50% is not
taken in the same financial year in which the capital goods
were received. The above judgment does not consider Rule
6(4) of the Cenvat Credit Rules, which clearly stipulates
that no credit shall be allowed on capital goods used
                                67                E/526,1101/2008




exclusively in the manufacture of exempted goods. In
other words, the ACE Timez decision discusses the manner
in which credit to be availed as per Rule 4(2)(a) &amp; (b) and
does not discuss eligibility in terms of Rule 6(4). Moreover,
the ACE Timez decision does not consider the Tribunal's
earlier decisions in Surya Roshni and Grasim Industries.
</p>
<p id="p_240">10. In the light of the above discussion, we answer the
reference by holding that Cenvat credit eligibility is to be
determined with reference to the dutiability of the final
product on the date of receipt of capital goods."
</p>
<p id="p_241">5.5.6 Further when the capital goods are capitalized in the
account books of 2nd Party, then by adopting this device
Appellants could not have claimed the credit in respect of
the same goods in view of Rule 4(4) of the CENVAT Credit
Rules, 2004.
</p>
<p id="p_242">5.5.7        Further appellants have submitted that credit
of Rs 1,70, 55,003/- has been denied to them in respect of
the Capital Goods received in their premises after the
merger of Appellants and 2nd Party with effect from
01.02.2007. We find force in the arguments of the
appellant that after merger both the entities have become
one and the credit cannot be denied on the ground that
they were distinct earlier at time of placement of order.
After merger the goods received were received by the
appellants only in their premises and used by them. Hence
we have to set aside the order dated 21.08.208 and
remand     the    matter      back   to   Commissioner      for
determination of CENVAT Credit to be disallowed after
merger of the two entities.

</p>
<p id="p_244">5.6.1        The next issue is with regards the admissibility
of credit in respect of supporting structures used for

handling system, system and other miscellaneous goods.
</p>
<p id="p_245">5.6.2 We are in agreement with the submissions made by
the appellant that decision of the larger bench of Tribunal
in case of Vandana Global Ltd [2010 (253) ELT 440 (Tri-
LB)] has been set aside by the Hon'ble Chhattisgarh High
Court as reported at [2018 (16) GSTL 462 (Chhattisgarh)].
Similar view has been expressed by the Gujarat High Court
in the case Mundra Port [2015 (39) STR 726 (Guj)].
However since the credit has been sought to be denied for
the reason of that the goods were not received by the
appellants and were used by them for the process of
production of finished goods we do not dwell into this issue
much.
</p>
<p id="p_246">5.6.3 Similarly   with   regards   to    credit    in   respect     of
miscellaneous goods classified by the supplier under
Chapter 84, relying on the decision of Apex Court in case
of Madras Cement [2010 (254 0 ELT 3 (SC)] we hold that
the credit would not be admissible without identification of
goods. However this question to becomes irrelevant as the
issue has been decided on the fact that these goods were
not received and used by the appellants for the process of
production of finished goods.
</p>
<p id="p_247">5.7.3    Since we are not adjudicating the case in relation to
excisablity of the thermal power plant we do not dwell into
submissions made by both the sides on this issue and
various case laws relied upon by the revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_248">5.7.4 However in the remand proceedings in respect of the
goods received after the date of effect of merger of two
units, Commissioner should consider these issues afresh

merger.

"08.01      The noticee No 1, has contended that the
credit on some of the items were taken as in April 205
based on invoices which showed the Noticee No as
consignee and capital goods were received and used in
their factory. Therefore it cannot be alleged that the
Noticee No 1, has suppressed the facts with intent to
evade payment of duty and hence the proposal to deny the
credit for the period beyond one year prior to show cause
notice is not sustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_251">"08.02.     I do not find merits in the argument of the
Noticee No.1.     After introduction of 'self assessment
scheme' in Central Excise, there is no need to submit
invoices pertaining to clearance of final products and
purchase of capital goods, inputs. No description of goods
purchased by the assessee is reflected in the prescribed
ER1 returns.    Only the figures of duty paid and Cenvat
credit taken are reflected in the returns. The responsibility
of assessing the correct duty liability on the clearance of
final products and taking of credit on eligible goods lies
only with the assessee.      It is specifically provided in
Rule 9 Cenvat Credit Rules 2004 that the assessee
should take reasonable steps to take eligible credit
with proper documents. The contention of Noticee No.1
is that "the notices were under the bona fide belief that the
items in question were covered under the definition of
capital goods since they have been used in the factory of
the notice even though they were not the owners of the
                                       70                   E/526,1101/2008




    capital goods so long as they satisfy the definition of
    capital goods and hence they cannot be alleged that they
    suppressed the facts with intent to evade duty". It is not
    sufficient to satisfy the definition of capital goods alone
    which gives the right of availing credit on ineligible credit
    to the assessee but they should satisfy other equally
    binding, mandatory and substantial conditions of the
    provisions of Rules."
</p>
<p id="p_252">    Therefrom he quotes as series of case laws and by
    applying the ratio decidendi of the said decisions he holds
    "that extended period could very well be invoked in this
    case in as much as the Noticee No 1, has failed to take
    reasonable     steps     before    taking   eligible    credit     as
    responsibility of assessing the correct duty liability on the
    clearance of final products and taking of Cenvat credit on
    eligible capital goods lies only with the assessee.":

    5.8.2 We do not any reason to differ with the findings of
    the Commissioner. We would like to add the fact that piece
    of land has been leased out to 2nd Party and Thermal
    Power Plant was being erected there by the 2nd Party on
    their own account to commercially exploit the same was
    never brought to the knowledge of the department. These
                                   71                  E/526,1101/2008




facts came to knowledge            of department       only     when
Appellant came for revision of the ground plan on
16.10.2006. Further the invoices in this case against which
the credit has been taken show them as consignee,
whereas the goods were actually never destined to them.
It was nothing but a well planned documentation to
hoodwink the department for availing the inadmissible
credit. The idea was that the same goods would be
capitalized in the book of accounts of 2nd Party and the
CENVAT credit claimed by them. Just on sample basis one
of the invoices is reproduced below which show the
quantum of layering in built therein to hide the real
transaction.
</p>
<p id="p_255">      The first invoice is issued showing consignee as "M/s
       Indo Rama Synthetics Ltd, A-31 MIDC Industrial
       Area    Butibori   Nagpur,        A/c    M/s   Indo    Rama
       Petrochemicals     Ltd.,    A/c    M/s    Indure   Pvt    Ltd
       Sahibabad, A/c M/s Chethar Vessels Pvt Ltd Trichy.";
       and

      The second invoice is showing consignee as "M/s
       Indo Rama Synthetics (I) Ltd. A-31 MIDC Industrial
       Area Butibori Nagpur Maharashtra, A/c M/s Indo
       Rama Petrochemicals Ltd." and buyer is shown as
       "M/s Indure Pvt Ltd, M/s Indo Rama Synthetics (I)
       Ltd. A-31 MIDC Industrial Area Butibori Nagpur
       Maharashtra."
</p>
<p id="p_256">The invoice itself speaks volume as to why the identity of
actual purchaser and user of the said goods have been
layered so as to make identification difficult.</p><pre id="pre_15"> 72   E/526,1101/2008

duty/ take inadmissible credit is well established against
the appellants.

<p id="p_258">5.8.4        Since we find that appellants have availed the
inadmissible      credit    by     suppressing the         relevant      and
complete information from the department we also uphold
the penalties imposed under Rule 15 of CENVAT Credit
Rules, 2004 read with <a href="/doc/92590795/" id="a_64">Section 11AC</a> of Central Excise Act,

sustained.
