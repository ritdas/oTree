                   W.P.(C).NO.10791 OF 2017 (Y)
                      -----------------------------------
              Dated this the 29th day of March, 2017

                            J U D G M E N T
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      The petitioner has approached this Court challenging Ext.P4

consent to operate that has been issued in favour of the 6th respondent,

for the purposes of operating a hot mix plant.             Although various

contentions are raised in the writ petition, in its challenge against Ext.P4

consent granted to the 6th respondent, I find that, against Ext.P4

consent, the petitioner has an effective alternate remedy, by way of an

appeal, before the Appellate Authority under the Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>. Thus, without prejudice to the right of the

petitioner to move the Appellate authority under the Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, the writ petition, in its challenge against Ext.P4

consent order, is dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      Taking note of the apprehension of the learned senior counsel for

the petitioner that the Appellate authority may take time to consider the

appeal, it is made clear that, if the petitioner prefers an appeal against

Ext.P4 consent order, before the Appellate authority, within a period of

ten days from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment, the

Appellate authority shall consider the appeal, on merits, and pass orders

thereon, within a period of one month from the date of receipt of receipt

of the appeal. The petitioner shall also serve a copy of the writ petition

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C).No.10791/2017              2</span>




together with a copy of this judgment, before the Appellate authority, for

further action.
