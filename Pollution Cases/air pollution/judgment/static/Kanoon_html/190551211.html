</pre>
<p id="p_1">    1            This application arises out of Civil action initiated by

    Applicant-Lokmangal Sanstha. Originally, Lokmangal Sanstha,

    filed Civil suit bearing Regular Civil Suit No.55/2003 against the

    Respondents in the Court of Civil Judge (J.D.), Chamorshi.

    Because the suit involves substantial civil dispute pertaining to

    environmental issues and in view of jurisdictional bar under

    <a href="/doc/115054998/" id="a_1">Section 29(2)</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, the suit

    was transferred to this Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">(J) Application No.22/2013 (WZ)                                        2</span>
     2            The suit filed in the Civil Court was for declaration that

    permission dated June 29th, 2001 granted in favour of

    Respondent Nos.1 and 4 is void and therefore, construction of

    Sai Rice Mill in the proximity of Lokmangal Sanstha is illegal and

    void-ab-initio. In addition, Applicant Lokmangal Sanstha also

    prayed for permanent prohibitory injunction restraining the said

    Respondents from operating Sai Rice Mill unit or alternatively to

    take preventive measures to stop the nuisance caused by the air

    and noise pollution created due to running of the Rice Mill.


    3            According to Applicant-Lokmangal Sanstha, it is a

    registered institution dedicated to upliftment of women in

    general and for their financial empowerment in particular. The

    Applicant runs a Training Institute which caters vocational

    programmes such as Typing skills, sewing, bamboo handicrafts,

    and preparation of herbal medicines, literacy classes, so on and

    so forth. The training institute is being run on land bearing old

    Survey No.396/2 and 396/3 (now S.No.8 and 9) which were

    originally owned by one Dilasagram Society. The latter gave that

    land on lease to Applicant Lokmangal Sanstha for a period of 30

    years in or about 1997. Applicant Lokmangal Sanstha thereafter

    constructed building for the training institute as well as staff

    quarters on the said land. There is a big well of about 20 ft.

    diameter in the campus of institute for drawing potable water to

    be used by the inmates of the institute and staff members.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">(J) Application No.22/2013 (WZ)                                          3</span>
     4            It is the case of Applicant Lokmangal Sanstha that the

    Respondents Nos.1 to 4 made certain encroachment over

    agricultural lands bearing S.No.6 and 7 and have constructed

    Sai Rice Mill at a short distance of about 10 ft from the

    residential quarters. So also, the construction of Rice Mill is in

    the close proximity of the premises of vocational classes of the

    training institute. The construction permission was granted by

    Respondent No.2 Gram Panchyat without calling of objections

    and without following the relevant Rules. The Rice Mill is being

    run constantly for 24 hours. The constant pounding sound and

    banging sound emanating from the Rice Mill causes serious

    sound pollution, which creates disturbance in the work of the

    training institute. The husk emanating from the Rice Mill fly

    helter-skelter. It floats in the nearby area and ultimately gets

    deposited in the kitchen and other parts of the institution as well

    as into the well which provides drinking water to the in-mates.

    The frequent flow of solid particles of chaff/husk also causes

    health hazard to the trainees, staff members, and others who are

    required to be in the premises of Applicant-Lokmangal Sanstha.

    The institute of Applicant-Lokmangal Sanstha is a social welfare

    organization, situated at village Ghot, Tq. Chamorshi, District

    Gadchiroli.

    It appears that original Respondent No.4 died during pendency




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">(J) Application No.22/2013 (WZ)                                      4</span>
     of the suit. His Legal Representatives were brought on record as

    Respondent No.4(a) to 4(e).
</p>
<p id="p_4">
    6            Respondent No.1 filed W.S./reply-Affidavit and resisted

    the Application. He denied all the material averments made by

    Applicant Lokmangal Sanstha.                     He contended that the

    application is barred by limitation and as such, this Tribunal

    should not entertain the same. He denied the allegation that the

    Rice Mill is constructed on encroached portion land no.6 and 7.

    He also disputed that Lokmangal Sanstha has been given

    agricultural land bearing Old S.no.396/2 and 396/3 (now S.No.8

    and 9) by Dilasgram Society on lease for a period of 30 years. He

    flatly denied that unit of the Rice Mill causes air pollution and

    sound        pollution,       particularly,   endangering   the   rights   of

    Applicant Lokmangal Sanstha.                  He emphatically denied that

    Applicant Lokmangal Sanstha has raised any substantial

    environmental dispute by way of filing the present Application.


    7            According to contesting Respondents, inside the Rice

    Mill, pipes are fixed for emitting of the husk which is collected

    near inner wall of the Rice Mill, within its premises. The husk is

    useful for power generation plant as a fuel and hence it is

    immediately disposed of.              There is no possibility that husk

    emitting from the Rice Mill would fly in the air, and will get

    deposited in the premises of Applicant Lokmangal Sanstha.

    There is no harsh sound created due to running of the Rice Mill

    and therefore, there is no substance in the allegation that there

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">(J) Application No.22/2013 (WZ)                                                5</span>
     is noise pollution because due to running of the Rice Mill.

    According to the contesting Respondents, the Rice Mill is not

    manufacturing unit as such, but it is only processing unit. In

    this processing, grains of the rice are mechanically separated

    from paddy and thereafter are polished. The Polishing work is

    done mainly by rubber rolls and separators are used for

    segregating husk from polished rice.          No heavy machinery or

    furnace is used in the Rice Mill. The material collected while

    polishing the rice is subsequently used for extraction of edible

    oil, popularly known as "Rice Bran Oil". Thus, it is contended

    that there is no waste material left out nor any Pollution is

    caused by the Rice Mill. In nutshell, it is the case of Respondents

    that Rice Mill does not cause any actionable nuisance or

    environmental harm for which the Applicant Lokmangal Sanstha

    can ventilate grievances through the present Application. Hence,

    the Respondents sought dismissal of the Application.


    8            We have heard Learned Counsel for the contesting

    parties and MPCB. Though MPCB has not separately contested

    the matter, yet, it being regulatory and monitoring agency, we

    had directed the MPCB to place on record the status report of

    juxtaposition.           That Report is filed by the MPCB.   We have

    perused the relevant documents including depositions recorded

    in the Trial Court.

<p id="p_7">For reasons discussed hereinafter, we have recorded our findings

in the last but one paragraph of the judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
10               Before we proceed to deal with the environmental issues,

arising out of the installation of the Rice Mill, let it be noted that

there are certain guide-lines issued by the Central Pollution Control

Board (CPCB) for installation of such industries. These guide-lines

are required to be followed by the State Pollution Control Board

while granting Consent to Rice Mills. The handling, storage and

transport of the rice husk are the subject matter of mandatory

guidelines issued by the CPCB which needs to be implemented

through           the       consent   mechanism.    One    of   the   main

recommendations is that there shall be a close enclosure for

blowing of rice husk. It is mill type enclosure which shall be closed

from all the sides and have an access for loading and handling of

the rice husk. Obviously, no activity regarding blowing and storage

of rice husk shall be carried out, outside the said enclosure.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">(J) Application No.22/2013 (WZ)                                           7</span>
 11               The important points in these guidelines are mentioned

here. Rice husk is the largest byproduct of Rice Milling Industry

which amounts to 22-24 per cent of the total paddy. The unit needs

to handle large quantity of husk and store them within the unit

premises till husk is used or sold. During the Milling of the paddy,

rice husk is mechanically separated out in the de-husker machine

and husk is conveyed to the storage yard through the husk

conveyance system. This conveyance system varies based on the

size of the Rice Mill. CPCB has categorized the rice mills with the

capacity less than three tons per hour as small mills, 3 to 15 tons

per hour capacity as Medium and greater than 15 tons per capacity

at large. In most of the small mills, husk from the de-husker is

simple blown to the storage yard with the help of blowers.          In

Medium and large mills, the husk is extracted from the de-husking

machines and taken through the conveyance system to the cyclone

where fine dust is separated out. The environmental issues in the

Rice Mills are mainly related to the Management of the rice husk

and the noise pollution due to the operation of the mechanical

equipment. Central Pollution Control Board has already published

guide-lines for: i. Siting of rice Sheller's/Mills, ii. Handling and

storage of rice husk, iii. Handling storage and disposal of husk

generated in boiler using rice husk as fuel in 2012.


The Rice Mills employ mechanical equipment for cleaning and

milling activities for de-husking of the paddy. These mechanical

equipments can cause significant noise pollution, particularly in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">(J) Application No.22/2013 (WZ)                                      8</span>
 Rural site CPCB has already carried out study and following noise

Pollution prevention measures have been recommended. Various

generating sources in Rice Mill, Rotary, vibratory screen bucket,

elevator, screw conveyors and grinders, motors etc. need to be

provided with adequate noise prevention control measures

including following :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">        1)       Provide vibration dampening pads to prevent noise

                 generated due to vibration.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">        2)       To provide rigid enclosure for Rotting/vibrating screen.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">        3)       All transfer points to be covered with rigid enclosures.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_9">These guide-lines are quite elaborate and the chapter 10 proposes

the siting criteria for the rice mills which should be considered by

the State Pollution Control Board while granting consent to

establish for the new Rice Mills. This section also gives guide-lines

for handling storage and transport of the rice husk which shall be

mandated by SPCB through the consent mechanism. One of the

important recommendation is unit shall be mandated to provide a

close on enclosure for blowing and storage of rice husk. This mill

type enclosure shall be closed from all the sites and have an access

for loading and handling of the rice husk. No activity regarding

blowing and storage of rice husk shall be carried out, outside the

said enclosure.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">(J) Application No.22/2013 (WZ)                                             9</span>
 12               The grains of rice are required to be separated from the

chaff by mechanical process. The Small Scale Industrial Unit needs

to handle large quantity of husk and store the same within the close

premises till it is sold away or otherwise disposed of in appropriate

manner. During the milling of the paddy, rice husk is separated

out in de-husker machine and husk is conveyed to the storage yard

through the husk conveyor system. The conveyor system varies as

per size of the Rice Mill. In most of the small Rice Mills, simple

blower system is used which throws the husk to the storage yard

with the help of wind blowers. The noise pollution is required to be

minimized with the help of mechanical equipment. Any chance of

mixing of the husk with water is likely to cause foul small.


13               Considering the above background, it is important to

note that the Training institute of the Applicant (Lokmangal

Sanstha) was already being run much prior to installation of the

Rice Mill of the Respondent Nos.1 and 4(a) to (e). We are not much

concerned with the issue of encroachment over S.nos.6 and 7. The

fact remains that they started the Rice Mill in the premises of said

agricultural land somewhere in or about 2001-02. The training

institute of Applicant (Lokmangal Sanstha) was being run about 10

years prior to installation of the Rice Mill. It appears that consent

to establish the Rice Mill was issued on 8-12-2003 (Ex.D/1) by the

MPCB. The MPCB granted consent till end of December 2005. One

of the conditions imposed on the Respondent Nos.1 and 4 was that

they shall take adequate measures for control of air pollution so as

Parapilly in support of the Application. She is a Social Worker. She

has categorically stated that the Rice Mill emits husk which causes

water pollution due to its falling in the adjoining well of the Training

institute.         Her version further shows that due to continuous

running of the Rice Mill, the Training institute suffers from noise

pollution. The husk blows out of the Industrial unit and causes

health hazard to the staff members and inmates of the Training

institute.        She states that running of the Rice Mill has causes

nuisance to the Training institute. The Learned Counsel for the

Respondent Nos.1 and 4 has pointed out, from cross-examination

of Miss A.P. Parapilly, that in village Ghot, there are two other Rice

Mills in the residential locality. It is also pointed out that she does

not know location of place where the Rice bran falls.         She also

admits that she has no knowledge whether the Rice bran is used

for manufacturing of edible oil.       She does not know where the

polished rice falls from the out-let of the Rice Mill.           These

admissions of Miss A.P. Paralpilly are not sufficient to dislodge her

version. Nothing of much importance could be gathered from her

cross-examination so as to disbelieve her version. One cannot be

oblivious of the fact that she has no personal interest in the matter.

She is more interested in the social work and benefit of the welfare

activities of the Training institute. She has no business rivalry

 against the Respondent Nos.1 and 4.              It is true, however, that

solitary statement of Dr. Siddheshwar Naringe is not sufficient to

establish the fact that the rice chaff/husk had triggered any

epidemic disease in the near-by area.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
15               We have perused the photographs filed along with the

Application. It is an admitted fact that the Rice Mill is situated

hardly at a distance of 10 ft. from the rear wall of the Training

institute run by Applicant Lokmangal Sanstha. This fact is clearly

seen from photograph No.2 (D-11). It appears that although the

Respondent Nos.1 and 4 have erected a middle wall between the

Rice Mill and the Training institute, yet, that wall is only a Kachcha

wall without foundation. It is but natural that the said wall may

collapse during rainy season and the husk will be exposed to the

rain water.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
16               That the contesting Respondents have not entered the

witness box.            From the record, it can be gathered that on 24 th

October 2013, the authorities of MPCB visited the site of the Rice

Mill and the Training institute as per directions of this Tribunal.

We had called upon the Regional Officer, Chandrapur to give the

status Report. The status Report dated 28th October 2013 reveals

following information:
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">        A)       The Sai Rice Mill is located very close to the residential

        that, before starting the mill the same will be repaired and
        open portion between roof and wall will be plugged.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">        E)       About 5 to 6 Ton of rice husk was found stored outside
        the rice husk shed. The Proprietor Shri Sanjay Waddetiwar

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">(J) Application No.22/2013 (WZ)                                                   13</span>
<p id="p_15"> 17               Perusal of the above report clearly indicates that the rice

husk was found stored outside of the rice husk shed, though the

Rice Mill was not in operation. So, it cannot be believed that when

the Rice Mill is in operation, the husk totally falls within the

enclosed area of the rice processing unit. It was also noticed that

the roof of the rice husk storage shed was damaged. The proprietor

of the Rice Mill informed the authority that due to heavy rains, the

roof was damaged. Still, however, in spite of fact that the rainy

season had been over at least 3-4 months back of the said visit, no

steps were taken to repair the roof. The fact that the Rice Mill was

not being operated, did not give any opportunity to examine the

issue of noise pollution.               The report is silent about the noise

abatement measures implemented by the industry. We are

surprised to see as to how same Sub Regional Officer of the MPCB

Chandrapur observed that the normal noise level was within

permissible units.                It is nobody's case that even for temporary

purpose the Rice Mill was made functional during the short

duration of the said limits dated 24th October 2013. Another status

Report dated 2nd December 2013 submitted by the Sub Regional

Officer, MPCB Chandrapur is also dis-satisfactory.                The Report

shows that the Rice Mill was not in operation during the visit dated

22nd October 2013. The Report further shows that the old rice husk

was under process of lifting. The representative of the Rice Mill

(Shri Sanjay Waddetiwar) verbally informed that the maintenance

of all the machinery including oil and greasing work was conducted.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">(J) Application No.22/2013 (WZ)                                           14</span>
 We do not find whether the MPCB verified correctness of such

information.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
18               It is difficult to place implicit reliance of such top-sided

status Report submitted by the MPCB.                 The Learned Counsel

appearing for the Respondent Nos.1 and 4 submitted that rice husk

is valuable by-product of the Rice Mill and immediately sold away

to bran oil manufactures. He placed reliance on some payment

receipts (D-14 to D-29). These payment receipts are for the period

from 13-12-2011 to 1-1-2012.              So also, these receipts do not

indicate that the entire stock of the husk produce from the Rice Mill

is sold to the Rice Bran Oil Manufacturer.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
19               All said and done, it cannot be overlooked that due to

proximity of the premises of the Rice Mill, there is more possibility

that the husk separated from the grains after process of the paddy

may flow away towards premises of the training institute run by the

Applicant. The running of the Rice Mill causes constant pounding

sound which also amounts to nuisance. Thus, the Applicant has

made out a case of actionable nuisance. The MPCB has not has so

far granted consent to operate the Rice Mill. Consequently, we find

it necessary to ensure that without appropriate measures taken for

arresting the air and noise pollution, the consent to operate may

not be renewed.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
20               Coming to the question of limitation, it may be noted that

the application is transferred to this Tribunal and was originally a

suit filed in the Civil Court. The suit was based on the cause of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">(J) Application No.22/2013 (WZ)                                           15</span>
 action which was stated in the Notice issued U/s. 80 of Code of

Civil Procedure.              Moreover, running of the Rice Mill continued

during the relevant period. The nuisance gave recurring cause of

action. The suit was not barred by limitation. The continuity of

the nuisance and air pollution as well as noise pollution amounts

to continuity of cause of action. Hence, the suit cannot be deemed

as barred by limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
21               In view of the foregoing discussion, we record our

findings on the issues mentioned earlier as follows: Issue No.1 : No,

Issue No.2 : Yes, and Issue No.3 : Yes.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
22               In the result, the application is partly allowed with costs

of Rs.25,000/- (Rs. Twenty five thousand only) each by the

Respondent Nos. 1 and 4 to the Applicant Lokmangal Sanstha

within period of four (4) weeks.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">23               The Respondent Nos. 1 and 4(a) to 4(e) (Legal</span>

Representatives              of   deceased   Respondent   No.4)   shall   pay

compensation of Rs.50,000/- (Rs. Fifty Thousand only) to Applicant

Lokmangal Sanstha for causing noise pollution and air pollution

during the period for which the Rice Mill was being operated, the

amount which has been arrived at, has been founded on general

assessment, having regard to the fact that the Rice Mill is a small

unit and is a seasonal industry.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
24               We direct that the MPCB shall not grant renewal of

consent to operate the Rice Mill run by the Respondent Nos. 1 and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">(J) Application No.22/2013 (WZ)                                            16</span>
 4(a) to (e) unless it is duly satisfied that adequate measures are

taken by them to install modern equipment in order to control the

noise pollution by way of proper insulation of the unit and to ensure

that the chaff/husk will not flow outside the unit's premises. The

Rice Mill shall install a conveyance system or conveyor belt to carry

the chaff/husk to adequately covered cellar/storage from which it

can be carried out for sell/disposal.        Unless such facilities are

adequately provided, the application for renewal of grant for

consent to operate shall not be processed by the MPCB. In case the

Rice Mill is found running without consent to operate or any breach

of conditions envisaged in the consent to operate is noted, action

under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_2">Section 31-A</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control Pollution) Act</a>

1981 may be taken by the MPCB against Proprietor.




</p><p id="p_23">                 The Respondent Nos.1 and 4 shall bear their own costs.


The Application is accordingly disposed of.
