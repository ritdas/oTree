<p id="p_1">           (PER : HONOURABLE DR.JUSTICE A. P. THAKER)
</p><p id="p_2">1.     The appellant - original petitioner has taken out present

Letters Patent Appeal under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent inter

alia assailing the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge

dated 13.07.2018 passed in Special Civil Application No. 2930 of

2014 whereby the learned Single Judge has dismissed the said

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2.     The facts briefly stated are as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_5">2.1    The appellant - original petitioner is carrying business in

Ahkleshwar GIDC on Plot No.4767 in producing liquid bromine in the

said factory. It is also the case of the appellant that the unit of the

          C/LPA/1216/2018                                 ORDER



petitioner is zero discharge unit and not discharging any sort of

contaminated water. It is contended that considering the practice of

respondent, he has become the member of respondent No. 3 -

Narmada Clean Tech Limited (for short "NCTL") in order to start a

unit in Ankleshwar GIDC. It is contended that the said NCTL is a

registered company under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 1956 and in which

the share of GIDC is to be extent of 51% and remaining 49% shares

of the company are offered to private companies located in

Ankleshwar, Panoli and Jhagadiya industrial establishment. It is also

contended that Article of Association of the NCTL are also prescribed

that 21 Directors, out of which 12 are to be appointed by the GIDC

and remaining 9 are to be appointed from the industries.

2.2   It is also the case of the appellant that though the NCTL has

no authority of law and source of power, the office bearers thereof

have collected the sample in arbitrary manner from the appellant's

company and sent it to the private laboratory and, thereafter,

imposed cost on the appellant and, thus, the NCTL is using the

powers of GPCB (Gujarat Pollution Control Board) and according to

the appellant, the exercise of powers by NCTL are against the

provisions of law. It is contended by the appellant that the NCTL is

shield used by major industries to prevent GPCB from exercising its

jurisdiction. It is contended that the issue involved in the matter is

whether NCTL has jurisdiction, source of power to collect sample,

get it tested and inflicting of punishment and acting as adjudicating

authority.

2.3     It is further the case of the appellant that by way of contract

</pre><p id="p_7">or agreement, the jurisdiction cannot be conferred if it is not

provided by the statute and accordingly, even if it is believed that

the appellant has signed the agreement with NCTL, that could not

give any jurisdiction to the NCTL to impose cost or act as

adjudicating authority.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
2.4     On all these grounds, the appellant has filed the aforesaid

Special Civil Application which, after hearing both the sides, came to

be dismissed by the learned Single Judge on the following grounds.


</p><p id="p_9">(i)     The petitioner, appellant herein was caught for the purpose of

violation of norms and policy which has been undisputedly

formulated twice which are not under challenged.

</p><p id="p_10">(ii)    The NCTL has been created with aid and assistance of the

order passed in Public Interest Litigation by this Court.

</p><p id="p_11">(iii)   The petitioner became member of the NCTL in the year 2008

pursuant to the agreement. The petitioner is already party to

specific clause of monitoring and there is arbitration clause in

agreement of year 2008. That the existence of NCTL was recognized

by this Court and allowed extension of time to take appropriate

measures. On that count, the petition is not entertained. That, the

material circumstances about conduct of the petitioner himself has

not been projected by him and there appears to be an attempt to

suppress the material facts from the Court.

No.3 is acting without the authority of law is not at all possible to be

existence of respondent No.3 appears to be in larger interest of

public at large.

</p><p id="p_14">(v)    That special mechanism of adjudicating machinery has been

setup.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
2.5    The aforesaid observations of the learned Single Judge has

been assailed in the present appeal submitting that the learned

Single Judge has not decided the question as to whether NCTL has

any authority under the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>. That it has also not taken

into consideration that even the NCTL was given closure by the

GPCB in year 2015. It is contended that the action on the part of

the NCTL is without jurisdiction. It is contended that the arbitrator

has no authority to restrain the respondent No.3 from discharging

function of GPCB. It is also contended that the learned Single Judge

has committed error on forming an opinion on the basis of some

orders passed in Public Interest Litigation. It is contended that

recognition of existence of a company would not clothe the said

company with power to collect samples, inflict penalty and establish

it as adjudicating authority.

2.6      It is contended that the establishment of NCTL itself is

</pre><p id="p_17">contrary to law and it has no power whatsoever under the Air and

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a> and, therefore, the action on the part of NCTL is without

law. As such, the petitioner has preferred the main petition seeking

reliefs referred to therein. According to it, the impugned judgment

and order of the learned Single Judge is liable to be quashed and set

aside.

submitted the same facts which are narrated in the memo of appeal

and has submitted that without any authority of law, respondent

No.3 is carrying out the work of collecting samples and is exercising

the power of adjudicating authority which is against the law. While

referring to the documentary evidence, he has submitted that the

circumstances, which have been referred to above by the learned

Single Judge, are not legally sustainable. He has submitted that

even if it is believed that the appellant has signed the agreement

with the NCTL, even in that case, the NCTL cannot adjudicate and it

cannot exercise power of adjudication. He has submitted that the

arbitration clause thereof cannot be pressed into service when

not sustainable in the eyes of law.

4.1   While    referring       to   the   documentary   evidence       and      the

impugned judgment and order of the learned Single Judge, learned

advocate for the appellant has submitted that the authority lies with

the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to collect the sample and to pass

necessary order, but NCTL has no such power. He has submitted

that the NCTL is exercising power of adjudicating authority which

cannot be sustainable in the eyes of law. He has submitted that the

appellant has specifically taken the contention that he does not

admit any of the averments of affidavit-in-reply filed by respondent

No3 and, therefore, the pleading of respondent No.3 ought not to

have been believed by the learned Single Judge. While referring to

the agreement, learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that

the agreement does not refer to any policy or power whereby it

could be specifically shown that petitioner has specifically agreed to

collect the water samples, its testing, consent to accept the report

and is consent to adjudicating authority. He has submitted that even

otherwise, by way of contract or agreement, a jurisdiction cannot be

conferred if it is not provided by the statute. He has submitted that

simply   because       there    are    two alleged incident       against the

petitioner, that fact itself cannot be termed him as violater. He has

submitted that there is serious dispute as to collection of samples

from the premises of the appellant, the learned Single Judge ought

not to have accepted the contention of respondent No.3 i.e. NCTL.

He has submitted that the arbitrator has no authority to restrain

respondent No.3 from discharging function of GPCB. On all these

grounds, he has urged to allow the appeal and quash and set aside

the impugned judgment and order of the learned Single Judge.


</p><p id="p_23">5.   Mr.R. D. Dave, learned advocate for respondent No.1 has

vehemently submitted that the impugned judgment and order of the

learned Single Judge is proper and it does not warrant any

interference. During the course of the arguments, learned advocate

for respondent No.1 has also produced the paper book which

contains lease deed executed dated 07.05.2004, broacher of NCTL

(respondent No.3), certificate of incorporation pursuant to change of

memo    of    respondent   No.3,    Government    Resolution         dated

14.03.2018 and consent and authorization order dated Nil August

2016 issued by GPCB to NCTL. While referring to all documentary

evidence, he has submitted that the NCTL has been established by

referring to the impugned judgment and order of the learned Single

Judge, he has submitted that the learned Single Judge has taken into

the impugned judgment and order. He has urged to dismiss the

present appeal.

and disposal system or any extension or addition
thereto, is established, or any steps for such
establishment have been taken or a new or altered
outlet is brought into use for the discharge of sewage
or a new discharge of sewage is made, the State Board
may serve on the person who has established or taken
steps to establish any industry, operation or process,
or any treatment and disposal system or any extension
or addition thereto, or using the outlet, or making the
discharge, as the case may be, a notice imposing any
such conditions as it might have imposed on an
application for its consent in respect of such
establishment, such outlet or discharge.

(6) Every State Board shall maintain a register
containing particulars of the conditions imposed under
this section and so much of the register as relates to
any outlet, or to any effluent, from any land or
premises shall be open to inspection at all reasonable
hours by any person interested in, or affected by such
outlet, land or premises, as the case may be, or by any
person authorised by him in this behalf and the
conditions so contained in such register shall be
conclusive proof that the consent was granted subject
to such conditions.]

(7) The consent referred to in sub-section (1) shall,
unless given or refused earlier, be deemed to have
been given unconditionally on the expiry of a period of
four months of the making of an application in this

under Section 6(2) of the Hazardous and Other Waste (Management

has been constituted as a monitoring committee for monitoring of

the effluent discharged by member units in the GIDC underground

drainage system. It also reveals from the agreement between the

appellant and NCTL, which is produced at page No.141 to 143, that

there is a clause regarding monitoring, which reads as under:-

NCTL and, therefore, in view of this agreement, it was incumbent

on the part of the appellant to initiate proceeding in accordance

with the provisions of Arbitration &amp; <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_18">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996.

discharge standard prescribed for waste water is maintained.

wholly and substantially controlled by the GIDC and essentially, it

was created for controlling large number of industrial units and with

a view to ensure that there discharge may not affect to the general
