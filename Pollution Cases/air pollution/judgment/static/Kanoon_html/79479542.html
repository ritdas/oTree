<p id="p_1">2   20-08-2015                  Heard the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                The petitioner made a complaint against running of

                 Chura Mills by the private respondents in a residential area before

                 the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (for short 'the Board')

                 (respondent no.2). The Board took notice of the said complaint

                 and issued notices to the private respondents to furnish his

                 response(s) and also caused a report to be submitted in this regard.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court CWJC No.13051 of 2014 (2) dt.20-08-2015</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          2/3</span>




             It is stated that the respondent-Board by a communication copy

             whereof has been enclosed along with the letter dated 14.07.2014

             (Annexure-4) directed the private respondents to stop running of

             the mill which was emitting air pollutant and causing

             objectionable noise. Such direction was issued after making an

             inquiry into the matter. The Block Development Officer,

             Bhagwanpur was also directed to ensure compliance of the order.

             The grievance of the petitioner is that in spite of the aforesaid

             order passed by the respondent-Board and the steps taken by the

             BDO the private respondent continues to operate the mill.

</p><p id="p_3">                              A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the

             State respondents stating therein that in the light of the direction

             issued by the respondent-Board steps were taken to stop running

             of the Chura mills in question. When the private respondent did

             not pay heed to those steps. The officer-in-charge of the concerned

             police station has also been informed to ensure compliance of the

             order of the respondent-Board.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                             It appears to this Court that the grievance of the

             petitioner in substratum is           non compliance of the order passed

             by the respondent-Board. The Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of

             Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (for short 'the Act') under which the Board

             has been created itself contemplates diverse penal provisions and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">        Patna High Court CWJC No.13051 of 2014 (2) dt.20-08-2015</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                 3/3</span>




                    procedure to ensure due compliance of the order passed by the

                    Board. Indisputably, the direction was issued to the private

                    respondents under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_2">section 31-A</a> of the Act. It appears on perusal

                    of <a href="/doc/172134797/" id="a_3">section 22-A</a> and other provisions under Chapter VI of the

                    Act that the Board can take steps for lodging of complaint in the

                    court and also take punitive action against the person who has

                    defied the order/direction issued by the respondent-Board.

</p><p id="p_5">                                     In these circumstances, this Court would permit the

                    petitioner to pursue the respondent-Board to take appropriate

                    steps/action as required under law against the private respondent

                    for his wilful defiance of the direction/order passed by the Board.

</p><p id="p_6">                                    The writ application is disposed.
