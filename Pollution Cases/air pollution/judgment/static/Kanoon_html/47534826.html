                                 JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                      Dated this the 9th day of June, 2020
S.Manikumar, CJ.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      Instant writ appeal is filed against judgment dated 26.11.2019

passed in W.P.(C) No.30789 of 2019, by which, writ court closed the writ

petition without granting any relief sought for by Thrissur Corporation,

represented by its Secretary, writ petitioner/appellant, but leaving liberty to

the Corporation to approach National Green Tribunal appropriately, either

by filing a statutory appeal or by impleading themselves in the original

application or by doing both.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      2. Short facts leading to the appeal are as under:
</p>
<p id="p_4">         The     Chairman,      Kerala       State   Pollution   Control   Board,

Thiruvananthapuram, (respondent No.2) has issued a direction under

<a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_1">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 dated 21.10.2019

(Exhibit-P1) imposing compensation of Rs.4,56,60,000/- to Thrissur

Corporation (appellant) for the period 22.11.2018 to 31.07.2019, for non-

compliance of Rule 22 of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. In

Exhibit-P1, the 2nd respondent has referred to various orders passed by the

National Green Tribunal, New Delhi, clarifying that apart from prosecution,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> W.A.No.2572 of 2019                    3</span>


statutory authorities under the Environmental (Protection) Act in exercise of

their incidental powers shall collect prescribed scale of compensation from

the polluters on the "polluter pay's principle". It was also noted that

National Green Tribunal in the order dated 22.11.2018 in O.A. No.353 of

2016 has observed that statutory authorities are entitled to assess and

recover damages by applying polluter pay's principle in exercise of

incidental powers to protect environment.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      3. Appellant has contended that the Environmental (Protection) Act,

1986 or Solid Waste Management Rules, 2006 do not provide assessing or

imposing compensation upon local authorities for the delay in providing

facilities and in carrying out the activities prescribed in the rules. Appellant

has further contended that a clarification made by the National Green

Tribunal shall not clothe the Pollution Control Board with any power which is

not otherwise provided under the Act. Challenging the authority of Kerala

State Pollution Control Board, i.e. 2nd respondent, to issue such a direction

(Exhibit-P1) on the basis of certain clarifications made by the National

Green Tribunal, instant writ petition has been filed seeking for issuance of a

writ of certiorari or other appropriate writ order or direction, quashing

Exhibit-P1 order dated 21.10.2019 issued by the Kerala State Pollution

Control Board, respondent No.2.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> W.A.No.2572 of 2019                      4</span><p id="p_6">


</p><p id="p_7">      4. After considering the rival contentions, writ court by the impugned

judgment, closed the writ petition by observing thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 "Resultantly, I close this Writ Petition without granting
          any of the reliefs sought for, but leaving liberty to the petitioner
          to approach the NGT appropriately, either by filing a statutory
          appeal or by impleading themselves in the Original Application
          or by doing both.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                 Needless to say, until such time as the statutory period
          for filing an appeal, as fixed under Section 16 of the NGT Act
          expires, the interim order granted by this Court will continue to
          be in operation; and consequentially, all further action being
          pursued by the Pollution Control Board, based on Ext.P1, shall
          stand interdicted, so as to enable the Corporation to approach
          the NGT without the threat of imminent action."</blockquote><p id="p_8">


</p><p id="p_9">      5. Being aggrieved, instant writ appeal has been filed contending

that,- the judgment passed by the writ court refusing to entertain the writ

petition relegating the petitioner to seek alternate remedy of appeal without

considering the specific pleadings to the effect that such an appeal is not

efficacious, is improper. According to the appellant, Exhibit P1 direction has

been issued specifically in compliance with the direction issued by National

Green Tribunal; that there is reference in Exhibit P1 direction to certain

findings of the Tribunal, to the effect that statutory authorities under

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment (Protection) Act</a> are empowered to impose compensation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> W.A.No.2572 of 2019                   5</span>


against the polluters. The writ petition is filed specifically challenging the

authority of the Pollution Control Board to issue such a direction, on the

basis of certain clarifications made by the National Green Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_10">      6.   In the writ petition, appellant has further contended that, a

clarification made by the National Green Tribunal shall not clothe the

Pollution Control Board with any power, which is not otherwise provided

under the Act. The scale of compensation is arbitrarily fixed by the 1 st

respondent and is seen to have been approved by the Tribunal. Hence, an

appeal before the Appellate Authority cannot be said to be efficacious.

</p><p id="p_11">      7. It is further contended that Thrissur Corporation was not a party

to the proceedings before the National Green Tribunal, in which, an order

has been passed endorsing the authority of Pollution Control Board to

impose compensation. Direction has been issued by the 2 nd respondent

mechanically, noting that the six months' period fixed by the National Green

Tribunal have elapsed. The explanation of the appellant was not at all

considered. Further, it was not considered whether the delay is due to the

laches on the part of the appellant. The 1 st respondent itself had certain

duties to be performed in the matter of issuing directions and suggestions

to the local authorities, which were not done promptly. The State Policy

itself was formulated after two years of the enactment of the rules. It is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> W.A.No.2572 of 2019                   6</span>


finally contended that the polluter pay's principle does not apply in the case

of the appellant for the alleged delay in complying with the norms. At any

rate, imposition of compensation for an act of pollution, being a tortious

liability could not have been done by the 2nd respondent.

</p><p id="p_12">      8. The Senior Environmental Engineer, Kerala State Pollution Control

Board, Regional Office, Ernakulam has filed a counter affidavit on behalf of

Kerala State Pollution Control Board, rep; by its Member Secretary and the

Environental Engineer, Kerala State Pollution Control Board, Thrissur,

respondents 1 and 3, contending that,- as per the Solid Waste Management

Rules, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as SWM Rules), the Municipal

Corporation is legally bound to take all measures for the scientific disposal

of the solid waste generates within its limits. As per Rule 22(1) of the SWM

Rules, the Corporation shall identify suitable sites for setting up of solid

wastes processing facilities by 08/04/2017, that is one year from the date of

notification of the Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      9.   It is further contended that the Board on numerous occasions

issued directions to the appellant to comply with the directions issued in the

light of the provisions contained the SWM Rules. However, the appellant

failed to comply with those directions and the facilities now in place for the

disposal of solid wastes are highly inadequate. National Green Tribunal,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> W.A.No.2572 of 2019                     7</span>


Principal Bench, New Delhi vide Exhibit-P2 order dated 22.11.2018 in O.A.

Nos.353 of 2016 and 412 of 2017 has clarified that the statutory authorities

shall collect compensation from the pollutors on "polluter pays" principle.

Vide paragraph 13 of the above order, the National Green Tribunal has held

as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                      "We may also clarify at this stage that apart from
              prosecution, the statutory authorities under the
              <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, the Air (Prevention and
              <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and the Water (Prevention
              and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 must, in exercise of
              their incidental powers, prescribed scale of compensation to
              be collected from the polluters on the "Pollutor Pays'
              principle. Such scale which may be laid down at various
              levels, having regard to the local conditions or as per
              directions in the hierarchy of the authorities."
       The Tribunal further ordered that the copies of the order be sent
       by e-mail to the Hon'ble Apex and the' Regional Committees and
       also to the Central Pollution Control Board (hereinafter referred to
       as "CPCB") for being communicated to all the State Pollution
       Control Board or such other Authorities as may be considered
       necessary.</blockquote><p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">      10. Therefore, it is further contended that in the light of the above

clarification made by the National Green Tribunal, the Board is bound to

prescribe the scale of compensation to be collected from the polluters on

the "polluter pay's principle". In this case, the appellant is the authority

fastened with the responsibility to dispose the solid wastes generated

within its limits in a scientific manner as prescribed under the SWM Rules.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> W.A.No.2572 of 2019                   8</span>


The Board is competent to impose and prescribe compensation on the

appellant in case of failure on their part in scientifically handling the solid

waste generated within its limits.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      11. It is further contended that as per Rule 22(7) of the SWM Rules,

solid wastes processing facility has to be set up by bodies having 1 lakh

population or more and as per Rule 22(9), common or standalone sanitary

landfill is to be provided by 08.04.2019. As the time period was over and

no considerable progress has been achieved by the local bodies, the NGT

issued Exhibit-P5 order in O.A. No.606/2018, directing to notify atleast 3

major cities and 3 major towns in the State and at least 3 Panchayats in

every district, which would comply with the provisions contained in SWM

Rules, within 6 months from the date of the order. The above Original

Application came up for consideration before the NGT pursuant to the

transfer of proceedings in W.P.(C) No. 888/1996 pending before the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, vide order dated 2.9.2014. The National Green Tribunal

vide order dated 22.12.2016 held that,- "the directions contained in this

judgment shall apply to the entire country. All the State Governments and

Union Territories shall be obliged to implement and enforce these directions

without any alteration or reservation."
</p>
<p id="p_17">      12. It is further contended that the appellant-Corporation was one
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> W.A.No.2572 of 2019                    9</span>


among the three model cities identified as per G.O.(t) No.45/2019/ENVT

dated 31/05/2019. Though the time granted was over, appellant failed to

comply with the provisions contained in SWM Rules. The solid waste

management measures taken were not adequate to cater the quantity of

wastes generated in Thrissur Corporation. The Corporation also failed to

identify land for solid waste treatment processing facility.

</p><p id="p_18">      13. In the light of the directions issued by the National Green

Tribunal, Exhibit-P3 notice under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_6">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection)

Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred to as E.P. Act) was issued to the appellant,

to show cause within 15 days why the Board shall not recover

environmental compensation of Rs.456.6 lakhs from 22-11-2018 to 31-7-

2019 for the non-compliance of Rules 22 (1), 22(3), 22(5), 22(6), 22(7)

and 22(11) of the SWM Rules, 2016. Above notice was issued based on the

finding that solid waste management measures reported by the appellant-

Corporation are inadequate to cater the quantity of waste expected in the

Corporation. As per the Annual Report submitted by Thrissur Corporation,

the total quantity of solid wastes generated is 177 tonne per day. The

quantity of solid wastes processed (community level) is 37 TPD and

quantity of solid wastes processed in household level is 60 TPD. Hence, it is

clear that 80 TPD of wastes generated in Thrissur Corporation are not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> W.A.No.2572 of 2019                  10</span>


scientifically processed. This also establishes a fact that the appellant

Corporation has miserably failed to identify the land for solid wastes

processing facility and sanitary landfill. The reply submitted by Thrissur

Corporation vide letter dated 27-8-2019 was far from satisfaction as they

have not identified land for solid waste treatment facility, sanitary landfill

and failed to implement door to door collection of solid wastes.

</p><p id="p_19">      14. It is further contended that in the light of the above, the Board

had taken steps for assessment of environmental compensation from the

appellant-Corporation for the period from 22-11-2018, on which date the

Order specifying the levying of Environmental Compensation by Hon'ble

NGT came into force, to 31-7-2019 (days 252). The Board is following the

environmental compensation regime for solid waste accepted by the NGT

vide order dated 28/08/2019 in O.A. 593/2017. Thereafter, the Board has

issued Ext.P1 under Section 5 of the E.P. Act and directed Thrissur

Corporation to remit environmental compensation of Rs.456.6 lakhs from

22-11-2018 to 31-7-2019 for non-compliance of SWM Rules, within 15 days

from the date of receipt of the direction. The Corporation replied to the

direction vide letter dated 5-11-2019 and requested for a hearing on the

subject. A hearing was held on 2-12-2019, in which the Secretary, Thrissur

Corporation attended. However, no action plan was submitted specifying
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> W.A.No.2572 of 2019                  11</span>


the activities and time limit for implementation of Solid Waste Management

Rules, 2016.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      15. It is further contended that Exhibit-P1 is an order issued under

<a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_7">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act. <a href="/doc/148809041/" id="a_8">Section 5A</a> of the said Act

stipulates that any order passed under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_9">Section 5</a> is appealable before the

National Green Tribunal. It was in that background, the learned single

Judge has disposed of the writ petition, granting liberty to the appellant

Corporation to approach the National Green Tribunal by filing an appeal

against Exhibit-P1 order. Apart from that, the appellant was given liberty to

implead in the pending Original Applications before the NGT. Without

exhausing the statutory remedies, the appellant has approached this Court,

and for that reason alone, writ appeal is liable to be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_21">      16.   As stated above, Exhibit-P1 was issued strictly based on the

directions and observations contained in Exhibits-P2 and P5 orders of the

National Green Tribunal. The above orders cast a duty upon the Pollution

Control Board to take appropriate steps for imposing environmental

compensation and to realise the same from the polluters under polluters-

pays-principle. Hence, the contention of the appellant has no relevance as

the steps taken by the Board are in the light of the directions issued by the

NGT. As regards the averments contained in the Appeal Memorandum to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> W.A.No.2572 of 2019                   12</span>


the effect that the Hon'bie NGT cannot confer any power under the

statutory Authority, the Board herein; unless there is specific provision, it is

contended that the action taken by the Board is as per the directions and

observations of the Hon'bie NGT. It is to enable the appellant to canvass

such a position before the NGT, the writ court granted liberty to the

appellant for impleading in the pending Original Application. The appellant-

Corporation is duty bound to-handle with the solid wastes generates within

its limits in a scientific manner as per the SWM Rules, 2016. The failure on

the part of the appellant- Corporation is a valid reason for imposing

environmental compensation under "polluter pays" principle. For the afore-

mentioned reasons, the Kerala State Pollution Pontrol Board, sought for

dismissal of the writ appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      17. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material

available on record.

has been issued by the Chairman of Pollution Control Board, as extracted

above. In fact, in the objection filed to the show cause notice, the

Corporation has raised various contentions, including the authority of the

Pollution Control Board to impose fine against them on the basis of

"pollutor pay's principle". However, as per Exhibit-P1, Chairman of the

Pollution Control Board has gone through the provisions of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_21">Environment

(Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and the rules made thereunder, for arriving at the

conclusion that the authorities are vested with sufficient powers to impose

environmental compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      20. The paramount contention advanced by the appellant Corporation

before the writ court was that it was not provided an opportunity of being

heard by the Pollution Control Board. Writ court after considering the rival

contentions of the appellant, held that the Corporation has got an alternate

remedy to file an appeal against the order of the Chairman, Pollution

Control Board before the National Green Tribunal. However, on a perusal of

Exhibit-P1, extracted above, it is evident that the said order was passed

without providing an opportunity of hearing to the appellant. In fact, the

amount of Rs.456.6 lakhs was imposed against the Corporation as

environmental compensation, directed to be paid within 15 days from the

date of receipt of the order. In our considered view, since the Corporation

has filed serious objection to the show cause notice, issued by the Pollution

Control Board, the Corporation ought to have been provided with such an

opportunity to contest the proceedings before the Chairman.

</p><p id="p_27">      21. It is almost an admitted fact that no opportunity of hearing was

provided to the Corporation to contest the proceedings. Moreover, on a

perusal of Exhibit-P1, it is evident that even though the provisions of the

Act and rules were considered by the Chairman of the Pollution Control

Board, no opportunity has been provided to the appellant Corporation to

substantiate the case putforth by them in their objections. Therefore, we

are of the considered view that Exhibit-P1 order of the Chairman suffers

from the vice of arbitrariness, since it has been passed in violation of the

principles of natural justice. It was only appropriate on the part of the

Pollution Control Board to have provided an opportunity of hearing to the

appellant. Having not done so, there is clear illegality and unfairness on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20"> W.A.No.2572 of 2019                 21</span>


part of the Chairman of the Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_28">      In the light of above discussion, we set aside Exhibit-P1 order of the

Chairman, Kerala State Pollution Control Board, dated 21.10.2019 and

direct the Chairman to issue notice to the appellant Corporation and finalise

the proceedings, after providing the Corporation an opportunity of being

heard. Writ appeal is accordingly, allowed.
