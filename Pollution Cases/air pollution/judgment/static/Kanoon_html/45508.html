HEADNOTE:
    The Petitioner, representing a Social Organisation,	 has
written	 a  letter alleging environment	 pollution  in	some
villages  and the adjoining Sarnath Temple. The	 letter	 was
treated	 as Writ Petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_3">Article 32</a> of the  Constitu-
tion of India. It was alleged that the smoke and dust  emit-
ted from the Chimneys of Respondent No. 3, viz., an oil Mill
and  a	refinery plant in the area, and the  effluents	dis-
charged by the plants has been causing serious environmental
pollution in the thickly populated area, leading to epidemic
diseases.  It  was further alleged that even the  flora	 was
badly  affected by pollution. Petitioner prayed	 for  direc-
tions to check the pollution.
    On behalf of Respondent No. 3, it was contended that  it
had  complied  with the provisions of  Air  (Prevention	 and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control	 of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and the  Water	 (Prevention
and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and there was  no	com-
plaint whatsoever. It was further stated that the petitioner
was an anti-social element and his only aim was to blackmail
and  extract  money from people like Respondent No.  3,	 and
that a criminal case has already been filed against him, for
such activities.
Dismissing the writ petition,
    HELD:  1. <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_6">Article 32</a> is a great and	 salutary  safeguard
for  preservation  of fundamental rights  of  the  citizens.
Every citizen has a fundamental right to have the  enjoyment
of quality of life and living as contemplated by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_7">Article  21</a>
of the Constitution of India. Anything which
740
endangers or impairs by conduct of anybody either in  viola-
tion  or  in derogation of laws, that quality  of  life	 and
living	by  the people is entitled to be taken	recourse  of
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_8">Article 32</a> of the Constitution. But this can only be done by
any  person  interested genuinely in the protection  of	 the
society	 on behalf of the society or community. This  weapon
as  a  safeguard must be utilised and invoked by  the  Court
with  great  deal of circumspection and	 caution.  Where  it
appears	 that  this  is only a cloak to	 "feed	fat  ancient
grudge"	 and  enemity, this should not only be	refused	 but
strongly discouraged. While it is the duty of this Court  to
enforce	 fundamental  rights, it is also the  duty  of	this
Court to ensure that this weapon under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_9">Article 32</a> should not
be misused or permitted to be misused creating a  bottleneck
in the superior Court preventing other genuine violation  of
fundamental rights being considered by the Court. That would
be an act or a conduct which will defeat the very purpose of
preservation of fundamental rights. [743B-E]
    Bandhu  Mukti Morchay. Union of lndia &amp; Ors.,  [1984]  2
SCR 67, referred to.
    2.1.  This	petition is legally devoid of any  merit  or
principles  of public interest and public protection.  There
was no fundamental right violation or could be violative  if
the allegations of the so-called champions on behalf of	 the
society are scrutinised. [743G]
    2.2.  Prima	 facie the provisions of the  relevant	Act,
namely,	 the  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Air Pollution Control Act</a> have  been  complied
with  and there is no conduct which is attributable  to	 re-
spondent No. 3 herein leading to pollution of air or ecolog-
ical imbalances calling for interference by this Court.	 The
orders	passed by the Pollution Control Board also  indicate
that there were no instances of any violation. There was  no
complaint  from	 anybody apart from the petitioner,  or	 any
authority  as  to the non-compliance of any statute  by	 Re-
spondent No. 3. [743A-B; 742G]

</p><p id="p_3">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">741</span>
    SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, CJ. A letter written to this  Court
was  treated  as  a writ petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_12">Article	 32</a>  of	 the
Constitution  of  India.  The letter  written  by  Chhetriya
Pardushan Mukti Sangharsh Samiti. Sarnath, alleged  environ-
mental	pollution in the area. It was also  alleged  therein
that  the  Jhunjhunwala Oil Mills and a refinery  plant	 are
located in the green belt area, touching three villages	 and
the Sarnath temple of international fame. The smoke and dust
emitted	 from  the chimneys of the Mills and  the  effluents
discharged  from  these plants were alleged  to	 be  causing
environmental  pollution in the thickly populated  area	 and
were  proving a great health hazard. It was  further  stated
that  the people were finding it difficult to eat and  sleep
due  to smoke and foul smell and the highly polluted  water.
It was further alleged that the lands in the area had become
waste,	affecting crops and the orchards  damages.  Diseases
like  TB,  jaundice  and other ailments were  stated  to  be
spreading  in an epidemic form. The growth of  children	 was
affected.  It was further alleged that the schools,  nursing
homes,	leprosy	 homes	and hospitals situated	on  the	 one
kilometer  long	 belt touching the oil Mills and  the  plant
were  adversely	 affected. It was stated that  licences	 had
been  issued to one richman Dina Nath for  these  industrial
units  thereby	risking	 the lives of  thousands  of  people
without	 enforcing  any safety measure either  to  cure	 the
effluents  discharged from the plants or to check the  smoke
and the foul smell emitted from the chimneys. The whole area
was expected to be ruined due to any explosion or gas  leak-
age.
</p><p id="p_4">    In that background, the petitioner prayed for  necessary
directions  to	check  the pollution, and  also	 enclosed  a
printed	 leaflet alleging real-practices and  corruption  on
the  part of the proprietor of these industrial units  apart
from polluting the atmosphere.
</p><p id="p_5">    As mentioned hereinbefore, the complaint was made by the
said  Samiti stated to be a social organisation about  envi-
ronmental pollution and ecological imbalance being caused by
the two plants and thereby exposing the population to health
hazards and life risk which was, therefore, considered to be
a  matter  of great public importance. It  is  necessary  to
recognise  the danger in order to strike a  balance  between
the quality of life to be preserved and the economic  devel-
opment	to be encouraged. Dealing with this aspect  in	<a href="/doc/1599374/" id="a_13">M.C.
Mehta  v.  Union of India &amp; Ors</a>., [1988] 1 SCR 279,  it	 has
been  stated  that  whenever applications  for	licences  to
establish  new industries are made in future, such  applica-
tions  should be refused unless adequate provision has	been
made for the treatment of trade effluents flowing out of the
factories.  So, this letter was treated as a  writ  petition
and notice was issued,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">742</span>
counter	 affidavits was filed on behalf of respondent No.  3
being  the proprietor of Jhunjhunwala Oil  Mills.  Reference
was  made  to the decision of this Court  in  <a href="/doc/595099/" id="a_14">Bandhua  Mukti
Morcha	v.  Union of India &amp; Ors</a>., [1984] 2 SCR	 67  wherein
this Court underlined the importance of satisfactory verifi-
cation of allegations. The Court was asked to be ever  vigi-
lant  against  abuse of its process and there was  need	 for
appropriate verification. There is a statute for controlling
pollution.  It	is wellsettled that if there  is  a  statute
prescribing  a	judicial procedure  governing  a  particular
case,  the court must follow such procedure. It is not	open
to  the court to by pass the statute and evolve a  different
procedure  at  variance with it. It is further	asserted  on
behalf	of the respondents that between the petitioner	Sita
Ram  Pandey and respondent No. 3, there was a long  rivalry.
According  to respondent No. 3, the petitioner is  an  anti-
social-element	and his only aim was to extract	 money	from
the people like respondent No. 3 as in the present case.
    It has further been stated that there has been  criminal
proceeding  against  the petitioner and several	 items	have
been marked in the affidavit in opposition. The	 particulars
make out a rather disgraceful state of affairs. It has	been
alleged that Mr. Sita Ram Pandey for the last so many  years
was blackmailing the people, and a case u/s 500 of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_15">I.P.C</a>
being Case No. 121/88 was filed. It has been further averred
that  respondent No. 3 has complied with the  provisions  of
the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981	 and
of  the water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_17">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,	1974
and there is no complaint of any kind from any person,	body
or  authority. The correspondence, in this  connection,	 has
been set out.
</p><p id="p_6">    It further appears that as early as 1980, the petitioner
had  made various complaints to the A.D.M. (Supply),  Distt.
Varanasi,  alleging  that respondent No. 3  was	 accused  of
smuggling of coal and diesel blackmailing. It was dismissed.
It further appears that there was no complaint from  anybody
apart from the present petitioner by any authority as to the
non-compliance	of  any	 statute by respondent	No.  3.	 The
orders passed by the Pollution Control Board which had	been
annexed, also indicate that there are no instance of  viola-
tion of the said Acts.
</p><p id="p_7">    Time  was sought on behalf of respondents for  filing  a
rejoinder  which, unfortunately, has not been filed, and  no
satisfactory  explanation has been given therefore.  Certain
letters alleged to have been written on behalf of the  peti-
tioners	 were  sought to be placed before us  in  the  Court
today.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">743</span>
<p id="p_8">    Having  considered the facts, circumstances,  nature  of
the allegations and the long history of enemit and  animosi-
ty, we are of the opinion that prima facie the provisions of
the relevant Act, namely, the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Air Pollution Control Act</a> have
been  complied	with and there is no conduct  which  is	 at-
tributable  to respondent No. 3 herein leading to  pollution
of air or ecological imbalances calling for interference  by
this Court.
</p><p id="p_9">    <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_19">Article 32</a> is a great and salutary safeguard for preser-
vation of fundamental rights of the citizens. Every  citizen
has a fundamental right to have the enjoyment of quality  of
life and living as contemplated by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_20">Article 21</a> of the Consti-
tution	of  India. Anything which endangers  or	 impairs  by
conduct	 of anybody either in violation or in derogation  of
laws,  that  quality  of life and living by  the  people  is
entitled to be taken recourse of <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_21">Article 32</a> of the Constitu-
tion.  But  this can only be done by any  person  interested
genuinely in the protection of the society on behalf of	 the
society	 or  community. This weapon as a safeguard  must  be
utilised and invoked by the Court with great deal of circum-
spection  and caution. Where it appears that this is only  a
cloak to "feed fact ancient grudge" and enemity, this should
not  only be refused but strongly discouraged. While  it  is
the duty of this Court to enforce fundamental rights, it  is
also the duty of this Court to ensure that this weapon under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_22">Article 32</a> should not be misused or permitted to be  misused
creating a bottleneck in the superior Court preventing other
genuine violation of fundamental rights being considered  by
the  Court.  That would be an act or a	conduct	 which	will
defeat	the  very  purpose of  preservation  of	 fundamental
rights.
</p><p id="p_10">    Having regard to the ugly rivalry here, we have no doubt
that  between the contestants, the Court was misled  and  we
must,  therefore, proceed with caution. There was no  funda-
mental right violation or could be violative if the  allega-
tions  of the so-called champions on behalf of	the  society
are  scrutinised. We must protect the society from  the	 so-
called	'protectors'. This application is legally devoid  of
any  merit or principles of public interest and public	pro-
tection.  This application certainly creates bottlenecks  in
courts, which is an abuse of process of this Court. We have,
therefore, no hesitation in dismissing this application with
the observations made herein.
