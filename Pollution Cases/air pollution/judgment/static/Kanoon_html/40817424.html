          Dated this the 19th day of February 2018


                             ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     The revision petitioners herein are the original accused

Nos.1, 5 and 6 in C.C.No.105/2002 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kolencherry. The case as against the others

already stands quashed by this Court.         C.C. No.105/2002 is a

prosecution brought by the 1st respondent alleging violation of

the provisions of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1981 (for short, 'the Act').      The 1 st accused is a private

limited company, by name, M/s.Philips Carbon Black Limited,

having a branch in Kerala, at Kochi, represented by the

Managing Director.      The 5th accused is the Chief Executive

Officer of the Company, and the 6 th accused is the Manager

(Pollution Control). At present, these three accused must be the

accused Nos.1 to 3, when the case against the others stands

quashed. The complaint of the 1st respondent in the court below

is that the Company installed a machinery at the Company

premises without obtaining the consent of the Pollution Control

Board.   The dispute is concerning only one portion of the
Crl.R.P. No.293 of 2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   -: 2 :-</span>

business concern because the other two portions already stand

closed down.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.    The court below conducted the required enquiry, and

recorded the statements of the complainant and the witnesses.

The available documents were also perused as part of the enquiry.

On enquiry, the court below found a prima facie case against the

accused, and accordingly, took cognizance under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_2">Section 37</a> read

with <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.    The accused appeared before the trial court and took

part in the trial.        After pre-trial evidence under <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_4">Section 244</a>

Cr.P.C., the trial court heard the parties on the question of

framing charge.           The accused pleaded for discharge on the

ground that there is no material at all for a prosecution under the

Act. On an examination of the materials produced in court, the

trial court found that there are sufficient materials, prima facie, to

frame charge against the accused, and accordingly, the trial court

decided to frame charge appropriately as per the order dated

7.12.2013. The said order is under challenge in this revision.

</p><p id="p_4">      4.    The definite case of the revision petitioners is that they

had actually obtained consent from the Pollution Control Board

for installing the required machinery, and so, there cannot be a
Crl.R.P. No.293 of 2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 -: 3 :-</span>

prosecution against them under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_5">Section 37</a> of the Act. What is

punishable under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_6">Section 37</a> of the Act is failure to comply with

the provisions of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_7">Section 21</a> or <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_8">Section 22</a> of the Act, or the

directions issued under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_9">Section 31(A)</a> of the Act.     In this case,

what is practically alleged is non-compliance of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_10">Section 21</a> of the

Act. <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_11">Section 21</a> of the Act provides that, subject to the provisions

of the Section, no person shall, without the previous consent of

the State Board, establish or operate any industrial plant in an air

pollution control area. The premises, where the Company is being

run, stands already declared as a 'pollution control area' by the

Government.        So, the very short question for consideration is

whether the revision petitioners had in fact obtained the consent

of the Pollution Control Board for installing machinery there. If it

is found that they installed the machinery with consent, there

cannot be a prosecution. Any way, the complaint in this case was

filed in February, 2002. The notice as required under <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_12">Section 43</a>

of the Act was issued by the complainant on 12.10.2001.         The

revision petitioners claim to have obtained consent of the Board

on 9.10.2001, and it was extended till 31.12.2011 on 7.11.2001. It

appears that the crucial documents were not produced in the trial

court by the complainant or the accused.        Before deciding to
Crl.R.P. No.293 of 2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   -: 4 :-</span>

frame a charge on the basis of the pre-trial evidence adduced

under <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_13">Section 244</a> Cr.P.C., the trial court will have to examine all

the relevant materials, including the documents covering the

issue in dispute.         Here, the material document must be the

consent given by the Pollution Control Board, if there is a consent.

If the revision petitioners had in fact obtained consent as on the

date of filing of the complaint, and if the consent was in force at

the time of adducing evidence, there cannot be a prosecution as

alleged. Before this Court, the revision petitioners have produced

a copy of the consent given by the Pollution Control Board. The

details of the consent, and also the other materials connected with

it will have to be examined by the trial court. In this proceeding,

I am not inclined to examine those aspects. It is for the trial court

to examine, and decide first, whether there are sufficient

materials to frame a charge, and this decision must be on the

basis of the relevant materials, including documents. Let the trial

court examine the materials produced before this Court, including

the consent obtained by the revision petitioners, and decide

whether there is scope to frame a charge against the accused.

</p><p id="p_5">             In the result, this revision petition is disposed of as

follows :-

                    court, and the parties will make appearance before
