<p id="p_1">ORDER
 

Jaspal Singh, J.
</p> 

<p id="p_2">1.      The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (hereinafter called the  committee)  has issued a direction to the Sub Divisional Magistrate to  seal  the industrial unit of the petitioner. The writ petition, seeks the quashing of that direction.
</p> 

<p id="p_3">2.   The  petitioner is a private limited company engaged  in  multifarious business  activities and it is claimed that casting of iron  components  in the  Cupola Furnace, which is the subject matter of the impugned  order  is only  a  small part of petitioner/s business activities being  run  from  a premises residential in nature. On July 3, 1996 directions were received by the  petitioner  under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">section 31A</a> of the Air (Prevention  and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control  of Pollution)  Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter called the Act) for closure of the  unit on  the  grounds, namely, (1) the Unit was being operated  without  consent under  <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">section  21</a> of the Act, (2) the Unit had a Cupola Furnace  with  air pollution  potential, and that (3) the Unit was being operated in  non-conforming  area  under the Master Plan of Delhi-2001. Aggrieved by  the  said direction, the petitioner company preferred an appeal. On July 3, 1996  the Appellate  Authority remanded the matter to the Committee "to  examine  and take   a  decision  on  the  grant  of  consent  on  the  basis  of   fresh inspection/monitoring of the unit."
</p> 

<p id="p_4">     The  grievance of the petitioner is that without ever  monitoring  its unit  in terms of the order of the Appellate Authority, and  acting  beyond its  powers,  the Committee has directed the Sub Divisional  Magistrate  to seal the unit.
</p> 

<p id="p_5">3.   The question is: Could the Committee issue such a direction?
</p> 

<p id="p_6">4.   The learned counsel for the respondents has taken a preliminary objection.  He submits that the impugned direction to the Sub Divisional  Magistrate  being  appealable, writ jurisdiction cannot be invoked. It  is  also argued  that the Unit was monitored on two dates and that in any case,  the impugned direction suffers from no illegality.
</p> 

<p id="p_7">5.   A few provisions of the Act need to be noticed before commenting  upon the rival contentions:
</p><p id="p_8">      <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_4">Section  21</a>  of the Act which lays down restrictions  on  use  of certain  industrial plants, prohibits establishment or  operation of any industrial plant in an air pollution control area  without consent of the State Board. <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_5">Section 22</a> prohibits persons  operating  any  industrial plants, in any air pollution  control  area, from  discharging or causing or permitting to be  discharged  the emission  of  any air pollutant in excess of the  standards  laid down  by the State Board under clause (g) of Sub-section  (1)  of <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_6">Section 17</a>. Where it is "apprehended" by the Board that  emission of any air pollutant, in excess of the standard laid under clause (g)  of  Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_7">Section 17</a>, is "likely to  occur"  by reason  of any person operating an industrial plant or  otherwise in any air pollution control area, <a href="/doc/172134797/" id="a_8">Section 22A</a> empowers the Board in  such a case to make application to a Court of a  Metropolitan Magistrate/Judicial Magistrate of the first class, for  restraining such person from emitting such a pollutant and the Court may, on  such  application, direct such person to desist  from  taking such  action  as is likely to cause emission, and,  if  the  said direction is not complied with, authorise the Board to  implement the direction "in such manner as may be specified by the Court."
</p> 

<p id="p_9">6.   <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_9">Section  31A</a> of the Act invests the Board with power to  give  certain directions  and  since  the question raised in this  Writ  Petition  hovers around  this  provision, I feel tempted to reproduce the same. It  runs  as under:
</p>  

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     31A. Power  to  give directions.- Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in any other law, but subject to the provisions  of  this Act,  and to any directions that the Central Government may  give in  this behalf, a Board may, in the exercise of its  powers  and performance of its functions under this Act, issue any directions in writing to any person, officer or authority, and such  person, officer  or authority shall be bound to comply with  such  directions.
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     Explanation:  For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby  declared that  the power to issue directions under this  section  includes the power to direct -
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     (a)  the  closure,  prohibition or regulation  of  any  industry, operation or process; or 
 

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     (b)  the  stoppage or regulation of supply of electricity,  water or any other service.
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     What if someone fails to comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_10">section 21</a> 
     or <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_11">section 22</a> or the directions issued under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_12">section 31A</a>? <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_13">Section 37</a> of the Act deals with such an eventuality. It says:
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">     "37. Failure  to  comply  with the provisions of  <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_14">section  21</a>  or <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_15">section 22</a> or with the directions issued under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_16">section 31A</a>.-  (1) Whoever  fails  to comply with the provisions of  <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_17">section  21</a>  or <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_18">section  22</a>  or directions issued under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_19">section  31A</a>,  shall,  in respect of each such failure, be punishable with imprisonment for a  term which shall not be less than one year and six months  but which  may  extend to six years and with fine, and  in  case  the failure  continues, with an additional fine which may  extend  to five  thousand  rupees for every day during  which  such  failure continues after the conviction for the first such failure.
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     (2)  If  the  failure referred to in  sub-section  (1)  continues beyond  a  period of one year after the date of  conviction,  the offender  shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term  which shall  not be less than two years but which may extend  in  seven years and with fine."
</blockquote>  

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">    Since  the learned counsel for the respondent has challenged  the maintainability  of  the petition on the ground  that  remedy  of appeal  is  available  to the petitioner, I may  as  well  notice <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_20">section 31</a> which provides the remedy of appeal. It lays down:
</blockquote>
 

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">     "31. Appeals.  (1) Any person aggrieved by an order made  by  the State Board under this Act may, within thirty days from the  date on  which the order is communicated to him, prefer an  appeal  to such authority (hereinafter referred to as the Appellate Authority) as the State Government may think fit to constitute:
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">     Provided  that the Appellate Authority may entertain  the  appeal after  the expiry of the said period of thirty days if  such  authority  is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by  sufficient cause from filing the appeal in time.
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">     (2)  The Appellate Authority shall consist of a single person  or three  persons  as the State Government may think fit to  be  appointed by the State Government.
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">     (3)  The form and the manner in which an appeal may be  preferred under  sub-section (1), the fees payable for such appeal and  the procedure to be followed by the Appellate Authority shall be such as may be prescribed.
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">     (4)  On receipt of an appeal preferred under sub-section (1), the Appellate  Authority  shall, after giving the appellant  and  the State Board an opportunity of being heard, dispose of the  appeal as expeditiously as possible."
</blockquote> 

<p id="p_10">7.   Having  surveyed  the relevant provisions of the Act, it  is  time  to proceed ahead.
</p> 

<p id="p_11">        I  need not go into the question as to whether the Unit is  in  any air  pollution control area or not. Admittedly, it is. I also need  not  go into  the question as to whether any consent has been obtained for,  admittedly again, no such consent has been obtained so far. As already  noticed, the  Committee purporting to act under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_21">section 31A</a> of the Act directed  the closure of the unit but in appeal that order was set aside with the following observations:
</p>  

<p id="p_12">                                   ORDER 
 

     After hearing the parties on 27.9.96 and considering the material available  on record, the matter is remanded to the Delhi  Pollution  Control  Committee to examine and take a  decision  on  the grant  of consent on the basis of fresh inspection/monitoring  of the unit and information available with them. The question of the unit  operating in non-conformity with the Master Plan of  Delhi, 2001  is subjudice in the Hon'ble Supreme Court in IA No.  22  of W.P.4677  of 1985 - <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_22">M.C.Mehta vs. Union of India and  Others</a>  and the  Supreme Court is monitoring the progress, the orders of  the Supreme Court from time to time will be binding on the industries also.
</p> 

<p id="p_13">     Ordered accordingly."
</p> 

<p id="p_14">8.   Although it is claimed by the Committee that after the order of remand there  was  monitoring of the unit and that the petitioner had  adopted  no measures  to control air pollution and although the petitioner  has  denied these allegations, let us assume for argument's sake, that what the Committee is asserting is correct. The question still remains: Could the  Committee  give the direction to the Sub Divisional Magistrate to "seal the  unit forthwith"? Mr.Kashyap appearing for the Committee says the Board could and in support relies upon <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_23">section 31A</a> of the Act but then Mr.Govil who appears for  the petitioner is equally vehement in denying any such power with  the Committee  and he too, in support, swears by the same provision,  that  is, <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_24">section 31A</a>.
</p> 

<p id="p_15">9.   I have already reproduced above <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_25">section 31A</a> of the Act.It undoubtedly invests the Board to issue "any directions" to "any  person" subject,  however,  to the satisfaction of two requirements.  Firstly,  the direction  so issued must be "in the exercise of its powers" under the  Act 
and  secondly  it must also be in the "performance of its  functions  under this Act". But then <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_26">section 31A</a> has an Explanation too and for avoidance of doubts,  it declares that the power to issue directions under  the  section "includes" the power to direct "the closure, prohibition or regulation"  of any industry, operation or process.
</p> 

<p id="p_16">10.  Mr.Kashyap submits that "closure" is synonymous with "sealing" of  any industry, operation or process and that, in any case, only the  interpretation suggested by him would help achieve the purpose of the enactment as it is a social benefit oriented legislation.
</p> 

<p id="p_17">11.  Undoubtedly,  while interpreting a provision the court has to keep  in view the attempted objective of the enactment and has to adopt a  constructive approach, but then, it is also true that no violence is to be done  to the  language of the provision. What is of significance in <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_27">section  31A</a>  is that  the main part itself is very wide. Subject to certain conditions  the Board in the exercise of its powers and performance of its functions  under this Act, may issue "any" directions. The word "any" is significant and  is of  wide  amplitude.  It means one or same or all and may  be  employed  to indicate  "all" or "every". But then does the use of the word "any" in  the context  it has been used in the main part of <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_28">section 31A</a> indicate that  it has  been  used  in the wider sense extending from one to all?  If  it  was clearly so, where was the need for the Explanation to say: "For the  avoidance  of doubts, it is hereby declared that the power to  issue  directions under this section includes the power to direct" the closure etc.? Obviously, the need for the Explanation was felt because the meaning of the  wider word "any" was felt in the context, to be not clear and free from  ambiguity.  When  the main part uses the expression of wide amplitude  like  "any" indicating its wide sweep, what is the significance of the word  "includes" in the Explanation? Now, as we all know, the word "includes" is often  used in  interpretation Clauses in order to enlarge the meaning of the words  or phrases occurring in the body of the statute. (Dilworth Vs. Commissioner of Stamps  1899  A.C.99) (See also Regl. Director, ESIC Vs.  High  Land  Coffee Works (1991) 3 S 617 at p.620). If we read the Explanation in the light  of what  has been noticed above, it would be difficult to hold that the  power can extend to the giving of a direction much more harsh and stringent  than the direction of the closure, of the industry, operation or process.
</p> 

<p id="p_18">12.  But  then,  as  noticed above, the contention of  Mr.Kashyap  is  that "sealing" and "closure" are interchangeable and, in effect signify the same end result.
</p> 

<p id="p_19">Is it so?
</p> 

<p id="p_20">13.  As  I see it, a closure order is an order prohibiting the use  of  the premises as respects which an order is made for any purpose which  violates the  provisions of the Act and would not operate to close such user  as  is not  found  offending the provisions of the Act. Closure of  the  industry, operation  or  process would thus imply closure of  only  manufacturing  or other  such  activity which is found offending the provisions  of  the  Act though the management and/or the workers of such Unit and even others  like customers etc. may still have easy or regulated ingress or egress from such a  Unit. Closure here would thus mean discontinuance of  the  objectionable activity.  An  order to seal the industry would lead to  consequences  much harsher  than closure. Sealing would prevent access to and egress from  (an area or space), and thus close (entrances) for this purpose. Sealing  means to  fasten with or as with seal; to close (an aperture, etc.)  securely  be placing  a  coating of wax, cement, or lead over the orfice, or,  in  wider sense, by any kind of festinating that must be broken before access can  be obtained. And if that be so, what happens to the other non-offending activities  of the petitioner? Closing down all industrial activity  is  neither the  purpose nor the object of the Act. Prevention of pollution is. If  one particular component is the cause of pollution, the Board may well, subject to  the  provisions of the Act, direct its closure but it cannot  seal  the entire  unit bringing thereby even unoffending activities to a  standstill. It  was  said that the Committee had to direct sealing of the Unit  as  the direction  of closure had not been acted upon. I feel this argument  itself goes  to  show  that 'closure' is not synonymous with  "sealing"  and  that though  sealing implies closure, it also, in effect, means much  more  than mere closure. In any case, if the Committee found its direction of  closure having not been acted upon it could take recourse to <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_29">section 37</a> of the Act.
</p> 

<p id="p_21">14.  As  for Mr.Kashyap's objection regarding maintainability of  the  writ petition,  I need say no more than this that as the direction to  seal  the Unit  is  not authorised by the Act, and is thus beyond the powers  of  the Committee, the writ would lie. For the reasons recorded above, the impugned direction  of  sealing the unit of the petitioner is quashed.  However,  no order is made as to costs.
