                          JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1"> 1.       The complainant No.1 is a registered company

     named as M/s. Peerless Engineering Products Private

     Limited, Bangalore and it represented by its complainant

     No.2 - Managing Director - S. Dorai Raju, filed the

     complaint u/s. 200 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>. alleging that the accused has

     committed the offence punishable u/s. 166 of the

     <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_2">Companies Act</a>, 2013. (Herein after referred as the 'Act')

</p><p id="p_2">2.        The complainant's case in brief is that the main

     object of complainant No.1 company i.e., M/s. Peerless

     Engineering Products Private Limited, Bangalore is to

     manufacture, import, export, purchase and to sell LPG

     stoves and other appliances in all kinds of varieties of

     forms. Accused was inducted as director of the company

     on 07.12.1993. The complainant No.2-Managing Director

     of the company met with accident in the Year - 2000 and

     he lost the eyesight. Accused assured that he would help

     him to manufacture paper cups, but instead of that he

     started to exploit the company and use the open land
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               3                       CC.No.233-17</span>


belonging to the company in illegal way. Accused brought

storage tanks for storing the acid for doing electroplating

business. The accused is doing the illegal activities without

the consent from the company and sitting on the land

which   does   not    belong      to     him.   The    carrying      of

electroplating business is illegal. Thus, the Karnataka

Pollution Control Board issued a show cause notice dated:

02.03.2015 to the company, for carrying out such activities

in violation of the provisions of Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. The accused issued the

reply dated: 04.03.2015 and 06.03.2015 to the said notice

on a fabricated letterhead. The letterhead not contains the

address of the registered office of the company as required

u/s. 12 of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_4">Companies Act</a> and that amounts to

commission of offence punishable u/s.12(8) of the Act. The

accused issued the reply and made the Karnataka

Pollution   Control   Board       that    he    has    done       with

electroplating business for wrongful gain and thus,

committed the offence punishable u/s. 447 of the Act. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4                   CC.No.233-17</span>


     accused also committed the forgery by signing the letter as

     a person authorized to represent the company and thereby

     committed the offence punishable u/s.416 and 419 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>.

     The accused intentionally violated the Pollution Laws and

     started the manufacturing of electroplating business. The

     accused is also preventing the Managing Director of the

     company from discharging his duties. The accused has

     also indulged in filing civil and criminal cases against the

     company and his intention to harass not only the company,

     but   also   the   Managing    Director   personally   taking

     advantage of his disability. The accused is acting against

     the interest of the company and he has been violating the

     duties as Director envisaged u/s. 166 of the Act, hence the

     complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.         On the presentation of complaint, cognizance was

     taken and thereafter, recording the sworn statement, the

     case was registered against the accused for the offence

     punishable u/s. 12(8), 166 and 447 of the Act and

     summons was issued to accused. Accused appeared
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  5                 CC.No.233-17</span>


     through his counsel and got enlarged on bail. Then, the

     copies of the complaint and other documents were

     furnished to him. Then, it revealed that the complaint is

     already filed for the offence punishable u/s. 447 of the

     <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>. and that involves the offence punishable u/s. 12(8)

     of the Act also. Thus, the accusation was framed only for

     the offence punishable u/s. 166 of the Act, and read over to

     the accused and he denied the accusation leveled against

     him and pleaded not guilty and claimed for trial

</p><p id="p_4">4.       To prove the case, the authorized person of the

     complainant got examined as P.w.1 and got marked the

     documents as Ex.p.1 to 7. While the cross examining

     P.w.1, the accused got marked Ex.D.1.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.       After closure of the complainant's side evidence, the

     statement of accused was recorded as provided u/s. 313 of

     <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>. The accused denied incriminatory evidence found

     against him and he did not choose to lead the defence

     evidence.

</p><p id="p_7">6.      Heard the arguments of the learned counsels of the

     complainant and accused. Perused the evidence on record

     &amp; documents. The points that arise for consideration are :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                         Point No.1: Whether the complainant
                         has proved that the accused acted
                         against the interest of the company
                         and he is violated the duties as
                         Director of the company and thereby
                         committed the offence punishable
                         u/s.166 of the Act ?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                          Point No.2: What order?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">7.     My findings on the above said points are as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                        Point No.1: In the Negative,

                        Point No.2: As per the final orders for the following:


                           REASONS

</blockquote><p id="p_9">8.      Point No.1:     The complainant No.1 is a registered

     company, complainant No.2 is the Managing Director. The

     accused is the Director of the complainant No.1 company.

     In the complaint, various allegations are made against the

     accused and most of them are already involved in the

     complaint filed against the accused, on which the case in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  7                  CC.No.233-17</span>


     CC. No 192/2016 was registered. The offence which not

     covered under the earlier complaint is the offence

     punishable under <a href="/doc/1047995/" id="a_8">section 166</a> of the Act.

</p><p id="p_10">9.         Firstly, it contended that Company hasn't authorized

     the Managing Director to file the complaint. It is argued that

     the Managing Director has no authority to file the complaint

     on behalf of the company. The complainant No.2 not

     produced the evidence to the effect that he authorized to

     file the complaint on behalf of the company. In the Article of

     Association of company, the power is not given to the

     Managing Director to file the criminal case on behalf of the

     company. It is not the case of complainant No.2 that the

     Board of Directors have authorized him to file the complaint

     against the accused. The Managing Director has right to

     file the complaint on his individual capacity against the

     Director of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.       Sec. 166 (2) to (7) of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_9">Companies Act</a>, 2013 deals

     with the duties of Directors. Sub-Sec.2 says that - the

     director of a company shall act in good faith in order to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                             8                  CC.No.233-17</span>


promote the objects of the company for the benefit of its

members as a whole, and in the best interest of the

company, its employees, the shareholders, the community

and for the protection of environment. Sub-Sec.3 says that

</p><p id="p_12">- the director of a company shall exercise his duties with

due and reasonable care, skill and diligence and shall

exercise independent judgment. Sub-Sec.4 says that - a

director of the company shall not involve in a situation in

which he may have a direct or indirect interest that

conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interest of the

company. Sub-Sec.5 says that - a director of a company

shall not achieve or attempt to achieve any undue gain or

advantage either to himself or to his relative, partners, or

associates and if such director is found guilty of making any

undue gain he shall be liable to pay an amount equal to

that gain to the company. Sub-Sec.6 says that - a director

of a company shall not assign his office and any

assignment so made shall be void. Sub.-Sec.7 says that - if

a director of the company contravenes the provisions of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                              9                CC.No.233-17</span>


  this section such director shall be punishable with fine

  which shall not be less than one lakh rupees, but which

  may extend to five lakh rupees.
</p>
<p id="p_13">11.      In the complaint, so many allegations are made and

  most of them are already covered in the pending cases.

  The sum and substances of the accusation involved in this

  case is that accused in contravention of objection of

  company, started the business of electroplating and

  thereby acted against the interest of the company. The

  complainant No.2-Sri.S.Dorai Raju examined as P.w.1

  deposed in line with complaint averments and produced the

  Memorandum and Articles of Association, notice dated:

  02.03.2015 issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control

  Board, the reply dated:06.03.2015 given the company,

  signed by the accused, the closure directions notice

  dated:18.08.2015 issued by the Karnataka State Pollution

  Control Board, the inspection report dated:17.07.2015, the

  company of the mahazar, notice dated:22.09.2015 issued
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                 10                       CC.No.233-17</span>


  by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board are marked

  as Ex.p.1 to 7.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12.     The   accused     produced        and      got   marked    the

  documents as Ex.D.1 and this document discloses that the

  complainant No.2 in the year 2012 filed the application to

  Karnataka State Pollution Control Board to give the

  consent for manufacture of machine equipments, hydraulic

  and pneumatic equipments with hard chrome plating. P.w.1

  in the cross examination admitted that he sought the

  permission to carry out the electroplating business with all

  safety measures. P.w.1 admitted that after submission of

  application, the concerned official visited the factory

  premises. The oral and documentary evidence referred

  above discloses that the complainant No.2 on behalf of the

  company     submitted   the        application    to    accord   the

  permission to start the electroplating business.

</p><p id="p_15">13.     The document is marked as Ex.p.2 discloses that

  the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board has issued

  show cause notice dated: 02.03.2015 to the company for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                              11                 CC.No.233-17</span>


  violating the directions. Ex.p.3 is the reply dated:

  06.03.2015 given by the accused. The documents is

  marked as Ex.p.4 to 6      disclose that the officials have

  inspected the premises of complainant No.1 company and

  then issued closure direction notice u/s.33(A) of the Water

  (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, R/w. Rule 34

  of the Karnataka State Board for Prevention and Control of

  Water Pollution (Procedure for Transaction of Business)

  and the (Prevention and Control Pollution ) Rules, 1976,

</p><p id="p_16">14.      The learned counsel of the complainant argued that

  accused started the business of electroplating and

  manufacturer of paper cups and it amounts to acting

  against the interest of the company. The evidence on

  record shows that it is the complainant No.2 applied for the

  permission to start the electroplating and there is no

  reliable evidence to the effect that the accused started the

  electroplating and paper cups in the company premises.

  Only for the reason that the accused issued the reply

  dated:06.03.2015 to the show cause notice issued by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                            12                          CC.No.233-17</span>


  Karnataka State Pollution Board, it cannot be held that the

  accused acted against the interest of the company. In the

  reply, the accused tried to protect the interest of the

  company. Thus, on appreciation of evidence on record, I

  hold that there is no reliable evidence to the effect that the

  accused acted against the interest of the company.

  Accordingly, this point is answered in negative.
