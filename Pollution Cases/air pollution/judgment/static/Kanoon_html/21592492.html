JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON)



</p><p id="p_3">1.     The Legislature has vested the Central Government with the

power to issue directions, in writing, to any person, officer or

authority, in exercise of its powers    and in performance of its

functions under the provisions of Section 5 of the Environmental

(Protection) Act, 1986 (for short 'the Act').   Section 5 has two

distinct and significant features.   Firstly, it opens with a 'non-

obstante' clause to give an overriding effect to such directions but

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                   3</span>
 such directions have to be subject to the provisions of the Act.

Secondly, in explanation to Section 5, the scope of the power to

issue directions has been described by use of inclusive language. It

extends to issuance of directions even for closure, prohibition or

regulation of any industry, operation or process. It further goes to

the extent of issuing directions with regard to the stoppage or

regulation of the supply of electricity or water or any other services.

This wide power has been vested in the Central Government with

the object to protect and enhance the environmental equality and

the Act was enacted with the purpose of providing for the uncovered

gaps that existed in the area of major environmental hazards. The

Legislature   enacted   a   general   legislation   on   environmental

protection which inter alia provided with the power to issue such

directions.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">2.   Section 6 of the Act empowers the Central Government, by

notification in the official gazette, to make rules in respect of all or

any of the matters referred in Section 3, which in turn empowers

the Central Government to take measures to protect and improve

the environment.    Section 6, thus, gives restricted powers to the

Central Government. This deficiency, however, is made up for under

the provisions of Section 25 of the Act where the Central

Government, may by notification in the official gazette, make rules

for carrying out the purposes of the Act. In other words, Section 5

and 25 both, give specific and general powers to the Central

Government to make rules. In exercise of the power under section

25 of the Act, the Central Government framed the Environment

 (Protection) Rules, 1986 (for short 'the Rules) which were notified on

19th November, 1986. How the powers of Section 5 of the Act are to

be exercised was elucidated by enacting the Rules, particularly

Rules 4 and 5 of the Rules. The said provisions read as under: -


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "4. Directions

          (1) Any direction issued under section 5 shall be in
          writing.

          to be taken and the time within which it shall be
          complied with by the person, officer or the
          authority to whom such direction is given.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">          (3) (a) The person, officer or authority to whom any
          direction is sought to be issued shall be served
          with a copy of the proposed direction and shall be
          given an opportunity of not less than fifteen days
          from the date of service of a notice to file with an
          officer designated in this behalf the objections, if
          any, to the issue of the proposed direction.

                any industry, operation or process and is
                sought to be issued to an officer or an
                authority, a copy of the proposed direction
                shall also be endorsed to the occupier of the
                industry, operation or process, as the case
                may be and objections, if any, filed by the
                occupier with an officer designated in this
                behalf shall be dealt with in accordance with
                the procedures under sub-rules (3a) and (4) of

          in sub-rule

          (3b) above for the stoppage or regulation of
          electricity or water or any other service was the
          resultant decision of the Central Government after
          such earlier hearing.</blockquote><p id="p_6">

given to the person, officer or authority to file
objections whichever is earlier, after considering
the objections, if any, received from the person,
officer or authority sought to be directed and for
reasons to be recorded in writing, confirm, modify
or decide not to issue the proposed direction.

(5) In case where the Central Government is of the
opinion that in view of the likelihood of a grave
injury to the environment it is not expedient to
provide an opportunity to file objections against the
proposed direction, it may, for reasons to be
recorded in writing, issue directions without
providing such an opportunity.

     requirement of notice under clause (a) of sub-rule (3).]"


</p><p id="p_24">3.   A bare reading of the above provisions makes it clear that Rule

4 and Rule 5 deals with the manner in which the power under

<a href="/doc/943898/" id="a_2">Section 5</a> shall be exercised as well as the procedure that the

Central Government is expected to adopt during such exercise.

From the reading of the above provisions it is clear that Rule 4

deals with the general directions that may be issued by the Central

Government and such proposed directions have to state the nature

of the action to be taken and the time within which such direction

should be complied with. That direction has to be served upon the

concerned person, officer or authority as per the procedure

prescribed. In terms of Rule 4 sub clause 3(b) where the proposed

direction is for stoppage or regulation of electricity, water or any

other service affecting the carrying on of any industry, operation or

process, then a copy of the said proposed direction shall be

endorsed to the occupier of the industry who shall have the right to

file the objection, if any, which then shall be dealt with as per the

procedure prescribed under sub-rules 3(a) and (4) of Rule 4.

However, an exception to the compliance of principles of natural

justice has been made in the proviso to Rules 2 and 3(b), which

state that no opportunity of being heard shall be given to the

person, if he had already been heard earlier and the proposed


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                    9</span>
 direction referred to in clause 3(b) of Rule 4 for the stoppage or

regulation of electricity, water or any other services was the

resultant decision of the Central Government after earlier hearing

and a direction so issued upon its service shall be binding upon

that person, officer or authority in terms of the Rules. On the other

hand, Rule 5 appears to restrict its application to the location of

industries and carrying on of processes and operations in different

areas. Sub-rule (1) of Rule 5 spells out the factors which have to be

taken into consideration while prohibiting or restricting the location

of an industry or carrying on of its processes or operations in

different areas. Rule 4 has its limited operation with regard to the

stoppage or regulation of water, electricity or any other services,

while Rule 5(2) lays emphasis upon prohibiting or restricting the

location of the industries and carrying on of processes or operations

in an area and the procedure that the Central Government is

required to follow in such cases. The scheme of different sub-rule

of Rule 5 is to provide an opportunity to the affected person to file

his objections/replies within the stipulated time.     Sub-rule 4 of

Rule 5 in a given situation but specifically excludes the application

of the principle of audi alteram partem in a specifically given

situation.   It empowers the Central Government to pass an order

without complying with the procedure contained in sub-Rule (3), i.e.

issuance of notice, right to file objections/reply and to decide the

matter thereafter within the stipulated time, but such power could

only be exercised upon recording of satisfaction that it is in 'public

interest' to do so.

</p><p id="p_26"> 4.     Whether one reads sub-rules 2 and 3(a) conjunctively or

disjunctively the power of the Central Government to issue

directions appears to apply and regulate the following:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">     a. It is expedient to impose prohibition or restriction on the

       location of an industry.

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">     b. It is expedient to impose prohibition or restriction on carrying

prejudicially affect the rights of a person. The Legislature obviously

was aware of the consequences of such serious nature but still

opted to specifically provide for the exclusion of the principles of

natural justice, though, only when, it was in 'public interest' to do

so.

<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">10. The appellant in this appeal holds rights of mining lease to an

iron ore mine known as 'CALSANICHOMATO DE OILOMOL IRON

ORE MINE' wherein TC No. 89/1952, located in Villages of Advalpal

and Tivim in Bicholim and Berdes Taluka, North Goa, District Goa.

These rights, according to the appellant were granted by the

erstwhile Portugal regime as title concession on 7th November, 1952

which was thereafter transmitted to the appellant by title of

transmission dated 31st August, 1959. These grants are stated to

be permanent grants conferring proprietary rights upon them.

However, on coming into force of the Goa, Daman and Diu Mining

Concessions (Abolition and Declaration as 'Mining Lease') Act, 1987

(for short 'the Abolition Act'), the concessions were abolished and

were deemed to be mining leases granted under the Mines and

Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_7">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957. The correctness

of this State action leading to abolition of such rights was

challenged unsuccessfully by the parties, including the appellant,

before the Bombay High Court by filing a writ.         The writ was

dismissed on 20th June, 1997. Being aggrieved from the judgment

of the High Court, the appellants had preferred a Special Leave

Petition before the Supreme Court, which is pending and a limited

interim order was passed in favour of the appellants.           Upon

complying with the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the

interim order, the appellants filed an application under the

Abolition Act and the Mineral Concessions Rules, 1960 for renewal

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                    14</span>
 of the lease.   The Central Government accorded its approval vide

order dated 24th July, 1989. The State Government renewed the

lease in accordance with law for a period of ten years.           The

appellant again applied for renewal for 20 years on 24th October,

2006.    According to the appellant, the lease has been deemed to

have been extended in terms of the Mineral Concession Rules,

1960.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">11.     It is specifically pleaded case of the appellant that the said

mine is not affected by any forest, either Government or private.

They claim to have carried out the mining operation since the year

1959 till recently, with a break, however for some years prior to

2008 due to economic and other reasons. The approval letter which

the appellant claims to have received for mining from the Indian

Bureau of Mines, the period is valid upto 2027. In the meanwhile,

the Environmental Impact Assessment notification dated 14th

September, 2006 was issued and the lease of the appellant was to

come up for renewal. The appellant applied for renewal under the

said notification and was granted the Environmental Clearance (EC)

on 4th May, 2007.      The appellant states that he had submitted

exhaustive details about the working of the mine, the impact on the

environment and it was only after following the stringent prescribed

procedure that the environmental clearance was granted to the

appellants after holding the screening, scrutiny, public hearing and

appraisals.     The appellant also obtained periodical renewal of

license to operate under The Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and The Water (Prevention and Control of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                    15</span>
 <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. They were obtained on 20th March, 2008 and

25th July, 2008 respectively and are in force. Thus, the appellant

has all the requisite licenses, permits and NOCs for carrying out the

mining activity in the said area.     The appellant claims to have

employed about 300 persons, directly and indirectly, and such

persons and their families are dependent upon the mining operation

for their livelihood. As parts of its corporate social responsibility,

the appellant has carried out extensive projects for the benefit of

the local community and has spent huge amounts for the social

needs and aspirations of the local community in the year 2011-12.


</p><p id="p_40">12. In the memorandum of appeal it has been stated by the

appellant specifically that the Central Government had appointed a

Commission under the Chairmanship of Justice M.B. Shah (Retired

Judge of the Supreme Court of India) under the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_10">Commission of

Inquiry Act</a>, 1952 vide notification dated 22nd November, 2010 to

examine illegal and unjustified mining activities going on in the

States of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, as a number of

complaints in that regard had been received by the Central

Government. Though, the State of Goa had not complained about

the mining activities but in the investigation carried out by Justice

Shah Commission and in the report submitted by it on 15th March,

2012 irregularity and unscrupulous operations with respect to the

mining activities in the State of Goa, that was also tabled before the

Parliament on 7th September, 2012 along with the Action Taken

Report of the Ministry of Mines, Government of India.       The said

report has neither been debated nor been accepted by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                    16</span>
 Parliament as of now.         Against the report of Justice M.B. Shah

Commission, the issue raised by the appellant is that they were

never granted any hearing in terms of <a href="/doc/1805627/" id="a_11">Sections 8(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/1805627/" id="a_12">8(c)</a> of the

Commission of Inquiry Act, 1962 and as such the same was non est

in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/211801/" id="a_13">State of Bihar v. L.K. Advani and Ors</a>. (2003) 8 SCC 361. Once the

report prepared by Justice M.B. Shah Commission was tabled

before the Parliament, the State of Goa vide its order dated 10 th

September, 2012 suspended all the mining operations with effect

from 11th September, 2012. The District Magistrate of North Goa

and South Goa also issued orders in relation to prohibiting the

movement and transportation of iron ore vide their order dated 11 th

and 12th September, 2012 respectively.        These orders have been

challenged by the appellant and the appeal is pending before the

High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">13. The appellant claims that it had been submitting six monthly

reports   in   terms   of   the   Environmental    Impact     Assessment

Notification   dated   14th    September,   2006   to   the    competent

authorities and they do not show any impermissible activity or

illegal mining by the appellant. Even an inspection of the premises

was conducted on 7th September, 2012 by the representatives of the

regional office of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF).


</p><p id="p_43">14. The MoEF issued a show cause notice to the appellant on 11 th

September, 2012 only on the sole ground that the appellant was

allegedly carrying out 'dumping mines'.        No other violation was

found or stated in the said show cause notice.          The show cause

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                      17</span>
 notice further called upon the appellant to show as to why the

environmental clearance granted to the appellant be not revoked

and the direction for closure be not issued.     The appellants also

raised the issue that there was no concept of 'dumping mines'

inasmuch as there was no element of excavation or mining of ores

from the dumps.     In fact, the appellant was obliged to stack the

dumps/overburden separately in terms of Rules 16 and 33 of the

MCDR, 1988. The appellant responded to this show cause notice

vide its reply dated 25th September, 2012 pointing out that not even

dumping handling leave alone dumping mining taken place at the

mining site of the appellant.      The State of Goa had already

suspended    the   handling   of   sub-grade    ore   pending   policy

formulation by the State vide its notice dated 27th September, 2011

and as such the show cause notice was without any basis.          The

appellant also stated the other factors as afore-noticed.


</p><p id="p_44">15. According to the appellant no final order and in fact any order

has been passed in furtherance to the said show cause notice dated

11th September, 2012 till date.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">16. According to the appellant after passing of the order of

suspension of mining and other prohibitory orders by the State of

Goa on 10th September, 2012 and 11th September, 2012, the

Minister for Environment &amp; Forests, Ms. Jayanthi Natarajan, had

visited the State of Goa sometime on 12th September, 2012 held a

Press Conference in which she declared that 'she suspends the ECs

of 93 mines in the State. The order will be sent by a separately

constituted Committee of my Ministry and the matter will be

 probed.'   This was extensively covered by the print media in the

State of Goa.    Thus, according to the appellant based on the

statement of the Minister and without any application of mind and

for that matter without any reasons to support their decision, the

respondents have issued the order dated 14th September, 2012 in a

most arbitrary manner and is opposed to all canons of natural

justice, equity and fair play. According to the appellant, the order

has been passed without providing them with an opportunity of

hearing, therefore the order passed enmasse. Once the proceedings

had been initiated by issuance of the show cause dated 11th

September, 2012 by the respondents, there was no justification in

law or otherwise to pass the impugned order. The said order is in

gross violation of the principles of natural justice, is ab initio void

and nonest and even suffers from non-application of mind. Thus,

they pray that the said order be quashed and/or set aside.

<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">17. The entire gamut of the submissions made on behalf of the

     Historically, "natural justice" has been used
     in a way "which implies the existence of moral
     principles of self-evident and unarguable
     truth". In course of time, Judges nurtured in
     the traditions of British jurisprudence, often
     invoked it in conjunction with a reference to
     "equity and good conscience". Legal experts of
     earlier generations did not draw any
     distinction between "natural justice" and
     "natural     law".   "Natural    justice"   was
     considered as "that part of natural law which
     relates to the administration of justice". Rules
     of natural justice are not embodied rules.
     Being means to an end and not an end in
     themselves, it is not possible to make an
     exhaustive catalogue of such rules. But two
     fundamental maxims of natural justice have
     now become deeply and indelibly ingrained in
     the common consciousness of mankind, as
     pre-eminently necessary to ensure that the
     law is applied impartially, objectively and

<p id="p_54">17. It must be noticed that the aim of rules of
natural justice is to secure justice, or to put it
negatively, to prevent miscarriage of justice.
Despite the fact that such rules do not have any
statutory character, their adherence is even more
important for the compliance of the statutory rules.
The violation of the principles of natural justice has
the effect of vitiating the action, be it
administrative or quasi-judicial, in so far as it
affects the rights of a third party. Flexibility in the
process of natural justice is an inbuilt feature of
this doctrine. Absolute rigidity may not further the
cause of justice and therefore adoption of flexibility
is important for applying these principles.

<p id="p_55">18. A Court or a Tribunal has to examine whether
the principles of natural justice have been violated
or not as a primary consideration, whenever and
wherever such an argument is raised. Test of
prejudice is an additional aspect. Normally,
violation of principles of natural justice, like non-
grant of hearing, would vitiate the action unless
the theory of 'useless formality' is pressed into
service and is shown to have a complete
applicability to the facts of Page 18 of 52 the case.
We may notice that this theory, though has been
accepted by the Courts, but is rarely applied.

     adequate so as to enable him to make his

     one of the most important principles of

     of fair play. The concept has gained
     significance and shades with time. When the
     historic document was made at Runnymede
     in 1215, the first statutory recognition of this
     principle found its way into the "Magna

               the principle was thus stated: (ER p. 420)

                     "Even God himself did not pass sentence
                     upon Adam before he was called upon to

                     'where art thou? Hast thou not eaten of
                     the tree whereof I commanded thee that
                     thou shouldest not eat?' "Since then the
                     principle has been chiselled, honed and
                     refined, enriching its content. Judicial
                     treatment    has    added     light  and

<p id="p_57">18. The audi alteram partem rule is intended to inject justice into

law. It cannot be applied to defeat the ends of justice or to make

the law 'lifeless, absurd, stultifying, self-defeating or plainly

contrary to the common sense of the situation.' It is a rule of vital


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                   23</span>
 importance in the field of administrative law and it must not be

jettisoned,   save   in    very   exceptional    circumstances      where

compulsive necessity so demands. It is a wholesome rule designed

to secure the rule of law and the court should not be too ready to

eschew it in its application to a given case. The Court must make

every effort to salvage this cardinal rule to the maximum extent

permissible in a given case. It must not be forgotten that 'natural

justice is pragmatically flexible and is amenable to capsulation

under the compulsive pressure of circumstances.            The aim is to

secure justice or to prevent miscarriage. Where the statute is silent

about the observance of principles of natural justice, then such

statutory silence is taken to imply compliance with the principles of

natural justice. The implication of natural justice being presumptive

in nature may be excluded by express words of the statute or by

necessary intendment.       The real conflict is between the public

interest and the private interest.      Not only, therefore, can the

principles of natural justice be modified but in exceptional cases

they could even be excluded. There are well-defined exceptions to

the nemo judex in causa sua as also to audi alteram partem rule.

There are certain well recognized exceptions to the audi alteram

partem rule established by judicial decisions and they are

summarized by S.A. de Smith in Judicial Review of Administrative

Action, 2nd ed., at pages 168 to 179. If we analyse these exceptions

a little closely, it will be apparent that they do not in any way

militate   against   the   principle   which    requires   fair   play   in

administrative action. The word 'exception' is really a misnomer


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                                         24</span>
 because in these exclusionary cases, the audi alteram partem rule is

held inapplicable not by way of an exception to "fair play in action",

but because nothing unfair can be inferred by not affording an

opportunity to present or meet a case. Since the life of the law is not

logic but experience and every legal proposition must, in the

ultimate analysis, be tested on the touchstone of pragmatic realism,

the audi alteram partem rule would, by the experiential test, be

excluded, if importing the right to be heard has the effect of

paralyzing the administrative process or the need for promptitude

or the urgency of the situation so demands.

<p id="p_58">
</p><p id="p_59">19. Where a statutory provision either specifically or by inevitable

implication excludes the application of the rules of natural justice,

then the court cannot ignore the mandate of the legislature.

Whether or not the application of the principles of natural justice in

a given case has been excluded, wholly or in part, in the exercise of

statutory power, depends upon the language and basic scheme of

the provision conferring the power, the nature of the power, the

purpose for which it is conferred and the effect of exercise of that

power.   A statute conferring power can, by express language,

exclude the application of principles of natural justice. It is neither

unknown nor unacceptable.       If the legislation and the necessity of

a situation can exclude the principles of natural justice, including

the audi alteram partem rule, a fortiori so can a provision of the

Constitution, for a Constitutional provision has a far greater and

all-pervading sanctity than a statutory provision (Refer : <a href="/doc/1766147/" id="a_19">Maneka

Gandhi v. Union of India and Anr</a>. (1978) 1 SCC 248).

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                                     25</span>
</p><p id="p_60"> 20. Normally, the test that is adopted by the Courts while dealing

with the exclusion is that exclusion of application of audi alteram

partem rule to cases where nothing unfair can be inferred by not

affording an opportunity to present and meet a case. Now, it is true

that since the right of prior notice and opportunity of hearing arises

only by implication from the duty to act fairly, or to use the words

of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest, from 'fair play in action', it may

equally be excluded where, having regard to the nature of the action

to be taken, its object and purpose and the scheme of the relevant

statutory provision, fairness in action does not demand its

implication and even warrants its exclusion. Thus, it is seen from

the decision in Maneka Gandhi (supra) that there are certain

exceptional   circumstances     and   situations      whereunder    the

application of the rule of audi alteram partem is not attracted. A.K

</p><p id="p_61">21. The above stated principles clearly show that the principles of

natural justice can also be subject to exceptions. These exceptions

would   depend    upon    the   language   of   the    provision,   the

circumstances and facts of a given case.           Compliance to the

principles of natural justice is general rule and non-observance,

even on the strength of a statutory provision is exception. There are

cases where the courts have declined to issue writ for compliance to

the principles of natural justice even in absence of an excluding

provision where it would have made no difference or the facts,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                                     26</span>
 would indisputably lead to that conclusion alone. But in the case

in hand, both proviso to Rule 4(3)(b) and Rule 5(4) provide for

specific exclusion of the principles of natural justice. Of course, the

limitations stated in those provisions have to be strictly adhered to.

If the authority concerned desires to rely upon the exclusion clause

under Rule 4, then it must be certain that the affected party has

already been heard earlier and the proposed direction was the

resultant decision of the Central Government after such earlier

hearing.   While if the authority wishes to exclude applicability of

principles of natural justice with reference to the provisions of Rule

5(4), then it must record its satisfaction that the public interest so

demands such exclusion. Adherence to these principles would be

necessary as otherwise it would be difficult for the Tribunal to hold

that recourse to exclusion clause to the principles of natural justice

was not proper and would call for no interference.         The above

provision clearly indicate the specific intention of the Legislature to

exclude the applicability of the doctrine of audi alteram partem

while the Central Government issues directions under <a href="/doc/1113701/" id="a_20">Section 5</a> of

the Act read in conjunction with Rules 4 and 5 of the Rules. Still

this has to be kept in mind that these exclusion clauses are an

exception to the general rule of grant of time, opportunity and

hearing to the applicant in terms of the scheme of these very rules.

To put it simply, the Central Government is vested with the power

of issuing directions de hors, compliance to the principles of natural

justice but in strict compliance to the conditions stated in the

Rules.

exception to the rule of audi alteram partem, as contemplated under

sub-rule 3 of the said rule. The Central Government is vested with

the power to dispense with the requirement of serving a notice in

accordance with the scheme of Rule 3(a) to 3(d) of Rule 5 requiring

a person to whom direction is sought to be passed to file objections

to the proposed prohibition or restriction in relation to carrying on

of an industrial or commercial activity. This power is not

omnipotent but is a power which is of limited application. This can

be pressed into service by the Central Government only when it is

in public interest to do so. In other words, dispensation of

compliance to the principles of natural justice can be taken

recourse to only when the public interest so demands, and the

Central Government is expected to form an opinion that such is the

requirement of public interest. Ordinarily, compliance to the rules

of natural justice, as envisaged in Rule 3, is mandatory and cannot

be overlooked. Thus, we must understand what the expression

'public interest' means and how it applies.

authorities for protection and regulation of human environment,

providing safeguards from hazardous substances and punishment

considered in the light of the same. It is a settled canon of

interpretation of statutes that a provision or an expression should

be interpreted while keeping in mind the entire legislation, its

objects and the public purpose that is sought to be achieved by

enforcement of such enactment. As already noticed, <a href="/doc/1113701/" id="a_22">Section 5</a> of

     and subserve public interest than making it
     available for residential use. Public interest
     floats in a vast, deep ocean of ideas, and
     "imagined experiences". It would seem to us
     wise for the courts not to venture into this
     unchartered minefield. We are not exercising
     our will. We cannot impose our own values on

against the interest of an individual i.e. the member
of the service to whom the extension is sought to be
given and this has to be balanced by the
Government with reference to the record based
opinion and settled canons of administrative
jurisprudence. The public interest must be
construed in relation to its true context and with
reference to the facts of a given case. It is so
because this expression is capable of being given a
very different meaning in different contexts. The

new dimension. In exercise of certain powers by the Government,

this principle is of paramount consideration. The doctrine of

legitimate expectation and promissory estoppel cannot be pressed

into service by a citizen where the public interest justifies action of

the State. Where the public interest will be harmed, individual

rights must give way to rights of the society at large. Public interest

must take precedence over individual interest as it is an expression

which takes in its ambit the concept of responsibility and fair

governance. Public interest, therefore, has to be considered and

applied on the basis of the facts and circumstances of a given case.

It must be examined with reference to both specific statutory

provisions and the scheme of the Act.

<p id="p_80">27. Public interest in the present case has to be read in

conjunction     with   environmental     protection.   Environmental

protection must attain paramount consideration and other private

interests including other minor interests must give in. In the case

of Monek Ispat and Union of India and Ors. 2012(7) SCC 50, the

Supreme Court took the view that rivers, forests, minerals and such

other resources constitute the natural wealth of the nation. These

resources are not to be frittered away by any generation. However,

one generation owes a duty to all succeeding generations to

preserve, protect and develop the natural resources in the best

possible way.    It is the right of the next generation and in the

interest of mankind to protect and preserve the environment. The

 Central Government has under its control the regulation of mines

and development of minerals. Thus, legally it casts a special duty

on the Central Government to take necessary steps for conservation

and development of minerals in India. <a href="/doc/116114/" id="a_27">Section 17</a> of the Mines and

Minerals (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_28">Development) Act</a>, 1957 authorises the

Central Government itself to undertake prospecting or mining

operations under any area not already held under any prospecting

licence or mining lease. This is sufficiently indicative of the fact that

protection of mines and minerals is the obligation of the State as

well as to ensure environmental protection.          On humanitarian

grounds, and also as per the intent of the statute, it is the balance

between public and private interests that the authorities are

expected to maintain. Illegal mining is bound to affect the

environmental and ecological balance. Thus, wherever public

interest so demands, Government must stop and prevent such

illegal mining which would have devastating effects on the

environment of that area.

<p id="p_84">32. There is a close relationship between public interest on the

one hand and sustainable development on the other. It is

demonstrably clear from the above discussion that the expression

'public interest' used by the legislature in Rule 5(4) has to have a

direct nexus to the environmental protection. The direction which is

sought to be issued in exercise of the powers conferred under this

Rule has to be for the protection of environment as well as the

greater and urgent need to protect the environment for the good of

the public at large by dispensing with the principles of natural

justice.

<p id="p_85">Discussion on merits

</p><p id="p_86">33. Before we examine the other contentions, we must deal with

the factual matrix of the case and contentions related thereto. There

is no doubt that the appellant had obtained permissions from

various authorities and had also obtained the environmental

clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). It

is also undisputed that the show cause notice dated 11th

September, 2012 had been served upon the appellant raising the

sole complaint in relation to 'dump mine'. To this, the appellant

submitted a reply on 25th September, 2012. No final order with

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                                   36</span>
 reference to the said show cause notice has yet been passed by any

competent authority. The authorities, before issuing the show cause

notice dated 11th September, 2012, had inspected the mining lease

of the appellant. It was stated that the two conditions mentioned in

the notice had been violated and they related to the following:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_46">     "(i)   No change in mining technology and scope of

     working shall be made without prior approval of the

     Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests, and

     excavation, quantum of mineral, iron ore and waste shall

     be made."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_87">34. For violation of the above, it was proposed to revoke the

environmental clearance. Undisputedly, as already noticed, final

order in that regard had not been passed. It has even been

specifically stated by the applicant in his application itself that

showed that the Commission was constituted under the provisions

of the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_32">Commission of Inquiry Act</a>, 1952 to go into illegal mining in a

number of States, including Goa. The Shah Commission had

submitted its report, which was placed before the Parliament on 7 th

September, 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_88">35. It can usefully be noticed at this stage that in the summary

and recommendations made by the Shah Commission in relation to

mining activity in Goa, it had noticed that the right to development

must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet the developmental needs of

the present and future generations. While noticing this principle, it

pointed out various unacceptable activities being carried on with


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                                                   37</span>
 mining operations and, therefore, it inter alia recommended as

follows:-

            operations of all such mines should be kept under
            suspension. The Standing Committee should take
            note of enhanced 192 production, approved by IBM
            and MoEF for the leases falling within 10 kms. The
            production should be reduced equivalent to
            production during the year 2000-2001.

<blockquote id="blockquote_50">            i. On perusal of records of Environmental

             sensitive zone, though many leases falls within 10
             kms. from protected areas (16 EC approvals before
             4.12.2006 and 25 EC approvals after 4.12.2006
             for 50 mining leases). Such leases should be
             identified and action be taken. This should be
             considered as an undue favour extended to the
             lessees. Action should be initiated against all the
             officers/officials of MoEF who are involved in
             ignoring this well-known fact in Goa State.

            specific condition for the mining leases though they
            are having the same parameters yardsticks while
            according Environmental Clearances under the EIA
            Notifications during the year from 2005 to 2010.
            Further, after imposing conditions, no action has
            been taken to follow up and for implementation of
            the conditions. Though this matter was in full
            knowledge of MoEF (Environment, Wildlife Wings)
            but the officers remain silent on the issue and

              Member Secretary of GSPCB is arbitrary,
              discriminatory and shown undue favour to some of

              complete co-ordination."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_89">36.   While    making    the   above   recommendations,    the   Shah

Commission also noticed that many of the lessees have crossed the

leased boundary and illegally extracted minerals from outside the

leased areas. It also noticed that the extraction of excessive iron ore

in Goa would result in the iron ore to disappear from the State of

Goa much earlier than expected.
</p>
<p id="p_90">37. The State of Goa, immediately after placement of the report

before the Parliament, passed a general order on 10 th September,

2012 suspending all the mining operations in Goa, including that of

the applicant. While this order was in force, it appears that the

Union Minister of State for Environment and Forests (Independent

Charge) had gone to Goa and made a statement that the

environmental clearance granted in respect of 93 mines in that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                                     39</span>
 State shall be suspended. Thereafter, on 14-09-2012, the impugned

order came to be passed. The impugned order dated 14-09-2012

was passed in exercise of the powers vested in the Ministry in terms

of <a href="/doc/1113701/" id="a_33">Section 5</a> of the Act. It was directed in this order that the

environmental clearance granted in each of the 139 cases by MoEF

shall be kept in abeyance pending detailed inquiry in each case.

</p><p id="p_91">38. In paragraph 7 of this order, it was specifically noticed that

immediate action in public interest was required to be taken, and

therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred under Rules 4(5) and

5(4) of the Rules, the action was taken without giving notice to the

appellant. Thus, the order was passed in public interest, keeping in

mind the Shah Commission's report, which was placed before the

Parliament on 7th September, 2012. Thus, it is obvious that the

Central Government had taken note of the entire record, including

Justice M.B. Shah Commission's report and the other orders, as is

evident from the impugned order, and then passed the order, in

public interest, suspending the environmental clearance granted to

the appellant. Thus, in the light of the above provisions, now we

have to examine whether the order dated 14th September, 2012 is

violative of the principles of natural justice or suffers from any of

the infirmities, as contended before the Tribunal at the very

threshold.
</p>
<p id="p_92">39. It is not correct to contend that the impugned order does not

state any reasons. On the contrary, the impugned order refers to

the background as well as to the reasons which have persuaded the

competent authority to exercise its powers in an urgent manner and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                                   40</span>
 in public interest. The authority has taken into consideration the

contents and records leading to the passing of the order by the

State government dated 10-09-2012. They have also noticed that

there are violations of environmental norms, statutory requirements

and apprehension of large scale illegalities in the mining operations

in the State of Goa. This prima facie view is not ill-founded. It is

based upon the Shah Commission's report, which document was

prepared after site inspection, collection of evidence and in

accordance with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_34">Commission of Inquiry Act</a>,

1952. Thus, we are unable to accept the contention that the

impugned order is based on no material and does not state any

reason. It is true that administrative orders must give reasons but

not like judgments of courts. The authorities are expected to apply

their mind to examine the matter from a wide perspective and with

reference to the controversy in the issue. The authorities have

referred to the records in the impugned order and some of these

records have also been produced before us. In our considered

opinion, the order is neither vitiated for want of application of mind

nor for non-recording of reasons.       The order ex facie shows

application of mind and some reasons have certainly been recorded

in the impugned order. The grievance with regard to breach of the

conditions of environmental clearance notified by the appellant is

separately pending before the competent authority in furtherance to

the show cause notice dated 11th September, 2012. Those

proceedings have not culminated into passing of any final order as

of now. It is apparent that in view of the Shah Commission's report,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                                    41</span>
 there is an imminent threat to the environment as well as untimely

exhaustion of mining reserves of iron ore in the State of Goa. It is

bound to have adverse effects on the ecology of the area, thereby

disturbing the ecological and natural balance in the State of Goa.

This would apparently amount to irreparable damage to the

environment and the ecology. Lest the damage of such a magnitude

should take place, it is always wiser to take preventive measures

rather than to expose the State to the kind of danger indicated in

the Shah Commission's report.
</p>
<p id="p_93">40. The order, in the present case, is for suspension of the

environmental clearance during pendency of the main proceedings,

thus, is preventive in nature.
</p>
<p id="p_94">41. Another very important aspect that we cannot ignore in the

facts of the present case, is that taking note of the Shah

Commission's report, the Supreme Court in Writ Petition No. 435 of

2012, <a href="/doc/1369159/" id="a_35">Goa Foundation v. Union of India</a> on 5th October, 2012, not

only required the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to submit

its report but also passed the following restraint order:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">          "A preliminary report from the CEC should reach
          this Court within four weeks from today. Put up on
          receipt of the report from the CEC.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_56">               Till further orders, all mining operations in the
          leases identified in the Shah Commission's report
          and transportation of iron ore and manganese ore
          from those leases, whether lying at the mine-head
          or stockyards, shall remain suspended, as
          recommended in the Commission's report.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_57">                IA Nos. 2580 and 2669 in Writ Petition (Civil)
          No. 202 of 1995 may also be listed along with this
          writ petition."
</blockquote>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                                                   42</span>
<p id="p_95"> 42. From the above order, it is clear that carrying on of mining

activities, transportation of iron ore, manganese, etc. had been

suspended. Thus, there are three different orders in force -

suspending any carrying on of mining activity in the State of Goa by

all the mine-lease owners including the appellant.

</p><p id="p_96">43. The judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/189070545/" id="a_36">Onkar Lal Bajaj v. Union

of India</a>, (2003) 2 SCC 673, is relied upon by the applicant wherein

it held that the enmasse order cancelling the allotment of petrol

pumps was vitiated.     We are not impressed with this contention

inasmuch as the facts of that case were entirely different than the

facts of the case in hand. In the present case, there are multiple

orders passed by different authorities and the Supreme Court of

India, suspending the mining activity in the State of Goa. It is not

that the mining leases of various persons including the appellant

had been cancelled. In fact, a detailed inquiry is contemplated

before the Supreme Court and CEC has been asked to submit a

report in a similar case while the MoEF is conducting a detailed

investigation where the appellants have been asked to put forward

their entire case. Thus, in our opinion, the appellant cannot derive

any advantage from the judgment of the Supreme Court in Onkar

Lal Bajaj case supra.
</p>
<p id="p_97">44. Now, we will proceed to examine the merits of the contentions

raised by the appellant that the impugned order suffers from the

vice of arbitrariness and legal malice. Reliance in support of this

contention is placed upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                                                  43</span>
 the case of Kalabharati Advertisement v. Hemant Vimalnath Nari

Chania &amp; Ors. (2010) 9 SCC 437.
</p>
<p id="p_98">45. No doubt it is a settled proposition of law that the State must

act fairly without ill-will or malice in fact or in law. 'Legal' or 'lawful'

or 'malice in law' has been explained in that judgment of the

Supreme Court as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_58">           "Legal Malice:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_59">           25. The State is under obligation to act fairly
           without ill will or malice- in fact or in law. "Legal
           malice" or "malice in law" means something done
           without lawful excuse. It is an act done wrongfully
           and wilfully without reasonable or probable
           cause, and not necessarily an act done from ill
           feeling and spite. It is a deliberate act in disregard
           to the rights of others. Where malice is attributed
           to the State, it can never be a case of personal ill-
           will or spite on the part of the State. It is an act
           which is taken with an oblique or indirect object.
           It means exercise of statutory power for "purposes
           foreign to those for which it is in law intended." It
           means conscious violation of the law to the
           prejudice of another, a depraved inclination on
           the part of the authority to disregard the rights of
           others, which intent is manifested by its injurious
           acts. (Vide Addl. Distt. <a href="/doc/165099707/" id="a_37">Magistrate, Jabalpur v.

 the facts and circumstances of a given case. Malice in law means

something done in law without lawful excuse. It presupposes an

act done wrongly without sufficient cause and reason. The plea of

legal malice is sought to be substantiated in the present case on the

basis that the impugned order was followed by the statement made

by the Minister of Environment and Forests, a day prior to the order

in Goa. In other words, a political statement made has resulted in

passing of an omniscient order and thus has the element of

arbitrariness. May be this argument appears to be attractive at the

first blush but is found to be without substance when examined in

some depth. Normally, if a political statement was made and an

order was passed solely on that ground such an order may be liable

to be set aside if it was unsubstantiated by records, had no reasons

and was a result of non-application of mind. But that is not the

situation herein.   We have already held that there was sufficient

record before the competent authority, i.e. the Shah Commission

Report, the order of the State Government dated 10 th September,

2012 and the show cause notice dated 11th September, 2012.

Furthermore, the mining activity falls in two domains. The State

Government can decline or reject an application filed by a person

for obtaining grant of lease for mining activity while the EC is to be

given by the Central Government.      Thus, both the State and the

Central Governments have functions to perform together though in

separate realms.    In these separate, well-defined fields, the order

passed by the Central Government may even be to remove or

correct the jurisdictional error in the entire process. The statement


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                                    45</span>
 of the Minister cannot be taken in abstract, de hors other attendant

circumstances but must be examined in light of the other factors

which would justify passing of the impugned order dated 14 th

September, 2012. In the case of Kalabharti Advertising (supra), the

Hon'ble Supreme Court was somewhat concerned with a different

issue and on the facts that the Corporation had passed an order in

furtherance to an order passed by the High Court itself and

therefore, the objection with regard to the maintainability of a

petition before the Hon'ble Supreme Court while by-passing the

High Court was held to be not tenable. Not only the statement of

the Minister, but also the impugned order clearly show application

of mind with reference to the records and the directive being issued

in the larger public interest. It was not a case of an appeal from

one's own order to oneself. Having examined the cumulative effect

of the record before us and the contentions raised we are unable to

hold that the impugned order suffers either from the vice or

arbitrariness or that of legal malice.

Prejudice and Theory of Useless or Empty formalities : -

</p><p id="p_101">47. The law as stated in Ridge v. Burbin 1964 AC 40 that breach of

principle of natural justice was in itself treated as prejudice and

that no other defect/prejudice need to be proved.        It was also

expressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1306907/" id="a_44">S.L. Kapur v.

Jagmohan</a> (1981) 1 SCR 746 to say that non-observance of

principles of natural justice is itself prejudice to any man and proof

of prejudice independently of proof of denial of natural justice is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                                                    46</span>
 unnecessary. It will come from a person who has denied justice that

the person who has been denied justice is not prejudiced. With the

passage of time and with the development of law, law underwent a

significant change. In the case of Malloch v. Aberdeen Corporation

(1971) 2 All England Reporter 1278 stated: "a great many

arguments might have been put forward but if none of them had

any chance of success then I can see no good reason why the

respondents should have given the appellant a hearing, nor can I

see that he was prejudiced in any way." Where the Courts took the

view that there can be certain situations in which an order passed

in violation of natural justice need not be set aside under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_45">Article

226</a> of the Constitution of India where no prejudice is caused to the

person concerned and as such interference is not necessary.         <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_46">In

M.C. Mehta v. Union of India</a> (1999) 3 SCR 1173 the latter has then

consistently been followed by the courts.    The view accepted was

that unless it is shown that non-observance has caused prejudice

to the person concerned for the reason that quashing the order may

revive another order which is itself illegal or unjustified. The order

without strict observance of natural justice may not be set aside.

The basis for such a view was that on admitted or undisputable

facts if only one conclusion could be drawn which the authorities

have   taken, then the element of prejudice would            lose   its

significance. Non-observance of principles of natural justice must,

thus, satisfy some real prejudice being caused to the person

concerned and not that it was merely a technical infringement of

principles of natural justice. This view has also been reiterated by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                                                     47</span>
 the Courts that the breach of natural justice by itself would not be

prejudicial if the undisputable proposition shows no arbitrariness

on the part of the authorities concerned.     Not mere violation of

natural justice but de facto prejudice other than non-issuance of

notice had to be proved.
</p>
<p id="p_102">48. To sustain the allegation of violation of principles of natural

justice, one must establish that prejudice has been caused to him

for non-observance of such principles. It is a settled legal position

that an order is to be examined on the touchstone of doctrine of

prejudice.
</p>
<p id="p_103">49. Thus, it is evident that the law of prejudice stands on somewhat

similar footing in India as well as in England. [<a href="/doc/309285/" id="a_47">Ajit Kumar Nag v.

General Manager (PJ), Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., Haldia and Ors</a>.

AIR 2005 SC 4217]

</p><p id="p_104">50. Still the principles of natural justice cannot be imprisoned in a

strait-jacket formula. They are not rigid or immutable. They must

be applied and construed on the facts of a given case.         Their

observance would depend upon the factual situation of each case.

Whether, in fact, prejudice has been caused to the concerned

person or not on account of denial of the requirements of natural

justice to him, must be considered on the facts of a given case. The

doctrine of prejudice has to be established by a plea and preferably

by proof. The Courts have also taken the view now that if there is

no prejudice, least would be chances of the court setting aside the

order only on the ground that no hearing was granted.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                                                   48</span>
</p><p id="p_105"> 51. While applying the principles to the present case, the appellants

have failed to show any prejudice that has resulted from the alleged

non-grant of the right of hearing to them. It is not in dispute before

us that an interim order was passed by means of the impugned

order suspending the mining activity. No hearing had been granted

to the appellants. We have already noticed that there were records,

reports and orders which had found large scale illegalities,

irregularities and extraction of iron and manganese ore in excess of

the leased area.   Inter alia it was also recommended that mining

activity, including that of the appellant, should be banned. These

records are:
</p>
<p id="p_106">
  a. Shah Commission Report which had even been tabled before

     the Indian Parliament.
</p>
<p id="p_107">  b. Order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 5th October, 2012

     banning the mining activity.
</p>
<p id="p_108">  c. Order passed by the State of Goa dated 10th September, 2012

     prohibiting carrying on of mining activity in the leased mining

     areas and the show cause noticed dated 11th September, 2012.

     These were the voluminous records which had been examined

     by the authority which applied its mind and even mentioned

     them in the order dated 14th September, 2012 banning the

     mining activity.
</p>
<p id="p_109">
</p><p id="p_110">52. Even if this order had not been given effect to, still other orders

producing the same results are in force. The appellants are duly

represented before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and had the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                                                     49</span>
 occasion to put forward their cases before the Shah Commission.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court has not varied its order dated 15th

September, 2012 till date and even the order passed by the State

Government has been in force.       Thus, all the contentions and

undisputable facts before us lead only to one conclusion that no

prejudice has been caused to the appellant for non-grant of hearing

to them. Only one view was possible that no different order could

follow, more so in the larger public interest.   Similarly, no other

view is possible even before the Tribunal that no prejudice has been

caused to the appellants for they having not been provided any

hearing pre-passing of the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_111">53. Natural Justice means 'fairplay in action' and a clear

distinction must be drawn between a case of 'no notice' or 'no

hearing' on the one hand and a case of 'no fair hearing' or

'inadequate hearing' on the other. If the defect is of the former

category and arises out of statutory obligations in the given case it

may automatically make the order invalid but, if the defect is of the

latter category the element of prejudice and failure of justice are

required to be examined then it is only when such a conclusion is

reached that the order may be declared invalid. One of the known

but rare exceptions to the rule of audi alteram partem is the theory

of 'useless or empty formality'. Where on admitted or undisputed

facts, the view taken by the impugned order is the only possible

view and it would be futile to issue any writ to compel observance of

natural justice. Then this is called the 'useless or empty formality

theory'. This theory has been considered at some length by the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                                                   50</span>
 Supreme Court of India in the case of Aligarh Muslim University

supra as well as in M C Mehta supra. In the present case the

appellants have not been able to show demonstrable prejudice

beyond doubt and that the result would have been different had

they been provided with an opportunity to present their case. Thus

compliance to natural justice can be avoided because admitted and

undisputed facts lead prima facie only to one conclusion that the

appellants have indulged in violation of conditions of EC and lease

terms and, therefore, the theory can be brought into service.


</p><p id="p_112">54. In the present case, one very important aspect that the

Tribunal has to keep in mind is that the impugned order is not a

final order, it is only an order of suspension during the pendency of

a detailed inquiry to be conducted by the MoEF. It is in this

background and the fact that various other orders and reports with

similar directions against the appellant, including orders of the

Supreme Court of India dated 5th October, 2012 have already been

passed and to be enforced, that the facts of the present case have to

be examined by the Tribunal. Even if the applicants have been

granted a hearing, they would in no way be in a position to show

that the reports/orders of the highest Court of the land as well as

the State Government were without jurisdiction or were erroneous.

Even if for the sake of argument it is assumed that the appellant

could advance such an argument, the same would inconsequential

as the MoEF would not be in a position to accept such an

argument. Thus, no fruitful purpose would be served and in fact, in

the facts and circumstances of the cases, the hearing even if

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                                                   51</span>
 granted would be futile. On the cumulative examination of the facts

of the present case and report before the Tribunal, it is clear that

the theory of useless or empty formality, to some extent, if not in its

entirety, would be applicable to the present case.


</p><p id="p_113">55. Having rejected all the contentions raised on behalf of the

applicant, still, we must observe that the impugned order was

passed on 14th September, 2012 and even till date, the proceedings

have not been concluded. In other words, the order dated 14th

September, 2012, has not culminated into passing of a final order

by the competent authority. The order was passed during the

pendency of a detailed inquiry and investigation to be conducted by

the MoEF to come to final conclusion whether direction regarding

suspending and prohibiting mining activities which has resulted in

revocation of the EC granted by the MoEF on 4th May, 2007 needs

to be passed or not. There can be no justification in the eye of law,

that MoEF should keep this aspect pending for an indefinite period.

The applicant has right to carry on a business that in law they are

entitled to. Closure of their business certainly invades their rights.

Thus, it would be expected that of the MoEF to pass the final order

upon detailed inquiry expeditiously and without undue delay.


</p><p id="p_114">56. In light of the reasons aforestated and while declining to

interfere with the impugned order date 14th September, 2012, we

hereby direct the MoEF to complete its detailed inquiry and pass

appropriate orders/directions as expeditiously as possible and in

any case, not later than three months from today.
