vide which appeal filed by the petitioner against order dated 31.3.2011

was dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">          It is not in dispute between the parties that initially the plot in

which the factory has been established by the petitioner was allotted to

one M/s Northern Glass Industries Limited to set up a glass factory. It

was a condition in the allotment letter issued to M/s Northern Glass

Industries Limited that if the compensation amount is enhanced in

future, the same shall be paid by the company. However, the above

named company failed to pay the enhanced amount which resulted into

attachment of the land in execution proceedings initiated on an

application moved by the land owners for payment of enhanced

compensation, lateron the property was put up on sale. The petitioner is

one of the purchaser. An application was moved to get a "No Objection"

Certificate under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_7">Sections 21</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_8">22</a> of the 1981 Act and <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_9">Sections 25</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_10">26</a>

of the 1974 Act to set up a leather cloth industry but the same was

rejected on a ground that the petitioner has set up the factory on a

disputed plot. It is an admitted case on record that for violation of the

condition of the allotment, the plot allotted to M/s Northern Glass

Industries Limited was resumed and the said company had come to this

Court by filing a writ petition viz. Civil Writ Petition No. 3750 of 2005

challenging the order of resumption . As per the information supplied,

the said writ petition was allowed vide order dated 11.12.2007 and the

authorities were directed to decide the matter afresh after giving an

opportunity of hearing to M/s Northern India Glass Industries Limited

and the petitioner, in the present petition. However, the State of Haryana

has filed an appeal against the said order dated 11.12.2007 passed by

this Court, in the Hon'ble the Supreme Court, which is pending, wherein

status quo has been ordered.
</p>
<p id="p_8">          Taking notice of the above facts, we dispose of this writ

petition by giving liberty to the petitioner to file a fresh application for

getting "No Objection Certificate" as per the provisions of the above

Acts. It is made clear that this order shall not be treated as a hurdle in

case fresh application is moved.
