JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_1">Rule.
</p><p id="p_2">	Learned APP Mr. K.P. Rawal waives service of rule for respondent
	State.
</p>	  

<p id="p_3">The
	petitioner  seeks quashing of complaint Annexure-A. Complaint is
	with respect to pollution allegedly caused by original accused no.1
	which was a private limited company. Rest of the accused were stated
	to be the Directors of the said company. The petitioners are
	original accused No. 4 and 5. In the complaint it is stated
	inter-alia that accused No.1 is a private limited company, accused
	No. 2 to 5 are its partners and administrators. They are therefore,
	co-accused and are jointly and severally responsible for the
	offence.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_4">Counsel
	for the petitioner submitted that the company was situated at Anand.
	The petitioners from beginning were residing permanently at Mumbai.
	They were in no way connected with the day to day affairs of the
	company or in any manner responsible for the conduct of the affairs
	of the company.  From the complaint, it can be seen that there is
	nothing  to show that the present petitioners were in-charge of or
	responsible tot he company for conduct of the business.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_5">Counsel
	for the Pollution Control Board however, relied on <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_1">Section 47</a>  of
	Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, which reads
	as follows :
</p>	 



 


<p id="p_6"> 47.
Offences by companies.(1)Where an offence under this Act has been
committed by a company, every person, who at the time the offence was
committed was in charge of, and was responsible to the company for
the conduct of, the  business of the company, as well as the company,
shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be
proceeded against and punished accordingly.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_7">Provided
that nothing contained in this sub-section shall render any such
person liable to any punishment provided in this Act if he proves
that the offence was committed without his knowledge or that he
exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such
offence.
</p> 


 


 
	 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">(2)</span>
<p id="p_8">	Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section(1),  where an
	offence under this Act has been committed by a company and it is
	proved that the offence has been committed with the consent or
	connivance of, or is attributable to any neglect on the part of, any
	director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company, such
	director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed
	to be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded
	against and punished accordingly. 
</p>	 


	  


<p id="p_9">	It
	can thus be seen that language used in the above provision of
	passing any vicarious liability of offence committed by the company
	is on material aspect identical to language used in <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_3">Section 141</a> of
	the Negotiable Instrument Act, which reads as follows :
</p>	 



 


<p id="p_10"> 41.
Offences by companies.(1)If the person committing an offence under
<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">Section 138</a> is a company, every person who, at  the time the offence
was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to the company
for the conduct of, the  business of the company, as well as the
company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be
liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_11">Provided
that nothing contained in this sub-section shall render any person
liable to punishment if he proves that the offence was committed
without his knowledge, or that he had exercised all due diligence to
prevent the commission of such offence:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_12">[Provided
further that where a person is nominated as a Director of a company
by virtue of his holding any officer or employment in the Central
Government or State Government or a financial corporation owned or
controlled by the  Central  Government or the State Government, as
the case may be, he shall not be liable for prosecution under this
Chapter.
</p> 


 


 
	 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">(2)</span>
<p id="p_13">	Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section(1),  where any
	offence under this Act has been committed by a company and it is
	proved that the offence has been committed with the consent or
	connivance of, or is attributable to, any neglect on the part of,
	any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company,
	such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be
	deemed to be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be
	proceeded against and punished accordingly. 
</p>	 


	  


<p id="p_14">	Relying
	on the decision in case of <a href="/doc/672341/" id="a_5">Saroj Kumar Poddar v. State (NCT of
	Delhi) and another</a> reported in (2007) 3 Supreme Court Cases 693,
	and decision in case of <a href="/doc/1957018/" id="a_6">K.K. Ahuja v. V.K. Vora and another</a>
	reported in (2009) 10 Supreme Court Cases  48, it can be seen
	that in absence of any allegation that petitioners were in-charge of
	and were responsible to the company for its day to day functioning,
	their mere status of being the Directors of the company would not
	make them responsible for any alleged act of the company
	particularly, when it is pointed out that factory of the company was
	situated at Anand and petitioners were all through out residing at
	Mumbai. Additionally, I also find that complaint was filed way back
	in the year 1997, summons was served to the petitioner only
	recently. It is stated that the company has also gone sick and
	principal accused who was in-charge of the company has died. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_15">Considering
	all these aspects of the matter, complaint at Annexure-A qua the
	present petitioners is quashed.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_16">Petition
	is disposed of . Rule made absolute accordingly.
</p>
