 WA.No.211 OF 2020                             2




                                JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">         Petitioners jointly filed W.P.(C) No.34876/2019 dated 13.1.2020

   with the following prayers:
</p>
<p id="p_2">      I)To issue a writ of Mandamus or other appropriate writ order or direction
      directing the 2nd and 3d respondents not to grant any license in favour of
      5th respondent to start meat collection centre as described in Exhibit
      P5(a) Sketch.
</p><p id="p_3">      II) To issue a writ of mandamus or other appropriate writ order or
      direction directing the 2nd and 3rd respondent to issue such direction
      after following the procedure if any to stop such activity of causing
      nuisance/pollution in conducting a meat collection centre mention in
      Exhibit P5(a) sketch by the 5th respondent.
</p><p id="p_4">      III) To issue a Writ of mandamus or other appropriate Writ, order or
      direction directing the 1st respondent to take steps in Exhibit P1
      representation.
</p><p id="p_5">      IV)To issue such other reliefs as this Hon'ble Court may deem just and
   proper in the circumstances of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">         2. After hearing learned counsel for parties, writ court passed the

   following order:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "5. Without considering the merit and demerit of the matter, the
       writ petition is disposed of directing the 2nd and 3 respondents to
       consider the representation of the petitioners referred above, in
       accordance with law, after affording an opportunity to them, of being
       heard. Since the counsel for the 5 th respondent has already undertaken
       not to carry out any activity as stated in the order cited above, at this
       stage, he has pointed out that Pollution Control Board has come out
       with on-line registration of the industry. He has submitted application
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> WA.No.211 OF 2020                           3</span>



       dated 09.11.2019 categorising his unit as orange for fish processing
       and packing. However no such category is available on-line. But in fact
       his activity is fish processing and collection and therefore he had no
       option but to apply under on line. He further submits that he may be
       permitted to apply manually owing to the unavailability of other option.
       The afore-mentioned request of the petitioner appears to be fair and
       genuine. Accordingly, the directions of Pollution Control Board to
       consider the request submitted by the petitioner manually for prawn
       collection instead of fish processing. It is upto the Pollution Control
       Board to decide whether the case of the petitioner falls under prawn
       collection or fish processing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">          Writ petition stands disposed of as above."</blockquote><p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">         3. Though Mr.S.Krishnamoorthy, learned counsel for appellants

   sought for reversal of the judgment in W.P.(C) No.34876/2019 dated

   13.1.2020 on the basis of the grounds raised, which were refuted by

   Mr.M.Ajay, learned counsel for respondent No.5, ultimately sought

   permission of this Court to withdraw the writ petition.

</p><p id="p_10">         4. When attention of the learned counsel for appellants was invited

   to the directions of the writ court permitting the respondent No.7/5 th

   respondent herein, to make a manual application, to be considered by

   the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, Alappuzha, respondent No.3.,

   Mr.S.Krishnamoorthy, learned counsel for appellants submitted that he

   has no objection for the application submitted manually by the 5 th

   respondent, be considered by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board,

   Alappuzha.
</p>
<p id="p_11">         5. Submission of the learned counsel for appellants is placed on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> WA.No.211 OF 2020                      4</span>



   record. Mr.Naveen.T, learned standing counsel for the Pollution Control

   Board submitted that, the application submitted by respondent No.5

   manually, would be considered in accordance with law.          Mr.M.Ajay,

   learned counsel for respondent No.5 submitted that Central Pollution

   Control Board, New Delhi, has issued modified directions under <a href="/doc/728591/" id="a_1">section

   18(1)(b)</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and

   the Air (Prevention &amp; Contrl of Pollution) Act, 1981 and sent

   communications to all the Chair         Persons/State Pollution Control

   Boards/Pollution Control Committees. He further submitted that, Pollution

   Control Board may be directed to take note of the above said modified

   directions issued.
</p>
<p id="p_12">         6. Though the learned counsel for appellants seeks for a prayer to

   withdraw the instant appeal, he has conceded that the application

   submitted by the 5th respondent manually be considered.

</p><p id="p_13">         7. In view of the above, we are of the considered opinion that,

   there is no impediment for the Kerala State Pollution Control Board to

   consider the said application. While doing so, Pollution Control Board is

   directed to take note of all the existing guidelines/modified directions

   issued by the Central Pollution Control Board, wherever applicable.

      relating to licence.
</p>
<p id="p_15">            Placing on record the submissions, writ appeal is dismissed,

      granting liberty of the appellants to approach the appropriate forum, if

      aggrieved and advised so.
