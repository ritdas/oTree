:JUDGMENT   
</pre><p id="p_1">[Judgment of the Court was delivered by C.T. SELVAM,J] 
        With consent of both sides, this Writ Appeal is disposed of at the
stage of admission.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.First respondent sought an order of police protection for its
employees, premises and vehicles in W.P.(MD) No.20469 of 2017 for engaging  
and handling bio-medical waste and this Court was pleased to direct the same
under order dated 10.11.2017. Appellant, who was impleaded as 6th respondent 
on the date of order under challenge, has preferred this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.Learned counsel for appellant submitted that first respondent/
petitioner had not requisite environmental clearance and as the order under
challenge was passed on the very date on which appellant was impleaded as 
party respondent in the writ petition, opportunity to appellant to explain
the position, as would disentitle first respondent to get an order of police
protection, was not afforded.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.Learned counsel for appellant submitted that as per notification of
the Ministry of Environment and Forests in S.O. 1553 dated 14.09.2006,
industries which fell within Category 'A' in the Schedule thereto have to,
before undertaking any construction work, or preparation of land by the
project management except for securing the land, obtain environmental
clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India,
while those which fall under category 'B' of the Schedule would have to
obtain the same at the hands of the State Environment Impact Assessment  
Authority (SEIAA). Learned counsel pointed out that the requirement would be
attracted even in the case of expansion or modernization of existing projects
or activities. First respondent has admitted to up-gradation of incinerator,
a facility which was found satisfactory by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control
Board as late as in 2017. Learned counsel submitted that as per schedule to
the notification dated 14.09.2006 and serial No.7(d) thereunder, all
integrated facilities having incineration and landfill or incineration alone
towards common hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities
(TSDFs) fell under category A and require prior environmental clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5.He drew reference to judgment of the National Green Tribunal in Haat
Supreme Wastech Private Ltd. &amp; Others. V. State of Haryana and Others dated  
28.11.2013, wherein the question ?Whether or not the bio-medical waste
disposal plants require Environmental Clearance (EC) in terms of the
Environmental Clearance Regulation, 2006 (for short '2006 Notification')?
came for consideration and such Tribunal had found that bio-medical treatment
plants, such as the first respondents, required environmental clearance in
terms of Entry 7(d) of the Notification of 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6.Learned counsel informed that initially authorisation from Tamil Nadu
Pollution Control Board had been obtained for a period of one year from the
date of issue under Authorisation No: BMW ? 0055 dated 22.02.2005 and that 
the same stood issued to another and the first respondent had been
incorporated on 22.02.2006. He however, fairly conceded that through
necessary amendment, consent order obtained in the year 2005 had been made   
applicable to the first respondent. Referring to proceedings of the
Commissioner of the concerned Panchayat Union dated 28.02.2007 in  
Na.Ka.No.A4/1532/06, learned counsel submitted that building construction had
been commenced only thereafter. The first respondent unit was upgraded in
2009. He contented that the authorisation issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution
Control Board for segregation, storage and disposal of Bio-medical Wastes on
21.03.2016 was valid for a period of 3 years from the date of issue. The
notification and the authorisation were not a one time affair but was
periodic. The notification of 14.09.2006 is to be understood as applicable to
all projects which had not been constructed or wherein production had not
commenced. As initial authorisation granted on 22.02.2005 had expired in
2006, a doubt arose as to whether authorisation has been continuously renewed
since first respondent had obtained permission for construction only in the
year 2007. Learned counsel submitted that authorisation issued on 21.03.2016
for a period of 3 years indicated that no periodical renewal of authorisation
had been obtained by first respondent and in the absence thereof, the
notification of 14.09.2006 automatically came into play. Submitting as above,
learned counsel placed reliance on the decision of the National Green
Tribunal in Rayons-Enlighting Humanity and another v. Ministry of Environment
and Forests and others in Application No.86 of 2013 dated 18.07.2013,
wherein, in paragraph No.7, it has been held as follows:
</p><p id="p_7">        "7. In the meanwhile, on 14th September, 2006, the EIA Notification
came into force. As per Entry No.7(i) of the Schedule to the said
Notification, common MSWM facility which was listed in category 'B' required
prior EC from the SEIAA. Here, we may notice that there is no record placed
before us which could show that any effective step, in relation to the
project, were taken by Respondent No.4. Admittedly, no EC was obtained by 
Respondent No.4 for carrying out/completion of  the MSWM project. In the
meanwhile, MoEF issued a Circular clarifying applicability of the
Notification of 2006 to cases where land had been acquired before the EIA
Notification of 1994. The said Circular dated 15th January, 2008 reads as
under:
</p><p id="p_8">        "It has been brought to the notice of this Ministry that an
interpretation has been taken by some of the State Pollution Control Boards
that EIA Notification, 2006 shall not be applicable for the projects for
which land was acquired before the EIA Notification, 1994. Further, it has
been observed that State Pollution Control Boards have issued NOCs/Consent to 
Establish (CTE) after 14th September, 2006 without advising the project
proponent to seek prior EC under EIA Notification, 2006. In this regard, the
following clarification is issued-
</p><p id="p_9">(i) Since the EIA Notification, 1994 has now been superseded by EIA
Notification, 2006, all projects activities listed under the EIA
Notification, 2006 shall require prior environment clearance under the said
Notification without linking it to the date of land acquisition, if the
project activity has not commenced at the site.
</p><p id="p_10">(ii) Only such projects under EIA Notification, 2006 shall not require
environment clearance under the said Notification which were not listed in
EIA Notification, 1994 and for which NOC was issued on or before September
14, 2006.
</p><p id="p_11">(iii) All such projects listed in both EIA Notifications, 1994 and 2006,
shall require prior environment clearance irrespective of issue of NOC if the
project related activity has not yet commenced at site. The validity of NOC
should not be extended without asking the proponent to seek prior environment
clearance under the EIA Notification, 2006.
</p><p id="p_12">2. In view of the above, it is advised to the State Pollution Control Boards
not to grant/extend/revalidate NOC/CTE without advising the proponent to seek
environment clearance under EIA Notification, 2006 for the projects which
were listed in EIA Notification, 1994 and are now also listed under EIA
Notification, 2006 even if they have acquired the land before January 1994.
All such projects, which were issued NOC/CTE before September, 2006 and  
listed in both the Notifications, but  have not commenced project activities
at the site shall not start project activity now without obtaining prior
environment clearance under EIA Notification, 2006 even if the land was
acquired before January, 1994."
</p><p id="p_13">Learned counsel contended that in Rayons case, as in the present, the Green
Tribunal was concerned with a case where no work of the project had been
carried on at the site in question and it had ruled that the project activity
must be such as well directly connected with the establishment of the plant
i.e., activity which is related to setting up, operating and maintenance of
the plant.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        7.Learned counsel for first respondent submitted that necessary
authorisation of Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board,  initially obtained on
22.02.2005, had been renewed from time to time and the last renewal was from
15.03.2016 under proceedings of the Board dated 21.03.2016 and valid upto
15.03.2019. Appellant was a party to proceedings in W.P.(MD) No.10953 of 
2017, wherein first respondent had challenged the order of the Revenue
Divisional Officer, Aruppukottai, Virudhunagar District passed in exercise of
power under Section 203 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act, 1994, directing
stoppage of first respondents functioning. Such petition as also W.P.(MD)
No.1931 of 2016 filed by Villagers seeking directions towards preventing the
first respondent from setting up and operating a ?Bio-Medical Waste Disposal
Unit? without following due process of law as also W.P.(MD) No.10957 of 2013,
wherein the first respondent sought police protection were considered and
disposed of under common order by a Division Bench of this Court on
05.09.2017.  This Court had passed the following order:
</p><p id="p_15">        ?17.Accordingly, the following orders are passed:-
</p><p id="p_16">        i) W.P(MD)No.10957 of 2013 stands allowed. The order impugned passed by   
the third respondent stands set aside.
</p><p id="p_17">        ii) W.P(MD)No.10953 of 2017 stands disposed of by directing the second
respondent to give adequate police protection as and when required, only for
the purpose of maintenance and the trial of the petitioner unit alone.
</p><p id="p_18">        iii)Till the consent to operate is obtained from the fourth respondent,
the petitioner cannot run the unit.
</p><p id="p_19">        iv) The District Environmental Engineer, the fourth respondent in
W.P(MD)No.10953 of 2017 is directed to pass an appropriate orders within a
period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order in the
light of the observation made earlier.
</p><p id="p_20">        v)The District Medical Officer, Madurai is directed to conduct the
Screening Camp along with 8 officials mentioned, who participate  earlier, on
20.09.2017.
</p><p id="p_21">        vi)The fourth respondent and the District Medical Officer are further
directed to communicate their decision, both to the petitioner in
W.P(MD)No.10953 of 2017 and W.P(MD)No.1931 of 2016.     
</p><p id="p_22">        vii) In order to maintain transparency and fairness one Mr.Dr.
A.Rengarajan, M.D., Retired Professor of Medicine, Madurai Medical College is
also directed to be added as one of the doctors in the panel, which is
directed to make inspection on 20.09.2017.
</p><p id="p_23">        viii)The petitioner shall not be allowed to carry his vehicle for the
purpose of running the unit and it is made clear that they would be permitted
to use for the trial running and maintenance alone.
</p><p id="p_24">        ix) In view of the above, W.P(MD)No.1931 of 2016 is disposed of. No
costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are also closed.?
Learned counsel submitted that the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment (Protection) Act</a> came into
force in 1986 and as per first notification S.O.60 (E) dated 27.01.1994, 30
industries had been notified and Bio-Medical Waste was not one of them. The
notification dated 14.09.2006 at clause 2 stated as follows:
</p><p id="p_25">        "2.Requirements of prior Environmental Clearance (EC) :- The following
projects or activities shall require prior environmental clearance from the
concerned regulatory authority, which shall hereinafter referred to be as the
Central Government in the Ministry of Environment and Forests for matters
falling under Category 'A' in the Schedule and at State level the State
Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) for matters falling under
Category 'B' in the said Schedule, before any construction work, or
preparation of land by the project management except for securing the land,
is started on the project or activity:
</p><p id="p_26">        (i) All new projects or activities listed in the Schedule to this
notification;
</p><p id="p_27">        (ii) Explanation and modernization of existing projects or activities
listed in the Schedule to this notification with addition of capacity beyond
the limits specified for the concerned sector, that is, projects or
activities which cross the threshold limits given in the schedule, after
expansion or modernization;
</p><p id="p_28">        (iii) Any change in product - mix in an existing manufacturing unit
included in Schedule beyond the specified range."
</p><p id="p_29">The Green Tribunal under orders dated 28.11.2013 in Haat Supreme Wastech Pvt.  
Ltd. &amp; Others. v. State of Haryana &amp; Others in Appeal No.63 of 2012 had held
that environmental clearance was also required for Bio-Medicate Waste
Disposal Plants. Thereafter, the Ministry of Environment and Forests had
issued Notification S.O.1142(E) on 17.04.2015 introducing item No.7(da).
Learned counsel referred to the schedule in the notification of 14.09.2006 to
explain that the same provided as follows:
</p><p id="p_30">LIST OF PROJECTS OR ACTIVITIES REQUIRING PRIOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE                   
Project or Activity
Category with threshold Limit

B

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">(3)</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">(4)</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">(5)</span>
The Schedule read with Clause 2 of the notification made clear that while the
activity falling under Sl.No.3 above fell into category 'A' requiring Central
Government Clearance, that in Sl.No.4 fell under Category 'B' requiring
clearance from State Environmental Authority. He then referred to
notification of the Ministry of Environment and Forests in S.O.1142(E) dated
17.04.2015, which reads as follows:
</p><p id="p_31">        "In the said notification, (reference to notification dated 14.09.2006)
in the Schedule, after item 7(d) and the entries relating thereto, the

Bio-Medical Waste Treatment Facilities
</p><p id="p_33">-
</p><p id="p_34">All projects
</p><p id="p_35">-
</p><p id="p_36">Learned counsel thus explains that new category 7(da) - Bio-Medical waste
Treatment facilities fell under Sl.No.4 and the same fell under category 'B',
where regards no Central Government Clearance was envisaged, but clearance  
required was of the State Environmental authority. Learned counsel submitted
that environmental clearance was to be obtained at the nascent stage of
industrial activity. He submitted that environmental clearance having been
obtained for the first respondent concern even in the year 2005, the same
fell under category envisaged in clause (ii) of the circular dated 15.01.2008
referred in paragraph 7 (herein above reproduced) in Rayons Case. Learned
counsel made a further submission that in Rayons case environmental clearance 
had lapsed, while infers the case of first respondent, the same was in force
from 03.11.2005. The first respondent had obtained 'consent to establish'
even before the notification of 15.01.2008 and 'consent to operate' on
18.10.2006. Referring to a tabular statement in the Typed Set of papers,
learned counsel submitted that first respondent unit had obtained clearances
under AIR (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and WATER (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a> as also all other requisite clearances.
</p>
<p id="p_37">        8.Learned counsel contended that the Division Bench in passing orders
on 05.09.2017 had withheld passing of orders of police protection in favour
of first respondent only since as on the date thereof, consent to operate had
not been obtained by the first respondent. One A.Thangapandian was the
petitioner in W.P.(MD) No.1931 of 2016, while A.Ezhilvizhi was co-respondent
with the appellant in W.P.(MD) No.10953 of 2017 filed by first respondent,
seeking police protection on 11.06.2017.  Pending the same, authorisation of
the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had lapsed and hence, the Division
Bench, having found that consent to operate under Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 had lapsed and finding compliances effected by first
respondent substantial and that basic parameters were satisfied, directed the
Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to consider the application of the first
respondent for renewal within a period of 6 weeks from the date of order.
Having directed so, this Court issued orders above reproduced after observing
in paragraphs 14 to 16 as follows:
</p><p id="p_38">        ?14.The petitioner in W.P(MD)No.1931 of 2016 is also permitted to give
his objection on behalf of the villagers.
</p><p id="p_39">        15.The only other question is with respect to the impact of the unit on
the general public residing in the said Village. Considering the apprehension
expressed by the learned counsel appearing in W.P.(MD)No.1931 of 2016, we  
hereby direct a fresh camp consisting of very same eight persons under the
Leadership of District Medical Officer, Madurai, Madurai District, as
requested by his counsel appearing for the villagers.
</p><p id="p_40">        16.The Speciality Health Screening camp is to be conducted on
20.09.2017. The third respondent, namely the Revenue Divisional Officer,
Arupukkottai is directed to give intimation of it, in the locality.?
</p>
<p id="p_41">        9.As petitioner in W.P.(MD) No.1931 of 2016 and others acted against
the spirit of the order of the Division Bench in W.P.(MD) Nos.10957 of
2013,1931 of 2016 and 10953 of 2017 dated 05.09.2017 and indulged in unlawful
acts, case in Crime No.95 of 2017 came to be registered against him and
others on the file of A.Mukkulam Police Station on the complaint of Village
Administrative Officer on 20.09.2017 for offences under <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_5">Sections 147</a>, <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_6">341</a> and
<a href="/doc/1208971/" id="a_7">353</a> I.P.C. Although the appellant was a party to earlier proceedings as
informed above, the ground of first respondent having not satisfied
requirement of environment clearance had not been raised. If the first
respondent had not obtained requisite clearance, challenge thereto would have
to be made before the appropriate forum.
</p>
<p id="p_42">        10.To meet the submission of learned counsel for appellant that first
respondent had admitted to up-gradation of incinerator, in the affidavit
filed in W.P.(MD) No.20469 of 2017, learned counsel submitted that what the
first respondent had done was to effect replacement of worn out machinery.
Such act of first respondent would not amount to up-gradation or
modification.
</p>
<p id="p_43">        11.We have considered the rival submissions.
</p>

<p id="p_44">        12.We would start with the position that environmental clearance
initially is to be obtained at the nascent stage of an industry and the same
is to be renewed from time to time and on effecting compliances as called
for. It is a safe presumption that compliances required of units commencing
anew would be more rigourous than those of old. The first respondent has
obtained environmental N.O.C. in the year 2005 and after the last renewal,
the same is valid up to the year 2019. A co-joint reading of the notification
S.O.1533 dated 14.09.2006 and S.O.1142(E) dated 17.04.2015 makes clear, as   
rightly contented by learned counsel for respondent, that the Bio-Medical
Waste Management Unit of the first respondent falls under Category 'B' which
requires no clearance of the Central Government. We also find ourselves in
agreement with the submission that even without circular dated 15.01.2008,
the first respondent Unit would not require environmental clearance from the
Central Authority. The clarity provided by circular dated 15.01.2008, shows
that the first respondent Unit would not fall within Central Ministerial
Clearance category since its unit had not been listed in the EIA notification
1994 and NOC was issued in 2005 i.e. before EIA notification 2006. Consent to
operate of the first respondent unit had been granted on 18.10.2006 and Plan
approval and Trade License as prescribed under Section 160 of Tamilnadu
Village Panchayat Act had been obtained on 28.02.2007. These necessarily must  
be seen as activities directly connected with the establishment of the first
respondent industrial unit. Looked at from any angle, the first respondent
unit does not attract any disqualification on the ground of environmental
clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_45">        13.In the result, the Writ Appeal stands dismissed and as a consequence
the direction of the learned Single Judge to afford Police Protection to the
first respondent shall hold good. No costs. Consequently, connected
Miscellaneous Petition also stands dismissed.
