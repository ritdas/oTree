</p><p id="p_3">                            2. These appeals by the Revenue under <a href="/doc/54762929/" id="a_2">Section 35G</a> of the Central

                      Excise Act, 1944 are directed against the common order passed by the

                      Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, South Zonal Bench,

                      Chennai (for brevity, the Tribunal) dated 25.1.2016 in Appeal Nos.E/40427 to

                      40433/2014 vide final order Nos.40090 to 40096 of 2016.

</p><p id="p_4">                            3. The following substantial question of law arises for consideration in

                      these appeals :
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">                                         “Whether     an   activity      carried    out     in
                                  compliance    of   statutory   requirement        under   a

                                  service as input service under Rule 2(1) of the
                                  CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 especially when such
                                  service/activity   has   no    nexus    in   or    integral
                                  connection to the manufacture of final product ?”
</p><p id="p_6">                            4. The assessee's case before the Tribunal was that the plantations,

                      which were established by them, were erroneously construed as gardening

                      services provided when the assessee had established the plantation and

                      greenery in the campus on account of the direction issued by the Appellate

                      Authority under the provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of

                      Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. In terms of the said direction, the assessee was

                      required to maintain a green belt area comprising of 1000 trees per acre of

                      land and effective usage of water among other conditions.

</p><p id="p_7">                            5. The question was as to whether the assessee was entitled to avail

                      the CENVAT credit in this regard.

</p><p id="p_9">                            6. The Tribunal referred to the decision of the Division Bench of this

                      Court in the case of CCE, LTU, Chennai Vs. Rane TRW Steering Systems

                      Ltd. [reported in (2015) 39 STR 13]. In the instant case also, a similar

                      issue arises i.e whether the housekeeping and landscaping services should be

                      included under the term 'input services' as defined under Rule 2(l) of the

                      CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004. The Division Bench took note of the decision of

                      the Karnataka High Court in the case of Commissioner Vs. Millipore

                      India Pvt. Ltd. [reported in (2012) 26 STR 514] wherein it was held that

                      the Environmental Laws expect the employer to keep the factory without

                      contravening any of those laws, that the concept of corporate social

                      responsibility is also relevant and that when the employer spends money to

                      maintain their factory, to discharge a statutory obligation, in an eco-friendly

                      manner, certainly, the tax paid on such services would form part of the costs

                      of the final products. Therefore, the Court held that the Tribunal was right in

                      holding that the service tax paid in all those cases would fall within the

                      definition of 'input services' and that the assessee is entitled to the benefit

                      thereof. Accordingly, the appeal filed by the Revenue was dismissed.

</p><p id="p_10">                            7. The decision in the case of Millipore India Pvt. Ltd., was taken

                      note of by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Rane TRW

                      Steering Systems Ltd., and it was held that when the employer spends

                      money to maintain factory premises in an eco-friendly manner based upon

                      the directives issued by the Statutory Authorities, the tax paid on such

                                                                                  T.S.SIVAGNANAM,J

                      services would form part of the costs of the final product, that the same

                      would fall within the ambit of 'input services' and that the assessee is entitled

                      to claim the benefit. In our considered view, the Tribunal rightly decided the

                      issue in favour of the assessee and we find no grounds to entertain the above

                      appeal.

<p id="p_11">                            8. Accordingly, the above appeal filed by the Revenue is dismissed and

                      the substantial question of law framed is answered in favour of the assessee.

                      No costs.
