<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
 

N.V. Dabholkar, J. 
</p> 

<p id="p_2"> 1. By these writ  petitions  under  <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article
227</a>  of  the Constitution of India, original accused
Nos.3 and 4 challenge the orders passed  by  learned
Chief  Judicial Magistrate, Aurangabad on 14.6.2002,
in Criminal  Case  No. 80348/1997  (earlier  Criminal
Case No.11 of 1995) and Regular Criminal Case No.179
of 1996 (earlier Criminal Case No.675 of 1994) below
Exhibits  33 and 34 in the first matter and Exhibits
23 and 24 in the second matter.    By  orders  below
Exhibits  33  and  23,  in  the  respective criminal
cases, learned Chief  Judicial  Magistrate  rejected
the  applications of petitioners/accused Nos. 3 and 4
requesting to recall the process issued against them
on the ground that they were  not  incharge  of  the
business  of  the  company,  nor  responsible to the
company for conduct of the business.  Since  it  was
admitted  position  that accused Nos. 3 and 4 are the
Managing Director and Director respectively  of  M/s
Aristo  Pharmaceuticals  Limited  (for  short,  "the
company") (original accused No. 5), the learned Chief
Judicial Magistrate was of the view that  they  were
responsible  for  the  act  of  the  company, having
control  over  it,  although  they  reside  out   of
Station.  
</p> 

<p id="p_3"> So  far  as applications Exhibits 34 and
24 are concerned, the petitioners had requested  for
exemption  from personal appearance till decision of
Exhibits 23 and 24.  Those were rejected in view  of
disposal of  applications  Exhibits 33 and 23.  Even
when the matter is  now  being  argued  before  this
Court,  since  exemption  was  sought  from personal
appearance till decision of applications for  recall
of  the  process,  applications  Exhibits 34 and 24,
with decision of applications Exhibits 33 and 23  on
14.6.2002;  have  become  infructuous,  so  also the
challenge to rejection of applications  Exhibits  34
and 24.  
</p> 

<p id="p_4"> 2. Both  the  matters  are  taken  up   for
hearing  together  and are being disposed of by this
common judgment, in view of the fact that  identical
questions  of fact and law arise in both the matters
and only variance is regarding date of collection of
samples of drugs manufactured by  the  accused  No. 5
company.  
</p> 

<p id="p_5"> 3.Heard learned counsel for the respective
parties.  
</p> 

<p id="p_6"> Rule.  
</p> 

<p id="p_7"> By  mutual   consent,   Rule   is   made
returnable forthwith.  
</p> 

<p id="p_8"> 4. The  factual  matrix  giving   rise   to
present  criminal  cases  can  be stated in brief as
follows:   (Henceforth  for  the  sake  of  brevity,
criminal  case  from  which  Writ Petition No. 261 of
2002 arises is referred to as "first case"  and  the
other one as "second case").  
</p> 

<p id="p_9"> So  far as first case is concerned, Shri
P.N. Shende,  Drugs   Inspector,   Food   and   Drugs
Administration,  Nagpur  paid  visit  to M/s Thakkar
Medico Traders, 89, Central Avenue, Nagpur  440  019
on 17.11.1993.    He drew sample of Scarab Lotion of
batch No. 85093-G, manufactured  in  July  1993,  for
which  the date of expiry was June, 1995 by following
the prescribed procedure laid down under the Act.  
</p> 

<p id="p_10"> So far as second case is concerned, Shri
V.N. Ransube, Drugs Inspector visited M/s Maharashtra
Medical Stores, 17 Kherwadi Road, Bandra (E), Bombay
400  051  and  had  drawn sample of Scarab Lotion of
batch No.85082-H, manufactured in  August  1992  for
which date of expiry was July 1994.  
</p> 

<p id="p_11"> The Government Analyst,  upon  analysis,
sent   the   analytical   report   No.M-6952/93  and
M-2145/93 dated 7.6.1994 in the  respective  matters
reporting  in  both  the matters;  
</p><p id="p_12">   " Content of gamma
benzene hexachloride and Citrimide in the sample are
more than Schedule V limits."   
</p> 

<p id="p_13"> In   the  first  matter,  Gamma  Benzene
Hexachloride was 124.5 %  of  the  labelled  amount,
whereas   it   was  128%  in  the  second  instance.
Similarly Citrimide in the sample of first case  was
270%  of  the labelled amount and it was 226% of the
labelled amount in the second case.  
</p> 

<p id="p_14"> Since both the  traders  from  whom  the
respective  samples  were  collected  by  respective
Drugs Inspectors informed that  they  had  purchased
the   said   drug   from   the   said  company,  the
prosecutions were launched by the  Drugs  Inspector,
Aurangabad,   attached   to   the  office  of  Joint
Commissioner, Aurangabad Division,  Food  and  Drugs
Administration,  Aurangabad  for  the offences under
<a href="/doc/886520/" id="a_2">Section 18(a)(i)</a> of the  Drugs  and  <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_3">Cosmetics  Act</a>,
1940 (for  short,  "the  said Act" hereinafter).  In
the said prosecutions, petitioners/original  accused
Nos.3  and  4 filed applications Exhibits 33 and 23,
as discussed  earlier,  for  recalling  the  process
issued  against  them  by the learned Chief Judicial
Magistrate, which  were  rejected  by  the  impugned
order dated 14.6.2002 and hence the writ petitions.  
</p> 

<p id="p_15"> 5. Apart  from  the  arguments  on  merits,
learned Senior Counsel Shri Gupte  for  petitioners,
has  taken a serious exception to the impugned order
on the ground that the impugned orders  suffer  from
non  application  of mind, although he conceded that
both the applicants as well as their Advocates  were
absent   when  the  learned  Judge  dealt  with  the
applications.   Shri  Gupte  pointed  out  that  the
learned  Judge  has  dealt  with the applications on
merits  and  rejected  those   by   observing   that
petitioners,  as  the Managing Director and Director
respectively, were in control  of  the  company  and
therefore,  responsible for the acts of the company.
Shri Gupte has taken me through the text of  Exhibit
"C",  which  is  the  copy  of application presented
before the learned Chief  Judicial  Magistrate,  and
pointed   out  that  even  in  application  para  4,
reliance was placed upon the judgments  reported  at
1998 Cr.L.J.3287 State of Haryana Vs.  Brij Lal as
also 2000 Cr.L.J.4442 Pannalal Choksi Vs.  State of
Maharashtra.  
</p> 

<p id="p_16"> The first one is the judgment of Supreme
Court  and  the  later  one  is  the judgment of the
learned Single Judge of this Court, both  being  the
cases  under  the  said  Act,  as  the  cases in the
present writ petitions and in both the matters,  the
prayer   of   accused   Directors  of  manufacturing
companies was for quashing the complaint.  According
to Advocate Shri  Gupte,  the  learned  Judge  while
dealing   with   the   applications  in  absence  of
petitioners and their counsel, but on merits,  could
not have ignored the contents of the application and
if  he  was  willing  to go ahead with the matter in
absence of petitioners and  their  counsel,  he  was
duty  bound  to  consider  the  application  in  its
entirety and in any case, he could not have  ignored
the  ratio  laid  down  by  the  apex Court and this
Court,  which  was  relied  upon  expressly  by  the
contents in the application.  
</p> 

<p id="p_17"> The  submission of Sr.Counsel Shri Gupte
regarding the impugned order, to  above  effect  are
fully justified.    The learned Judge has dealt with
the matter in a hurried and slipshod manner, without
referring to the grounds on which  the  process  was
prayed  to  be  recalled  and  speedy deposal of the
application, at the  cost  of  non-consideration  of
submissions  in  the  application, is required to be
deprecated in harsh words.  
</p> 

<p id="p_18"> 6. Shri  Gupte,  Sr. Counsel has relied upon
those two cases,  which  were  relied  upon  in  the
application  and  in  addition couple of more cases.
It was argued that by  the  text  of  the  complaint
itself,  it  was  evident  that the original accused
Nos.1 and  2,  the  manufacturing  chemist  and  the
Assistant Manager, Quality Control were the persons,
having  control over the manufacture and composition
of various ingredients in the drug.  Petitioners  as
Directors  had  no  control  over  the manufacturing
activities, much less there  are  any  averments  to
that  effect  in the complaint and therefore, in the
light of ratio laid down by the apex Court  as  well
as   this  Court  in  the  cases  relied  upon,  the
Magistrate could not have rejected the applications.
According  to  Shri  Gupte,  these  were  fit  cases
wherein  process was required to be recalled, so far
as the original accused Nos.3 and  4  /  petitioners
are concerned.  
</p> 

<p id="p_19"> 7. <a href="/doc/886520/" id="a_4">Section  18(1)(i)</a>  of   the   said   Act
prohibits manufacture for sale of drug, which is not
of  standard  quality  or misbranded, adulterated or
spurious.  According to <a href="/doc/1278572/" id="a_5">Section  16(1)(a)</a>  "standard
quality" in relation to a drug means that drug which
complies  with  the  standard  set  out  in  the  II
Schedule.    <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_6">Section   27</a>   provides   penalty   for
manufacture, sale etc.  of the drug in contravention
of  the provisions of Chapter IV of the said Act and
for the purpose of  cases  at  hand,  the  residuary
clause  (d) of the said Section would be applicable.
The drug is defined by <a href="/doc/798638/" id="a_7">Section 3(b)</a> of the said Act.
None of these provisions are either referred  to  or
disputed by  Shri Gupte, Sr.  Counsel in the present
matter.  
</p> 

<p id="p_20"> 8. Since,  the  prosecution has relied upon
<a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_8">Section 34</a> of the said  Act  regarding  offences  by
companies,  Shri  Gupte, Sr. Counsel has referred to
text  of  <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_9">Section  34(1)</a>  and  contended  that   the
contents   of  the  complaint  do  not  attract  the
ingredients of the said section,  so  as  to  invite
prosecution of  Directors  i.e.  petitioners.   Said
provision reads as follows :  
</p>  

<p id="p_21">  " 34.  Offences by  companies.    -  (1)
Where an offence under this Act has been
committed by a company, every person who
at  the  time the offence was committed,
was in charge of, and was responsible to
the  company  for  the  conduct  of  the
business  of the company, as well as the
company shall be deemed to be guilty  of
the  offence  and  shall be liable to be
proceeded    against    and     punished
accordingly;......."  
</p> 
 

<p id="p_22"> According to Shri Gupte, Sr. Counsel, the
complaint  does not contain any averment, which will
indicate that petitioners / Directors were in charge
of and responsible to the company for the conduct of
business on the date the drug  was  manufactured  or
the  day  on which the samples of the said drug were
collected by the Drugs Inspector.  According to Shri
Gupte, paras 2, 3 and 16 of  the  complaint  are  the
only  paragraphs,  which  contain  averments  in  an
attempt  to  fasten  the   responsibility   on   the
respective accused  persons.    These paragraphs are
being reproduced herein below, for ready reference.  
</p>  

<p id="p_23">  " 2.    That   accused   No.1   is   the
manufacturing  Chemist  who manufactured
the not of  standard  quality  drug  and
accused  No. 2  is  the  quality  control
chemist under whose supervision the  not
of    standard   quality   product   was
analysed.  
</p> 

<p id="p_24"> 3. That accused No. 3 and  4  are  the
Directors  of M/s Aristo Pharmaceuticals
Ltd.    situated   at   E-6,    M.I.D.C.
</p><p id="p_25">Chikalthana, Aurangabad.   
</p> 

<p id="p_26"> 16. That, the complainant,  therefore,
charges  that accused No. 1 and 2 who are
incharge of Production  and  Testing  of
the  (drug)  not of standard quality and
the accused No. 3 and 4 are the directors
of the accused  No.5  for  manufacturing
and selling on or about 17.11.1993 a not
of   standard   quality  drug  and  thus
accused Nos. 1,2,3,4 and 5 have committed
an offence ........."  
</p> 

<p id="p_27"> 9. The case of KPG Nair  Vs.    M/s  Jindal
(2001  All  Mah.Reporter (Criminal) 1206 (SC)) was a
matter  under  <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_10">Section   138</a>   of   the   Negotiable
Instruments Act.    Application under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_11">Section 482</a> of
the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking to quash  the
proceedings  was  dismissed  by  the  High Court, by
holding that  averments  in  the  complaint  by  the
respondent   company   along   with   statements  of
witnesses, prima  facie  go  to  show  that  at  the
relevant  time,  the appellant being the Director of
the  accused  company  was  also   in   charge   and
responsible for  the business of the same.  In fact,
appellant had not signed the cheque, but was  sought
to  be  prosecuted  in  view  of  <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_12">Section 141</a> of the
Negotiable  Instruments  Act  in  his  capacity   as
Director of the accused company at one time.  It was
argued  on  behalf  of  the complainant, that it was
required to be inferred that appellant was in charge
of and responsible to the company for the conduct of
its business.  However, nowhere it was  stated  that
on   the   date  when  the  offence  was  committed,
appellant was in charge or was  responsible  to  the
accused   company   for  conduct  of  its  business.
Provisions  of  <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_13">Section  141</a>   of   the   Negotiable
Instruments Act are pari materia with the provisions
of <a href="/doc/1385350/" id="a_14">Section 34(1)</a> of the said Act.  
</p> 

<p id="p_28"> It  was  held  by the Supreme Court that
the substance of the allegations should  necessarily
fulfill  the  requirements of ingredients of <a href="/doc/1755330/" id="a_15">Section
141(1)</a> for being proceeded against for the  offence,
which is  alleged to have been committed.  According
to apex Court, the allegations in the complaint  did
not,  either  in the express words or with reference
to the allegations contained  therein,  make  out  a
case  that at the time of commission of offence, the
appellant was in charge of and  was  responsible  to
the   company  for  the  conduct  of  its  business.
Consequently,  the  appeal  was  allowed   and   the
proceedings were quashed.  
</p> 

<p id="p_29"> In  brief,  in  absence  of  allegations
regarding  appellant  being   in   charge   of   and
responsible  to  the  company,  the Director, it was
held; cannot be prosecuted.  
</p> 

<p id="p_30"> 10. State of  Haryana  Vs.    Brij  Lal   was the second case  relied  upon  by
petitioners.   This  was a complaint for the offence
under <a href="/doc/1887096/" id="a_16">Section 27</a> of  the  said  Act.    The  process
issued  against  three Directors of the manufacturer
company, was quashed by the  High  Court,  as  filed
after expiry  of  shelf  life of the drug.  The apex
Court, although held that quashing was not justified
on  that  ground,  upheld  the  order  on  different
grounds.   The  apex  Court considered the scope and
ambit of vicarious liability that can be imposed  by
virtue of <a href="/doc/1385350/" id="a_17">Section 34(1)</a> of the said Act and observed
that,  simply  because the person is Director of the
company,  it  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  he
fulfills the above requirements.  From the complaint
in  question,  it  was  found  that  except the bald
statement that respondents  were  Directors  of  the
manufacturer,  there  was  no  other  allegation  to
indicate that prima facie they were in-charge of the
company and also responsible to the company for  the
conduct of business.  
</p> 

<p id="p_31"> 11. Thus,  as  a  result  of observations in
both these cases,  it  can  be  said  that  although
<a href="/doc/1385350/" id="a_18">Section 34(1)</a> creates a presumption as to the guilt,
once  it  is  shown that the person was in charge of
and  responsible  to  the  company  for  conduct  of
business,  the  section  by itself does not create a
presumption  that  the  person  merely  by  being  a
Director  was  in  charge  and  responsible  to  the
company, which fact is required to be averred in the
complaint and duly proved.  
</p> 

<p id="p_32"> In the  matter  of  Iqbal  Vs.  State of
Maharashtra (2002 (1) FAC 321), the  learned  Single
Judge  followed  the same view. In this matter under
the  <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_19">Food  Adulteration  Act</a>,  one   Gyan   Bahadur,
Supervisor  was  nominee  of the company by specific
resolution passed on 31.5.1993 under  <a href="/doc/41907041/" id="a_20">Section  17(2)</a>
of the Food Adulteration Act. So far as Directors of
the  company,  it was observed by the learned Single
Judge that Director,  Manager,  Secretary  or  other
officers  could  be  proceeded  against  only if the
complaint showed that the offence was committed with
the consent or connivance of these  persons  and  in
absence  of  allegations  regarding  the  same, they
could not be proceeded against.    In  this  matter,
there  were  no  averments  against  the  Directors,
alleging that the offence was committed  with  their
consent or connivance.  
</p> 

<p id="p_33"> 12. Pannalal Vs.  State of Maharashtra (2000
(4) M.L.J.674) is a judgment of learned Single Judge
of this  Bench.    Two Criminal Writ Petitions under
<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_21">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India  read  with
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_22">Section  482</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code, seeking
quashment of proceedings  under  the  <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_23">Prevention  of
Food  Adulteration  Act</a>  and Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_24">Cosmetics Act</a>
are dealt with in the said judgment.  The Court  was
seized  of interpretation of <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_25">Section 34</a> of the Drugs
and  <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_26">Cosmetics  Act</a>,  as  also  <a href="/doc/157838917/" id="a_27">Section  17</a>  of  the
Prevention   of   Food   Adulteration   Act,   which
provisions are pari materia, except the  distinction
that  under the Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_28">Cosmetics Act</a>, there is no
provision to declare a nominee  of  the  company  as
under  <a href="/doc/41907041/" id="a_29">Section  17(2)</a>  of  the  Prevention  of  Food
Adulteration Act.  
</p> 

<p id="p_34"> The  petitioners  in   both   the   writ
petitions were Directors of the respective companies
and  their  main grievance was that they were not in
charge of and were not responsible  to  the  company
for the  conduct of business.  While considering the
said submission, learned  Single  Judge  has  relied
upon observations of the apex Court in the matter of
G.L. Gupta Vs.  D.N. Mehta , wherein
the  Supreme Court had interpreted the provisions of
<a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_30">Section 23C</a>  of  Foreign  Exchange  Regulation  Act,
1947,  which provision is analogues to the provision
of <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_31">Section 34</a> of the Act of 1940 and <a href="/doc/157838917/" id="a_32">Section  17</a>  of
the Act  of  1954.    The  Supreme Court observed as
follows :  
</p>  

<p id="p_35">  "  .....It  seems  to  us  that  in  the
context  a  person in charge must mean
that the person  should  be  in  overall
control  of  the  day-to-day business of
the company or  firm.    This  inference
follows  from  the  wording  of  <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_33">Section
23C(2)</a>.  It mentions director,  who  may
be  a party to the policy being followed
by a company and yet not be in charge of
the business of the company.  Further it
mentions  manager,  who  usually  is  in
charge   of  the  business  but  not  in
overall charge.   Similarly,  the  other
officers  may  be  in charge of the only
some part of the business."  
</p> 

<p id="p_36"> It   was   held  that  what  is  legally
required is  overall  control  over  the  day-to-day
business of  the  company  and  the  firm.   If this
element is present then only the  directors  of  the
company are  responsible.    Since  in  the reported
matter, there was no whisper in the complaints  that
petitioners   were   in  charge  of  and  were  also
responsible  to  the  company  for  the  conduct  of
business,  the  applications were allowed and orders
of issuing summons as well as the proceedings before
the trial Court were quashed.  
</p> 

<p id="p_37"> 13. In  the  matter of Municipal Corporation
Delhi Vs.  Ram Kishan and others ,
Food  Inspector  had filed a prosecution against the
Manager (respondent No. 1) and Directors (respondents
Nos. 2  to  5)  of  M/s  Upper  Ganges  Sugar  Mills,
alongwith the company itself.  The appeal by special
leave  was preferred by the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi against  the  judgment  of  Delhi  High  Court
quashing   the   proceedings   taken   against   the
respondents Nos. 1 to 5.  The  only  point  that  was
canvassed  before  the Supreme Court was that on the
allegations in the complaint a clear  cut  case  was
made  out  against all the respondents and the trial
court ought not to have quashed the  proceedings  on
the  ground  that the complaint did not disclose any
offence.  According to respondents, even taking  the
allegations  of the complaint ex-facie true, no case
for trial was made out at all.  The main  clause  of
the  complaint  which  was  subject  matter  of  the
dispute read as follows :  
</p><p id="p_38">  " 5.  The accused No.3 is the Manager of
accused No. 2 and accused Nos. 4 to 7  are
the  Directors  of  accused  No. 2 and as
such,  they  were   in-charge   of   and
responsible  for conduct of the business
of  accused  No. 2   at   the   time   of
sampling."  
</p> 

<p id="p_39"> Accused No. 3 was respondent No.1 Manager
and  accused  Nos. 4  to 7 Directors were respondents
Nos. 2 to 4 of company respondent No.5.  The  Supreme
Court held,  
  " So far as the Manager is concerned, we
are  satisfied that from the very nature
of his duties it can be safely  inferred
that he would undoubtedly be vicariously
liable   for   the   offence;  vicarious
liability  being  an  incident   of   an
offence under  the  Act.   So far as the
Directors are concerned,  there  is  not
even  a  whisper nor a shred of evidence
nor anything to  show,  apart  from  the
presumption  drawn  by  the complainant,
that there is any act committed  by  the
Directors   from   which   a  reasonable
inference can be drawn that  they  could
also be vicariously liable."  
</p> 

<p id="p_40"> Consequently,  the  order  of  the  High
Court  was  upheld  so  far  as  the  Directors were
concerned and  it  was  set  aside  as  against  the
Manager/respondent No. 1.  
</p> 

<p id="p_41"> Taking into consideration the ratio laid
down,  which  is  identical  in all the cases relied
upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners,  at
the  stage  of  issuing  process, the complaint must
contain the allegations by which  the  Directors  of
the  company can also be proceeded against, when the
company is alleged to be guilty of offence.  In  the
absence  of  such  allegations,  there  cannot  be a
presumption that the Directors were in charge of and
responsible  to  the  company  for  conduct  of  the
business of the company.  
</p> 

<p id="p_42"> The averments fixing the liability  upon
individuals,  as  contained  in  the  complaint  are
reproduced in  para  No. 8  (ante).    In  fact,  the
contents  in para No. 16 of the complaint relating to
petitioners  also  depict  some  incompleteness   in
clause, ".....   and the accused Nos. 3 and 4 are the
Directors of the accused No. 5  for  manufacture  and
selling  on/or  about  17.11.1993  not  of  standard
quality drug...." and do not contain  any  averments
attributing  their  roll of persons in charge of day
to day business.  In para No.3  also  it  is  simply
said  that  accused Nos. 3 and 4 are the Directors of
the company.  There are no specific  allegations  or
averments, not even in the form of bald statement or
reproduction  of  relevant clause from <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_34">Section 34</a> to
the effect," in charge of  and  responsible  to  the
company  for  conduct  of  business",  much  less as
against accused Nos. 1 and 2, in  para  no. 2  of  the
complaint,  wherein,  it  is  specifically said that
accused No. 1 is Manufacturing  Chemist  and  accused
No. 2  is  the  Quality  Control Chemist, under whose
supervision    the    product    was    respectively
manufactured and analysed.  
</p> 

<p id="p_43"> In  view of the ratio from various cases
relied  upon  and  absence  of  specific   averments
against  petitioners/accused  Nos. 3  and  4  in  the
complaint, the arguments  advanced  by  the  learned
counsel for petitioners will have to be accepted.
</p>
 

<p id="p_44">14. Observations of the Supreme Court in the
matter of Ram Kishan Rohatagi (supra) have compelled
me  to  invite  attention  of learned counsel to the
fact that in the complaint Exhibit "A" accused Nos. 3
and 4 are described in a different manner, so far as
their  status  vis-a-vis   company   is   concerned.
Accused  No. 4  is  described  as "Director" whereas,
accused No. 3 is described  as  "Managing  Director".
All  the ratios relied upon and conclusions drawn by
me above, would be mutatis  mutandis  applicable  to
accused  No. 4,  but it becomes necessary to consider
whether  the  accused  No. 3  who  is  described   as
Managing  Director,  can  be  treated  on  the  same
footing as the Director.  
</p> 

<p id="p_45"> I   have   drawn  attention  of  learned
counsel for petitioners to the dictionary meaning of
word  "management"   which   means   administration,
control, supervision  etc.    It  was argued by Shri
Gupte, Sr.  Counsel that merely because accused No. 3
is described as "Managing Director", that by  itself
will not be sufficient to draw a presumption that he
was  in  charge  of or responsible to the conduct of
business of the company.  He may be  having  control
over  matter such as policy decision, but not on the
production or manufacture of the  objectional  drug.
In  the absence of specific averments that he was in
charge of and responsible  to  the  conduct  of  the
company,  so far as it related to manufacture of the
drug, he would not be liable for  prosecution  along
with  company  and  there  are  no  averments in the
complaint attracting ingredients required by <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_35">Section
34(1)</a> and therefore,  mere  description  of  accused
No. 3  as Managing Director will not be sufficient to
sustain the process issued against him.  
</p> 

<p id="p_46"> 15. In the matter  of  Ram  Kishan  Rohatagi
(supra),  the apex Court was concerned with the case
of Manager and not that of Managing Director.    For
the  purpose of finding out distinction in the roles
played by these two authorities in  the  life  of  a
company, I have referred to the definitions of these
terms from  the  <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_36">Companies Act</a>, 1956.  <a href="/doc/27875011/" id="a_37">Section 2(24)</a>
defines the word "Manager" as follows :  
  " 2(24) :  Manager means an individual
(not  being  the  managing  agent)  who,
subject to the superintendence,  control
and   directions   of   the   Board   of
Directors, has  the  management  of  the
whole  or substantially the whole of the
affairs  of  company,  and  includes   a
Director  or  any other person occupying
the position of Manager by whatever name
called and whether under the contract of
service or not."  
</p> 

<p id="p_47"> <a href="/doc/27875011/" id="a_38">Section    2(26)</a>    defines,   "Managing
Director" thus;  
</p><p id="p_48">  " 2(26) :  Managing Director  means  a
Director,  who by virtue of an agreement
with the company or a resolution  passed
by the company in the general meeting or
by  its  Board of Directors or by virtue
of  its  memorandum   or   articles   of
association     is     entrusted    with
substantial powers  of  the  management,
which would not otherwise be exercisable
by   him   and  includes  the  Director,
occupying  the  position   of   Managing
Director by whatever name called."  
</p> 

<p id="p_49"> The  distinction  between  Manager and
Managing Director is that, while  the  Manager  by
virtue  of his office has the management of whole or
substantially whole of the affairs of  the  company,
the  Managing Director has to be entrusted with such
powers of the management as may be thought fit.  The
powers of management are required  to  be  delegated
upon  the  Managing Director, either by an agreement
with the company or by a resolution  passed  by  the
Board  of  Directors  in  its  general meeting or by
virtue of its memorandum or article of  association.
It is not the name by which the person is called but
the  position  he  occupies  and  the  functions and
duties which he discharges that  determines  whether
infact,  he  is  in charge of and responsible to the
company or  not.  
</p> 

<p id="p_50"> Taking     this     distinction     into
consideration, there need not be  a  presumption  of
accused  No. 3  being  in-charge of or responsible to
the company  for  production  of  objectional  drug.
Although  Food  Inspector  has  obtained information
from the company itself that the respondent No.3  is
the  Managing  Director,  further  details  such  as
agreement between him and the company or  resolution
passed by  the  Board  of  Directors  etc.  by which
substantial powers of management are conferred  upon
accused  No. 3, are neither obtained nor incorporated
in the complaint.  
</p> 

<p id="p_51"> 16. On  reference  to <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_39">Section 34</a> as a whole,
there is a presumption of being guilty  against  the
person,  who  is in-charge of and responsible to the
company, and such a person is liable to be  punished
unless he proves that offence was committed, without
his   knowledge   or  inspite  of  exercise  of  due
diligence to prevent the commission of offence.   By
virtue  of sub-section (2) which is given overriding
effect over sub-section (1) by  non-obstante  clause
in  its  opening part, the prosecution is obliged to
prove that the offence has been committed  with  the
consent  or  connivance of or is attributable to any
neglect  on  the  part  of  any  Director,  Manager,
Secretary  or  other  officer of the company, before
drawing  a  presumption  of  guilty   against   such
individual.  
</p> 

<p id="p_52"> Taking   into   consideration  the  over
riding effect given to sub-section (2)  it  will  be
responsibility  of the prosecution to first indicate
and prove that objectionable drug  was  manufactured
with  the  consent  or in connivance of the Managing
Director  or  production  of  the   said   drug   is
attributable  to  any  neglect  on  the  part of the
Managing Director,  only  thereafter,  he  would  be
presumed  to  be  the  person  in  charge  of and is
responsible to the company for conduct  of  business
and   will   be  obliged  to  establish  absence  of
knowledge or exercise of due diligence in  order  to
seek exoneration.  
</p> 

<p id="p_53"> 17. In  the  recent  judgment in the case of
U.P.Pollution Control Board Vs.  Mohan Meakins , the order issuing  process  passed  by
the  Chief Judicial Magistrate against the Directors
of M/s Mohan Meakins for the offence under the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_40">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974  was
quashed by   the  Sessions  Judge.    The  Pollution
Control Board moved  the  High  Court  in  revision,
which was  dismissed  by  the  High  Court.    While
dismissing the appeal  preferred  by  the  Pollution
Control  Board  and  directing  the  trial  court to
proceed with the case,  supreme  Court  observed  in
para No. 12;  
</p>  

<p id="p_54">  " In the above context  what  is  to  be
looked  at  during  the stage of issuing
process is whether there are allegations
in the complaint by which  the  Managers
or  Directors of the Company can also be
proceeded against, when the  Company  is
alleged to be guilty of the offence."  
</p> 
 

<p id="p_55"> The  complaint  contained averments that
accused persons i.e.  Directors/Managers/Partners of
M/s Mohan Meakins were responsible for  constructing
the  proper  works  and  plant  for the treatment of
their highly  polluting  trade  effluent  so  as  to
conform to  the standard laid down by the Board.  It
also alleged that accused persons were  deliberately
avoiding to abide by the provisions of the said Act.
It  was  in  the  light  of factual averments in the
complaint, the Supreme Court was of  the  view  that
the  Directors and Managing Directors of the company
were liable to be  proceeded  against  according  to
law.  
</p> 

<p id="p_56"> In  the matter at hands, except the bare
statement that accused Nos. 3 and 4 are the Directors
of the company, there are no averments that they are
in charge of or responsible to the company, not even
in the form of bald statement.  
</p> 

<p id="p_57"> 18. Before closing, reference to  paragraphs
Nos. 17  and  19 of the judgment in the matter of Ram
Kishan Rohatagi  (supra)  is  inevitable.      After
referring  to  the  powers  to proceed against other
persons  appearing  to  be  guilty  of  offence   as
contained  in  <a href="/doc/435819/" id="a_41">Section  319</a>  of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 in para No. 17 of the  judgment,  the
Supreme  Court  made  following observations in para
No.19;  
</p>  

<p id="p_58">  "  In  the  circumstances, therefore, if
the prosecution can at any stage produce
evidence which satisfies the court  that
the  other accused or those who have not
been arrayed  as  accused  against  whom
proceedings  have been quashed have also
committed the offence the Court can take
cognizance against  them  and  try  them
along with  the  other accused.  But, we
would hasten to add that this is  really
an    extraordinary   power   which   is
conferred on the  court  and  should  be
used very sparing and only if compelling
reasons   exist  for  taking  cognizance
against the other  person  against  whom
action has not  been  taken.  ......  We
leave   the   entire   matter   to   the
discretion  of  the  court  concerned so
that it may act according to  law.    We
would,  however,  make it plain that the
mere fact that the proceedings have been
quashed against respondents 2 to 5  will
not  prevent  the  court from exercising
its discretion if it is fully  satisfied
that   a   case  for  taking  cognizance
against them has been made  out  on  the
additional evidence led before it."   
</p> 

<p id="p_59"> 19. The   Writ   Petitions  are,  therefore,
allowed and the process issued  against  petitioners
shall  stand recalled, however, by clarifying, as in
the case of Ram Kishan Rohatagi  - ,
that  mere fact that process against the petitioners
is recalled will not prevent the  trial  court  from
exercising  its discretion, if it is fully satisfied
that the case for taking cognizance against them has
been made out on the additional evidence that may be
led before it.  
</p> 

<p id="p_60"> Rule is accordingly made absolute,  with
clarification.
