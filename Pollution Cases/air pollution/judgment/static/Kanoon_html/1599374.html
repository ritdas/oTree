HEADNOTE:
     Delhi Cloth Mills Ltd., a public limited company having
its registered	in Delhi  runs an  enterprise called Shriram
Foods and  Fertilizer Industries,  which has  several  units
engaged	 in  the  manufacture  of  caustic  soda,  chlorine,
hydrochloric acid,  stable bleaching powder, superphosphate,
vanaspati,  soap,  sulphuric  acid,  alum  anhydrous  sodium
sulphate, high	test hypochlorite  and active  earth.  These
various units are all set up in a single complex situated in
approximately 76  acrea and  they are  surrounded by thickly
populated colonies  such as  Punjabi Bagh, West Patel Nagar,
Karampura, Ashok Vihar, Trinagar, Shastri Nagar and within a
radius	of  3  kilometres  from	 this  complex	there  is  a
population of  approximately 200,000.  The caustic  chlorine
plant was  commissioned in  the	 year  1949  and  it  has  a
strength  of  about  263  employees'  including	 executives,
supervisors, staff and workers.
     In the  wake of  the Bhopal  gas tragedy  realising the
hazardous character  of caustic	 chlorine plant	 of Shriram,
the Labour  Ministry of the Government of India commissioned
"Technica", a  firm of consultants, Scientists and Engineers
of the	United Kindgom	who set out the areas of concern and
potential problems,  in their  Report. Thereafter, the Delhi
Administration constituted  an Expert  Committee  under	 the
Chairmanship of Mr. Manmohan Singh. This Committee made
313
various recommendations	 in regard  to safety  and pollution
control measures  with a  view to  minimising hazard  to the
workmen and the public.
     On December  4, 1985, a major leakage of oleum gas took
place from  one of  the units  of Shri	Ram and this leakage
affected a large number of persons, both amongst the workmen
and the	 public and an Advocate practising in the Tis Hazari
Court died  on account	of inhalation  of  oleum  gas.	This
leakage resulted  from the  bursting of	 the tank containing
oleum gas  as a	 result of  the collapse of the structure on
which it  was mounted  and it  created a  scare amongst	 the
people residing	 in that area. Hardly had the people got out
of the shock of this disaster, when within two days, another
leakage, though this time a minor one took place as a result
of escape  of oleum  gas from  the joints  of  a  pipe.	 The
immediate response  of the Delhi Administration to these two
leakages was  the making  of an order dated 6th December '85
by the	District Magistrate  Delhi, under sub-section (1) of
<a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_6">section 133</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, directing and
requiring Shriram  within two days from the date of issue of
the  order   to	 cease	 carrying  on	the  occupation	  of
manufacturing and  processing hazardous and lethal chemicals
and  gases   including	 chlorine,   oleum,   superchlorine,
phosphate etc.	at their establishment in Delhi and within 7
days to	 remove such chemicals and gases from the said place
and not	 again to keep or store them at the same place or to
appear	on  17th  December  85	in  the	 Court	of  District
Magistrate, Delhi  to show cause why the order should not be
enforced. In the meantime, the "Agarwal Committee" appointed
by the	Supreme Court visited the caustic chlorine plant and
submitted  a   Report  in   which  it  pointed	out  various
inadequacies in	 the pland and expressed the opinion that it
was not	 possible to  eliminate hazard to the public so long
as the plant remained at the present location.
     Since there  were conflicting  opinions put  forward in
regard to  the question	 whether the  caustic chlorine plant
should be allowed to be restarted without any real hazard or
risk to	 the workmen and the public at large, another Expert
Committee called "Nilay Choudhary Committee" was constituted
by the	Supreme Court,	by its order dated 18th December 85.
This  Committee	  visited  the	caustic	 chlorine  plant  on
December 28, 1985 and after considering Dr. Slater, Manmohan
Singh Committee,  Agarwal Committee  and after	hearing	 the
parties
314
made a	report setting	out 14	recommendations which in its
opinion were  required to be complied with by the management
in order  to minimise  the hazards  due to possible chlorine
leak.  The  Committee  also  pointed  out  that	 it  was  in
agreement with the recommendations made in the Report of the
Manmohan Singh Committee which were exhaustive in nature and
obviously the  recommendations made by it in its Report were
supplementary recommendation  in addition to those contained
in Manmohan Singh Committee's Report.
     In addition  to these  Committees, the  Lt. Governor of
Delhi  also   appointed	 an   Expert  Committee	 called	 the
"Seturaman Committee"  which submitted	its  Report  on	 3rd
January, 1986.
     While these proceedings were going on before the Court,
an order  dated 7th  December 85 was issued by the Inspector
of Factories, Delhi in exercise of the power conferred under
<a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_7">section 40</a>,  sub-section (2)  of the  <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_8">Factories	 Act</a>,  1948,
prohibiting  Shriram   from  using   caustic  chlorine	 and
sulphuric acid	plants till  adequate  safety  measures	 are
adopted and  imminent danger  to human	life is	 eliminated.
Soon thereafter,  on December  13, 1985	 a show cause notice
was issued  by the Assistant Commissioner (Factories) of the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi, calling upon Shriram to show
cause as  to why action for revocation of its licence should
not be taken under <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_9">section 430</a>, sub-section (3) of the Delhi
Municipal Corporation  Act, 1957  for violation of the terms
and conditions	of the licence. Shriram showed cause, by its
letter	dated	23rd  December'	 85,  against  the  proposed
cancellation of	 its licence  but by  an  order	 dated	24th
December'  85,	 the  Assistant	  Commissioner	 (Factories)
directed Shriram  to stop  industrial use of the premises at
which the  chlorine caustic  plant is located. The result is
that unless  these two	orders - one dated 7th December 1985
and the	 other dated  24th December  1985 -  are vacated  or
suspended,  Shriram  cannot  restart  the  caustic  chlorine
plant. Hence  the Shriram's  Writ Petition  challenging	 the
said two orders.
     Suspending the  operation of  the two orders ad-interim
to enable  Shriram to  restart the plants for manufacture of
caustic chlorine  including its	 by products, the Court laid
down as many as eleven conditions, and
315
^
     HELD: 1.  All Expert  Committees are unanimous in their
view that  by adopting	proper and adequate safety measures,
the element  of risk  to the workmen and the public can only
be minimised,  but it  cannot  be  totally  eliminated.	 The
general concensus of opinion of all the Expert Committees is
that relocation	 of the	 caustic chlorine  plant is the only
long term  solution, if	 hazard to  the community  is to  be
completely eliminated.	Whether the  caustic chlorine  plant
should be  directed to	be shifted  or relocated  at a place
where there  will be  no hazard	 to the community and if so,
within what  time-frame, is  a question	 which will  require
serious consideration  and a National Policy will have to be
evolved by the Government for location of toxic or hazardous
industries and a decision will have to be taken in regard to
relocation of  such industries	with a	view to	 eliminating
risk to	 the community likely to arise from the operation of
such industries. [325 B-D; 329 E-F]
     1.2  It  is  undoubtedly  true  that  chlorine  gas  is
dangerous to  the life	and health  of the  community and it
escapes either	from the  storage tanks	 or from  the filled
cylinders  or	from  any   other  point  in  the  cause  of
production, it is likely to affect the health and well being
of the	workmen and the people in the vicinity. Both Agarwal
and Manmohan  Singh Committees	are agreed  to their opinion
that  chlorine	 is  a	hazardous  gas	and  though  smaller
concentrations	of   chlorine  in  the	air  cause  only  an
irritation and	coughing, longer  concentrations whether  25
parts per  million (PPM)  or 40	 parts per million (PPM) are
likely to  cause serious danger to life. However, in view of
the Report  of yet  another Expert  Committee (consisting of
Dr. Manmohan  Singh, Dr.  Sharma, Prof.	 P.  Khanna  &amp;	Shri
Gharekhan) appointed for the purpose of ascertaining whether
the various recommendations made in the earlier Reports were
substantially  complied	  with	or   not,  and	taking	into
consideration that  even the  restarting of  the  Vanaspati,
refined oil  plant and	recovery plants like soap, glycerine
and technical  hard oil,  not involving	 any health  hazard,
cannot be possible unless the caustic chlorine plant is also
restarted and  several other  factors including the power of
the Board  to renew or not to renew consent orders under the
<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">Water Act</a>, the balance of convenience would tilt
in favour  of Shriram  to be allowed to restart their plants
subject to  certain stringent conditions. [330 G-H; 331 C-D;
337 D-H]
316
     1.3  Since	 cases	involving  issues  of  environmental
pollution, ecological destruction and conflicts over natural
resources are  increasingly coming  up for  adjudication and
these cases  involve assessment	 and evolution of scientific
and  technical	data,  it  might  be  desirable	 to  set  up
Enviornment  Courts   on  the	regional  basis	  with	 one
professional Judge and two experts drawn from the Ecological
Sciences Research  Group keeping  in view  the nature of the
case and  the expertise required for its adjudication. There
would of  course be a right of appeal to this Court from the
decision of the Environment Court. [345 H; 346 A-C]

</p><p id="p_3">     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
     BHAGWATI, C.J.  Writ Petition  No. 12739  of 1985 which
has been brought by way of public interest litigation raises
some seminal  questions concerning  the true scope and ambit
of Arts.  21 and  32 of the Constitution, the principles and
norms for  determining the  liability of  large	 enterprises
engaged in  manufacture and  sale of hazardous products, the
basis on  which damages	 in case of such liability should be
quantified and	whether such  large  enterprises  should  be
allowed to  continue to	 function in thickly populated areas
and if they are permitted so to function, what measures must
be taken for the purpose of reducing to a minimum the hazard
to  the	  workmen  and	 the   community   living   in	 the
neighbourhood. These questions which have been raised by the
petitioner  are	  questions  of	  the  greatest	  importance
particularly since,  following upon  the leakage  of MIC gas
from the  Union Carbide Plant in Bhopal, lawyers, judges and
jurists are  considerably exercised  as	 to  what  controls,
whether by way of relocation or by way of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">317</span>
installation of	 adequate safety devices, need to be imposed
on Corporations employing hazardous technology and producing
toxic or  dangerous substances	and if	any  liquid  or	 gas
escapes which  is injurious  to the  workmen and  the people
living in the surrounding areas, on account of negligence or
otherwise,  what   is  the   extent  of	 liability  of	such
Corporations and  what remedies can be devised for enforcing
such liability with a view to securing payment of damages to
the persons affected by such leakage of liquid or gas. These
questions arise	 in the	 present case  since on	 4th and 6th
December, 1985,	 there was  admittedly leakage	of oleum gas
from one  of the  units	 of  Shriram  Foods  and  Fertiliser
Industries and	as a result of such leakage, several persons
were affected  and according to the petitioner and the Delhi
Bar Association,  one Advocate	practising in the Tis Hazari
Courts died.  We propose to hear detailed arguments on these
questions at  a later date. But one pressing issue which has
to be  decided by  us immediately is whether we should allow
the caustic  chlorine plant  of Shriram Foods and Fertiliser
Industries to be restarted and that is the question which we
are proceeding to decide in this judgment.
</p><p id="p_4">     Delhi Cloth  Mills Ltd.  is a  public  limited  company
having its registered office in Delhi. It runs an enterprise
called Shriram	Foods and  Fertiliser  Industries  and	this
enterprise has	several units  engaged in the manufacture of
caustic soda,  chlorine, hydrochloric acid, stable bleaching
powder, superphosphate,	 vanaspati,  soap,  sulphuric  acid,
alum anhydrous	sodium sulphate,  high test hypochlorite and
active earth. These various units are all set up in a single
complex situated  in approximately  76 acres  and  they	 are
surrounded by  thickly populated  colonies such	 as  Punjabi
Bagh, West  Patel Nagar,  Karampura, Ashok  Vihar, Tri Nagar
and Shastri  Nagar and	within a redius of 3 kilometres from
this complex  there is	population of approximately 200,000.
We are	concerned  in  this  Order  only  with	the  caustic
chlorine plant. This plant was commissioned in the year 1949
and it	has a  strength of  about  263	employees  including
executives, supervisors,  staff and workers. It appears that
until the  Bhopal tragedy,  no one neither the management of
Shriram	 Foods	 and  Fertiliser   Industries	(hereinafter
referred to  as 'Shriram') not the Government seemed to have
bothered at  all about	the hazardous  character of  caustic
chlorine plant	of Shriram.  But, it  seems that  the Bhopal
disaster shook of the lethargy of everyone and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">318</span>
triggered  off	 a  new	 wave  of  consciousness  and  every
Government became  alerted to  the  necessity  of  examining
whether	 industries   employing	 hazardous   technology	 and
producing dangerous  commodities were  equipped with  proper
and  adequate  safety  and  pollution  control	devices	 and
whether they  posed  any  danger  to  the  workmen  and	 the
community living  around them.	The Labour  Ministry of	 the
Government of  India accordingly  commissioned 'Technica', a
firm of	 Consultants, Scientists  and  Engineers  of  United
Kingdom, to  visit the caustic chlorine plant of Shriram and
make a	report	in  regard  to	the  areas  of	concern	 and
potential  problems  relating  to  that	 plant.	 Dr.  Slater
visited the  caustic chlorine  plant on	 behalf of  Technica
sometime in  June-July 1985  and submitted  a report  to the
Government of  India  summarising  the	initial	 impressions
formed during  his visit  and subsequent  dialogue with	 the
management  and	 with  one  Mr.	 Harries.  This	 report	 was
admittedly not	an indepth  engineering study but it set out
the preliminary	 conclusions of	 Dr. Slater in regard to the
areas of  concern and  potential problems. We do not propose
to rely	 very much  on this report since it is a preliminary
report.
</p><p id="p_5">     It appears	 that a	 question was  raised in  Parliament
sometime in March 1985 in regard to the possibility of major
leakage of liquid chlorine from the caustic chlorine unit of
Shriram and  of danger	to the lives of thousands of workers
and others.  The Minister  of Chemicals	 and Fertilizers, in
answer to  this question,  stated in  the floor of the House
that the  Government of	 India was  fully conscious  of	 the
problem of  hazards from  dangerous and	 toxic processes and
assured the  House that	 the necessary	steps  for  securing
observance of  safety standards	 would be taken early in the
interest of  the workers and the general public. Pursuant to
this assurance,	 the  Delhi  Administration  constituted  an
Expert Committee  consisting of	 Shri Manmohan	Singh, Chief
Manager, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_13">IPC</a>L,	BARODA, as  Chairman and  3 other persons as
Members to  go into  the existence  of safety  and pollution
control measures  covering  all	 aspects  such	as  storage,
manufacture and	 handling of  chlorine	in  Shriram  and  to
suggest measures  necessary  for  strengthening	 safety	 and
pollution control  arrangements with  a view  to eliminating
community risk.	 The Manmohan  Singh Committee	visited	 the
caustic chlorine  plant	 and  inspected	 various  operations
including storage  tanks, cylinders and tonners and obtained
detailed  information	from  the  management  and  after  a
thorough and exhaustive inquiry, submitted its Report to the
Government. This Report is a detailed Report
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">319</span>
dealing exclusively  with the  caustic	chlorine  plant	 and
considerable reliance  must, therefore,	 be placed  upon it.
The Manmohan Singh Committee made various recommendations in
this Report  in	 regard	 to  safety  and  pollution  control
measures with a view to minimising hazard to the workmen and
the public  and obviously  the caustic chlorine plant cannot
be allowed  to be restarted unless these recommendations are
strictly complied with by the management of Shriram.
</p><p id="p_6">     Now, on 4th December, 1985 a major leakage of oleum gas
took place from one of the units of Shriram and this leakage
affected a large number of persons, both amongst the workmen
and  the  public,  and,	 according  to	the  petitioner,  an
Advocate practising in the Tis Hazari Courts died on account
of inhalation  of oleum	 gas. This leakage resulted from the
bursting of the tank containing oleum gas as a result of the
collapse of  the structure  on which  it was  mounte and  it
created a  scare amongst  the people  residing in that area.
Hardly had  the people got out of the shock of this disaster
when, within  two days,	 another leakage, though this time a
minor one,  took place	as a  result of	 escape of oleum gas
from the  joints of  a pipe.  The immediate  response of the
Delhi Administration to these two leakages was the making of
an Order dated 6th December 1985 by the District Magistrate,
Delhi under  sub-s.(1) of  s.133<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_14"> of  the  Code</a>	of  Criminal
Procedure, directing  and requiring  Shriram within two days
from the date of issue of the order to cease carrying on the
occupation of  manufacturing and  processing  hazardous	 and
lethal chemicals and gases including chlorine, oleum, super-
chlorine, phosphate,  etc. at  their establishment  in Delhi
and within  7 days  to remove  such chemicals and gases from
the said  place and  not again	to keep or store them at the
same place  or to  appear on 17th December 1985 in the court
of the	District Magistrate,  Delhi to	show cause  why	 the
order should  not be  enforced. When  we took  up  the	writ
petitions for  hearing on  7th December	 1985, our attention
was drawn  to this  order made	by the	District Magistrate,
Delhi on  6th December	1985 and  on perusing  the order  we
pointed out  the inadequacies  in it which had the effect of
virtually defeating  the urgency  of the action to be taken.
We had	earlier appointed  a team  of Experts  to visit	 the
caustic chlorine  plant of Shriram and to report whether the
recommendations of  the Manmohan  Singh Committee  had	been
carried out  by the  management and  this  team	 of  Experts
orally reported	 to us	at the hearing on 7th December, 1985
that they
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">320</span>
had been  able to  inspect the	plant for  only a  couple of
hours and  that cursory	 inspection showed  that many of the
recommendations of  the Manmohan Singh Committee appeared to
have been  complied with  and that  too two  one hundred  MT
tanks for  storage of  chlorine which  constituted  a  major
element of  hazard or  risk had	 been  emptied.	 Since	this
inspection made by the team of Experts had necessarily to be
very  hurried	and  superficial   on  account	of  want  of
sufficient time,  we adjourned	the writ  petition  to	13th
December, 1985 with a direction that the petitioner would be
entitled to  appoint his  own team  of experts	who would be
allowed access to the caustic chlorine plant for the purpose
of ascertaining	 whether the  various recommendations of the
Manmohan Singh	Committee had  been carried  out or  not and
whether there  were  any  other	 drawbacks  or	deficiencies
likely to  endanger the	 lives of workmen and the public. We
also, with  a view  to expediting adjudication of claims for
compensation on	 behalf of the victims of oleum gas leakage,
appointed the  Chief Metropolitan  Magistrate as the Officer
before whom  claims for compensation may be filed by persons
affected by  leakage of	 oleum gas  in the course of the two
incidents referred  to above and we fixed time of four weeks
within which  such claim of compensation may be filed before
the Chief  Metropolitan Magistrate,  Delhi. We may point out
that subsequently  by an  Order dated  10.1.1986 we extended
the time  for filing of compensation claims upto January 31,
1986. We  also by  our Orders  dated 16.1.1986 and 21.1.1986
gave a	further direction  that those  who file compensation
claims	before	the  Chief  Metropolitan  Magistrate,  Delhi
should be got examined by a team of Medical Experts and this
task was entrusted to the Secretary of the Delhi State Legal
Aid and	 Advice Board. This direction was given by us with a
view to	 ensuring that	contemporaneous medical	 evidence of
the injuries  suffered by  the claimants and of the cause of
such injury should be available in support of the claims for
compensation lodged by the victims of oleum gas leakage.
</p><p id="p_7">     Pursuant to  the liberty  given by	 us, the  petitioner
appointed  an	Expert	Committee  consisting  of  Dr.	G.D.
Agarwal, Professor T. Shivaji Rao and Shri Purkayastha. This
Committee, which we shall hereafter refer to as the 'Agarwal
Committee', visited the caustic chlorine plant and submitted
a Report  to this  Court in  which it  pointed	out  various
inadequacies in	 the plant and expressed the opinion that it
was not possible
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">321</span>
to eliminate  hazard to	 the public  so long  as  the  plant
remained at the present location.
</p><p id="p_8">     Since  there  were	 conflicting  opinions	put  forward
before us  in regard  to the  question whether	the  caustic
chlorine plant should be allowed to be restarted without any
real hazard  or risk to the workmen and the public at large,
we thought  it desirable  to appoint  an independent team of
Experts to  assist us  in this	task. We  accordingly by  an
Order dated  18th December,  1985 constituted a Committee of
Experts consisting  of Dr.  Nilay Choudhary  as Chairman and
Dr. Aghoramurty	 and Mr. R.K. Garg as Members to inspect the
caustic chlorine  plant and  submit a report to the Court on
the following three points :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  1. Whether  the plant can be allowed to recommence
	  the operations in its present state and condition?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  2. If	 not, what  are the  measures required to be
	  adopted  against  the	 hazard	 or  possibility  of
	  leaks, explosion, pollution of air and water etc.,
	  for this purpose?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  3. How  many of  the safety  devices	against	 the
	  above hazards	 and possibility  exist in the plant
	  at present  and which	 of them,  though necessary,
	  are not installed in the plant.</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">     This Committee  of Experts to which we shall hereafter,
for the	 sake of  convenience, refer  to as 'Nilay Choudhary
Committee', visited  the caustic  chlorine plant on December
28, 1985 and after considering the Reports of Doctor Slater,
Manmohan Singh	Committee and  Agarwal Committee and hearing
the parties  made a  report to	the  Court  setting  out  14
recommendations which  in its  opinion were  required to  be
complied with  by the  management in  order to	minimise the
hazards due  to	 possible  chlorine  leak.  Nilay  Choudhary
Committee pointed  out that  it was  in agreement  with	 the
recommendations made  in the  Report of	 the Manmohan  Singh
Committee which	 were exhaustive in nature and obviously the
recommendations made  by it in its Report were supplementary
recommednations in  addition to	 those contained in Manmohan
Singh Committee's Report.
</p><p id="p_10">     We have thus two major Reports, one of Manmohan Singh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">322</span>
Committee  and	the  other  of	Nilay  Choudhary  Committee,
setting out  the recommendations which must be complied with
by the management of Shriram in order to minimise the hazard
or risk	 which the  caustic  chlorine  plant  poses  to	 the
workmen and  the  public.  The	question  is  whether  these
recommendations have been complied with by the management of
Shriram, for  it is  only if these recommendations have been
carried out  that  we  can  possibly  consider	whether	 the
caustic chlorine plant should be allowed to be restarted.
</p><p id="p_11">     There is  also one	 other report to which we must refer
in this connection and that is the Report made by the Expert
Committee appointed  by the  Lt. Governor of Delhi following
upon the  leakage of  oleum gas	 on 4th December 1985. Since
the leakage  of oleum gas caused serious public concern, the
Lt.  Governor  of  Delhi  constituted  an  Expert  committee
consisting of Shri N.K. Seturaman as Chairman and four other
experts as  members to	go into	 the causes  of spillage  of
oleum and  its after-effects,  to examine  if inspection and
safety procedures  prescribed under  the existing  laws	 and
rules were  followed by	 Shriram, to  fix responsibility for
the leakage  of oleum gas, to review the emergency plans and
measures for  containment of risk in the event of occurrence
of such	 situations and	 for  elmination  of  pollution,  to
examine any  other aspects that may have a bearing on safety
pollution control  and hazard to the public from the factory
of Shriram,  to make specific recommendations with a view to
achieving effective pollution control and safety measures in
the factory  and to  advise whether  the factory  should  be
shifted away  from its present location in densely populated
area. This Committee to which we shall hereafter refer to as
the "Seturaman	Committee" made an on the spot inspection of
the site  of the  factory and  after obtaining	the required
information about  the	plant  submitted  a  Report  on	 3rd
January 1986.  This  Report,  it  must	be  conceded,  deals
primarily with	the safety  procedures in the sulphuric acid
plant from  which there	 was oleum  gas leakage	 and is	 not
based  on  any	indepth	 review	 and  study  of	 safety	 and
pollution control  measures in	the caustic  chlorine plant.
But even  so it	 does contain  some observations  which have
relevance to the question whether the caustic chlorine plant
poses any hazard to the community and what steps or measures
are necessary to be taken to minimise the risk to the people
living in the vicinity.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">323</span>
<p id="p_12">     It is  necessary at this stage to point out that whilst
these proceedings  were going  on before the Court, an order
dated 7th  December 1985  was issued  by  the  Inspector  of
Factories, Delhi  in exercise  of the  power conferred under
<a href="/doc/137569/" id="a_15">Section 40</a>  sub-section (2)  of the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_16">Factories Act</a>, 1948. The
order commenced with the following recital, viz.,
	  "Whereas  it	has  appeared  to  me  that  Caustic
	  chlorine  plant  and	sulphuric  acid	 plants	 are
	  running without  adequate  safety  measures  being
	  adopted by  your management,	thereby	 endangering
	  the human  life and  safety of the workers and the
	  public at  large. Earlier  notices of	 the  Labour
	  Department asking your management to ensure proper
	  safety measures  has not been complied with fully;
	  and
	  Whereas inspite  of your  management's  assurances
	  vide letter  dated  14.10.1985,  on  4.12.85,	 non
	  adoption of  the  adequate  safety  measures	have
	  resulted in  collapse of  the structure  on  which
	  oleum tank  was mounted  resulting in	 the massive
	  leakage of  oleum causing fumes in the environment
	  affecting the	 health and safety of a large number
	  of residents of the Union Territory of Delhi; and
	  Whereas the  factory is  not still having adequate
	  safety measures required for such plants."
</p><p id="p_13">and prohibited	Shriram from  using the caustic chlorine and
sulphuric acid	plants till  adequate  safety  measures	 are
adopted and  inminent danger  to human	life is	 eliminated.
Soon thereafter,  on December  13, 1985, a show-cause notice
was issued  by the Assistant Commissioner (Factories) of the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi calling upon Shriram to show-
cause as  to why action for revocation of its licence should
not be	taken under <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_17">Section 430</a> sub-section (3) of the Delhi
Municipal Corporation  Act, 1957  for violation of the terms
and conditions	of the	licence. Shriram by its letter dated
23rd December,	1985,  showed  cause  against  the  proposed
cancellation of	 its licence  but by  an  Order	 dated	24th
December  1985,	  the  Assistant   Commissioner	 (Factories)
directed Shriram  to stop  industrial use of the premises at
which the  chlorine caustic  plant is located. The result is
that unless  these two	orders - one dated 7th December 1985
and the other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">324</span>
dated 24th December 1985 - are vacated or suspended, Shriram
cannot be allowed to restart the caustic chlorine plant.
</p><p id="p_14">     We may first consider what has been said by the various
Expert Committees in regard to the relocation of the caustic
Chlorine plant.	 All the  Expert Committees are unanimous in
their view  that by  adopting  proper  and  adequate  safety
measures the  elements of risk to the workmen and the public
can only  be minimised	but it cannot be totally eliminated.
Dr. Slater  has in  the last  part of his Report pointed out
that inspection	 of the	 caustic chlorine  plant revealed "a
worrying state	of affairs"  and he  was of the opinion that
the plant  was liable  to be  "classed	as  a  major  hazard
facility  by   applying	 most	of  the	 currently  accepted
definitions"  and   it	did   not   "measure   up   to	 the
responsibilities incumbent  upon operators of such plants to
safeguard both	public and employees so far as is reasonably
practicable." He  made various	recommendations which in his
opinion were  required to be complied with by Shriram and he
added that  if a  substantial improvement  in safety was not
possible or  rapidly forthcoming  along the  lines of  these
recommendations	   "the	   authorities	  should    consider
constraining  its  activities  to  protect  the	 public	 and
employees". He	concluded by  observing that  "relocation is
the only  practicable long term option which would guarantee
the complete  removal of  the community	 risk". The Manmohan
Singh Committee	 also observed towards the end of its Report
that "total  elimination of risk to the comminity i.e. human
population from	 toxic plant  hazardous industry  located in
close proximity	 is improbable.	 However, the probability of
risk can  be immensely	reduced if  the plant  is  run	with
adequate  precautions,"	  and  proceeded   to  make  various
recommendations for "strict and immediate compliance with an
object to  minimise risk  to the  workers and the population
around". Seturaman's Committee also pointed out in paragraph
10.8.1. of  its Report	that Shriram factory "is certainly a
perennial source  of hazard  to the community. These hazards
cannot be  completely eliminated  but could  be minimised by
strict compliance  of safety  regulations. Giving due weight
to the	hazard aspects	as mentioned  above and	 taking into
account the  safety  of	 the  community	 as  a	whole,"	 the
Manmohan Singh	Committee observed  that functioning  of the
SEFI in	 the present  location is  not	desirable.  So	also
Aggarwal Committee  opined that	 "under	 so  many  uncertain
factors	 a   chlorine  manufacturing  unit  cannot  be	even
reasonably safe when located in proximity
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">325</span>
to a  densely populated area. In the circumstances, the only
practical solution  is to  relocate the	 chlorine  plant  at
least 10  k.ms.	 away  from  the  urban	 limits	 of  densely
populated areas	 with  adequate	 safety	 measures."  Finally
Nilay Choudhary	 Committee also	 stated that even if all the
recommendations made  in its Report as also in the Report of
Manmohan Singh	Committee were carried out, "the risk due to
major release  of chlorine  could only	be reduced  but	 not
completely eliminated.	Complete elimination  of the risk to
the population	at large obviously lies in relocation of the
plant in  an area without human habitation." It will thus be
seen that the general concensus of opinion of all the Expert
Committees is  that relocation of the caustic chlorine plant
is the only long term solution if hazard to the community is
to be  completely eliminated.  We have	therefore decided to
hear arguments	on the	question as  to whether	 the caustic
chlorine  plant	  should  be  directed	to  be	shifted	 and
relocated at  a place  where there  will be no hazard to the
community and  if so,  within what  time frame.	 This  is  a
question which	will require  serious  consideration  and  a
National Policy	 will have  to be  evolved by the Government
for location of toxic or hazardous industries and a decision
will have  to be  taken in  regard  to	relocation  of	such
industries with	 a view to eliminating risk to the community
likely to  arise from  the operation of such industries. But
the immediate  question which we have to consider is whether
the caustic  chlorine plant  of Shriram should be allowed to
be reopened  and if  so, subject to what conditions, keeping
in  mind  constantly  that  the	 operation  of	the  caustic
chlorine plant	does involve  a certain	 amount of hazard or
risk to the community.
</p><p id="p_15">     Now it  is an  admitted fact  that the caustic chlorine
plant was  set up  by Shriram  more than  35 years  ago	 and
whatever might	have been the situation at the time when the
plant was installed, it cannot be disputed that, at present,
largely owing  to the  growth and  development of  the city,
there is  sizable population  living in	 the vicinity of the
plant and there is therefore hazard or risk to large numbers
of  people,   if,  on	account	 of  any  accident,  whether
occasioned by  negligence or  not, chlorine gas escapes. The
various Expert	Committees appointed  by the  Government  as
well as	 by the	 Court clearly	emphasise the  danger to the
community living in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">326</span>
vicinity of  the caustic chlorine plant if there is exposure
to chlorine gas through an accidental release which may take
place on  account of  negligence or other unforeseen events.
Now it	is evident from the reports of the Expert Committees
</p><p id="p_16">- and  on this	aspect of  the matter they are all unanimous
that there  was considerable  negligence on  the part of the
management of  Shriram in  the maintenance  and operation of
the caustic  chlorine plant  and there were also defects and
drawbacks in  its structure  and design.  The report  of Dr.
Slater which  is the  first report  in	the  series  clearly
pointed	 out   that  the   safety  policies,  practices	 and
awareness on  the  part	 of  the  management  needed  to  be
addressed  urgently   and  added   inter   alia	  that	 the
effectiveness and  availability of  the design and emergency
arrangements was,  to say the least, questionable and in the
real emergency	involving a  major spill, the measures would
probably prove	ineffective in limiting serious consequences
inside and  outside  the  plant.  He  also  added  that	 the
standard of  housekeeping and training among the operational
staff was  not good  and it  was symptomatic  of  inadequate
awareness of  the importance of safety devices and the scale
of potential  consequences following  "loss of containment".
He also	 reiterated that  the manner  in which	the  caustic
chlorine plant	was being  maintained and  operated did	 not
"measure up  to the responsiblities incumbent upon operators
of such	 plants". So  also  the	 report	 of  Manmohan  Singh
Committee pointed  out various drawbacks and deficiencies in
the structure  and design  of the  caustic chlorine plant as
also in	 its maintenance  and  operation  and  made  various
detailed  recommendations   which  in  the  opinion  of	 the
Manmohan  Singh	  Committee  needed   to  be   strictly	 and
scrupulously carried out, if the risk to the workers and the
population in  the vicinity  was to  be minimised. The Nilay
Choudhary Committee  also made	several	 recommendations  in
order to  minimise the	hazard due  to a possible leakage of
chlorine gas.  The management  of Shriram  claimed that	 all
these recommendations  made in the reports of Manmohan singh
committee and Nilay Choudhary Committee had been carried out
by Shriram  and the  possible hazard  to the workers and the
community living  in the  vicinity was almost reduced to nil
and that  Shriram should  therefore be allowed to reopen the
caustic chlorine  plant. The  management of  Shriram made it
clear that  they did  not intended  to	restart	 immediately
their plants  manufacturing Sulphuric  Acid, Oleum,  Chloro-
sulphonic Acid,	 Super Phosphate  and Granulated  Fertiliser
Ferric Alum and Active Earth. Since these plants were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">327</span>
under detailed	engineering audit  and	that  out  of  these
plants Double  Conversion Double  Absorption sulphuric	Acid
plant and  Ferric Alum	and Active  Earth  plants  would  be
started in  the second	phase "after  attending to immediate
maintenance needs"  and that so far as the other plants were
concerned, the	schedule restarting  would  be	communicated
later. The  only plants	 in respect  of which Shriram sought
the permission	of the Court to restart were the power plant
and the	 plants	 manufacturing	vanaspati  and	refined	 oil
including its  by-products and	recovery plants	 like  soap,
glycerine and  technical hard  oil and	the caustic chlorine
plant including	 plants manufacturing  by-products  such  as
sodium sulphate, hydrochloric acid, stable bleaching powder,
superchlor, sodium  hypochlorite and  container	 works.	 Our
directions  in	 the   present	 judgment   must   therefore
necessarily be	confined only  to these plants which Shriram
wants to  restart immediately  and we may make it clear that
so far	as other  plants which	Shriram does  not propose to
restart	 immediately   are  concerned,	they  shall  not  be
restarted by  Shriram without  obtaining further  directions
from  the   Court,  particularly  since	 the  machinery	 and
equipment in  some of  these plants is as pointed out in the
report of  Seturaman Committee	old and	 worn  out  and	 the
safety instrumentation	is not	adequate and the Court would
therefore have	to  be	satisfied  that	 the  machinery	 and
equipment is properly renovated and its design and structure
modernised with a view to ensuring maximum safety before the
Court can  permit these plants to be recommissioned. Now, of
course, there could be no objection to the restarting to the
vanaspati and  refined oil  plant and  other recovery plants
like soap,  glycerine and  technical hard  oil, because they
admittedly  do	not  involve  any  risk	 or  hazard  to	 the
community but  these plants obviously cannot be restarted by
the management	of Shriram  unless  and	 until	the  caustic
chlorine plant	is also	 allowed  to  be  reopened,  because
hydrogen is  needed for	 the vanaspati and refined oil plant
and hydrogen  would not	 be  available	unless	the  caustic
chlorine plant	is put	into operation.	 The question  which
therefore requires  to be  considered  is  whether  all	 the
recommendations	 made  in  the	reports	 of  Manmohan  Singh
Committee and  Nilay Choudhary	Committee in  regard to	 the
caustic	 chlorine   plant  have	 been  carried	out  by	 the
management of  Shriram and  if so, whether Shriram should be
allowed to restart the caustic chlorine plant.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">328</span>
<p id="p_17">     Since there  was considerable  controversy between	 the
parties as to whether the recommendations made in the report
of Manmohan  Singh Committee  and Nilay	 Choudhary Committee
had been  carried out  by the  management of  Shriram and  a
notice dated  28th January,  1986 issued by the Inspector of
Factories (Delhi) to the management of Shriram set out seven
of these  recommendations in  respect of which the Inspector
of Factories  did not  appear to  be satisfied as to whether
they had  been complied	 with or  not and a dispute was also
specifically raised  in the affidavit of Mrs. M.Bassi, Joint
Labour	Commissioner,	Delhi  Administration,	 dated	31st
January,   1986	  in   regard	to   compliacne	  with	 the
recommendations of  Manmohan  Singh  Committee	set  out  in
paragraph 3  and  the  recommendations	of  Nilay  Choudhary
Committee set out in paragraph 4 of the affidavit, the Court
decided to  appoint another Expert Committee for the purpose
of ascertaining	 whether the various recommendations made in
the reports  of Manmohan Singh Committee and Nilay Choudhary
Committee had  been complied  with by  the  management.	 The
Court accordingly  made	 an  order  on	31st  January,	1986
appointing a  Committee consisting  of Shri  Manmohan Singh,
Professor P.  Khanna, Dr. Sharma and Shri Gharekhan to visit
the site of the caustic chlorine plant of Shriram and report
to the	Court whether  the recommendations  contained in the
reports of  Manmohan Singh  Committee  and  Nilay  Choudhary
Committee had  been  complied  with  by	 the  management  of
Shriram and  even if there was no strict compliance with any
of these  recommendations, whether  the measures  adopted by
the management	of  Shriram  were  sufficient  to  meet	 the
requirements set  out  in  the	reports	 of  Manmohan  Singh
Committee and  Nilay  Choudhary	 Committee.  It	 seems	that
Professor P.  Khanna could  not make  his services available
with the  result that  the assignment entrusted by us by our
order dated  31st January,  1986 had  to be carried out by a
Committee consisting  of only  three persons,  namely,	Shri
Manmohan Singh, Dr. Sharma and Shri Gharekhan. The Committee
inspected  the	 caustic  chlorine   plant  of	Shriram	 and
submitted its  report dt.  3rd February,  1986	showing	 the
status of  compliance of  the recommendations  made  by	 the
Manmohan Singh	Committee and Nilay Choudhary Committee. The
report showed that barring the construction of a shed on the
space  where   filled  cylinders   are	to  be	kept,  which
construction is expected to be complete by 15th March, 1986,
all the	 recommendations made  in the  reports	of  Manmohan
Singh Committee and Nilay Choudhary Committee have been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">329</span>
complied with  by the  management of  Shriram. The hydraulic
test carried  out by Messrs. Nike Associates, Bombay, a firm
recognised by  the Chief  Inspector of	Factories, Bombay as
'competent  person'  to	 take  up  the	responsibilities  of
testing, examining  and issuing	 certificate in	 respect  of
pressure vessels  also established  that all  the five tanks
had an	adequate capacity  of withstanding  pressure.  Since
however the  authorities  wanted  a  hydraulic	test  to  be
carried out  once again	 by  the  Regional  Testing  Centre,
Okhla, the  management of  Shriram got	a fresh test carried
out by	the Regional  Testing  Centre  and  the	 certificate
issued by  the Regional	 Testing Centre	 dated 4th February,
1986 showed  that all the five tanks were found to be strong
enough	to  withstand  pressure	 of  375  dsig.	 for  thirty
minutes' duration. The Committee also insisted that not more
than 140  filled chlorine cylinders should be stored and the
report shows  that this	 limitation has been accepted by the
management  of	Shriram.  The  Committee  also	witnessed  a
mockdrill with	a view	to  ensuring  whether  there  was  a
specially trained  group  to  handle  any  chlorine  leakage
emergency and  the Committee  stated in	 the report that the
mock-drill was found to be satisfactory. There were also one
or  two	 other	recommendations	 in  respect  of  which	 the
Committee observed that compliance with them could be tested
only during the operation of the plant.
</p><p id="p_18">     The question  is whether  in view	of the fact that all
the recommendations  made in  the Reports  of Manmohan Singh
Committee  and	Nilay  Choudhary  Committee  have  now	been
complied with  by the  management of  Shriram,	the  caustic
chlorine plant of Shriram should be allowed to be restarted.
The petitioner	who appeared  in person submitted vehemently
and passionately  that	the  court  should  not	 permit	 the
caustic chlorine  plant to  be restarted  because there	 was
always an  element of hazard or risk to the community in its
operation. He  urged that  chlorine is	a dangerous  gas and
even if	 the utmost  care is  taken the	 possibility of	 its
accidental  leakage   cannot  be  ruled	 out  and  it  would
therefore be  imprudent to  rul the  risk  of  allowing	 the
caustic chlorine plant to be restarted. Mrs. Kumar-mangalam,
learned counsel	 appearing on  behalf  of  lokahit  Congress
Union as  also the  learned counsel  appearing on  behalf of
Karamchari  Ekta   Union,  however,   expressed	  themselves
emphatically against  the permanent  closure of	 the caustic
chlorine plant	and submitted  that if	the caustic chlorine
plant was not allowed to be restarted, it would not be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">330</span>
possible to operate the plants manufacturing the down stream
products and  the result  would be  that about 4,000 workmen
would be  thrown out of employment. Both the learned counsel
submitted that	since all  the recommendations	made in	 the
reports of  Manmohan Singh  Committee  and  Nilay  Choudhary
Committee had  been  complied  with  by	 the  management  of
shriram and  the  possibility  of  risk	 or  hazard  to	 the
community had  been  considerably  minimised  and  in  their
opinion reduced	 to almost  nil, the  caustic chlorine plant
should	be   allowed  to  be  reopened.	 The  learned  Addl.
Sclicitor General  appearing on behalf of the Union of India
and the	 Delhi Administration  stated  before  us  that	 his
clients	 were	not  withdrawing   their  objection  to	 the
reopening of the caustic chlorine plant but if the court was
satisfied that	there was  no real  risk or  hazard  to	 the
community by  reason of	 various recommendations of Manmohan
Singh Committee	 and Nilay  Choudhary Committee	 having been
carried out  by the  management of  Shriram, the Court might
make such  order as  it thinks fit, but in any event, strict
conditions should  be imposed  with a  view to	ensuring the
safety of  the workmen	and the	 people in the vicinity. The
learned counsel	 for Shriram  strongly pleaded that now that
all the	 recommendations made  in the  reports	of  Manmohan
Singh Committee	 and  Nilay  Choudhary	Committee  had	been
complied with  by the management and every possible step had
been taken  and measure	 adopted for the purpose of ensuring
complete safety	 in the	 operation of  the caustic  chlorine
plant, there  was no  real danger  of escape of chlorine gas
and even  if there  was some  leakage it  could be only of a
small quantity	and such  leakage could	 easily be contained
and there  was therefore  no reason  for permanently closing
down the  caustic chlorine plant as it would result not only
in less	 to the	 company but  also in  unemployment of about
4,000 workmen  and non-availability  of	 chlorine  to  Delhi
Water Supply  Undertaking and  short supply  of down  stream
products. These rival contentions raise a very difficult and
delicate question  before the  court as	 to what  course  of
action to adopt.
</p><p id="p_19">     It is  undoubtedly true  that chlorine gas is dangerous
to the	life and  health of  the community and if it escapes
either from  the storage  tanks or from the filled cylinders
or from	 any other  point in the course of production, it is
likely to  affect the  health and  well-being of the workmen
and the	 people living	in  the	 vicinity.  There  was	some
controversy before us
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">331</span>
as to what is the concentration of chlorine in the air which
is dangerous  to life  and health. Aggarwal Committee in its
report stated  that concentration  of chlorine	in  the	 air
above  25   parts  per	 million  (PPM)	  is  recognised  by
Occupational Safety  and <a href="/doc/185191195/" id="a_18">Health	 Act</a>  (USA)  as	 immediately
dangerous to  life and	health, but  this  was	disputed  on
behalf of the management of Shriram relying on the report of
Manmohan Singh	Committee which opined that it is only where
concentration of  chlorine in  the air	is between  40 to 60
parts per  million (PPM)  that exposure for 30 minutes would
be dangerous  to life. It is not necessary for us to go into
this controversy  and decide  as to  which view	 is correct,
whether the  one expressed  by Aggarwal Committee or the one
expressed by  Manmohan Singh  Committee.  Fortunately,	both
Committees are	agreed that  chlorine is a hazardous gas and
though smaller	concentrations of  chlorine in	the air	 may
cause only  irritation and  coughing, larger concentrations,
whether above  25 parts	 per million (PPM) or above 40 parts
per million  (PPM) are	likely to  cause serious  danger  to
life. There  can therefore  be no  doubt that there would be
hazard to  the life and health of the community, if there is
escape of  chlorine gas	 from the  caustic  chlorine  plant,
whether by  reason of negligence of the management or due to
accidental  release.  In  fact	the  Issue  of	the  Journal
"Scavenger"  for   January,  1985   enumerates	some   major
accidents which	 have occurred	in different  parts  of	 the
world in  the process  industries and this enumeration shows
that not  less than  25 accidents have been caused by escape
of chlorine gas in the last about 70 years and many of these
accidents have	resulted in death of quite a few persons. To
take only  a few  examples,  the  escape  of  chlorine	from
storage tank  in Wilsum Germany in 1952 resulted in death of
seven persons  and similarly  release  of  chlorine  gas  in
Bankstown, Australia  in 1967  resulted in  gassing of	five
persons and  on account	 of escape  of chlorine gas in Baton
Rouge in  1976, about 10,000 persons had to be evacuated. It
is true that quite a few of these accidents arose on account
of escape  of chlorine	gas in	course of  transport by rail
tank cars  but some accidents did occur on account of escape
of chlorine  gas from  storage tanks.  We  cannot  therefore
ignore the  possible hazard  to the health and well-being of
the workmen and the people living in the vicinity on account
of escape  of chlorine	gas. We also cannot overlook the old
and  worn   out	 state	 of  machinery	and  equipment,	 the
negligence of the management in the maintenance
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">332</span>
and  operation	 of  the  caustic  chlorine  plant  and	 the
indifference shown  by the  management in  installing proper
safety devices	and safety instruments and taking proper and
adequate measures for ensuring safety of the workmen and the
people living  in the  vicinity.  These	 are  considerations
which are  very relevant  in deciding  whether	the  caustic
chlorine plant	should be  allowed to  be restarted.  But as
against these considerations, we must also take into account
the proven  fact that  all the	recommendations made  in the
Reports of  Manmohan Singh  Committee  and  Nilay  Choudhary
Committee have been carried out by the management of Shriram
and it	is the	opinion of not only Manmohan singh Committee
and Nilay Choudhary Committee but also of the last Committee
appointed by  us on  31st January, 1986 that since all these
recommendations have been complied with by the management in
satisfactory manner,  Shriram may  be allowed to restart the
caustic chlorine  plant. There can be no doubt, particularly
having regard  to the  opinion of  Manmohan Singh Committee,
Nilay Choudhary	 Committee and	the last Committee appointed
by us,	that the  possibility  of  hazard  or  risk  to	 the
community is  considerably minimised  and there	 is  now  no
appreciable risk  of danger  to the community if the caustic
chlorine plant	is allowed  to be  restarted. We cannot also
ignore the  interests of  the workmen  while  deciding	this
delicate and  complex question.	 It could  not	be  disputed
either	by   the  Government   of  India  or  by  the  Delhi
Administration or  even by the petitioner that the effect of
permanently closing down the caustic chlorine plant would be
to throw about 4,000 workmen out of employment and that such
closure would  lead to their utter impoverishment. The Delhi
Water Supply  Undertaking which	 gets its supply of chlorine
from Shriram  would also have to find alternative sources of
supply and  it was  common ground  between the	parties that
such sources may be quite distant from Delhi. The production
of down	 stream products  would also  be seriously  affected
resulting to  some extent in short supply of these products.
These various  considerations  on  both	 sides	have  to  be
weighed and  balanced and a decision has to be made at to on
which side  the considerations	preponderate  and  till	 the
balance. It  is none  too easy task, for the decision either
way may	 entail	 serious  consequences.	 We  have  therefore
reflected over	the various aspects of this rather difficult
and complex  question with great anxiety and care and taking
an overall  view of the diverse considerations we have, with
considerable hesitation,  bordering  almost  on	 trepidation
reached the conclusion that, pending consideration of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">333</span>
issue whether  the caustic chlorine plant should be directed
to be shifted and relocated at some other place, the caustic
chlorine plant	should be  allowed to  be restarted  by	 the
management  of	 Shriram,  subject   to	 certain   stringent
conditions which we propose to specify.
</p><p id="p_20">     But before	 we proceed  to set out the conditions which
must strictly be observed by the management of Shriram while
operating the  caustic chlorine plant, we must deal with one
other question	which was  raised before us on behalf of the
Central Board  of Prevention  and Control of Water Pollution
(hereinafter referred  to as the Central Board). The Central
Board is constituted under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_19">Control
of Pollution)  Act</a>, 1974  (hereinafter referred	 to  as	 the
<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_20">Water Act</a>)  and it is also required to perform the functions
assigned under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_21">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, 1981  (hereinafter referred  to as	 the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_22">Air Act</a>). Since
some of	 the plants  of Shriram	 situate within	 the complex
including the  vanaspati plant	were  discharging  effluent,
Shriram was  required  to  obtain  consent  for	 discharging
effluent from  the Central  Board under	 <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_23">Section 25</a>  of	 the
Water Act  and Shriram	accordingly made  an application for
this purpose  in the  prescribed  form.	 The  Central  Board
passed an  Order on  19th April,  1979 granting	 consent  to
Shriram to  discharge effluent	from their  factory  in	 the
sewer, subject	to the	terms and  conditions set out in the
consent order.	The consent  granted to	 Shriram was renewed
from time  to time  and the  last renewed  Consent Order was
dated 22nd  July, 1985	and it was valid upto 31st December,
1985.  Pursuant	 to  the  Consent  Order  Shriram  installed
effluent treatment plants in the vanaspati, stable bleaching
powder, super  phosphate and  active earth units with a view
to complying  with the	limiting standards stipulated by the
Central Board in the consent Order. The waste water in other
units was  either solar	 dried in lagoons or recycled in the
different process houses and the major units emanating waste
water were  thus vanaspati, active earth, superphosphate and
stable bleaching  powder plants.  The waste  water  effluent
from these  four plants	 used to  be drained out through one
common terminal	 outlet and  the complaint  of	the  Central
Board was that this combined effluent at the terminal outlet
never complied with the limiting standards prescribed by the
Central Board.	The  results  of  analysis  of	the  samples
collected by  the officers  of	the  Central  Board  at	 the
terminal  outlet   were	 annexed   as  Annexure	  I  to	 the
supplementary affidavit dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">334</span>
19th December,	1985 filed  by Shri P.R. Gharekhan on behalf
of the	Central Board.	The Central  Board  also  repeatedly
complained that	 the effluent  discharged from the vanaspati
plant was  not in  accordance with  the	 limiting  standards
prescribed in  the Consent  Order. Now,	 as pointed  out  by
Surendra Kumar,	 Senior Environmental Engineer in the employ
of Shriram, there are broadly two technologies available for
effluent  treatment   in  vanaspati  industry.	One  is	 the
technology of removing suspended solids by settling with the
help of clariflocculation and the other is the technology of
removing suspended solids, oils and grease and greasy solids
by flotation  and skimming.  The affidavit of Surendra Kumar
stated that  the technology  based on settling with the help
of clariflocculation  was recommended  by the  Central Board
and  Messrs   Dorr  Oliver   were  selected  by	 Shriram  in
consultation  with  the	 Central  Board	 for  supply  of  an
effluent treatment  plant employing  this  technology.	But,
unfortunately, the  plant of  Messrs Dorr  Oliver failed  to
give  the   guaranteed	results	  presumably  because	this
technology was	not satisfactory.  The Central Board in fact
carried out  a	performance  evaluation	 of  this  plant  in
December, 1983	and they  came to  the conclusion  that this
plant would  require  substantial  changes  to	make  it  to
achieve stipulated  effluent standards. It was then realised
that the  technology of	 removal of  impurities by flotation
method is  more appropriate for vanaspati plant effluent and
Shriram accordingly  once  again,  as  pointed	out  in	 the
affidavit of Surendra Kumar, made a reference to the Central
Board. On 17th January, 1985 the Central Board directed that
Messrs Kroft Engineering Company should be asked to set up a
pilot plant  based on  dissolved air flotation technology in
the vanaspati  plant for treatability study of the effluent.
But despite the follow-up action taken by Shriram, the pilot
plant was  not set  up by  Messrs Kroft Engineering Company.
Shriram thereupon in its anxiety to comply with the limiting
standards set  by the  Central Board  in the  Consent Order,
placed an order with another reputed supplier namely, Messrs
Patel Brothers of Bombay in June, 1985 for supply of a plant
based  on   flotation  technology.   Messrs  Patel  Brothers
guaranteed to  instal  and  commission	the  plant  by	31st
December, 1985	but the	 affidavits show that there has been
some delay  in	the  installation  of  this  plant  and	 its
installation is	 now going to be completed by 28th February,
1986. Meanwhile, however, Shriram installed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">335</span>
at the	terminal outlet	 a  plant  based  on  dissolved	 air
flotation technology  of Messrs	 Krofta Engineering  Company
and the	 counter-affidavit of Shri P.R. Gharekhan dated 13th
January, 1986  shows that the representatives of the Central
Board have  verified that  this terminal treatment plant has
been installed.	 However, the  performance of  this terminal
treatment plant	 is yet to be evaluated by the Central Board
in order  to assess  compliance with  the limiting standards
stipulated in  the Consent  Order. The	Central	 Board	will
therefore have	to evaluate the performance of this terminal
treatment plant	 after the caustic chlorine and other plants
of Shriram  commence production.  So  far  as  the  effluent
discharged by  the active  earth plant	and stable bleaching
plant is  concerned, it complies with the limiting standards
prescribed for	it in  the Consent  Order but  the  effluent
discharged by  the vanaspati  plant does not comply with the
relevant limiting  standards. Shriram  has, however,  stated
that once  the plant  ordered from  Messrs  Patel  Brothers,
Bombay	is   installed,	 it   will  be	possible  to  secure
compliance with	 the requirement  of the limiting standards.
This of	 course will  have to  be assessed  on the  basis of
performance evaluation of the plant of Messrs Patel Brothers
when installed.
</p><p id="p_21">     But there	is one	difficulty in  the  way	 of  Shriram
restarting its	vanaspati plant.  The last  renewed  Consent
Order dated  2nd July,	1985 expired  on 31st December, 1985
and obviously therefore Shriram cannot operate the vanaspati
plant and  discharge effluent  unless and  until the Consent
Order is  renewed, for	the discharge  of  effluent  without
Consent Order  would be	 contrary to  the provisions  of the
<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_24">Water Act</a>.  We, however,  find that  the Central  Board	 has
stated in  the affidavit  filed in  this behalf by Shri D.C.
Sharma, Assistant  Environmental Engineer,  that the Central
Board has  no objection	 to grant temporary consent pursuant
to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_25">Water Act</a> on condition that Shriram
would  comply	with  all  the	recommendations	 of  various
Committees appointed  by this  Court or	 otherwise and	that
such consent  would be	valid only for a period of one month
from the  date of  issue of  the Consent Order. Since we are
permitting Shriram  to reopen its caustic chlorine vanaspati
and other plants above referred to, we would ask the Central
Board to  grant a  temporary Consent  Order to Shriram valid
for a period of one month from the date of its issue and the
Central Board will take samples
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">336</span>
from the  effluent discharged  from the	 vanaspati plant  as
also at	 the  terminal	outlet	and  ascertain	whether	 the
samples comply	with the  limiting standards  set out in the
Consent Order.	If  the	 samples  do  not  comply  with	 the
relevant standards, the Central Board will immediately bring
such fact to the notice of this Court and it will be open to
the Central  Board to  take such  action as  it	 thinks	 fit
including nonrenewal of the Consent Order.
</p><p id="p_22">     So far as compliance with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_26">Air Act</a>
is concerned,  the Central  Government in  consultation with
the Central  Board issued a notification under <a href="/doc/1384966/" id="a_27">Section 19(1)</a>
of  the	 Air  Act  notifying  certain  areas  in  the  Union
Territory of Delhi as air pollution control area. The plants
of Shriram  are admittedly  situated in	 the  air  pollution
control area  and the  industries carried on by Shriram also
fall within  the schedule of industries specified in the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_28">Air
Act</a>. Shriram  was therefore  required to apply for a Consent
Order from the Central Board under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_29">Section 21</a> of the Air Act
and an	application was	 accordingly made  by Shriram on the
basis of  which a  Consent Order  was issued  by the Central
Board on  13th June,  1985 authorising	Shriram	 to  operate
their plants  in the  air pollution control area, subject to
the conditions	set out	 in the	 Consent Order.	 The Consent
Order relates  to three plants of Shriram, namely, sulphuric
acid plant,  super phosphate  plant and	 power plant. We are
not concerned  at the  present stage with the sulphuric acid
and super  phosphate plants since permission to restart them
is not presently sought by Shriram and we need not therefore
pause to  consider whether  the conditions  laid down in the
consent Order  in respect  of these  two  plants  have	been
complied with  or not.	So far as the power plant of Shriram
is concerned,  it is  not the case of the Central Board that
the conditions	in  the	 Consent  Order	 in  regard  to	 the
operation of  the power plant are not being complied with by
the management,	 though there  is specific complaint made in
the affidavit  filed on behalf of the Central Board that the
conditions in  the Consent  Order relating to sulphuric acid
and super  phosphate plants  are not  being observed. We may
however point  out that	 if the	 Central Board	finds at any
time that  the conditions  in the  Consent Order relating to
the  power  plant  are	not  being  complied  with  and	 the
particulate matter  emitted by	the stacks of the boilers is
more than  150 mg/Nm3,	it will be open to the Central Board
to take whatever action is appropriate under the law.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">337</span>
<p id="p_23">     Before we	part  with  this  topic	 of  water  and	 air
pollution by  the plants  operated by  Shriram, we may point
out a  most unsatisfactory  state of  affairs which seems to
prevail in  the Delhi  Municipal Corporation.  The Municipal
Corporation sewer  in the Nazafgarh area has admittedly been
lying chocked  since 1980  with the  result that Shriram has
since then  not been able to discharge its domestic effluent
in the	municipal sewer	 and the domestic effluent has to be
discharged  in	 the  Nazafgarh	  drain	 thereby   adversely
affecting the  standards prescribed by the Central Board. It
is difficult  to understand  as to  why the  Delhi Municipal
Corporation has	 not taken any steps for the last five years
to clean  up the  sewer so  that it can be used for carrying
domestic effluent  discharged by  the  people.	We  are	 not
issuing any  direction in  this behalf	but we are certainly
constrained to express our deep sense of regret at the total
indifference  of   the	Delhi	Municipal   Corporation	  in
discharging its obligations under the law.
</p><p id="p_24">     We have  therefore decided to permit Shriram to restart
its power  plant as  also plants  for manufacture of caustic
chlorine inculding  its by-products  like  sodium  sulphate,
hydrochloric acid,  stable bleaching powder, superchlor, and
sodium hypochlorite, vanaspati refined oil including its by-
products  and  recovery	 plants	 like  soap,  glycerine	 and
technical hard	oil and	 container works.  But there are two
orders which  prohibit Shriram	from operating these plants.
One is	the order  dated 7th  December, 1985  issued by	 the
Inspector of  Factories,  Delhi,  prohibiting  Shriram	from
using the  caustic chlorine  and other	plants till adequate
safety measures	 are adopted  and imminent  danger to  human
life is	 eliminated and	 the other  is the  order dated 24th
December,  1985	  issued  by   the  Assistant	Commissioner
(Factories) directing  Shriram to stop industrial use of the
premises on which the caustic chlorine plant is located. The
validity of these two orders has been assailed by Shriram in
Writ Petition  No. 26  of 1986.	 We are	 not inclined at the
present moment	to  vacate  these  two	orders	because	 the
permission which we are granting by this judgment to Shriram
to reopen  these plants	 is as	a temporary  measure  to  be
reviewed at  some point	 of time  in the future and we would
therefore merely  suspend the  operation of these two orders
until further  directions with a view to enabling Shriram to
restart	 these	plants.	 But  we  are  laying  down  certain
conditions which shall be strictly and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">338</span>
scrupulously followed  by Shriram  and if  at any time it is
found that any one or more of these conditions are violated,
the permission granted by us will be liable to be withdrawn.
We formulate these conditions as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	  (1)Since it  is clear	 from the affidavits and the
	  reports of  the various Expert Committees that the
	  management  of   Shriram  was	  negligent  in	 the
	  operation and	 maintenance of the caustic chlorine
	  plant and  did not take the necessary measures for
	  improving the	 design and quality of the plant and
	  equipment and	 installing adequate  safety devices
	  and  instruments  with  a  view  to  ensuring	 the
	  maximum safety  of the  workers and  the community
	  living in  the vicinity  and it is only after W.P.
	  No. 12739  of 1985  was filed	 and all the glaring
	  deviciencies were  pointed out that the management
	  carried  out	 various  alterations	and  adopted
	  various   measures	in   accordance	  with	 the
	  recommendations made	by Manmohan  Singh Committee
	  and Nilay  Choudhary Committee,  it  is  necessary
	  that an expert Committee should be appointed by us
	  which will  monitor the  operation and maintenance
	  of  the   plant  and	 equipment  and	 ensure	 the
	  continued implementation of the recommendations of
	  these two  committees. We  accordingly constituted
	  an Expert  Committee consisting  of Shri  Manmohan
	  Singh, Shri P.R. Gharekhan and Professor P. Khanna
	  of the  Indian Institute  of Technology,  Bombay -
	  and if  Professor P.	Khanna is  not available for
	  any  reason,	 Dr.  Sharma   of   the	  University
	  Department of	 Chemical  Technology,	Bombay	will
	  take his place as a member of the Expert Committee
	  and this Expert Committee will inspect the caustic
	  chlorine plant  of Shriram  at  least	 once  in  a
	  fortnight and	 examine whether the recommendations
	  made	by   Manmohan  Singh   Committee  and  Nilay
	  Choudhary   Committee	  are	being	scrupulously
	  implemented  by   the	  management.	The   Expert
	  Committee will  also examine	the adequacy  of the
	  design,  materials,	fabrication  etc.   of	 the
	  devices, instruments and other hardware calculated
	  to monitor,  warn, avoid,  control and  handle all
	  situations  arising	on   account   of   possible
	  accidental release  of chlorine  gas,	 keeping  in
	  mind
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">339</span>
	  matereological factors,  location of the plant and
	  the largeness	 of the population exposed to hazard
	  or risk.  This examination  may involve a thorough
	  check and  experimentation at	 site with a view to
	  determining how for the safety measures adopted by
	  the  management   are	 adequate  to  deal  with  a
	  possible  situation.	The  Expert  Committee	will
	  submit a  report of  its examination to this Court
	  immediately after  completion of  the	 examination
	  with copies  to the  petitioner and  Shriram.	 The
	  first such examination shall be made by the Expert
	  Committee within one week of the restarting of the
	  caustic chlorine plant and it shall be followed by
	  a second examination within a further period of 15
	  days. If as a result of either such examination it

<p id="p_25">     We have  formulated these	conditions with	 a  view  to
ensuring continuous  compliance with  the recommendations of
Manmohan Singh	Committee and  Nilay Choudhary Committee and
strict observance  of safety  standards and  procedures,  so
that the  possibility of  hazard or  risk to the workmen and
the community  is almost  reduced to  nil. We  would like to
point out
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">344</span>
that the  caustic chlorine  plant of Shriram is not the only
plant which  is carrying  on a hazardous industry. There are
many other  plants in  Delhi which  are employing  hazardous
technology or  are engaged in manufacture of hazardous goods
and if	proper and  adequate precautions are not taken, they
too are	 likely to  endanger the  life	and  health  of	 the
community. We  would therefore	suggest that  a High Powered
Authority should  be set  up by	 the government	 of India in
consultation  with   the  Central   Board   for	  overseeing
functioning of	hazardous industries with a view to ensuring
that there  are no  defects or	deficiencies in	 the design,
structure or  quality of their plant and machinery, there is
no negligence  in maintenance and operation of the plant and
equipment and  necessary safety	 devices and instruments are
installed and  are in  operation  and  proper  and  adequate
safety standards  and procedures are strictly followed. This
is  a	question  which	  needs	 serious  attention  of	 the
Government of  India and  we would request the Government of
India to  take the  necessary steps at the earliest, because
the problem  of danger	to the	health and well-being of the
community  on	account	 of  chemical  and  other  hazardous
industries  has	  become  a   pressing	problem	  in  modern
industrial society.  It is  also necessary to point out that
when science  and technology  are increasingly	employed  in
producing goods	 and  services	calculated  to	improve	 the
quality of  life, there	 is a  certain element	of hazard or
risk inherent  in the very use of science and technology and
it is  not possible to totally eliminate such hazard or risk
altogether. We	cannot possibly adopt a policy of not having
any Chemical  or other	hazardous industries  merely because
they pose  hazard or risk to the community. If such a policy
were adopted,  it would	 mean the  end of  all progress	 and
development. Such  industries, even  if hazardous have to be
set up since they are essential for economic development and
advancement of well-being of the people. We can only hope to
reduce the  element of	hazard or  risk to  the community by
taking all necessary steps for locating such industries in a
manner	which  would  pose  least  risk	 of  danger  to	 the
community  and	 maximising  safety   requirements  in	such
industries. We	would therefore	 like to  impress  upon	 the
Government of India to evolve a national policy for location
of chemical  and other	hazardous industries  in areas where
population is  scarce and  there is little hazard or risk to
the community,	and when hazardous industries are located in
such areas, every care must be taken to see that large human
habi
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">345</span>
tation does not grow around then. There should preferably be
a green	 belt of  1 to	5 k.m.	width around  such hazardous
industries.
</p><p id="p_26">     There is  also one other matter to which we should like
to draw	 the attention	of the	Government of India. We have
noticed that  in the  past few	years there is an increasing
trend  in   the	 number	 of  cases  based  on  enviornmental
pollution and  ecological destruction  coming up  before the
Courts. Many  such cases  concerning the  material basis  of
livelihood of  millions of  poor people	 and  reaching	this
Court by way of Public interest litigation. In most of these
cases there  is need  for neutral scientific expertise as an
essential input	 to inform  judicial decision  making. These
cases require  expertise at  a high  level of scientific and
technical  sophistication.   We	 felt	the  need  for	such
expertise in  this very	 case and  we had to appoint several
expert committees  to inform  the court	 as to what measures
were required  to be adopted by the Management of Shriram to
safeguard  against  the	 hazard	 or  possibility  of  leaks,
explosion, pollution  of air  and water etc. and how many of
the  safety  devices  against  this  hazard  or	 possibility
existed in  the plant  and which  of them, though necessary,
were not  installed. We have great difficulty in finding out
independent expertes  who would	 be able to advise the court
on these  issues. Since	 there is  at present no independent
and  competent	 machinery  to	generate,  gather  and	make
available   the	   necessary   scientific    and   technical
information, we had to make an effort on our own to identify
experts who  would provide reliable scientific and technical
input necessary	 or the	 decision of  the case	and this was
obviously a difficult and by its very nature, unsatisfactory
exercise. It  is therefore  absolutely essential  that there
should	be   an	 independent   Centre  with   professionally
competent and  public spirited experts to provide the needed
scientific  and	  technological	 input.	  We  would  in	 the
circumstances urge upon the Government of India to set up an
Ecological   Sciences	 Research   Group    consisting	  of
independent, professionally  competent experts	in different
branches of  science and  technology, who  would act  as  an
information  bank   for	 the   Court  and   the	  Government
Departments and	 generate new  information according  to the
particular  requirements  of  the  Court  or  the  concerned
Government  department.	  We  would   also  suggest  to	 the
Government of  India that  since cases	involving issues  of
enviornmental pollution,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">346</span>
ecological destruction	and conflicts over natural resources
are increasingly  coming up for adjudication and these cases
involve assessment and evolution of scientific and technical
data, it  might be desirable to set up Environment Courts on
the regional  basis with  one  professional  Judge  and	 two
experts drawn  from the	 Ecological Sciences  Research Group
keeping in  view the  nature of	 the case  and the expertise
required for  its adjudication.	 There would  of-course be a
right of  appeal to  this Court	 from the  decision  of	 the
Enviornment Court.
</p><p id="p_27">     We have  in this  judgment dealt only with the question
as to  whether Shriram	should be  allowed  to	restart	 its
caustic chlorine  plant and  other plants  manufacturing by-
products and  if so,  subject to  what conditions. There are
many other  issues of  seminal importance arising out of the
claims for  compensation by  victims of olium gas which have
to be  considered by  the Court.  We have  formulated  these
issues and  asked the petitioner and those supporting him in
W.P. 12739  of 1985  to file their written submissions on or
before 24th February, 1986 and Shriram to file their written
submissions on	or before 28th February, 1986 so that we can
take up the hearing of the writ petitions on 3rd March 1986.
</p><p id="p_28">     Before we	part with  this judgment  we would  like  to
express	 our   deep  sense  of	appreciation  for  the	bold
initiative taken  by the  petitioner in bringing this public
interest litigation  before the	 Court. The  petitioner	 has
rendered signal	 service to  the community  by bringing this
public interest	 litigation and	 he has	 produced before the
Court considerable material bearing on the issues arising in
the litigation.	 He has argued his case with great sincerety
and dedication	and the	 people of Delhi must be grateful to
him for	 espousing such a public cause. There is no doubt in
our mind  that	but  for  this	public	interest  litigation
brought	 by   the  petitioner,	there  would  have  been  no
improvement in	the design,  structure and  quality  of	 the
machinery and  equipment in  the caustic  chlorine plant nor
would any proper and adequate safety devices and instruments
have been  installed nor  would there have been any pressure
on the management to observe safety standards and procedures
and the	 possibility cannot  be ruled  out that perhaps some
day olium gas tragedy might have been repeated but this time
with chlorine  gas which  is admittedly	 more dangerous than
olium gas. Though lone and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">347</span>
single, he  has fought	a valiant  battle  against  a  giant
enterprise  and	  achieved  substantial	 success.  We  would
therefore as a token of our appreciation of the work done by
the petitioner	direct that  a sum  of Rs. 10,000 be paid by
Shriram to the petitioner by way of costs.
