      petition under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India

      challenging the action of respondent-Haryana Urban Development

      Authority in rejecting its bid vide notice dated 3.2.2012, Annexure

      P.4 and awarding of contract in favour of respondent No.3 in respect

      of the project for the construction of 120 MLD capacity Sewage

      Treatment Plant etc. at Village Behrampur, Gurgaon. Prayer has also

      been made for quashing Clause 3.1.7 of the Bid document, Annexure

      P.1 being illegal, arbitrary and without any justification.

</p><p id="p_5">      2.           A few facts relevant for the decision of this case, as

      narrated in the petition may be noticed. The petitioner is a company
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> CWP No.3502 of 2012                                                       2</span>

      incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 1956. It is engaged in the

      business of providing services of project development like planning,

      feasibility studies, engineering design, equipment/system supply and

      construction/installation. On 25.12.2011, respondent No.1 invited

      tenders from interested contractors having prescribed technical and

      financial credentials for construction of 120 MLD capacity Sewage

      Treatment Plant (STP) and Main Pumping Station (MPS) based on

      Activated Sludge Process(ASP)/Sequential Batch Reactor (SBR)

      Technology and 30 MLD capacity Tertiary Treatment plant and all

      other works contingent thereto including design, construction of Civil

      Works, Supply of Mechanical, Electrical and Instrumentation Works,

      Erection,   Testing,   Commissioning     alongwith    operation   and

      maintenance for 72 months after stabilization period of 90 days on

      turnkey basis at Village Behrampur, Gurgaon. Pursuant to the said

      invitation, respondent No.1 issued bid documents for the project

      which were made available at its website. The petitioner-company

      filed its bid for the project through online submission as well as

      submission of physical documents on 21.1.2012 and 24.1.2012

      respectively alongwith necessary documents within the stipulated

      period. Vide letter dated 31.1.2012, respondent No.1 sought

      clarification from the petitioner on certain issues. The petitioner

      replied to the said letter and submitted the documents as required. On

      3.2.2012, Annexure P.4 the petitioner was informed that its bid had

      been rejected but no reasons were communicated. During the course

      of meeting with the officials of respondent No.1, the petitioner was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CWP No.3502 of 2012                                                         3</span>

      orally informed that its bid was rejected since it did not qualify the

      criteria of never having been blacklisted by any government authority.

</p><p id="p_6">      3.          According to the petitioner,     earlier, it had bid for a

      project of Delhi Jal Board (DJB) for setting up of 70 MGD

      Kalyanpuri Pumping Station. The petitioner was in discussion with

      two pump suppliers viz. Grundfos and ITT Water and Wastewater

      LLC for providing technical assistance in relation to the said project.

      The petitioner first tied up with ITT Water and Wastewater LLC but

      subsequently, this firm refused to endorse Memorandum of

      Understanding on stamp paper and also refused to provide original

      Memorandum of Understanding duly signed by them on their letter

      head. Consequently, the petitioner entered into a Memorandum of

      Understanding with Grundfos on 3.8.2010 and submitted the same

      with DJB to fulfil the qualification criteria.      On 11.2.2011, the

      petitioner received a show cause notice from DJB stating that

      decision had been taken to debar it from participating in the tenders

      on the ground that it had already forged certain documents to qualify

      for the project. On 30.5.2011, Annexure P.5, DJB issued circular

      blacklisting and debarring the petitioner from participating in any

      tender for a period of one year for submitting forged documents for

      Kalyanpuri project.    Thereafter, the petitioner submitted various

      representations before DJB. Ultimately, DJB reviewed its decision

      and withdrew the debarment vide letter dated 11.8.2011, Annexure

      P.6. Inspite of that, respondent No.1 rejected the bid of the petitioner

      vide impugned notice dated 3.2.2012, Annexure P.7. Hence this

      petition.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      4.          Notice of the petition was issued. Separate written

      statements have been filed on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 &amp; 2 on one

      hand and respondent No.3 on the other. In the reply filed on behalf of

      respondent Nos. 1 and 2, the averment regarding withdrawal of the

      action for debarment of the petitioner on 11.8.2011 has been disputed.

      It has been stated that the order dated 30.5.2011 had never been

      withdrawn vide Annexure P.6 but the period had been reduced after

      review from one year upto the date of issuance of the review letter. It

      has been further stated that financial bid of the petitioner was never

      opened. As regards the averment of the petitioner that financial bid

      had been opened on 3.2.2012, it has been submitted that as per the

      information available on the website, the message shown is

      "Financial/Price Bid cancelled or Rejected Bid.", Annexure R.2.

      According to respondent Nos. 1 and 2, the petitioner seems to have

      created a forged web site/portal of HUDA to show that its commercial

      bid was opened. In this regard, the petitioner has produced Annexure

      P.9 with the writ petition. On enquiry, it has been found that the

      petitioner has committed cyber crime by creating/forging a web

      site/portal of HUDA. As regards the prayer of the petitioner for

      quashing of Clause 3.1.7 of the Bid document, Annexure P.1, it has

      been stated that the petitioner had accepted each and every term and

      condition of the tender document by signing the same. It is now

      estopped from challenging the said clause. It is also submitted that the

      petitioner was earlier awarded a contract for design, supply,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CWP No.3502 of 2012                                                         5</span>

      construction, installation etc. for a period of three years. The

      petitioner delayed the said project as a result of which penalty was

      imposed upon it by HUDA. A show cause notice dated 29.3.2012,

      Annexure R.4 was also issued by Haryana State Pollution Control

      Board, Gurgaon to the petitioner under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_2">Section 33A</a> of Water

      (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 as the samples were

      not found in accordance with the specified standards. It has been

      further submitted that in view of clause 3.1.10, the petitioner was not

      eligible for allotment of tender as the performance of the applicant for

      execution of similar work in HUDA was also required to be

      considered. On these premises, prayer for dismissal of the petition has

      been made.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      5.           An additional affidavit on behalf of respondent-HUDA

      was also filed explaining the position with regard to Annexure P.9

      appended by the petitioner. It was submitted that a unique user ID and

      password had been assigned to all the bidders who had given bid for

      tender No.306. Therefore, all the bidders could only use the same to

      submit their price bid. During the technical evaluation, bid of the

      petitioner had been rejected as is evident from Open tender details,

      Annexure R.7. Thus, as a result once the bid of the petitioner had

      been rejected, the same could not have been opened by respondent

      HUDA. It was also clarified that e-tendering system of HUDA allows

      opening of financial bid of only those participating agencies which

      are duly shortlisted by the department during the technical evaluation

      stage. According to the respondents, Annexure P.9 is a screenshot

      which has been managed by the petitioner on 3.5.2012 after the price

      bids of the qualified bidders had been opened by the respondent on

      3.2.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      6.          In the reply filed on behalf of respondent No.3, the

      averments made in the writ petition have been controverted on the

      similar grounds as have been taken by respondent Nos. 1 and 2. It has

      been further stated that respondent No.3 has already deposited a sum

      of Rs.90 lacs as security with respondent no.1. The possession of the

      site has also been handed over to it and it has completed the Survey

      work and soil investigation work. The designs and drawing of the

      project have also been submitted to respondent No.1 and the work of

      the excavation of the soil has already commenced at the site. It has

      thus been prayed that the writ petition may be dismissed with costs.

<p id="p_11">      8.          Mr. D.V.Sharma, learned Senior counsel for respondent

      Nos. 1 and 2, controverting the submissions of learned counsel for the

      petitioner, had vehemently disputed that the price bid of the petitioner

      was opened by the respondents. It was urged that Annexure P.9

      appended alongwith the writ petition was a forged document. It was

      also urged that respondent Nos. 1 and 2 had filed an affidavit refuting

      the averment of the petitioner that the price bid had been opened to

      which no rejoinder had been filed. Reference was also made to

      Annexures R.1, R.2 and R.3 appended alongwith the written

      statement wherein a communication addressed by the petitioner was

      relied upon in which it was admitted by the petitioner that the price

      bid had not been opened till 20.2.2012. It was further submitted that

      in the original unamended writ petition, there was no averment with

      regard to opening of price bid of the petitioner on 3.2.2012. Learned

      counsel further submitted that cumulative effect of this fact only leads

      to one conclusion that the petitioner had fabricated Annexure P9 as

      the date thereon shows that it was generated on 3.5.2012. Conversely,

      it was argued that in case price bid had been opened then there was no

      reason for the petitioner not to mention this fact in the

      communications which had been appended as Annexures R.1, R.2 and

      R.3. Learned counsel further submitted that the petitioner had not

      approached this Court with clean hands and therefore, the writ
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> CWP No.3502 of 2012                                                          9</span>

      petition was liable to be dismissed with exemplary costs. It was also

      argued that the petitioner itself did not fulfil the condition as it was

      debarred from submitting the tender for three months from 30.5.2011

      to 11.8.2011.     With regard to the argument that the condition of

      debarring in case of joint venture and individual was bad, it was

      submitted that the petitioner had misinterpreted the provisions.

      Condition No.3.1.7 related to individual/firm and therefore, any

      person who had been blacklisted was not entitled to submit a tender.

      It was more onerous condition than in the case of joint venture that an

      applicant who had been debarred till the date of submission of the

      application form was blacklisted, was not entitled to submit a tender.

      It could not thus be arbitrary. It was also submitted that the petitioner

      having participated in the tender process could not now be allowed to

      raise this objection.

      therefore he had no locus standi to file the writ petition. Reliance was

      placed on the Division Bench judgments of this Court in

      6.3.2012. It was also urged that there was no malafide attributed to

      any bid on the basis of which it could be said that the contract had

      been given for extraneous considerations. Learned counsel argued

      that the respondent No.3 fulfilled the technical eligibility condition

      mentioned in Condition No.3.1.2.1 and the argument of learned

      counsel for the petitioner to the contrary did not carry any weight.

     condition at this stage after having participated in the tender and

     U.G.Hospitals Private Limited's case (supra), examining similar

     issue where the petitioner had participated in the selection process for

     allotment of plot and later on had sought to challenge the validity of

     the criterion adopted by the respondents, in para 7 had held as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                 "Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and
                 perusing the paper book with their able assistance we are
                 of the considered view that the advertisement Annexure
                 P.1 clearly postulates the eligibility criterion. According to
                 the   criterion        an      individual/society/trust/institution/
                 company was eligible to apply but preference was to be
                 given to (i) reputed/renowned institution/trust/society
                 already running multi specialty hospitals (ii) NRI
                 professionals in the field of Medical Science (iii) A
                 team/group        of        Doctors/Specialists     (iv)    Retired
                 Doctor/Retiring Doctors in the near future from an
                 eminent medical institutions/ government hospitals (v)
                 Doctors already running hospitals/nursing homes. It is
                 stipulated that preference was to be given to applicants
                 hailing from Haryana State and (vi) allotment was to be
                 made on the basis of professionals as well as financial
                 capability to run the hospital. The petitioner as well as
                 respondent no.5 had applied in time alongwith requisite
                 earnest money. Both the applicants are private limited
                 companies. The petitioner is associated with Metro Heart
                 Institute whereas respondent no.5 has been attached with
                 Apollo Hospital Group. After interview of both the
                 applicants, the high profile committee recommended the
                 case of respondent no.5 for allotment which has been
                 accepted by the Government. It is well settled that once
                 the petitioner has participated in the selection process for
                 allotment of a plot then it looses the right to question the

                 allotment on the ground of adopting irrational criterion.
                 The principle in the nature of estoppel would be attracted
                 in such a case. In a number of cases where the candidate
                 has participated in the selection process for induction in
                 service, the Supreme Court has held that such a candidate
                 cannot be permitted to question the selection process
                 when he has remained unsuccessful. The principles laid
                 down in those cases would fully apply to the facts of the
                 present case. We may place reliance in that regard on the
                 judgements of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of

<p id="p_17">     13.          Under the aforesaid condition, the applicant was required

     to certify that he has not been blacklisted or debarred by any

     knowing the implication of eligibility condition contained in 3.1.7 in

     the tender document is not entitled to challenge the validity thereof.

<p id="p_19">     15.          Adverting to the plea of waiver of blacklisting, on

     examining the order of blacklisting,it is discerned that originally the

     petitioner was blacklisted for one year vide Annexure P.5 which

     period was reduced to three months vide Annexure P.6. It was not

     disputed that the petitioner had been debarred for three months and in

     the tender in view of Clause 3.1.7 of the bid document, Annexure P.1.

                  (1) The modem           trend points to judicial restraint    in
                  administrative action.

                  made.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">                  (3) The court does not have the expertise to correct the
                  administrative decision. If a review of the administrative
                  decision is permitted         it will be substituting its
                  own decision,         without the necessary expertise which
                  itself may be fallible.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">                      (4) The terms of the invitation to tender cannot be open
                  to judicial scrutiny because the invitation to tender is in
                  the realm of contract. Normally speaking, the decision to
                  accept the tender or award the contract is reached by
                  process of negotiations through several tiers. More often
                  than not, such decisions are made qualitatively by
                  experts.

                  necessary      concomitant for an administrative            body
                  functioning        in an    administrative sphere or quasi-
                  administrative sphere.       However, the decision must not

                  principle of reasonableness (including its other facts

                       amenable to judicial review, the Court can examine
                       the decision-making process and interfere if it is
                       found vitiated by malafides, unreasonableness and

<p id="p_23">     19.           Recently, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1246711/" id="a_9">Siemens Public

     Communication Networks Pvt. Limited and another v. Union of

     India and others</a>, AIR 2009 SC 1204, after analysing the judicial

     precedents in para 39 had concluded as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">                      "39. On examining the facts and circumstances of the
                      present case, we are of the view that none of the
                      criteria   has    been   satisfied   justifying   Court's
                      interference in the grant of contract in favour of the
                      appellants. When the power of judicial review is
                      invoked in the matters relating to tenders or award of
                      contracts, certain special features have to be
                      considered. A contract is a commercial transaction and
                      evaluating tenders and awarding contracts are
                      essentially commercial functions. In such cases
                      principles of equity and natural justice stay at a
                      distance. If the decision relating to award of contracts
                      is bona fide and is in public interest, Courts will not
                      exercise the power of judicial review and interfere
                      even if it is accepted for the sake of argument that
                      there is a procedural lacuna."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">      20.         For the Courts to examine validity of allotment of

      tenders, it is essential for the person approaching the Court with a

      grievance to establish that the decision making process is faulty and it

      is vitiated by malafides, unreasonableness or arbitrariness. The award

      of contract in the case of a private party or by a public body or the

      State is essentially a commercial transaction for which commercial

      considerations shall have precedence. It is open to the State to evolve

      its own methodology for arriving at a decision. The courts shall

      exercise judicial restraint in such administrative action as they do not

      sit as a Court of appeal to substitute its own views.

</p><p id="p_25">     21.          Examining the factual matrix involved herein, in our

     opinion, none of the grounds for Court's intervention in the grant of

     contract in favour of respondent No.3 has been satisfied. The

     respondents No.1 and 2 had evaluated the tenders and found

     respondent No.3 to be competitive and more suitable to perform the

     contract successfully. No malafides, arbitrariness, unreasonableness or

     variation in any procedure had been pointed out so as to nullify the

     award of the contract to respondent No.3.

     conduct of the petitioner in misleading and fabricating by way of

     cyber crime whereby petitioner had manipulated the entry dated

     3.2.2012. The petitioner had shown that its technical bid was opened

     on 3.2.2012 whereas the sequence of events unambiguously show that

     no such event had taken place. The glaring factor which requires

     notice is that the petitioner had appended document Annexure P.9

     which was forged. The respondents had categorically filed additional

     affidavit and also denied opening of financial bid of the petitioner to

     which no rejoinder had been filed by the petitioner controverting the

     same. However, the petitioner had itself accepted that the financial

     bid had not been opened till 20.2.2012 in letters Annexures R.1, R.2

     and R.3. Further fact which requires notice is that the unamended

     writ petition which was filed did not stipulate that price bid had been

     opened. The same was an after-thought, particularly in view of the

     averments made in the additional affidavit which has been filed by

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_42">                 8.     The facts of the present case leave no manner of
                 doubt that Jagannath obtained the preliminary decree by
                 playing fraud       on   the court. A fraud is    an act    of
                 deliberate deception         with the design of securing
                 something by taking unfair advantage of another. It is a
                 deception in order to gain by another's loss.         It is a
                 cheating intended to get an advantage.       Jagannath was
                 working as a clerk with Chunilal Sowcar. He purchased
                 the property in the court auction on behalf of       Chunilal
                 Sowcar. He had, on his own volition,executed the
                 registered release deed (Ex. B-15) in favour of Chunilal
                 Sowcar regarding the property in dispute.        He knew that

                 master Chunilal Sowcar. Without      disclosing   all   these
                 facts, he filed the suit for the partition of the property on
                 the ground that he had purchased the property on his own

                 production and even non-mentioning of the release deed
                 at the trial is tantamount to playing fraud on the court.
                 We do not agree with the observations of the High Court
