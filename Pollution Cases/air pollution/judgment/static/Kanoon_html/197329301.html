:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">[Order of the Court was made by T.S.SIVAGNANAM, J.]   

        Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2. In this writ petition, the petitioner challenges the proceedings
issued by the first respondent/the Chairman (FAC), Tamil Nadu Pollution
Control Board, Chennai, dated 08.02.2017, in and by which direction has been
issued to the Electricity Board as well as the District Collector to
disconnect the electricity supply for the unit in exercise of the powers
conferred under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_2">Section 31A</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, 1981 as amended in 1987. This has has a case  chequered history and this
is the third round of litigation before this Court.
</p>        
<p id="p_3">        3.  Earlier, the 8th respondent had approached this Court and filed
W.P.(MD).No.1956 of 2016 to forbear the Official respondents from permitting
the petitioner herein to run the industry in the name and style of Gnanam
Ever Silver Pattrai at the place in question and to immediately take action
for violation of the <a href="/doc/17873873/" id="a_4">Public Health Act</a> and Madurai City Municipal Corporation
Act. The said writ petition was disposed of by an order dated 06.01.2017, by
the Division Bench.
</p>        
<p id="p_4">        4.  At this juncture, it would be relevant to take note of the relevant
portion of the order made in W.P.(MD). No. 1956 of 2016, Paragraph Nos.4, 5,
6, 7, 9, 10 and 13 are as follows:
</p><p id="p_5">        ?4. The main grievance of the petitioner is that in spite of his
complaint about the usage of heavy power equipments and machineries, which  
resulted in heavy noise and pollution in that area, no action was taken by
the respondents 1 to 3. It is to be noted that the fourth and fifth
respondents, without having licence to carry on the business, are running the
industry. Hence, he sought for a direction to consider his representation and
pass orders.
</p><p id="p_6">        5. The second respondent has filed a counter-affidavit stating that
notice under Section 41(8), 42(b), 44 and 134(1) of the Tamil Nadu Public
Health Act was issued to the fourth respondent on 29.01.2016, directing the
fourth respondent not to use the machineries after 10.00 p.m., till 06.00
a.m., and also directed the fourth respondent to take steps to reduce the
sound of machineries.
</p>

<p id="p_7">        6. The third respondent has also filed a counter-affidavit stating that
the petitioner has given a complaint against the operation of M/s.Gnanam Ever
Silver Pattarai, which is located next to the petitioner's house and because
of usage of heavy machineries, there were severe vibration, noise pollution
and public nuisance. Further, according to the petitioner, the Unit is
running without local body licence and building plan approval. The complaint
of the petitioner was forwarded to the Commissioner of Madurai Corporation to
take action under the Local Body Act and the <a href="/doc/17873873/" id="a_5">Public Health Act</a>, vide letter
dated 05.11.2015.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        7. It is further stated in the counter-affidavit that another petition
was received from the petitioner on 08.02.2016 against the same Unit. Based
on the said complaint, the Unit was investigated on 12.02.2016 by the
Assistant Engineer, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, Madurai and it was
observed thus:
</p>
<p id="p_9">         "The unit was under operation.
</p><p id="p_10">  The unit is located in the residential area.
</p><p id="p_11"> The unit has provided one lathe, one plate
 turning machine, 4 no's of spinning/shaping
 machine, 2 No's of polishing machine and a
 welding machine 

        It is reported that the lathe is not under operation for more than 8
months. 
</p>

<p id="p_12">        It is also reported that 1 no.of spinning/ shaping has been relocated
(i.e. away from Complainant house) based on the request from complainant 4
months before.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        It was found that the unit has not provided any noise absorbing
materials or any vibration controlling materials to the machinery and in the
unit's premises.
</p>
<p id="p_14">It is further to submit that no action taken reports has been received from
the Commissioner, Madurai Corporation with respect to the previous complaints
forwarded from this office."
</p>
<p id="p_15">        9. Pursuant to the same, a show cause notice was issued to the Unit
under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a> for running the industry without valid
consent. The Unit, by reply letter dated 07.05.2016, has stated that it has
removed all the machineries installed nearer to the complainant's house and
requested to grant one month time for removal of few of machineries in other
part of the Unit i.e., Shed No.2-II.
</p>
                
<p id="p_16">        10. Based on the reply of the Unit, it was again inspected by the
Assistant Engineer, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, on 20.05.2016 and on
inspection, it was found that the Unit was under operation, but all the
machineries adjacent to the petitioner's house were removed, except 2 numbers
of welding machines and the manual sheet turning machine. 
</p><p id="p_17">        13. However, a perusal of the counter-affidavits filed by the second
and third respondents would go to show that on receipt of the complaint
preferred by the petitioner, the officials concerned are taking steps
immediately. In fact, the second respondent has directed the Unit not to use
the machineries after 10.00 p.m., till 06.00 a.m., and the third respondent
has also constantly monitored the position of the Unit. When the official
respondents have taken action against the Unit, this Court need not give any
further direction. Therefore, recording the statements made by the  Tamil
Nadu Pollution Control Board in the counter-affidavit, more particularly,
their undertaking that as soon as they receive the report from the Joint
Chief Environmental Engineer (Monitoring) Madurai, they would take further
action on the complaint of the petitioner, the Writ Petition is closed. No
costs. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition is also closed.?
</p>                
        
<p id="p_18">        5. Thus, the Writ Petition stood disposed of by recording the statement
given by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board in the counter affidavit and
the undertaking given by the Joint Chief Environmental Engineer (Monitoring),
Madurai, that they would take further action on the complaint of the
petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_19">        6. The grievance of the petitioner is that the impugned proceedings
have been issued without any reference to the earlier orders passed by this
Court, wherein the Court has taken into consideration all the factors.  It is
seen from the records placed before this Court that the Joint Chief
Environmental Engineer (Monitoring), Madurai has conducted a public hearing
on 11.07.2016, in which the petitioner has also participated, wherein the
petitioner has stated that he has applied for permission from the Madurai
Corporation and also will obtain the appropriate clearance from the Tamil
Nadu Clearance Board within 15.08.2016.  Subsequently, the petitioner filed
another Writ Petition in W.P.(MD).No.10721 of 2016 for a Writ of Mandamus to
direct the respondents to permit him to run the said factory.  The said writ
petition was dismissed for non-prosecution by the Division Bench, by order
dated 04.08.2016.  Thus, it is evidently clear that the Writ Petitioner has
failed to obtain requisite clearance which he had undertaken to obtain at the
time of personal hearing, on 11.07.2016.  Hence, there is no error in the
impugned proceedings.  Accordingly, the Writ Petition fails and the same is
dismissed.  However, the dismissal of the Writ Petition will not prevent the
petitioner from approaching the Authorities for necessary approvals. No
costs. Consequently, the connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
</p>
<p id="p_20">                7. After the above order was passed, the learned counsel for the
petitioner submitted that domestic electricity connection alone may be
restored. In this regard, the petitioner shall give a representation to the
seventh respondent, who shall consider the same in accordance with law.
