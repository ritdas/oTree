</pre><p id="p_1">                           (28.03.2014)

Per A.M. Khanwilkar, Chief Justice (Oral):
</p>
<p id="p_2">         In this petition, the petitioner originally challenged the
decision of the M.P Pollution Control Board dated 7/3/2014.
However, by way of abundant precaution, the petitioner has
also asked for further relief against the State Government
relying on the fact that even after submission of the application
for renewal of mining lease on 16/10/2008, which was made
well in advance, the State Government has not taken any
decision thereon. As a result, by virtue of Rule 24-A of the
Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 (for brevity "the Rules of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2</span>
                                              Writ Petition No.4427/2014


1960"), sub-rule (6) in particular, the State Government has
deemed to have extended the lease by a further period till the
State Government passes order thereon. This position is no
more res integra.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2.    Petitioner has relied on the decision of the learned Single
Judge of this Court in Pratap Singh Chouhan Vs. State of
Madhya Pradesh and another (1996 MPLJ 233).
Petitioner has sought further relief of declaration and direction
against the State Government consistent with the stipulation
provided under Sub-rule (6) of Rule 24-A of the Rules of 1960.
The petitioner, in our opinion, must succeed in this behalf. The
State Authority is directed to consider the application of the
petitioner for renewal of lease dated 16/10/2008 expeditiously,
preferably within eight weeks. If that decision is adverse to the
petitioner, the petitioner may challenge the same by way of
appropriate proceedings which will have to be decided on its
own merits.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3.    The other core issue to be considered in         the present
petition is; whether the Pollution Control Board was justified in
rejecting the application for grant of consent for carrying on the
manufacturing activities on the ground that the petitioner has
failed to submit valid mining lease ?
</p><p id="p_5">      For that, we would usefully refer to the application made
by the petitioner to the Pollution Control Board (Annexure
P/11), which reads thus:-

                                               Writ Petition No.4427/2014


rejecting the application preferred by the petitioner is that the
petitioner had failed to submit valid mining lease. The Pollution
Control Board completely glossed over the stand taken by the
petitioner in the communication (Annexure P/11) dated
14/11/13 to the effect that the mining lease stood extended by
virtue of deeming provision contained in Rule 24-A (6) of the
Rules of 1960. This aspect has been completely missed out by
the Pollution Control Board while considering the application of
the petitioner for grant of consent. In other words, the decision
of the Executive Engineer, which is impugned in this petition,
suffers from the vice of non application of mind and deserves to
quashed and set aside.
</p>

<p id="p_24">6.    The Executive Engineer, Pollution Control Board is
directed to reconsider the application preferred by the
petitioner on 14/11/2013 (Annexure P/11) afresh on its own
merits, in accordance with law. Until final decision is taken on
the said application, the petitioner shall be entitled to continue
with the operations on the same terms and conditions as
specified by the Pollution Control Board in its communications
dated 15/5/13 (Annexures P/6 and P/7 respectively).

this mater within two weeks from today.             Till then, the

are left open. If the petitioner is aggrieved by the final decision
to be taken by the Pollution Control Board, will be free to
challenge the same in appropriate proceedings, which will be
considered on its own merits, in accordance with law.
