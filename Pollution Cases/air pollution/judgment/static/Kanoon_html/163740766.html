              We also give a note of caution to the effect that the power

              of quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised

              very sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the

              rarest of rare cases; that the court will not be justified in

              embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or

              genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the

              FIR or the complaint and that the extraordinary or

              inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on

              the court to act according to its whim or caprice."

              The point in controversy in the present case is only to the

effect that whether the company got the Environment Clearance

Certificate before starting the work or thereafter.

Ministry of Environment and Forests dated 14.9.2006, whereby the

company was required to get the prior Environment Clearance

Certificate before starting its business. Admittedly, the petitioners

(Annexure P-7).
</p>
<p id="p_25">              A perusal of the complaint (Annexure P-6) reveals that the

complaint was filed against the petitioners and others on the

allegation that the petitioners had started new construction project

without obtaining any prior Environment Clearance Certificate from

the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The complaint has been

filed in January 2009, whereas, the clearance certificate has been

issued to the company on 11.7.2007 (Annexure P-7).                       In the

complaint it has not been mentioned that as to when the construction

project was started by the company. A perusal of the complaint also

reveals that the allegations levelled therein are vague as it has not

been stated therein as to how the offence under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_17">Section 15</a> of the Act

had been committed by the petitioners-company. The petitioners

were granted 'No Objection Certificate' on 7.3.2007. In these

circumstances, it cannot be said that the company had started its

work before the issuance of the Environment Clearance Certificate.

On the day the complaint was filed, the petitioners-company was

already having the Environment Clearance Certificate. In these

circumstances, the continuation of the criminal proceedings against

petitioners would be nothing but an abuse of process of law.
