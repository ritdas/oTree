</p><p id="p_4"> 2.      The PIL petition concerns the unauthorised ready-mix plants

 in residential locality within the Thane Municipal Corporation

 limits. On 3rd December, 2019, we had passed the following order

 on this PIL:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           ""1. We have heard Mr. Ganesh Sovani, appearing forthe
           petitioner. Since Mr. Sovani says that he could not carry
           out the amendments which have been granted by this
           Court, we extend the time to carry out the amendments.
           The same be carried out within one week from today.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           2. After a brief hearing of this PIL, we are informed
           that the newly added respondent No.5 has not been
           served with a copy of the petition. Let Mr. Amol Mhatre
           take a copy of this petition along with all the affidavits on
           record by paying the usual copying charges.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">           3. The PIL concerns Ready Mix Cement Concrete
           ("RMCC") Plants functioning within the green and
           residential zones within the limits of the Thane Municipal
           Corporation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">           4. We have perused the affidavit of the Thane
           Municipal Corporation in which there is a statement
           made that the Municipal Corporation is making efforts to
           ensure that no unauthorised RMCC Plant functions in the
           residential and green zones.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">           5. Since Mr. A.R. Pitale, Advocate appearing for
           respondent No.1, is absent today, we direct that the
           Executive Engineer, Town Planning Department in the
           Thane Municipal Corporation should remain present in
           this Court on the next date with all original records. We
           would like to satisfy our conscience, particularly with
           regard to the correctness of the statement made in para
           11 of the affidavit. If actions have been taken against
           illegal and unauthorised RMCC Plants and which would
           continue hereafter, then, we do not think that the PIL be
           kept pending.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">           6. It is clear that on 10-1-2014, on this PIL, this Court
           was pleased to pass the following order:-
             "1.      Despite the order dated 21.02.2013,
             respondent No.1 has not filed an affidavit in reply. As
             a last chance, stand over to 31.01.2014.

</p><p id="p_6">              2. Till further orders, respondent No.1 shall not
              issue further permission for ready mix cement
              concrete plants in green and residential zones of the
              Thane city. If the affidavit in reply is not filed by the
              next date, it will be necessary to consider whether
              or not to restrain respondent No.1 from renewing
              the existing licenses.
</p>
<p id="p_7">              3. Respondent No.3 is also directed to file an
              affidavit stating whether the ready mix cement
              concrete plants in green and in residential zones
              would comply with the provisions of the Air
              (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981."

           There is no record today before us which will reveal
           whether despite the orders of this Court, any permission
           to set up RMCC Plant in the above zones has been
           granted. There is no record to indicate whether action
           has been taken against the unauthorised and illegal
           plants as well.
</p><p id="p_8">           7.   It is in these circumstances that we place this PIL on
           8-1-2020 but would like the Executive Engineer to remain
           present on that date with all original records.""

</p><p id="p_9"> 3.      Pursuant thereto, Mr.Apte has stated that there were 18

 plants identified as unauthorised and illegal. Out of these 18, 12

 have been dismantled and removed. From the remaining 6, 3 are

 being used for mixing cement concrete for the purpose of

 implementing the public projects such as widening of road etc.

 These projects are of the Thane Municipal Corporation and it has

 allowed the contractor executing the work to use these plants.

 These three plants would be dismantled by 31st December, 2020.

</p><p id="p_10"> 4.      As far as the 3 remaining plants, 2 are regularised by Thane

 Municipal Corporation. The remaining one is identified as illegal

 and unauthorised and would be demolished within a period of one

 month from today.
