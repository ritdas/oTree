Ex.DW1/A. He was examined wherein he deposed that there is no water pipe line of Delhi
Jal Board in Rangpuri Area, B Block and that the water is supplied through water tankers.
Further that there is no sewage network in the said Rangpuri area and that the sewage
management of this area is not looked after by them. He denied the suggestion that the
sewage management of the area within their jurisdiction is looked after by them only. He
volunteered to say that it is only in those cases where sewage network is laid out by DJB.
He deposed that his department do not issue challans for illegal sewage disposal in the
suit area. Thereafter, DE was closed on 14.01.2019.

effectively; a proper party is one in whose absence an effective order can be made but
whose presence is necessary for a complete and final decision on the questions involved
in the proceedings. Coming to facts of the case, the plaintiff has sought for the directions
that the said defendants be directed to remove the illegal sewerage pipeline and to take
appropriate actions to stop the effluence of illegal sewerage. With further directions to
remove the water logging into Gram Sabha land. As far as defendant no 7 is concerned
they have not lead any evidence to the effect why the suit for the plaintiff is bad for
misjoinder. Further, in their own submissions, they have admitted that they are the dealing
agency for all the matters pertaining to Gaon Sabha. In addition, it was brought to the
notice of the court that Gaon Sabha has been dissolved and is being represented by the
BDO Najafgarh that is by defendant no 7.Moreover, the defendant no. 7 have submitted
that " That plaintiff did not serve the notice under the mandatory provisions of section 99 of
the Delhi Panchayat Raj Act. Section 99 of the Delhi Panchayat Act read as; "No suit or

submitting before the court that they are not competent authority in the present matter and
the plaintiff has not approached the court in good faith. They have further submitted that
plaintiff has malafidely not named the names of land grabbers. Even if court takes into
account that plaintiff has not named the land grabbers, it does not discharge the burden of
the defendants.     The court cannot ignore the fact that the outlet of the illegal sewer
pipeline is towards the land of Gaon Sabha, which has become a source of environment
hazard. Further, the stand taken by the defendant no 11 that the competent authority

              It is a matter of record that before knocking the doors of this court, the
plaintiff has approached various forum in order to avail the relief sought for in this present
case. The plaintiff had filed a writ petition bearing no 5564/2010 before the Hon'ble High
Court Of Delhi, which was disposed on 14/09/2010. The plaintiff had also filed grievances
before the Hon'ble Public Grievances Commission, ITO, Delhi; wherein the number of the
orders were passed and the same were collectively exhibited as PW1/G (colly). It is again
a matter of record that the plaintiff had also approached before the Hon'ble NGT for
redressals of his grievances disclosing the pendency of the present case. The case was
however not admitted being barred by limitation of NGT Act, 2010. The copy of judgment

<p id="p_40">Whether the plaintiff is entitled to relief of permanent and mandatory injunction?

</p><p id="p_41">21.           The plaintiff stated in evidence by affidavit exhibited as Ex.PW1/1 that he is
the owner of plot bearing part of khasra no. 1229, situated at the revenue estate of village,
Malikpur Kohli, Abadi known as B Block Rangpuri Extension, New Delhi­110037. However,
it is interesting to note that the plaintiff has not produced any documents to prove his
ownership with regard to the said land. Further, the plaintiff has only brought before the
court copy of the GPA which is marked as Mark "A". Further, the plaintiff got examined Mr.
Khajan Singh; as PW2. In his cross­examination, PW2 admitted that he has not brought
any documents to prove his ownership. Thus, it remains clear that the plaintiff has not
brought any documents to prove his ownership all along. Further, the stand taken by
defendants all along have been that the plaintiff has not come to this court with clean
hands. It was submitted by the defendants in the present case, that the plaintiff has been
living in the unregularized colony, which is admitted by the plaintiff in his cross­
examination by defendant no 8 as well.
</p>


<p id="p_42">22.           Further, it has also come to the court attention that the plaintiff was initially a
party to laying down of illegal sewer line. The plaintiff had admitted in his cross­
examination by the Defendants no. 11 that he was not aware to laying down of said
pipeline. He had admitted in his cross examination that couple of people had approached
him regarding laying down of the pipeline and he was promised that they will discharge the
waste water away from the plot of the plaintiff and the said pipeline would be two feet
below the ground. However, when the water was discharged on plaintiff land contrary to as
promised to him, he got alarmed and initiated actions against various government
agencies left right and center. It intrigues the court till today, as why plaintiff did not initiate
actions against people who acted contrary to their promise and instead moved against
government agencies who had no iota of happenings. The plaintiff in his cross­
examination has submitted that sewer lines were laid down by govt funds. However, no
prove to that effect has been brought to courts notice. Various courts have been strict in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                                 Page 12 of 16</span>
 granting injunction, which has the effect of permitting illegal of occupation of public land. In
this regard, the case of Rajinder Kakkar Vs. DDA 1994 (1) AD (Delhi) 432 is relevant,
wherein, it was held: "where a person is an encroacher and never had any right to legal
possession of public land, the courts should not grant any injunctions or relief which will
have the result of permitting or protecting the continued illegal occupation of public land.
</p>
<p id="p_43">              Thus, significant question, which arises in the present case, is that whether
the injunction can be granted in favour of person who has occupied public land without
prior permission.
</p>


<p id="p_44">23.           The housing problem can be considered to be universal since, to date, no
country has yet managed to completely meet his basic human needs. Adequate housing
serves the crucible for human well being and development, bringing together elements
related to ecology, sustained and sustainable development. It serves as the basic unit of
human settlements and as an indicator of the duality of a city. Unfortunately, in spite of its
importance, there exists and enormous deficit through out the world.
</p>
<p id="p_45">              It would not be out of place to traverse though some of the international
concerns over the world housing situations.
</p>
<p id="p_46">              National General Assembly in 1948 made explicit reference to housing as a
fundamental human rights. <a href="/doc/86224/" id="a_19">Article 25(1)</a> states : "everyone has the right to a standard of
living adequate for the health and well being of himself and his family, including food,
clothing, housing and medical care, necessary social services.
</p>
<p id="p_47">              Further, <a href="/doc/1678224/" id="a_20">Article 11</a> of the international covenant on economic, social, and
cultural rights expanded on <a href="/doc/86224/" id="a_21">Article 25(1)</a> of the universal direction read as, " the state
parties to the present covenant recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of
living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing and to the
continuous improvement of living conditions".
</p>
<p id="p_48">              In 1987, the International year of shelter for the homeless, the United Nations
spoke of the right of all individuals to: "a real home is one which provided protection from
the elements, has access to safe water, sanitation, provided for secure tenure and
personal safety".
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                             Page 13 of 16</span>
<p id="p_49">               Right to shelter is considered a fundamental right to life. Food, shelter and
clothing are basic human needs. In Olga Tellis Vs Municipal Corporation of Greater
Bombay, PG Gupta and State of Gujarat; it was emphasized that problem of homeless
people is globally recognized. Absence of sufficient and cost effective housing has led to
surge in needs of slums, jhuggis and un­regularized colonies. At the same time, public
property cannot be allowed to encroach and concerned authorities have to ensure
constant vigilance on encroachment. However, once encroachment is allowed, they
cannot be easily evicted without giving them an alternative accommodation.
</p>
<p id="p_50">              In Chameli Singh Vs State of UP, Apex Court observed that right to shelter
is encompassed within <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_22">article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. Further, the court observed
that right to live in a civilized society implies right to food, water, decent environment,
education, medical care and shelter. Thus, civil, political and cultural rights enshrined in
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Conventions or under the Constitution of
India cannot be exercised without these basic human rights. Right to shelter, therefore
includes adequate living space, safe and decent structure, clean and decent surroundings,
sufficient light, pure air and water, electricity, sanitation and other civic amenities like roads
etc. so as to have easy right to shelter .
</p>


<p id="p_51">24.           However, the court is facing the dilemma that whether right to shelter which
is encompassed within <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_23">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India can withstand the settled
proposition of law that encroachers have no vested right in the public land and therefore
claim no relief from the court. The court concede to the fact that outlet of illegal sewer is
source of water pollution in the land of gram sabha and is a natural hazard to the residents
of regularized colony. The current theme of this era is to protect safe and conserve the
environment, however this court feels hesitant to grant any relief sought. The plaintiff has
not approached the court with clean hands. He himself admitted in his cross­examination
that before laying down of the pipe line the people of the locality had come to him and
promised him that they will discharge the waste water away from his plot and that the pipe
line would be 2 feet below the ground. Knowingly well, that the same is not the job of the
RWA and necessary permission has to be taken from the concerned authority, he gave his
no objection and complained only later on, allegedly on breach of their promise. To the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                               Page 14 of 16</span>
 reasons best known to him, none of those persons who had approached him for taking his
'No Objection' and laid down the pipe lines were not made party to the suit. The
Government agencies cannot be expected to oversee/maintain any structure/pipe lines
which have not been laid down by them as laying down of the pipe line for sewerage or
otherwise requires detailed planning and deliberations. It is not that public may be allowed
to lay down the same as per their wish and desire, according to their plan/design and then
shift the burden of their maintenance etc. to the public agencies.
</p>


<p id="p_52">25.           As the plaintiff has not been able to prove his ownership, the fact that his
occupation of the property has not been authorised by the competent authorities, he
himself was a party to the laying of sewer pipe lines, without any prior permission of any
authorised agency, the issue is decided against the plaintiff and in favour of the
defendants.

affluent/dirty water logged at the Gram Sabha Land. He also deposed that he did not know

alleged collapsed wall has placed on record. The photographs so placed i.e. Ex.PW1/C

<p id="p_57">              However, at the same time the court is concerned about the rights of the

includes right to healthy environment. As such, the court deems it expedient to impress
