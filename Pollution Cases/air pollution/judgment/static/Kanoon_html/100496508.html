 7        The Trial Court held that construction carried out by the
 plaintiffs of building no.4 i.e. stilt plus 21 floors was as per
 sanction lay out / building plan and declared that the same is not
 unauthorised construction. But at the same time the Trial Court
 held that the construction carried out by the plaintiffs of building
 no.4 is situated within Coastal Regulation Zone. Therefore, they
 are not entitled for completion and occupation certifcate. Hence,
 the plaintiffs fled the present First Appeal               No.849 of 2019
 challenging the impugned judgment and decree to the extent of
 issue of Coastal Regulation Zone and refusing to direct the
 Corporation to issue completion certifcate and occupation

the judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court restraining
them from demolishing the suit building no.4 situated on CTS

7.2.1998 under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">section 354A</a> of the said Act.


8        The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the
plaintiffs submits that in the present matter on 27.9.1988
(Exhibit 62) State Government approved development for
weaker section under Urban Land (Ceiling and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_2">Regulation) Act</a>,
1976. Thereafter, the plaintiffs through their architect on
7.8.1989 submitted layout for issuance of sanction and I.O.D. for
proposed project on the property bearing Survey No.343 CTS
No.261 of Village Dahisar (West), Bombay under <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_3">section 337</a> of
the said M.M.C.Act along with necessary forms, plans, copy of
U.L.C. N.O.C, copy of application and copy of receipt of central cell
remarks, copy of D.P. remarks, scrutiny fees etc. Thereafter, the
plaintiffs paid aggregate amount of Rs.3,27,200/- to the
defendant on 8.8.1989 as scrutiny fees.           He submits that
plaintiffs further paid fees of Rs.1,28,325/- on 9.11.89 towards
further fees for security of layout plans.        He submits that
defendants by the letter dated 19.8.89 called upon the plaintiffs
to submit further details for processing layout application. He
submits that to construct the bridge across Dahisar river along
44 ft. Wide D.P. Road as an access to property bearing CTS
No.261 of village Dahisar (West) was one of the condition for
carrying out development in the said plot of land. Pursuant to
the said condition, the plaintiff's architect on 5.5.90 and

 11.1.1991 submitted proposal and plan to the defendant for
 construction of bridge over the Dahisar river.


 9        The learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that
 as per the terms and conditions of IOD, plaintiffs agreed to
 complete the construction of bridge. He submits that after
 following due process of law, defendants on 14.3.1992 (Exhibit
 10) approved the plans for building No.4 and issued I.O.D. with
 reference to the plaintiff's application dated 7.8.1989 (Exhibit
 35).      He submits that defendants approved amended plans for
 building No.4 stilt + 21 upper floors. He submits that defendants
 called upon the plaintiffs to deposit the security charges and
 other payments for I.O.D. At that time, the plaintiffs requested
 defendants sometime to make payment. In this way, plaintiffs
 carried out construction of the building no.4 as per the sanction
 plan. He submits that even the defendants by their letter dated
 24.8.1998 (Exhibit 18) admitted the fact that, plans for stilt plus
 21 upper floors i.e. building no.4 on plot bearing CTS No.261
 Village Dahisar was approved by the Corporation. He relies on
 letter dated 24.8.1998 (Exhibit 18) which reads thus:

10       The learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that
after construction is over, plaintiffs applied for completion and
occupation certifcate on payment of usual charges. He submits
that, there is a circular issued by the Corporation bearing
no.CHE/4808/DPC             dated        13.3.1996   (Exhibit   46)       for
compounding offence by levying regularisation charges, for
carrying out the work beyond approval/without C.C. and by
withdrawing for stop work notice under <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_4">section 354</a> of the said
Act. He submits that the said Circular reads thus:

 proper approval by withdrawing notice under Section 354(A) of
 the BMC Act by the Building Proposal Department. The scale of
 penalties for regulations of the work carried out without proper
 approval/C.C. but which otherwise conforms with the provisions
 of D.C.Regulations was then prescribed.

     All the staff working in the Building proposal section are
requested to take not the the above policy circular."

11       The learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that
on the basis of the said Circular they tendered requisite amount
to the Corporation for issuing completion certifcate and also
occupation certifcate. He submits that instead of issuing
completion and occupation certifcate, the defendants issued
notice under section 53(1) of the MRTP Act, 1966 dated
16.10.2000 (Exhibit 20) on the ground that construction carried
out by plaintiffs is not in accordance with the permission granted
to them. The said notice was replied by the plaintiffs through
their Advocate's letter dated 10.11.2000 (Exhibit 58) and place
on record that, the defendants issued IOD and the construction
was carried out by them on the basis of IOD without violating FSI
limit. Therefore, there is no question of taking any action against
them under section 53(1) of the MRTP Act, 1966. He submits
that plaintiffs by their application dated 5.1.2000 (Exhibit 56)
requested defendants to regularise the work carried out of
building no.4 in terms of circular dated 13.3.1996 on payment of
usual charges.      In the meanwhile, on 19.1.2000 Coastal Zone
Management plan for Maharashtra was sanction by Union of
India.     On the basis of the said plan of the Coastal Zone
Management, the defendants refused to grant completion
certifcate, on the ground that construction of the building no.4
is affected by CRZ - II. Hence, plaintiffs fled Suit for declaration
that the construction carried out by plaintiffs was according to
law as per the sanction plan and IOD and same is not affected by
CRZ Zone because the plans for construction were sanctioned in

            4. Procedure for monitoring and enforcement:

            The Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests and the
            Government of State or Union Territory and such other
            authorities at the State or Union Territory levels, as

            for monitoring and enforcement of the provisions of this
            notifcation within their respective jurisdictions."



13       The learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that
bare reading of the notifcation dated 19.2.1991 shows that the
distance should not be less than 100 meters or width of the river,
creek or backwater whichever is less.            In the present case,
admittedly, width of the river is only 46 metres, as per the
defendants communication from time to time, at the time of
directing plaintiffs to construct the bridge on the river (Exhibit
'12' letter dated 21.09.1995). In this way, the notifcation dated
19.2.1991 does not affect construction on the suit plot of land,
particularly building no.4. Therefore, fnding given by the Trial
Court that construction of building no.4 affects the CRZ II is not
correct.

 14       The learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiffs                further
 submits that in any case, in the present proceeding, plaintiffs
 submitted layout for issue of sanction and IOD on 7.8.1989 i.e.
 before issuing the said notifcation.             Not only that, the
 Corporation approves plans within one year from the date of
 issuing notifcation. In this way, the said notifcation does not
 affect the construction carried out by the plaintiffs in respect of
 building no.4. Therefore, the impugned order passed by the Trial
 Court holding that construction of building no.4 violates CRZ II
 area is against justice, equity and good conscience and same is
 liable to be set aside.


 15       The learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that
 as per the said MMC Act before carrying out any construction,
 developer/builder have to give notice under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_12">section 302</a> of the
 said Act to the Commissioner with intention to lay out lands for
 building and for private streets. He submits that as per <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_13">section
 302</a>, plaintiffs submitted layout for issuance of sanction and IOD
 on 7.8.89. He submits that once the IOD is issued and
 construction is started, thereafter developer has to submit only
 subsequent plans of project for carrying out construction, within
 permissible FSI.


 16       The learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that,
 as per section 45 of the MRTP Act, 1966, planning authority to
 grant or refuse the permission for carrying out construction. He
 submits that in the present proceeding, admittedly, Corporation
 granted permission to carry out construction of building no.4.

He further submits that, as it remained on the part of plaintiffs to
pay requisite charges within time, the copy of the said IOD was
not handed over to the plaintiffs. He further submits that though
the defendant raised objection in their submission that, the said
IOD was in the form of draft, same cannot be acceptable, because
defendants themselves called upon the plaintiffs to deposit
requisite amount for issuing IOD. Apart from that there is no
provision in Municipal Act for draft IOD.                These facts were
admitted by defendant's witness Pankaj Prabhudas Bansali, Sub
Engineer MMC in his cross-examination dated 17.2.2014.
Paragraph 3, 4 and 5 of the cross-examination reads thus:




         "3.      I have also seen and studied the plans approved
         for construction of nine buildings having ground plus
         three floors to be constructed on suit plots. No IOD was
         given in respect or other buildings except building No.4
         in the year 1992. Commencement Certifcate in respect
         of building No. 4 was issued only after fulfllment of all
         the conditions of IOD Draft approval means summary of
         corrections to be carried on in fnal approval. I cannot
         say upto which level draft approval was carried out.
         Draft approval is always subjected to correction
         suggested by Executive Engineer. I do not know about
         the correction suggested in respect of draft approval
         upto       the         level          of   Executive        Engineer.
         (At this stage, witness stated before Court that he has
         not brought offce record in respect of draft approval.

               necessary for the purpose of cross examination hence,
               witness is directed to bring the concerned record on
               next date and till then, his further cross examination is
               deferred.)"


               "4.             Plaintiff had submitted additional plan for
               G plus twenty one floors and the same was approved
               under draft approval. It is true to say that at the time of
               draft approval the only condition for issuing the
               approved pan was to deposit amount as per demand
               note. Draft approval was submitted upto the level of
               Executive Engineer. Executive Engmeer had sanctioned
               the draft approval. If plaintiff had deposited amount of
               demand note then copy of approved plan would have
               been given to him by corporation."


               "5.             It is true to say that had the plaintiff
               deposited amount of demand note then there was no
               necessity to issue fresh commencement certifcate and
               in that case the earlier commencement certifcate would
               have re-endorsed for the further construction. When the
               demand note was sent there was no mention of CRZ in
               our offce record in respect of proposal of plaintiff
               regarding stilt + 21 floors. It is not true to say that till
               fling complaint on 14/1/2003 as per Ex.76 there was no
               remark in our offce record that suit plot was affected

            to assist police to carry out panchanama as mentioned
            on Ex.77. On the perusal of offce record I now say that
            panchnama was carried out by local police station on
            26/3/2003. It is true to say that there is no mention of
            violation of CRZ regulations in the police complaint."



17       The learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that
the Division Bench of our High Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/869805/" id="a_14">Sneha
Mandal Co-operative Housing Society Ltd. vs. Union of India and
ors</a>.1 held that if the process of the development starts prior to
CRZ notifcation then there is no question of affecting the said
project by the said notifcation. He relies on paragraph 10 of the
said authority which reads thus:


            "10.    In the present matter, detail arguments were
            advanced regarding delay and laches on the part of the
            petitioners in moving the Court during the period 1991
            to 1998 and during which period huge investment has
            been made by respondent No. 7. It is also submitted
            vehemently that citizens had welcomed construction of
            the Bulk Receiving Station in 1990 and coupled with the
            fact that no objection has been taken by the petitioners
            all over the years, the construction of the Bulk
            Receiving Station by Tata Electric Company should not

               be stopped. In the present matter, it is important to note
               that the process for construction of Bulk Receiving
               Station started prior to 1991. Initially, Plot 150-A was
               earmarked for the Bulk Receiving Station. However, the
               land was required to be reclaimed and during this
               period, the CRZ Notifcation came into force. In the
               circumstances, the Government decided to permit Tata
               Electric Company to construct the Bulk Receiving
               Station on Plot 148. Construction of a Bulk Receiving
               Station is a long-drawn process. It has various stages. It
               starts from laying of underground cables. These cables
               are long distance cables. They come from Dharavi. It is
               only after these cables are laid that actual construction
               of the structure commences. It is for this reason that
               Government permitted Tata Electric Company to
               cordon Plot 148 by a wall so that encroachment does
               not take place, particularly as the process was a long-
               drawn up process involving various different stages.
               The point which is required to be borne in mind is that
               the process started prior to CRZ Notifcation in 1991.
               Today, as the matter stands, the Project is at a stage
               where the building is required to be put up as under-
               ground cables at huge costs have already been laid
               down. Looking from this perspective, it is clear that
               before the CRZ Notifcation came into force, the process
               had already commenced. The Project involves various
               stages and to our mind, the initial allocation of the Plot
               150-A which was subsequently shifted to Plot 148 itself
               is a part of the ongoing process. In the circumstances,
               the CRZ Notifcation of 1991 is required to be considered
               in the context of the facts of this case. Lastly, we fnd
               merit in the contention of Mr. Chagla that in any event,
               the larger public interests should be weighed and since
               there is utmost need in the locality for the Bulk
               Receiving Station, the larger public interest should
               prevail, particularly when two public interests compete
               with each other."

18       The learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that in
the case in hand, project was started in the year 1989 when the
plaintiffs submitted their layout for issuance of sanction and IOD
and also when the Corporation approves plans and issued IOD on
14.3.1992. Apart from that, the width of the river is only 46
mtrs. Therefore, construction of building no.4 does not affect by
the CRZ Zone II.


19       The learned counsel for the plaintiffs submits that in the
present proceeding, frst time on 19.1.2000, Coastal Zone
Management Plan for Maharashtra was sanctioned by Union of
India. These facts were admitted by the respondent in the written
statement. He submits that apex court in the matter of Goan
Real Estate and Construction Limited and Another vs. Union of
India Through Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Others, 2
held that all development and activities within CRZ will be valid
and will not violate the provisions of the 1991 notifcation till the
management plans are approved. He relies on paragraph 28, 31,
38 and 40 of this authority.




             "28.     The question which falls for consideration is
             whether the constructions made or on-going pursuant
             to the plans sanctioned on the basis of Notifcation dated
             August 16, 1994 would be affected or not. For this
             purpose, it will be necessary to construe the judgment

             (supra)."

               which the same was passed. For the said purpose, the
               judgment of this Court is required to be read in its
               entirety. A judgment, it is well settled, cannot be read as
               a statute. Construction of a judgment should be made in
               the light of the factual matrix involved therein. What is
               more important is to see the issues involved therein and
               the context wherein the observations were made.
               Observation made in a judgment, it is trite, should be
               read in isolation and out of context. On perusal of
               paragraph 10 of the judgment, it is abundantly clear
               that even under 1991 Notifcation which is the main
               Notifcation, it was stipulated that all development and
               activities within CRZ will be valid and will not violate
               the provisions of the 1991 Notifcation till the
               Management Plans are approved. Thus, the intention of
               legislature while issuing Notifcation of 1991 was to
               protect the past actions/transactions which came into
               existence before the approval of 1991 Notifcation."

               respondents that the construction already completed

               senior counsel and counsel for the parties, the frst
               question which we have to look to is, whether Uppanar
               river and its banks at the point where pipelines pass,
               fall in the CRZ III area. If the answer to this is in the
               affrmative,        obviously,   the      pipelines           crossing
               underneath Uppanar river would require environmental
               clearance. The other main question we have to consider
               in connection with these matters is, whether paragraph
               2(ii) of 1991 Notifcation restricts transfer of VCM
               (hazardous substance) beyond port area to the PVC
               plant through pipelines. Other considerations would

directed to issue completion and occupation certifcate.                      He
submits that if First Appeal preferred by the plaintiffs is not

erred in coming to the conclusion that the plaintiffs carried out
construction of building no.4 is according to law. He submits that
admittedly in the present proceeding, plaintiffs carried out
construction of building no.4 without obtaining IOD from the
Corporation.     He submits that though the plaintiffs relied on
letter dated 24.8.1998 Exhibit '18' from the Corporation that
amended plans submitted by them for stilt + 21 upper floors were
approved, but the same was not issued for non payment of
requisite fees, for which demand letter was issued by them.
Therefore, construction carried out by plaintiffs of building no.4
was unauthorized.         In support of this contention, the learned

 in the present proceeding, admittedly, as per the notifcation

 Forests, Union of India, construction of building no.4 comes
 within CRZ and therefore, there is no question of granting any
 completion certifcate and or occupation certifcate to the
 plaintiffs. He submits that it is specifcally stated in the said
 notifcation dated 19.2.1991 that, no construction be carried out
 and or sanctioned by the authority, if the same is affected by CRZ.
 He submits that though survey was carried out in the year 2000
 by the authority and declared the said area affected by CRZ Zone,
 the construction carried out by the plaintiffs before that, cannot
 be regularized and or allow them to use for residential purpose.
 In any case, same is required to be demolished.

Exhibit 17 calling upon the plaintiffs to stop the further work of

demolish the unauthorised construction immediately, failing
which Corporation will take appropriate action against them. He
submits that inspite of all these facts, the plaintiffs failed and

Engineer (Building Proposal) 'R' Ward granted approval to carry
out the construction work as per amended plans. On 24.02.97,
the plaintiffs submitted further amendment plans for building

the ground that the work was being carried out beyond

of the defendants contained in the circular dated 13.3.1996 for
compounding offence by levying regularization charges,              for
carrying out the work beyond approval/without Commencement
Certifcate. However, the defendants vide letter dated 17.5.2000

Trial Court restrained the defendants from carrying out

 approval from the competent authority.              In the case in hand,
 Corporation themselves sanctioned the plans submitted by the
 plaintiffs and specifcally recorded in their letter dated 24.8.1998
 Exhibit 18, but same were not issued to the plaintiffs for want of
 payment of requisite fees. It is to be noted that as per Circular
 No. CHE/4808/DPC dated 13.3.1996, same can rectify by paying
 the charges. Apart from that whenever Corporation issued notice
 under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_57">section 354A</a> of the said MMC Act and under Section 53(1)
 of the MRTP Act, 1966, they failed to take any action in respect of

 sanction plans. In view of these facts, issue no.1 is answered in
 the negative (No).

 approved in respect of building no.4 for 21st upper floors with
 letter dated 21.6.1997 Exhibit '16' calling upon the plaintiffs to
 make further payment towards amended plan and IOD deposit.
 This itself shows that Corporation after considering the
 documents submitted by the plaintiffs, issue IOD but same was
 not handed over to the plaintiffs on the ground that plaintiffs
 failed to pay the said charges.           Thereafter, the Coastal Zone
 Management carried out survey, prepared the plan and
 sanctioned the same by Union on 19.1.2000. This itself shows
 that when plans were sanctioned and construction was carried
 out by the plaintiffs, said plot of land was not declared affected by

in the year 1988 with the State Government granting approval

Urban land Ceiling and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_63">Regulation Act</a>, 1976. Thereafter, the
plaintiffs had obtained all the necessary permission from the
defendants for development of the suit land. The construction of
the suit building no.4 was over in the year 1998-99 much prior to
Coastal Zone Management Plan being published on 19.1.2000.
Hence, the defendants Corporation committed grave error by
rejecting the regularisation application fled by the plaintiffs on
17.05.2000 on the ground that the development of the Suit
property is affected by CRZ.                      This itself shows that the
Corporation defendants retrospective made the Coastal Zone
Management Plan applicable to the development of the suit
property and more particularly development of the suit building
no.4. This itself shows that prior to publication of Coastal Zone
Management Plan, the construction of the suit building no.4 was
over      and     was   awaiting        occupation       certifcate   from       the

 failed to consider the fact that in the present proceeding, there is
 no question of challenge to the demarcation of High Tide Line
 carried out by Hydrographer in the year 2000. Main contention
 raised by the plaintiffs was that they started their project in
