</pre><p id="p_1">Date : 01-09-2020
(Ajai Lamba, C.J.)

              The Court proceedings have been conducted through Video-Conference.
</p>
<p id="p_2">   2.         Gist of the issue raised by this bunch of 4(four) cases is recorded in order
   dated 04.06.2020 rendered in PIL (Suo Moto) No.3/2020. The order reads as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_3">             "The Court proceedings have been conducted through Video-Conference.
</p><p id="p_4">                                                                            Page No.# 6/10

</p><p id="p_5">2.         The issue raised by virtue of this petition is in regard to approval allegedly
given for coal mining project in Saleki Reserve Forest, which is a part of Dehing
Patkai Elephant Reserve. It has been pleaded that Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve of
which Saleki is a part, is the largest rainforest in India and stretches for 575 square
kilometers across Tinsukia, Dibrugarh and Sivasagar districts of Upper Assam. The
virgin forestland is also referred to as the 'Amazon of the East'. Biodiversity of the
forestland is rich and unique. Dehing Patkai region is already threatened by high
polluting industries such as coal mine, oil refineries, gas drilling which adversely
affect the biodiversity of the region. There are varieties of animals and birds living in
the area. Large numbers of reptiles that are rare have their abode in the area.
</p><p id="p_6">           It has been alleged that environmental disaster would be caused if
approval is given by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to allow
coal mining project in this area without proper scientific study, discussions, and taking
into consideration various aspects of protecting the environment.
</p>
<p id="p_7">3.         It has been asserted that environmental impact is required to be assessed
before any such activity is allowed in this area. However, Environment Impact
Assessment Report has not been prepared so as to ensure safeguarding natural
habitat and protection of animals, birds and reptile species existing in the region.
</p>
<p id="p_8">4.         Issue notice to the respondents.
