            For the Respondent No.2: Mr. Mukesh Kumar

Reserved on 24.8.2009                               Pronounced on 2.9.2009.

10.   2.9.09</pre><p id="p_1">.     Both the applications were heard together and are

             being disposed of by this common order as the question involved

            in both the cases is the same.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                  Extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked for

            quashing the entire criminal case of Noamundi P.S. case no.47 of

            2006 (G.R.No.502 of 2006) instituted under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_1">section 37</a> of the Air

            (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter referred

            to as 'the Act') pending in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate,

            Chaibasa.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                  One Manikant Prasad, Regional Officer of Jharkhand State

            Pollution Control Board, lodged a First Information Report on

            24.8.2006 alleging therein that on 23.8.2006 when he visited the

            industrial unit known as M/s. Salasar Metallic, Noamundi belonging

            to the petitioner, Manish Chand Agarwal, he found the unit in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                           2</span>


working condition where iron ore was found stored, though the

Board had never given any consent to establish the unit or the

consent to operate the unit.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      Further it has been alleged that when he visited the

premises of industrial unit known as M/s. Keshri Balaji Minerals

belonging to the petitioner, Girdharilal Agarwal, iron ore (Fines)

was found stored over there and the unit was in working condition,

though the Board had never given consent to operate the unit.

</p><p id="p_5">      Thus both the accused persons as well as other persons,

who were also found to have been operating industrial unit without

consent of the Board have been alleged to have contravened the

provision of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of the Act and as such, they are punishable

under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_4">section 37</a> of the said Act.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      The very institution of the case by the police as Noamundi

P.S. case no.47 of 2006 has been challenged on the ground that as

per the provision contained in <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_5">Section 43</a> of he Act one can be

prosecution under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_6">section 37</a> of the said Act only on a complaint

made by a     Board or any officer authorized in this behalf by it

whereas instant application has been initiated on the basis of First

Information Report.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      Mr.Ananda Sen, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner

submits that since in terms of <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_7">Section 43</a> of the Act, cognizance of

the offence under the Act can be taken only on a complaint made

by a Board or any officer authorized in this behalf by it, launching

of any prosecution for contravention of provision of the Act by way

of First Information Report would vitiate the entire criminal

proceeding.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      In this regard it was pointed out that the Act is quite silent

over the meaning of 'complaint' and therefore, in order to construe

the meaning of 'complaint', one should resort to the provision of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            3</span>


the Code of Criminal Procedure where <a href="/doc/67938515/" id="a_8">Section 2(d)</a> defines

'complaint' which means any allegation made orally or in writing to

a Magistrate, with a view to take action under the Code of Criminal

Procedure and hence, prosecution can be launched only by way of

complaint to a Magistrate and this proposition has been laid down

by this Court in the context of the provision of Mines and Minerals

(Development and Regulation ) Act, 1957, in a case of <a href="/doc/1047566/" id="a_9">Manish

Khemka vs. State of Jharkhand and others</a> [ 2009(2) JLJR

720]. Thus, it was submitted that the entire criminal proceeding

initiated on the basis of First Information Report is fit to be quashd.

</p><p id="p_9">       On the other hand, it was submitted on behalf of the State

as well as Pollution Control Board that offences alleged being

cognizable, the police is quite competent to make investigation of

the case as the Act nowhere puts a bar or restrict the police officer

to institute or to investigate a case and, therefore, the submission

advanced on behalf of the petitioner is not at all tenable.

</p><p id="p_10">       In the context of the submission as well as allegation made

against the petitioner that industrial units were established and

were being run without there being consent of the Board, one

needs to take provision of <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_10">Section 37</a> which reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              37. "Failure to comply with the provisions of
              <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_11">section 21</a> or <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_12">section 22</a> or with the directions issued
              under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_13">section 31A</a> - (1) whoever fails to comply with
              the provisions of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_14">section 21</a> or <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_15">section 22</a> or directions
              issued under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_16">section 31A</a>, shall, in respect of each
              such failure, be punishable with imprisonment for a
              term which shall not be less than one year and six
              months but which may extend to six years and with
              fine, and in case the failure continues, with an
              additional fine which may extend to five thousand
              rupees for every day during which such failure
              continues after the conviction of the first such failure.
              (2) If the failure referred to in sub-section (1)
              continues beyond a period of one year after the date
              of conviction, the offender shall be punishable with
              imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than
              two years but which may extend to seven years and
              with fine."</blockquote><p id="p_11">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                           4</span>


</p><p id="p_12">      Cognizance of the aforesaid offence is taken in the manner

as enshrined in <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_17">Section 43</a> which reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              43. "Cognizance of offences - (1) No court shall
                  take cognizance of any offence under this Act
                  except on a complaint made by -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                    (a) a Board or any officer authorized in this
                          behalf by it; or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                    (b) any person who has given notice of not
                          less than sixty days, in the manner
                          prescribed, of the alleged offence and of
                          his intention to make a complaint to the
                          Board or officer authorized as aforesaid.
                    And no court inferior to that of a Metropolitan
                    magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first
                    class shall try any offence punishable under
                    this Act.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                    (2) Where a complaint has been made under
                    clause (b) of sub-section (1), the Board shall
                    on demand by such person, make available
                    the relevant reports in its possession to that
                    person :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                      Provided that the Board may refuse to make
                    any such report available to such person if the
                    same is, in its opinion, against the public
                    interest."</blockquote><p id="p_13">


</p><p id="p_14">      Since it has been stipulated that no courts shall take

cognizance of any offence under the Act except on a 'complaint',

submission was advanced that the police is not competent to

register a first information report for commission of the offence

under the Act. Admittedly, the word "complaint" has not been

defined in the Act nor the Act does stipulate about the manner in

which case would be instituted or investigated and in that event,

sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1329373/" id="a_18">Section 4</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure

would come into play which provides that all the offences under

any other law are to be investigated, inquired into, tried or

otherwise dealt with according to<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_19"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure,

subject to the provision contained in the special law regulating the

manner or the place of investigation or inquiring into, trying or

otherwise dealing with such offences.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             5</span><p id="p_15">


</p><p id="p_16">       I have already noticed that the offence alleged is punishable

for six years and hence, as per Part II of Schedule I of the Code,

any offence punishable with three years or more            becomes a

cognizable office.     Once the offence alleged        is cognizable,

information of it if given to an Officer-in-Charge of a Police Station,

he, as per the provision as contained in <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_20">Section 154</a> of the Code of

Criminal Procedure is obliged to reduce the same into writing. Sub-

section (3) of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_21">Section 154</a> further obligates the police authorities to

investigate the same as per the manner prescribed in subsequent

section and thereafter submit its report to the Magistrate, who is

empowered to take cognizance of the offence on police report

under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_22">section 173</a> of the Code on completion of the investigation.

Thus, in absence of any provision in the Act relating to institution,

investigation, inquiring or trial   or otherwise     resorting to the

provision<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_23"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure to deal with the matter

relating to the investigation, inquiry and trial shall not be without

jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_17">       Similar view, in the context of the similar situation though

with respect to <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_24">Electricity Act</a> wherein <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_25">Section 151</a> of the Electricity

Act also stipulates that no court shall take cognizance except on

complaint, has been expressed by the Delhi High Court in a case of

<a href="/doc/135697/" id="a_26">Bimla Gupta vs State and another</a> [136 (1007) Delhi Law

Times 521] and also in a case of <a href="/doc/1655328/" id="a_27">Sanjay vs. State</a> decided by

Delhi High Court in W.P.(Crl.) 582 of 2008 and Crl.M.A5393

of 2008         wherein it has been held that the offence being

cognizable offence the police could register a First Information

Report.
</p>
<p id="p_18">          So far the case referred to on behalf of the petitioner is

concerned, it is true that it has been held         by me that any

prosecution for contravention of <a href="/doc/1492002/" id="a_28">Section 22</a> of the Mines and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  6</span>


      Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_29">Regulation) Act</a>,1957 and also of Rule 8

      of Jharkhand Minerals Dealers' Rule, 2007 launched by informant

      not by way of complaint but by way of information to the police is

      quite illegal but it has been held so presumably in the context of

      offence under that Act and Rule, being non-cognizable which the

      police has got no power to investigate without order of the

      Magistrate and not in the light of the discussion made above.

</p><p id="p_19">             In that view of the matter, that decision is not helpful to the

      petitioner

             Under the circumstances, I do find and hold that the police

      is competent to register the case as the offence alleged is

      cognizable.
</p>
<p id="p_20">             So far as question of taking cognizance of the offence is

      concerned, it be observed that the Magistrate can take cognizance

      of the offence on the basis of complaint of an authorized officer

      which may be filed along with the police report. Thus, both the

      applications being devoid of any merit are hereby dismissed.



</p><p id="p_21">                                                       (R.R.Prasad, J.)
