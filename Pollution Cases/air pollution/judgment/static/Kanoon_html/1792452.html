ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 
	  

<p id="p_1">Heard
	learned Senior Advocate for the applicants, Mr.J.R. Nanavati for
	Mr.A.R. Thacker, learned counsel for the respondent no.1, Mr.K.H.
	Baxi and Learned
	Additional Public Prosecutor for the respondent no.2, Mr.A.J. Desai.
</p>	  

<p id="p_2">Against
	the Ballarpur Industries Ltd. and 10 others, complaint has been
	filed by the complainant before the Court of Learned Judicial
	Magistrate, First Class, Lalpur, District : Jamnagar on 07.10.1997
	under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_1">Sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_2">44</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of
	Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 for the alleged breach of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_4">Sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">25</a> of
	the Act, which came to be registered as Criminal Case No.472/1997.
	The said complaint was filed by one M.S. Shukla, Deputy
	Environmental Engineer. In the said complaint, process was issued
	against all accused.
</p>	  

<p id="p_3">Against
	the same, the applicant-Company has preferred this application under
	<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_6">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the
	Criminal Case pending before the Court of Learned
	Learned
	Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Lalpur.
</p>	  

<p id="p_4">It
	has been mainly argued by the Learned
	Senior Advocate, Mr.Nanavati that powers for filing the complaint
	delegated by the Chairman to the said person are not just, legal and
	proper, for which, he has placed reliance upon the decision reported
	in Vol. XLIII (2) GLR 1580, more particularly, in para 10, which
	reads as under:-
</p>	 


<p id="p_5">	?SEven
	if, sec.49(1)(a) and sec.11-A are read together,  it  can not be
	said that the legislature intended that the Chairman of a Board  can
	 exercise  all powers  and  perform all duties from time to time
	without specific delegation  made   to   him   by   the Board.
	Sec.49(1)(a)  is clear enough, from which, it can be said that the
	complaint can be made firstly  by  a  Board  and secondly by any
	officer authorized in this behalf by the Board.  Thus, filing of a
	complaint  under this  section can  be made by the Board or by any
	officer authorized by the Board in this behalf.  No specific 
	authorization  by the  Board has been made under resolution dated
	27-3-1984 to the Chairman for filing a complaint against any person
	committing offences under  the  Act.    All  that  he  is authorized
	 under  this  resolution  is power to sanction prosecution by the
	Chairman  of  the  Board.    Power  to sanction  prosecution  is
	altogether different from power and authority to file complaint. 
	Under this  resolution, it  is  nowhere  mentioned that the Chairman
	of the Board himself can file a complaint.  If, the  Chairman 
	himself does not possess power to file complaint under a specific
	resolution  from the Board, it is difficult to understand how he can
	delegate such power to another officer of  the Board.  In the
	absence of specific power delegated by the Board  to  the  Chairman
	to file complaint or authorizing the Chairman to delegate power to
	file complaint to  some other   officer   of  the  Board,  no 
	officer  can  file complaint, and in this view  of  the  matter, 
	the  order dated  18-8-1989  Ex.31  can  not  be  said  to  be valid
	delegation of power by the  Chairman  in  favour  of  the Assistant
	Environmental  Engineer  of  the  Board.  Even, under sec.11-<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_7">A of
	the Act</a>,  the  Chairman  of  the  Board shall exercise such powers
	and perform such duties as may be prescribed or as may from time to
	time be delegated to him by  the Board.  Thus, without delegation of
	powers by the  Board,  the  Chairman  can  not  exercise  power  to
	delegate  the  authority  to file complaint to some other person. 
	It is not  within  the  general  powers  of  the Chairman  of the
	Board to exercise power of delegation to some other officer of the
	Board to file complaint.
</p>	 


	
	 


<p id="p_6">	It
	can be said that cognizance of an offence can be taken by a Court,
	firstly on  a  complaint  filed  by the Board, and secondly by an
	officer authorized by the  Board  to  file  a  complaint. Since, 
	there  is no authorization by the Board in favour of the complainant
	to file a  complaint,  the  cognizance taken  by  the  learned 
	Magistrate  was  illegal,  as  a consequence of which, the entire
	trial  and  exercise  in appeal  becomes  illegal,  inasmuch  as, 
	the prosecution structure collapsed for want of a complaint  filed 
	by  a person duly authorized by the Board.??
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_7">Mr.Nanavati
	has also taken me through the minutes of the 43 meeting of the
	Board, copy of which is annexed with the application as Annexure-B
	at page no.17 and argued that the powers are only given to the
	Chairman. It is also argued that as held by this Hon'ble Court, no
	such powers are delegated to the complainant to file such complaint
	and it has been delegated to the Chairman. Thus, the present
	applicants are protected in view of the above referred judgment. It
	is, therefore, argued that the present application may be allowed
	and the complaint as well as proceedings issued therein may be
	quashed.
</p>	  

<p id="p_8">I
	have gone through the application, complaint annexed with the
	application and the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for
	the applicants. I have also considered the arguments advanced by the
	learned counsel for the applicant. Looking to the facts and
	circumstances of the case and keeping in mind the ratio laid down in
	the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the applicants,
	I am of the opinion that complaint as well as process issued therein
	are required to be quashed and set aside.
</p>	  

<p id="p_9">It
	is required to be noted that the complaint has been filed against
	the Company, its Directors as well as office bearers numbering 11.
	However, out of them, though the accused no.1-Company and its Deputy
	Manager have filed the present application for quashing of the
	complaint, benefit is also required to be given to all other accused
	of the said complaint.
</p>	  

<p id="p_10">In
	view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, the
	present application is allowed. Criminal Case No.472/1997 pending in
	the Court of Learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Lalpur,
	District : Jamnagar and the process issued therein are hereby
	quashed and set aside. Rule made absolute to the aforesaid extent.
</p>
