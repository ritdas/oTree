                             JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Ashok Bhushan, C.J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           Heard both the sides.          This writ appeal has been

filed against the order dated 29.09.2015 passed in R.P. No.657

of 2015 as well as the judgment dated 03.07.2015 passed in

W.P.(C) No. 14393 of 2015. The appellant was the writ

petitioner who had filed the writ petition challenging Exts.P1,

P4, P6 and P7.
</p>
<p id="p_3">           2. The learned Single Judge observed that the

petitioner has a remedy to file appeal as per the Air

(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 where all the

issues can be raised. Thus learned Single Judge refused to

exercise his jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition.

</p><p id="p_4">           3. A Review Petition was filed by the petitioner

raising various grounds including that there was no consent by

the Pollution Control Board when the Unit was transferred and

the Unit could not have run. In the Review Petition it was also

WA No. 2471 of 2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               -:2:-</span>


contended that at the time when the writ petition was filed, the

appellate authority was not functioning. Learned Single Judge

disposed of the Review Petition noticing the fact that at the time

of disposing of the writ petition the appellate authority was not

functioning, however, it was noted that the appellate authority

has now been constituted and the Review Petition was disposed

of deleting paragraph 9 of the original judgment.

</p><p id="p_5">           4. Learned counsel for the appellant in support of the

writ appeal contended that this was a case where the writ court

ought to have entertained the writ petition by staying the

functioning of the Unit, since there was no valid consent for the

Unit.  He submits that since the appellate authority was not

functioning when the writ petition was filed, the learned Single

Judge has committed error in not entertaining the writ petition.

He submits that even if the petitioner is relegated to avail the

remedy of appeal, an interim order be granted stopping the

functioning of the Unit.
</p>
<p id="p_6">           5. We have considered the submissions of learned

counsel for the parties and perused the record.

WA No. 2471 of 2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               -:3:-</span>


</p><p id="p_7">           6. There is no dispute that a statutory remedy is

available against the orders which were impugned in the writ

petition and the statutory remedy before the Tribunal could have

been availed by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_8">           7. The issues raised were issues which require

adjudication of facts which can appropriately be done by the

appellate authority. It is true that at the time when the writ

petition was disposed of, the appellate authority was not

constituted, but it has been noticed in the order disposing of the

Review Petition that now the appellate authority has been

constituted.
</p>
<p id="p_9">           8. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

appellate authority is not functioning. Be that as it may, the

appellate authority having been constituted, the appellant can

very well file an appeal and can raise all the issues which are

sought to be raised in the Writ Petition and Review Petition. It is

also open for the appellant to file such application as may be

necessary, if so advised.
</p>
<p id="p_10">WA No. 2471 of 2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               -:4:-</span>


           We are of the view that no error has been committed

by the learned Single Judge by relegating the petitioner to avail

statutory remedy and also disposing of the Review Petition by

order dated 29.09.2015. We thus dismiss the Writ Appeal. We,

however, observe that in the event the appellant/writ petitioner

files an appeal within a period of 30 days from today, the same

shall also be considered and decided.
