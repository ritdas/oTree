Environmental Engineering Department,            that  the

Board is a statutory quasi judicial authority

constituted by the State.                 It is neither a

Government             Department   nor  a  Public  Sector

Undertaking.            The Board is constituted under the

provisions of Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 to exercise the powers

conferred under the Act.              One of the functions

participate             in   investigation  and   research

leading          to    problems  of   water pollution  and

prevention, control or abatement             of pollution.

The efficiency of the Board can be improved by

way of attaining higher qualifications by its

employees. The Board has been deputing engineers

since 1977 for higher studies. In the early

years, the deputation was for a                ten months'

Kerala.            The Board in its 162nd meeting held on

09.05.2008 decided             to allow the 3rd respondent

to undergo deputation to Ph.D Course on the

subject           of    Water  pollution,   monitoring  and

prediction.              The    Board,    while    granting

deputation, made it clear that the deputation

allowed to the 3rd respondent is not an undue

favour and she would not be eligible for out of

turn        promotion       or  any    additional  monetary

benefit on acquiring the Ph.D but                her higher

level of knowledge               would contribute to the

functioning of the Board in a better way. As per

the 1999            Regulations, it is    obligatory on the

part of the             employees of the Board to go for

higher studies/training if the Board so directs.

The      Board         has  encouraged     3rd respondent's

endeavour to attain Ph.D and she was granted No

Objection Certificate to do part time research

leading to Ph.D.             The Board has so far  deputed

40 officers for higher studies for either ME

(EE) or M.Tech/Environmental Engineering from

1977 to 2009.              No objection was raised by the

petitioner to anyone being deputed for higher

studies               except    in  the   case of  the 3rd

respondent.             It is made more than clear by the

State Government that the knowledge gained by

way of higher studies                will be beneficial in

discharging the statutory functions. In that

regard orders were issued allowing deputation to

the 3rd respondent to undergo research leading to

Ph.D.

institution             as   well   as    the   State,   no

interference is called for.             Moreover,  this is

not a solitary incident relating to deputation

for higher studies.              We have already made it

clear that the two years term of deputation

granted to the 3rd respondent             is already over.

Hence        no       useful purpose   will  be  served  in

reopening the settled position. We do not find

any        public        interest  in    this   litigation.

Accordingly no interference is called for.
