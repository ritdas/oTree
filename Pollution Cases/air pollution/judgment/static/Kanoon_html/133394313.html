<p id="p_1">     1.           In this petition filed under Articles 226/227 of the

     Constitution of India, challenge is to the orders dated 27.5.2011 and

     24.8.2011, Annexures P.6 and P.9 respectively, whereby application of

     the petitioners for selling the mortgaged property under Section 13

     (13) of the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and

     <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_1">Enforcement of Security Interest Act</a>, 2002 (in short, "the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_2">SARFAESI

     Act</a>") has been declined.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.           Briefly, the facts necessary for adjudication of the

     controversy as narrated in the petition may be noticed. The petitioner-

     company is engaged in the business of trading of hosiery items,

     readymade garments and related items. On account of default and

     inability of the petitioner-company to pay back the dues of the

     respondent-Bank, proceedings under under <a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_3">sections 13(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_4">13(4)</a>

     of the the SARFAESI Act were initiated by the Bank proposing to sell

     mortgaged properties and hypothecated goods.           The petitioner-

     company proposed to sell off the mortgaged properties in order to

     fetch the best price of the same and make payment to the Bank. For

     this purpose, the petitioner-company approached the Bank            for

     settlement of loan facility under One Time Settlement scheme(OTS).

     Copy of the proposal dated 25.3.2010 submitted by the petitioner-

     company is at Annexure P.1 with the petition. The said proposal was

     finally approved by the bank vide letter dated 22.1.2011. The Bank

     granted permission to the petitioner-company for selling the alleged

     mortgaged properties for a total sale consideration of Rs.250 lacs. The

     petitioner-company thereafter entered into an agreement for sale of

     the property. It deposited Rs.50 lacs in terms of the settlement but

     was unable to pay the remaining amount of Rs.200 lacs by 22.3.2011.

     The petitioner-company sought extension of time from the Bank. In

     the meantime, father of petitioner Nos. 2 and 3 expired and due to

     family circumstances, the balance amount could not be arranged in

     time. Vide letter dated 24.8.2011, Annexure P.9, the Bank withdrew

     the one time settlement scheme granted in favour of the petitioners.

     Hence this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3.           Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that there

     was no remedy available to the petitioners against the impugned order

     passed under <a href="/doc/52478203/" id="a_5">section 13(13)</a> of the SARFAESI Act as <a href="/doc/6431889/" id="a_6">Section 34</a> bars

     jurisdiction of civil court and in such a situation, writ was the only
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CWP No.2250 of 2012                                                      3</span>

     remedy. It was submitted that the period which was allowed by the

     respondent-Bank for discharging the liability for releasing        the

     property could not be adhered to due to certain circumstances beyond

     the control of the petitioners. Elaborating the argument, it was urged

     that the father of petitioner Nos. 2 and 3 who was the Managing

     Director of the Company had expired on 17.6.2011 and therefore, the

     petitioner-Company was not able to follow the time schedule. It was

     next contended that there was statutory obligation which was cast on

     the Bank to have accepted the application of the petitioner-Company.

     Once there was no malafide and no alternative remedy of redressal

     being available, the petitioner-Company is before this Court.

     Addressing on merits, it was contended that reasonableness and

     fairness of the action of the Bank was under challenge in this writ

     petition as the Bank was too harsh in rejecting the application of the

     petitioners for sale of the mortgaged property for discharge of

     outstanding liability. There were sufficient grounds existed for

     condoning the delay and accepting the amount. It was also pointed

     out that the petitioners had prepared the demand drafts on 26.7.2011

     for the balance amount of ` 2 crores which was to be paid in terms of

     the original settlement by the Bank. Besides the aforesaid, learned

     counsel for the petitioners had shown the willingness of the

     petitioners in paying additional amount of `50,00,000/- in addition to

     ` 2 crores already deposited in the High Court as submitted by

     learned counsel for the petitioners on 25.7.2012. It was highlighted

     that in this situation, the bonafides of the petitioner-company were

     clear.   Learned counsel for the petitioners relied upon following

<p id="p_4">     4.           Learned counsel for the respondents raised a preliminary

     objection in view of the judgment in Federal Bank Limited's case

     (supra) to contend that the writ petition against private Bank was not

     maintainable. Another preliminary objection was raised with regard to

     delay and laches and prayer for dismissal of the writ petition was

     made on that ground. Refuting the contentions of the learned counsel

     for the petitioners,    it was submitted by learned counsel for the

     respondents that the petitioners did not avail statutory remedy of

     filing objections under <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_16">section 13(3A)</a> of the Act against notice issued

     under <a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_17">Section 13(2)</a> of the SARFAESI Act on 6.6.2009 and, thus, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CWP No.2250 of 2012                                                      5</span>

     same stood waived. Further remedy of appeal under <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_18">Section 17</a> of the

     SARFAESI Act was maintainable against notice issued under <a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_19">Section

     13(4)</a> of SARFAESI Act.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     5.           On merits, it was submitted by learned counsel for the

     respondents that the permission which was originally granted was

     conditional permission which was to be operative and effective only

     on deposit of the entire sale consideration by 22.3.2011 which was

     subsequently extended vide letter dated 18.4.2011. The petitioners

     having failed to honour the same, now under the garb of writ

     jurisdiction cannot claim any relief. It was also submitted that the

     petitioners had a right to redeem the property under <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_20">section 13(8)</a> of

     the Act by discharging the entire amount which was payable to the

     bank. She relied upon judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

     Federal Bank Limited's case (supra) and Satyawati Tandon's case

     (supra) and Madras High Court in <a href="/doc/638347/" id="a_21">Tamil Nadu Industrial Investment

     Corporation Limited v. Chennai Millenium Business Solutions Pvt.

     Limited and another</a>, AIR 2005 Madras 232 in support of her

     submissions. Learned counsel submitted that no statutory right had

     been violated and therefore, no mandamus could be issued.

     perused the record.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     7.           The questions required to be answered           may be

     categorized as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                  a) Whether the present writ petition is competent against

                  entitled to relief as claimed in the writ petition?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">     8.          Examining the issue (a) relating to maintainability of writ

     petition against respondents No.1-Bank, inevitably the reference is

     made to certain provisions of relevant statutes and also principles

     enunciated in the precedents laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court and

     other High Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     9.          Firstly, it may be noticed that Reserve Bank of India is a

                      The secured creditor can take possession of the
                      secured assets of the borrower and transfer the
                      same by way of lease, assignment or sale for
                      realising the secured assets. This is subject to the
                      condition that the right to transfer by way of lease,
                      etc. shall be exercised only where substantial part
                      of the business of the borrower is held as secured
                      debt. If the management of whole or part of the
                      business is severable, then the secured creditor can
                      take over management only of such business of the
                      borrower which is relatable to security. The secured
                      creditor can appoint any person to manage the
                      secured asset, the possession of which has been
                      taken over. The secured creditor can also, by notice
                      in writing, call upon a person who has acquired any
                      of the secured assets from the borrower to pay the
                      money, which may be sufficient to discharge the
                      liability of the borrower. Sub-section (7) of <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_49">Section
                      13</a> lays down that where any action has been taken

                      charges and expenses properly incurred by the
                      secured creditor or any expenses incidental thereto
                      can be recovered from the borrower. The money
                      which is received by the secured creditor is
                      required to be held by him in trust and applied, in
                      the first instance, for such costs, charges and
                      expenses and then in discharge of dues of the
                      secured creditor. Residue of the money is payable
                      to the person entitled thereto according to his rights

                      joint financing of a financial asset by secured

                      the workers of a company in liquidation. The first
                      of these provisos lays down that in the case of a
                      company in liquidation, the amount realised from
                      the sale of secured assets shall be distributed in

                      after the commencement of this Act. If the secured

                 be denied on the         ground that the duty to be enforced is
                 not imposed by the statute. Commenting on the
                 development of this law, Professor De Smith states: "To be
                 enforceable by mandamus a public duty does not
                 necessarily have to be one imposed by statute. It may be
                 sufficient for the duty to have been imposed by charter,
                 common law, custom or even contract." (Judicial Review
                 of Administrative 'Act 4th Ed. p. 540). We share this view.
                 The judicial control over the fast expanding maze of
                 bodies effecting the rights of the people should not be put
                 into water-tight compartment. It should remain flexible to
                 meet    the   requirements      of   variable   circumstances.
                 Mandamus is a very wide remedy which must be easily
                 available 'to reach injustice wherever it is found'.
                 Technicalities should not come in the way of granting that

                      the High Courts to reach injustice wherever it is
                      found. The Constitution designedly used a wide
                      language in describing the nature of the power, the
                      purpose for which and the person or authority against
                      whom it can be exercised. It can issue writs in the
                      nature of prerogative writs as understood in England;
                      but the scope of those writs also is widened by the
                      use of the expression "nature", for the said expression
                      does not equate the writs that can be issued in India
                      with those in England, but only draws an analogy
                      from them. That apart, High Courts can also issue
                      directions, orders or writs other than the prerogative
                      writs. It enables the High Court to mould the reliefs
                      to meet the peculiar and complicated requirements of
                      this country. Any attempt to equate the scope of the
                      power of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_95">Article 226</a> of the
                      Constitution of India with that of the English Courts
                      to issue prerogative writs is to introduce the
                      unnecessary procedural restrictions grown over the
                      years in a comparatively small country like England
                      with a unitary form of Government into a vast
                      country like India functioning under a federal
                      structure. Such a construction defeats the purpose of

<blockquote id="blockquote_45">                      "29. Thus, it can be seen that a writ of mandamus or
                      the remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_96">Article 226</a> is pre-eminently a
                      public law remedy and is not generally available as a
                      remedy against private wrongs. It is used for
                      enforcement of various rights of the public or to
                      compel the public/statutory authorities to discharge
                      their duties and to act within their bounds. It may be
                      used to do justice when there is wrongful exercise of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20"> CWP No.2250 of 2012                                                       21</span>

                      power or a refusal to perform duties. This writ is
                      admirably equipped to serve as a judicial control over
                      administrative actions. This writ could also be issued
                      against any private body or person, specially in view
                      of the words used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_97">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.
                      However, the scope of mandamus is limited to
                      enforcement of public duty. The scope of mandamus
                      is determined by the nature of the duty to be
                      enforced, rather than the identity of the authority
                      against whom it is sought. If the private body is
                      discharging a public function and the denial of any
                      right is in connection with the public duty imposed
                      on such body, the public law remedy can be enforced.
                      The duty cast on the public body may be either
                      statutory or otherwise and the source of such power is
                      immaterial, but, nevertheless, there must be the
                      public law element in such action. Sometimes, it is
                      difficult to distinguish between public law and
                      private law remedies. According to Halsbury's Laws
                      of England 3rd ed. Vol. 30, page-682, "a public
                      authority is a body not necessarily a county council,
                      municipal corporation or other local authority which
                      has public statutory duties to perform and which
                      perform the duties and carries out its transactions for
                      the benefit of the public and not for private profit."
                      There cannot be any general definition of public
                      authority or public action. The facts of each case
                      decide the point."

                and the High Court can issue directions, orders or writs to
                "any person" for the enforcement of any fundamental right
                and "for any other purpose". However, these wide powers
                have been regulated by judicial pronouncements so as to
                avoid interference in matters where alternative remedies
                are available as also where the dispute is purely of a
                private nature having no "public law" element. The
                traditional view was that wherever the State or its
                instrumentality was involved, it was regarded as an issue
                within the domain of public law. Likewise, where
                individuals were at loggerheads, the remedy lay within the
                precincts of private law. This was all very well as long as
                governments stuck to governance and private persons or
                bodies confined their activities to pursuits of a private
                nature. But, when the state entered into the fields of
                commerce, industry and business and when private bodies
                took up public functions and duties, this distinction
                between public law and private law based on the public or
                private character of the institution was no longer clear-cut.
                Therefore, it was no longer safe to rely solely upon the
                character of the institution to decide whether it was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25"> CWP No.2250 of 2012                                                         26</span>

                amenable to writ jurisdiction or not. For instance, where
                there is a dispute of a purely contractual nature (not being
                a statutory contract), it does not matter that one of the
                parties   is   the   "State" or a "statutory      body" or
                "instrumentality of the State", such a matter falls within
                the arena of private law and judicial review under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_116">article
                226</a> would not lie. And, the converse would be equally
                true. In other words, a dispute in which the State is not
                directly involved may yet be a public law issue if a public
                duty or a public function is performed by a private body.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_65">                8. Governments have ventured into the private arena and
                private bodies, likewise, have undertaken public duties or
                public functions. There is a degree of overlap and the
                distinction is no longer clear-cut or watertight. The law
                must be alive to these dynamics. Accordingly, the question
                of maintainability of a writ petition must not be addressed
                from the standpoint of amenability. Everybody is amenable
                to the jurisdiction of the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_117">article 226.</a>
                However, Courts have exercised restraint and they exercise
                these powers only in cases which involve public law.
                Therefore, the "litmus" test for invoking the writ
                jurisdiction is whether the act complained of is in the
                discharge of a public duty or a public function. It matters
                little as to who discharges the public duty or performs the
                public function. And so too, the source of the power to
                discharge or perform such duty or function. Whether the
                person is empowered by statute or some governmental
                order or whether such person arrogates to himself the
                power to perform a public function or discharge a public
                duty, is of no consequence. What is to be seen is whether
                there is an infraction in the discharge of such duty or
                function. If there is, the High Court has power to correct it
                by issuing an order, direction or writ to any person.
                Funding is also not an issue. A privately funded private

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_66">                 "17. At the cost of repetition, we may state that the whole
                 "amenability" issue is misplaced. A body, public or
                 private, cannot be categorised as "amenable" or "not
                 amenable" to writ jurisdiction. The "function" test is the
                 correct one to test maintainability. If a public duty or
                 public function is involved, any body, public or private,
                 qua that duty or function, and limited to that, would be
                 subject to judicial scrutiny under the extraordinary writ
                 jurisdiction of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_119">article 226.</a> The BCCI which is the sole
                 repository of everything cricket in India has attained this
                 "giant" stature through its organisation, skill, the craze for
                 the game in India and last but not the least by the tacit
                 approval of the Government. Its objects are the functions
                 and duties it has arrogated to itself. Many of these are in
                 the nature of public duties and functions. Others may be in
                 the field of private law such as private contracts, internal
                 rules not affecting the public at large etc.,. Therefore,
                 BCCI cannot be said to be beyond the sweep of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_120">article 226</a>
                 in all eventualities for all times to come. That is the
                 certificate that BCCI wants from this court. We are afraid,
                 we cannot grant that. Consequently, this petition cannot be
                 thrown out on the maintainability issue. This does not
                 necessarily mean that the petitioners would be entitled to
                 the orders, directions or writs that they seek. That will
                 have to be examined on merits."

                       amenable to the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_122">Article 226</a> of
                       the Constitution. But in certain circumstances a writ
                       may issue to such private bodies or persons as there
                       may be statutes which need to be complied with by
                       all concerned including the private companies. For
                       example, there are certain legislations like the
                       <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_123">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_124">Minimum Wages Act</a>, the
                       <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_125">Factories Act</a> or for maintaining proper environment
                       say Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_126">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
                       1981 or Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_127">Control of Pollution)
                       Act</a>, 1974 etc. or statutes of the like nature which
                       fasten certain duties and responsibilities statutorily
                       upon such private bodies which they are bound to
                       comply with. If they violate such a statutory
                       provision a writ would certainly be issued for
                       compliance of those provisions. For instance, if a
                       private employer dispense with the service of its

                       employee in violation of the provisions contained
                       under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_128">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in innumerable
                       cases the High Court interfered and have issued the
                       writ to the private bodies and the companies in that
                       regard. But the difficulty in issuing a writ may arise
                       where there may not be any non-compliance or
                       violation of any statutory provision by the private
                       body. In that event a writ may not be issued at all.
                       Other remedies, as may be available, may have to be
                       resorted to."

<p id="p_24">  26.       Another factor which cannot be ignored is that under <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_129">Section

  17</a> of the SARFAESI Act, an appeal lies to the Debt Recovery Tribunal

  against the action of the Bank and against any order passed thereunder,

  an appeal is maintainable under <a href="/doc/11945171/" id="a_130">Section 18</a> of the said Act to Debt

  Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT). An order passed by DRAT is

  amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court. <a href="/doc/6431889/" id="a_131">Section 34</a> of SARFAESI

  Act also has significance in deciding the issue relating to writ jurisdiction

  of this Court. This facet lends different dimension to the controversy

  raised herein. <a href="/doc/6431889/" id="a_132">Section 34</a> bars the jurisdiction of civil courts in matters

  relating to actions where provisions of <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_133">SARFAESI Act</a> have been

  invoked. Constitution guarantees equality and strikes against any

  arbitrary action of an authority. It cannot be said that wherever any

  authority acts in a discriminatory or unreasonable manner, the aggrieved

  party would be without any remedy either by way of civil suit or by

  invoking writ jurisdiction of the High Court. In such circumstances, it

  cannot be held that an action by the Scheduled Bank to which the

  provisions of <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_134">SARFAESI Act</a> are applicable and have been invoked by it,

  it shall be immune from the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of this Court.

</p><p id="p_25">  27.       Now adverting to the cases on which reliance had been placed

  by learned counsel for the respondent-Bank, the question in the Federal

  Bank's case (supra) was      relating to employer-employee dispute for

  which the employee had sought to approach writ Court for exercise of

  extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_135">Article 226</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_136">/227</a> of the Constitution of

  India. It was in those circumstances, it was held that writ petition under

  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_137">Article 226</a> was not maintainable. However, Satyawati Tandon and

  Tamil Nadu Industrial Investment Corporation Limited's cases (supra)

  being different on facts do not advance the case of the respondents.

</p><p id="p_26">  28.       From the above, it is concluded that ordinarily no writ would

  lie against a private Bank. However, where the Bank is a Scheduled

  Bank under <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_138">Reserve Bank of India Act</a>, 1934 and is governed by the

  provisions of <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_139">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949, it shall be amenable to writ

  jurisdiction of this Court where the Scheduled Bank takes recourse to the

  provisions of <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_140">SARFAESI Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_27">  29.       Now taking up the issues arising at Nos.(b) and (c), they can be

  adjudicated together. The petitioners had submitted a proposal for OTS to

  the respondent Bank which was accepted whereby petitioners were

  required to liquidate the outstanding liability by 22.3.2011 which period

  was extended vide letter dated 18.4.2011. The petitioners had deposited

  `50,00,000/- and the balance amount of ` 2 crores was to be deposited to

  complete the requirements of OTS accepted by the Bank. The petitioners

  due to certain personal and practical difficulties could not honour the

  commitment and had sought further extension which, however, was

  declined. On 17.6.2011, father of petitioners No.2 and 3 after illness for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30"> CWP No.2250 of 2012                                                       31</span>

  over a month expired and thereafter the petitioners again approached the

  respondent Bank to pay the balance outstanding amount of `2 crores.

  The bank refused to accept the same. The petitioners in order to show

  their bonafides had presented drafts for ` 2 crores on 26.7.2011 to the

  Bank and had also produced four demand drafts duly revalidated in this

  Court on 10.2.2012 which were deposited with the Registrar (Judicial) of

  this Court. Further on 25.7.2012, learned counsel for the petitioners had

  stated that besides the aforesaid amount of `2 crores, the petitioners were

  prepared to pay additional amount of `50 lakhs. This intention clearly

  depicts the bonafides of the petitioners. The narration of events noticed

  hereinbefore shows that it was due to certain unfortunate exigencies, the

  petitioners could not      honour the terms of the OTS. In such

  circumstances, the action of the respondent-Bank in rejecting the OTS is

  harsh and unjust. It may also be noticed that the petitioners have no other

  remedy available against the rejection of extension of time for OTS

  proposal. This Court in Sat Kartar Ice and General Mills v. Punjab

  Financial Cororation, 2008(1) ISJ Banking 248 had condoned the delay

  in depositing the amount of OTS and directed the Bank to abide by the

  OTS. Similarly in <a href="/doc/1269843/" id="a_141">State Bank of India v. Vijay Kumar</a>, AIR 2007 SC

  1689 again, the delay in depositing the amount which was condoned by

  the High Court was upheld by the Apex Court. Accordingly, in the present

  facts and circumstances after condoning the delay in depositing the

  amount, while allowing the writ petition, it is directed that in case, the

  petitioners deposit another sum of ` 50 lakhs in terms of the statement

  made by their counsel on 25.7.2012 within two months of receipt of a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31"> CWP No.2250 of 2012                                                       32</span>

  certified copy of this order, the OTS shall be implemented. It is further

  directed that the drafts deposited in pursuance to the order of this Court

  dated 10.2.2012 shall be returned to the petitioners, who after getting

  them revalidated, shall deposit the same with the bank within the

  aforesaid period for getting the OTS implemented.
