                                    ...

Date of Order ::     26th November 2008.

         HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE DINESH MAHESHWARI

Mr. N.L.Joshi, for the petitioner.
Mr. B.L.Choudhary, for the respondents.
                                 .....

BY THE COURT:</pre>

<p id="p_1">         These two writ petitions were heard together for having

been preferred by the defendant against the same order dated

26.07.2006 as passed by the Civil Judge (Junior Division)

Rajgarh, District Churu in Civil Suit No.36/2006 whereby the

application for amendment of the plaint as moved by the

plaintiffs-respondents has been allowed and an application

moved by the petitioner for rejection of plaint has been

disallowed; and are taken up for disposal by this common

order.
</p>
<p id="p_2">         The respondents-plaintiffs Paramveer Singh and Bhani

Singh have filed a suit for mandatory and perpetual injunction

raising complaint against establishment of a brick kiln by the

petitioner-defendant No.1 Smt.Prem Kanwar while joining the

State of Rajasthan through the Collector, Churu, the Project

Officer, District Industries Centre, Churu, the Director,

Pollution Control Board, Bichhwal, Bikaner, the Mining

Engineer, Mines &amp; Geology Department, Bikaner and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>

Superintending Engineer, Apani Yojana, Churu as the

defendants Nos. 2 to 6 respectively. The plaintiffs averred in

the plaint that the petitioner-defendant No.1 intended to

establish a brick kiln on an agricultural land comprised in

khasra No.652/632 situated at village Chainpura Bada, Tehsil

Rajgarh District Churu; that the kiln was required to be

established only after obtaining the licence from the defendant

No.3, the permission from the defendant No.4, and the land

use conversion order from the defendant No.2. It has been

alleged that the kiln was sought to be established only at

distance of 500 metres from the abadi of the village Chainpura

Bada and under the rules, permission to establish such a kiln

cannot be given within 1.5 kms. of the abadi area. The

plaintiffs have further stated various circumstances wherefor

the kiln would result in causing pollution, inconvenience and

injury to them and other villagers and have alleged that its

establishment at the given place would be dangerous for the

inhabitants of the village. The plaintiffs have also averred that

the petitioner-defendant No.1 having political clout has

prevailed upon the defendants Nos. 2 to 6 to issue necessary

licence, certificate and conversion orders and the defendants

had illegally extended the permission for establishing the

offending brick kiln. The plaintiffs have further averred that

despite requests, the defendants were not refraining from

establishing the said brick kiln and if commissioned, it would
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 3</span>

cause serious inconvenience and injury to the plaintiffs and

other villagers; and have sought perpetual and mandatory

injunctions for preventing establishment and functioning of the

disputed brick kiln.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      It appears that in this suit, an application for temporary

injunction   was   also   moved     by   the   plaintiffs   and   a

Commissioner inspected the site and made his report on

22.06.2006, inter alia, to the effect that the disputed brick kiln

was found commissioned and functional. The petitioner-

defendant No.1 thereafter moved an application under Order

VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure ('CPC') in the suit

(Annex.3 in CWP No.4276/2006) with the submissions that the

offices of the defendants Nos.2, 3, and 6 were situated at

different places in District Churu whereas the offices of

defendants Nos.4 and 5 were situated at different places in

Bikaner and the defendant No.1 was the resident of village

Chainpura Bada Tehsil Rajgarh; hence, according to the

petitioner, for the defendants being situated at different places,

the plaintiffs were not having a joint cause of action against

them and the plaint was required to be rejected on this count

alone. It was further submitted that all the proceedings related

to issuance of licence for the disputed kiln have either taken

place or were to take place at Bikaner and hence, the suit was

not of the jurisdiction of the Court at Rajgarh. The petitioner

further submitted that the main relief in the suit was for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                4</span>

preventing commissioning of the disputed kiln and the plaint

was presented on 19.06.2006, whereas it was clear from the

report of the Commissioner as made on 22.06.2006 that the

kiln had already been established and commissioned and for

this reason also, the plaint was required to be rejected. The

petitioner submitted yet further that the requisite conversion

order was issued on 29.03.2006 and kiln was established in

accordance with the rules; and the plaint was required to be

required because plaintiffs have not challenged the order of

conversion in appropriate proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      The plaintiffs, while resisting the aforesaid application

moved by the petitioner under Order VII Rule 11 CPC and

while maintaining that the plaint was not liable to be rejected,

moved an application under Order VI Rule 17 CPC (Annex.3 in

CWP No.4275/2006) seeking to amend the plaint.              The

plaintiffs submitted in this application for amendment that at

the time of presentation of the plaint, the defendant had

obtained the conversion order and provisional licence for

establishing the kiln but the plaintiffs were not aware of such

documents; that after filing of the suit, the defendant No.1

commissioned the kiln with hectic efforts before site inspection

by the Commissioner; that the order regarding the land

conversion was noticed by the defendants only after the

averments were made to that effect in the application under

Order VII Rule 11 CPC; and that in the given circumstances, it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5</span>

had become necessary for them to seek amendment of the

plaint. The plaintiffs sought amendment of the plaint so as to

incorporate the averments that the defendant-petitioner got

issued the order for land use conversion while using her

influence and such an order was inconsequential being wholly

illegal.   The plaintiffs further sought permission to take the

averments that the defendants had illegally commissioned the

disputed kiln that was likely to cause injury and loss to the

plaintiffs; and to seek the relief that by way of perpetual

injunction, the defendants be required to close down the

disputed kiln and to refrain from doing anything that might

have adverse effect on the health of the plaintiffs and other

villagers.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       The learned Trial Court in its impugned order dated

26.07.2006 took up the aforesaid application for amendment

for consideration at the first and observed that the plaintiffs

intended to amend the plaint so as to incorporate such facts

that were not in their knowledge at the time of filing of the suit

and did not agree with the submissions of the petitioner that

the amendment was likely to change the nature of the suit.

The learned Trial Court was also of the opinion that          the

amendment was necessary for determination of the real

questions in controversy and there had been subsequent

events after filing of the suit inasmuch as, prima facie, the

disputed kiln was not functional at the time of filing of the suit
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                6</span>

but was found commissioned as per the Commissioner's

report.   The learned Trial Court, accordingly, allowed the

application and permitted the amendment prayed for. The

learned Trial Court thereafter proceeded to reject the

application moved by the petitioner under Order VII Rule 11

CPC with the observations that situs of the defendants and

accrual of cause of action against them had already been

explained by the plaintiffs and the plaint was not liable to be

rejected on the submission as made by the petitioner. The

learned Trial Court also observed that the disputed kiln had

been established within its jurisdiction and otherwise mixed

questions of law and facts were involved that would be

determined after evidence; but on the facts as stated by the

petitioner-defendant No.1, the plaint could not be rejected

under Order VII Rule 11 CPC. The order so passed by the

learned Trial Court on 26.07.2006 has been challenged by

way of these separate writ petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      In CWP No.4275/2006, while challenging the order

allowing the application for amendment, learned counsel for

the petitioner has referred to the plaint averments and

strenuously contended that as per such averments, all the

facts were in the knowledge of the plaintiffs and when they

omitted to take all the requisite averments, the amendment

could not have been allowed so as to change the cause of

action. Learned counsel also contended that by allowing the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 7</span>

amendment, nature of the suit would change and, therefore,

amendment could not have been allowed. While challenging

the order as made on the application under Order VII Rule 11

CPC in CWP No.4276/2006, learned counsel contended that

the plaint discloses no cause of action at all; that the plaintiffs

could have adopted the proceedings before the competent

authorities and hence, per <a href="/doc/1835310/" id="a_1">Section 41(h)</a> of the Specific Relief

Act, the suit was not maintainable. Learned counsel for the

non-petitioners-respondents has duly supported the order

impugned.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having

given thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions and

having perused the material placed on record, this Court is

clearly of opinion that these writ petitions remain bereft of

substance and deserve to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      So far the application for amendment is concerned, the

learned Trial Court has taken note of the rival submissions and

has found that essentially the prayer for amendment was

made with reference to the subsequent events and has found

it proper to allow the amendment for effectual determination of

the questions involved in the case. Having regard to the

overall circumstances of the case, the submissions of the

plaintiffs about themselves being not aware of the specific land

use conversion order could not have been dubbed as false or

incorrect nor the averment as taken in the original plaint could
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 8</span>

have been construed to mean that the plaintiffs were

specifically aware of the land conversion order dated

29.03.2006 as made in favour of the petitioner. Amongst other

aspects, it is noticed from the documents placed by the

petitioner on record that the permission for earth excavation

was issued by the Mining Engineer, Bikaner (Annex.8 in CWP

No.4275/2006) only on 30.06.2006 and the recommendation

of the Regional Officer of the State Pollution Control Board

was issued on 28.07.2006 (Annex. 11 in CWP No. 4275/2006)

with a note to the petitioner that production had been started

and immediately the application for requisite permission be

made and else, necessary proceedings under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Air (Prevention

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 would be adopted.        The plaint was

presented on 19.07.2006. In the overall circumstances of the

case and particularly looking to the subsequent events of

commissioning     of    kiln   and    issuance    of    aforesaid

orders/recommendations only after filing of the suit, the

amendment       was    definitely    necessary    for    effectual

determination of the questions involved in the suit; and the

learned Trial Court cannot be said to have committed any

jurisdictional error in allowing the amendment as prayed for

nor the impugned order discloses any such jurisdictional error

leading to manifest failure of justice so as to warrant

interference under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_3">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                 9</span>

</p><p id="p_9">      So far the application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC is

concerned, the plaint as framed for the purpose of reliefs as

claimed cannot be said to be suffering from the vice of non-

disclosure of cause of action nor the suit could be said to be

barred by any law. Merely because some of the parties to the

suit like the Mining Engineer and the Director of Pollution

Control Board were said to be situated at Bikaner, it cannot be

said that the suit in relation to the cause as stated, raising

grievance against the disputed brick kiln, was not of the

jurisdiction of the Court at Rajgarh where the kiln was

established and commissioned. The argument as made with

reference to <a href="/doc/1436285/" id="a_4">Section 41</a> (h) of <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_5">Specific Relief Act</a> also remains

bereft of substance. Whether in the given case the relief could

have been obtained by way of alternative proceedings and

whether the injunction as prayed for be granted or not, are the

questions to be gone into in the suit but on such submissions,

it cannot be said that any bar of law operates over the trial of

the suit.   The learned Trial Court has rightly rejected the

application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC being bereft of

substance. This apart, in view of the relief as claimed in the

application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, for rejection of the

plaint, the order passed on the said application was obviously

open to revision before this Court. The petitioner has yet

chosen to prefer a writ petition in relation to the said order too.

The petition against such part of the impugned order (CWP
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                       10</span>

     No. 4276/2006) is required to be dismissed on this count also.

     However, and in any event, the petitioner has no case on

     merits for the impugned order does not disclose any

     jurisdictional error so as to call for interference.

</p><p id="p_10">           As a result of the aforesaid, both these writ petitions fail

     and are, therefore, dismissed. No costs.
