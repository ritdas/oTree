<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      The present petition has been filed by an Association of

Dairy farm owners and Sethi Dairy apprehending that even

though, the members of the Association have filed

applications for license from the Jabalpur Municipal

Corporation and consent under the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as

'Act of 1974') and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter referred to as 'Act of 1981'),

but still, the dairy owners were informed that their dairy

farms will be demolished if they do not vacate the same

within 24 hours.
</p><p id="p_6">       Learned counsel for the respondents appearing on

advance notice state that petitioner No.2 has applied for

license and consent and that no action shall be taken against

him till such time the consideration on his request of license

and/or consent under the Act of 1974 and the Act of 1981 is

finalized. It is also pointed out that the Municipal

Corporation and the M.P. State Pollution Control Board will

not take any action against all those Dairy farm owners who

have submitted applications along with requisite fee and the

documents to seek license from the Municipal Corporation

and/or consent under the Act of 1974 and the Act of 1981 on

or before 10.05.2017. But, in the absence of the name and

details of dairy farm owners, who are the members of the

petitioner No.1, no general direction should be issued in

favour of the petitioner No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and

find that in view of the categorical stand of the counsel

appearing for the M.P. State Pollution Control Board and of

the Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur, that no action will be
            taken against the dairy farm owners till such time their

           applications are under consideration, who have applied for

           license under Section 264 of the Madhya Pradesh Municipal

           Corporation Act, 1956 and/or for consent under the Act of

           1974 and the Act of 1981 on or before 10.05.2017. Once any

           decision is taken on applications received, action will be

           taken, but, after giving reasonable time to the dairy farm

           owners to avail their remedy in law.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                In view of the said fact, no further orders are called for

           in the present petition as all those dairy farm owners who

           have applied for license and/or for consent along with the

           requisite fee and the documents, are protected in view of the

           statement made by the counsel appearing for the M.P. State

           Pollution   Control   Board   and      Municipal   Corporation,

           Jabalpur.
