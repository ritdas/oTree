   learned Additional Sessions Judge has affirmed the order of the trial

   Magistrate rejecting his preliminary objection on the maintainability of the

   complaint filed before the jurisdictional criminal court for commission of

   the aforesaid offences on the complaint under <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_6">Section 200</a> of the CrPC

   filed by the respondent Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board (for

   short, 'the Board').
</p>
<p id="p_8">3. On the complaint filed by the respondent Board for violation of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_7">Sections

   21</a> and <a href="/doc/1161070/" id="a_8">22</a> of the Air Act and for commission of the aforesaid offences by

   the petitioner herein who is the Director of M/s. Niros Ispat Pvt. Ltd., the

   petitioner appeared and filed preliminary objection that by virtue of

   <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_9">Section 43</a> of the Air Act, cognizance of the aforesaid offences can be

   taken either by the Board or by any officer authorised in this behalf by it,

   but, in the instant case, the Regional Officer of the Board has been

   authorised by the Chairman of the Board by order dated 11-9-2002 to

   file complaint against the petitioner, as such, such a complaint is not

   maintainable and is hit by <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_10">Section 43(1)(a)</a> of the Air Act.        The said

   objection was rejected by the learned trial Magistrate and in revision filed

   by the petitioner, the revisional Court has affirmed that order and

   dismissed the revision. Calling in question that order, the instant petition

   has been preferred in which return has been filed by respondents No.1 &amp;

   2 Board supporting the order taking cognizance stating inter alia that

   subsequently, the Board by order dated 22-12-2007 (Annexure R-1) has

   authorised the Regional Officer of the Board to file complaint against the

   petitioner, therefore, the defect, if any, stands cured and the complaint as

   filed and cognizance taken is maintainable.

     would submit that <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_11">Section 43</a> of the Air Act is mandatory and no court

     shall take cognizance of the offence under the said Act except on the

     complaint made by the Board or any officer authorised in this behalf by it.

     Admittedly, in the present case, the Regional Officer of the Board was not

     authorised by the Board constituted under <a href="/doc/1966744/" id="a_12">Section 4</a> of the Air Act and

     the complaint was filed by the Regional Officer authorised by the

     Chairman of the Board vide order dated 11-9-2002 (Annexure A-4),

     therefore, the complaint is hit by <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_13">Section 43(1)(a)</a> of the Air Act. Mr.

     Mishra, learned counsel, relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in

     the matter of <a href="/doc/144974741/" id="a_14">P. Pramila and others v. State of Karnataka and another</a> 1 to

     buttress his submission. Therefore, the impugned order be set aside and

     the complaint be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">  5. Mr. Animesh Tiwari, learned counsel appearing for respondents No.1 &amp;

     2, would submit that subsequently, after filing of complaint, by order

     dated 22-12-2007, the Board has authorised the Regional Officer to file

     complaint against the petitioner which has been filed as Annexure R-1,

     therefore, the legal defect, if any, in authorisation has been rectified. He

     would alternatively submit that if ultimately, the complaint is quashed,

     liberty be granted to the respondent Board to file complaint in accordance

     with law.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      4</span>

   43 of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_16">Air Act</a> which states as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">         "43. Cognizance of offences.--(1) No court shall take
         cognizance of any offence under this Act except on a
         complaint made by--

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             (a) a Board or any officer authorised in this behalf by it; or

             authorised as aforesaid,

         and no court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">               (2) Where a complaint has been made under clause (b)
         of sub-section (1), the Board shall, on demand by such person,

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                Provided that the Board may refuse to make any such
         report available to such person if the same is, in its opinion,

</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">8. A careful perusal of the aforesaid provision would show that the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_17">Air Act</a>

   has given statutory power of giving sanction to the Board and the criminal

   court would take cognizance of the complaint filed by the Board or any

   officer authorised in this behalf by the Board. The Court would not take

   cognizance of the offence if the complaint is filed of any offence of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_18">Air

   Act</a> except on the complaint filed by the Board or any officer authorised

   in this behalf by the Board as such, the provision contained in <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_19">Section

   43(1)(a)</a> of the Air Act is mandatory in nature.
</p>
<p id="p_15">9. <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_20">Section 43</a> of the Air Act came to be considered by their Lordships of the

   Supreme Court in P. Pramila (supra) in which their Lordships have held

   that by virtue of <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_21">Section 43</a> of the Air Act, proceeding can be initiated by

   the Board or by any officer authorised by the Board and further held that

   the complaint filed by the Regional Officer having been authorised by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                        5</span>

    Chairman of the Board is illegal holding that the delegated power cannot

    be further delegated. It has been observed as under: -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">          "8. <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_22">Section 43</a> of the Air Act has already been extracted
          hereinabove. It is apparent therefrom, that Courts would take
          cognizance of complaints filed by the Board, or any officer
          authorised by the Board, in that behalf.                     The
          notification/resolution dated 29-3-1989 indicates, that the
          officer authorised was the Chairman of the Board. The Board
          could delegate the above power to the Chairman of the Board,
          because <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_23">Section 43(1)</a> of the Air Act, authorised the Board to
          do so. In that view of the matter, either the Board or the
          Chairman of the Board could have filed the complaints in terms
          of the mandate contained in <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_24">Section 43(1)</a> of the Air Act.
          The power to file the complaint could not be exercised by any
          other authority/officer. Under the principle of 'delegatus not
          potest delegare', the delegatee (the Chairman of the Board)
          could not have further delegated the authority vested in him,
          except by a clear mandate of law. <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_25">Section 43</a> of the Air Act
          vested the authority, to file complaints with the Board. <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_26">Section
          43</a> aforementioned, also authorised the Board to delegate the
          above authority to any "officer authorised in this behalf by it".
          The "officer authorised in this behalf" was not authorised by
          the provisions of <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_27">Section 43</a> of the Air Act, or by any other
          provision thereof, to further delegate, the authority to file
          complaints. The Chairman of the Board, therefore, had no
          authority to delegate the power to file complaints, to any other
          authority, for taking cognizance of offences under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_28">Air Act</a>.
          It is apparent, that the determination to initiate action against
          the appellants, and other similarly placed persons, against
          whom action was proposed to be taken, by the Chairman of
          the Board, vide his order dated 4-4-2006, was not in
          consonance with law. Annexure P-11, appended to Criminal
          Appeal No.152/2012 reveals, that the complaint was filed,
          and the proceedings were initiated before the Judicial
          Magistrate, First Class-II, Karwar, by the Regional Officer
          (Deputy Environmental Officer) Sri Gopalakrishna B.
          Sanatangi, in his capacity as a complainant. The Regional
          Officer (Deputy Environmental Officer) Sri Gopalakrishna B.
          Sanatangi, had no jurisdiction to prefer such complaints.
          Accordingly, we are of the view, that the aforestated
          complaints dated 28-4-2006 are liable to be set aside, on the
          instant technical ground itself. Ordered accordingly."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">10. Reverting to the facts of the case in the light of the provisions contained in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                              6</span>

           <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_29">Section 43</a> of the Air Act and the principle of law laid down by their

           Lordships of the Supreme Court in P. Pramila (supra), it is quite vivid that

           in the instant case, by order dated 11-9-2002 (Annexure A-4), the

           Chairman of the Board authorised all the Regional Officers of the Board

           including respondent No.2 herein to file complaint under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_30">Air Act</a> and

           accordingly, complaint for offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1296808/" id="a_31">Sections 37</a> and <a href="/doc/506633/" id="a_32">40</a>

           of the Air Act was filed on 26-6-2007 against the petitioner. Thus, it is

           quite clear that the complaint as filed was not filed either by the Board or

           by any officer authorised by the Board. The Regional Officer of the Board

           who was an officer having been authorised by the Chairman of the Board

           had filed the impugned complaint and therefore such an authorisation is

           clearly hit by <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_33">Section 43(1)(a)</a> of the Air Act and also in the teeth of the

           principles of law rendered by the Supreme Court in P. Pramila (supra).

           Accordingly, the impugned order dated 23-9-2019 passed by the 1 st

           Additional Sessions Judge, Durg, in Criminal Revision No.191/2019 and

           the order of the trial Magistrate dated 14-5-2019 passed by the Judicial

           Magistrate First Class, Durg in Criminal Complaint Case No.3659/2007
