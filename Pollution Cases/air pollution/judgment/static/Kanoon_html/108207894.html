</pre>
<p id="p_1">         MANMOHAN, J: (Oral)

</p><p id="p_2">        1.     Present writ petition has been filed seeking a direction to
        respondent no. 1-DPCC to refund Rs. 39,54,900/- to the petitioner
        along with interest @18% p.a. from the date of deposit till its
        realisation.
</p><p id="p_3">        2.     The admitted facts are that the petitioner has been running a
        Hotel in the name and style of M/s. Silver Ferns Hotel since 1993.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">       W.P.(C) No.5114/2016                                         Page 1 of 6</span>
<p id="p_4">  3.     On 30th April, 2013 petitioner was served with a show cause
 notices under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_1">Sections 33(A)</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of
 Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short „Act, 1974) and <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_3">Section 31(A)</a> of Air
 (Prevention Control of Pollution) Act, 1981(for short „Act 1981‟)
 wherein the following serious deficiencies were pointed out:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       1. Unit was found in operation and engaged in hotel activity with
          40 rooms.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       2. ETP not installed for waste water discharge from the hotel.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       3. No consent obtained from DPCC (CTE&amp;CTO).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       4. Unit is having one boiler.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5"> 4.     On 25th June, 2013, petitioner received a modified direction to
 install adequate effluent treatment plant to treat the effluent and submit
 effluent analysis report. Petitioner was further directed to submit an
 application for consent under the Act, 1974 as well as the Act, 1981.
</p><p id="p_6"> 5.     It is the case of the petitioner that under the threat of imminent
 closure and penal actions, it filed an application dated 19th August,
 2013 with a demand draft of Rs.41 lakhs as condonation fee with
 respondent no. 1 under protest seeking consent to operate. It is the case
 of the petitioner that it was liable to pay Rs. 46,000/- only as per the
 previous fee structure.
</p><p id="p_7"> 6.     Learned counsel for petitioner states that the Act, 1974 and Act,
 1981 do not authorise the respondent no.1 to levy penalty/fine in the
 garb of condonation fee retrospectively at an exorbitant rate of
 Rs.2,00,000/- per annum from the date of establishment of Hotel.
</p><p id="p_8"> 7.     On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1, who
 appears on advance notice, submits that the present writ petition is not
 maintainable as the petitioner has solely prayed for refund of money.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) No.5114/2016                                          Page 2 of 6</span>
<p id="p_9">  He points out that there is no challenge to the fee structure or to the
 revised fee schedule of respondent no.1.
</p><p id="p_10"> 8.      Learned counsel for respondent no.1 further submits that the
 present writ petition is not maintainable as the petitioner has not
 approached this Court with clean hands inasmuch as the petitioner had
 been running its Hotel without obtaining a "consent to establish" and
 "consent to operate" and without installation of any anti-pollution
 equipment for the last twenty years.
</p><p id="p_11"> 9.      In rejoinder, learned counsel for the petitioner states that by way
 of grounds, she has challenged the fee schedule as well as the
 jurisdiction of respondent no.1 to increase the fee. She further states
 that the petitioner should not be penalised for innocent non-compliance
 of laws. Since the counsel for the petitioner heavily relies on paragraph
 16.13 of the writ petition, the same is reproduced hereinbelow in its
 entirety:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       " 16.13. Because the petitioner had always been very keen to
       follow the law, and has been following all the instructions as
       issued by the authorities from time to time, although it is the
       established principal that ignorance of law is no excuse, still
       before a person is being held liable for any of the violations,
       there must be adequate warning or knowledge about the
       statutory compliance, if for any reason, the petitioner failed to
       follow any ofthe govt. regulations, the innocent non-compliance
       should not be confronted with the undue enrichment of the
       respondent no.1 and the maxim is also there to protect the
       ignorant "Lex security ignorant"(law assists the ignorant)."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12"> 10.     Learned counsel for the petitioner also relies upon the judgment
 of the Division Bench of this Court in Delhi Pollution Control
 Committee Vs. Splendor Landbase Ltd., LPA No.895/2010.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C) No.5114/2016                                           Page 3 of 6</span>
<p id="p_13">  11.    Having heard the learned counsel for parties, this Court is of the
 opinion that a writ petition solely praying for refund of money against
 the State is not maintainable.      In Suganmal Vs. State of Madhya
 Pradesh, AIR 1965 SC 1740, the Supreme Court has held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       "6. On the first point, we are of opinion that though the High
       Courts have power to pass any appropriate order in the
       exercise of the powers conferred under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article 226</a> of the
       Constitution, such a petition solely praying for the issue of a
       writ of mandamus directing the State to refund the money is
       not ordinarily maintainable for the simple reason that a claim
       for such a refund can always be made in a suit against the
       authority which had illegally collected the money as a tax. We
       have been referred to cases in which orders had been issued
       directing the State to refund taxes illegally collected, but all
       such cases had been those in which the petitions challenged
       the validity of the assessment and for consequential relief for
       the return of the tax illegally collected. We have not been
       referred to any case in which the Courts were moved by a
       petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> simply for the purpose of obtaining
       refund of money due from the State on account of its having
       made illegal exactions. We do not consider it proper to extend
       the principle justifying the consequential order directing the
       refund of amounts illegally realised, when the order under
       which the amounts had been collected has been set aside, to
       cases in which only order for the refund of money are sought.
       The parties had the right to question the illegal assessment
       orders on the ground of their illegality or unconstitutionality
       and therefore could take action under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> for the
       protection of their fundamental right, and the courts, on
       setting aside the assessment orders, excerised their
       jurisdiction in proper circumstances to order the
       consequential relief for the refund of the tax illegally realised.
       We do not find any good reason to extend this principle and
       therefore hold that no petition for the issue of a writ of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C) No.5114/2016                                            Page 4 of 6</span>
        mandamus will be normally entertained for the purpose of
       merely ordering a refund of money to the return of which the
       petitioner claims a right.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                       xxx        xxx           xxx

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       9. We, therefore, hold that normally petitions solely praying
       for the refund of money against the State by a writ of
       mandamus are not to be entertained. The aggrieved party has
       the right of going to the civil Court for claiming the amount
       and it is open to the State to raise all possible defences to the
       claim, defences which cannot, in most cases be appropriately
       raised and considered in the exercise of writ jurisdiction."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14"> 12.    Neither in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. &amp; Ors. Vs. Union of India &amp;
 Ors., (1997) 5 SCC 536 nor in Delhi Pollution Control Committee
 (supra), the said judgment of the Supreme Court has been overruled. It
 is pertinent to mention that in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. &amp; Ors. (supra)
 the Supreme Court dealt with an issue under Excise and <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_7">Customs Act</a>,
 whereas the Division Bench judgment in Delhi Pollution Control
 Committee (supra) dealt with the power and jurisdiction of DPCC to
 levy penalties under the Act, 1974 and the Act, 1981 and not with
 regard to legality and validity of fee schedule - which arises in the
 present case. This Court also finds that there is no prayer in the writ
 petition to strike down the revised fee schedule. Consequently, no
 relief with regard to the fee schedule can be granted to the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_15"> 13.    At this stage, learned counsel for the petitioner wishes to amend
 the writ petition. However, this Court is of the opinion that the present
 writ petition is liable to be dismissed on another ground also inasmuch
 as the petitioner has not approached this Court with clean hands as it
 had been polluting the city for the last twenty years i.e. from 1993 to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C) No.5114/2016                                           Page 5 of 6</span>
  2013.     During this period, neither a "consent to establish" nor a
 "consent to operate" had been obtained by the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_16"> 14.     To say that the lapse on the part of the petitioner was an innocent
 non-compliance is to trivialise a statutory provision which has a direct
 and vital impact on the life of the citizens of this city. Since a very
 important and salutary provision of the environmental law has not been
 complied with by the petitioner for nearly twenty years, this Court is of
 the view that the petitioner‟s writ petition cannot be entertained by this
 Court in exercise of equitable jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> of the
 Constitution.
</p><p id="p_17"> 15.     Accordingly, the present writ petition is dismissed.
