     5.4   At the time of pre-bid meeting, the petitioner was informed and
           explained about the statutory requirement under which, the
           condition under challenge, is necessary condition of tender.
     5.5   Petitioner has not obtained requisite expertise / qualification to
           deal with hazardous waste and at the time of pre-bid meeting,
           they were aware of the conditions and by that time, they could
           have obtained the necessary approvals from the Gujarat
           Pollution Control Board, but the petitioner have not obtained
           the same. Therefore, petitioner is not eligible for the work and
           they cannot challenge the terms and conditions of the NIC,
           which has been drafted in compliance with statutory
           requirement.

       by respondent Corporation and denied the contentions raised by

</p><p id="p_40">7.     Heard Mr. Chirag K. Sukhwani, learned advocate for the
       petitioner company and Mr. Kunan Naik, learned advocate for
       respondents ONGC. The respective advocates were permitted to
       file their written submissions, which are taken on record.
</p>
<p id="p_41">8.     Mr. C.K. Sukhwani, learned advocate for the petitioner has mainly
       contended as under :
</p>
<p id="p_42">     8.1   It was contended that the terms and conditions of the eligibility
           criteria of the work are unreasonable, arbitrary, actuated by
           malice and tailor-made to suit the DETOX/ SEPPL Company
           Limited and exclude the petitioner from participating in the bid.
           In support of this contention, the reliance is placed on the
           decision in case of United India Periodicals Pvt. Ltd Vs.
           M/s. M&amp;N Publication Ltd and others, reported in (1993) 1
           SCC p.446, wherein, it was observed that if the decision
           influenced by extraneous, irrelevant consideration, would
           vitiate the decision and the discretion of authorities is not
           absolute and must be governed by some norms and
           procedure in public interest and for public good.
</p>

<p id="p_43">     8.2   It is further contended that the petitioner company having all
           necessary eligibility and has experience in the field of
           hazardous waste management having team of experience
           engineers with all necessary infrastructure and have executed
           lot of similar work with PSUs company like GAIL, IOCL. The
           other PSU companies had followed the technical eligibility bid
           criteria suggested at the pre-bidding meeting.
     8.3   It was further contended that the petitioner company having
           fundamental right to carry the business guaranteed by the
           Constitution of India and by alleged BEC of the NIC, the right
           of the petitioner has been infringed on account of impugned

               eligibility criteria, which required modification to the extent
               making others eligible so that there will be fair competition and
               in larger public interest the tender process becomes more
               competitive.
</p><p id="p_44">     8.4       It was further contended that the eligibility criteria are not in
               compliance with relevant guideliens issued by the Central
               Vigilance Commission (for short 'CVC') in relation to the
               tender process.
</p><p id="p_45">     8.5       Mr. Sukhwani, learned advocate for the petitioner has invited
               our attention to the bid documents filed by the petitioner
               Company with other PSUs like GAIL, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>L, IOCL, GSPC,
               NTPC, BERL and emphasis that all the PSUs have been
               following the CVC guidelines and having similar conditions for
               eligibility criteria which have been suggested at the time of
               pre-bidding meeting. Thus, the action of the respondent
               Corporation while fixing the terms and conditions of eligibility
               criteria for the work is seems to be arbitrary, discriminatory,
               illegal and not adhering to the CVC guidelines and against the
               public interest, required to be amend suitably in larger public
               interest.

<p id="p_52">10.   On the above premise, learned advocate for the petitioner prays
      that the petition be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_53">11.   On the other hand, Shri Kunan Naik, learned advocate appearing
      for the respondent Corporation ONGC raised the following
      contentions:
</p>

<p id="p_54">  11.1 It was contended that the Court may not interfere with the Bid
            Evolution Criteria unless and until it is arbitrary, unreasonable
            and discriminatory and scope of judicial review would be
            limited to examine the decision making process on the ground
            of malafide or an act of nepotism to favour particular bid. It
            was further contended that the terms of invitation to tender
            are not open to judicial scrutiny, the same being in the realm
            of contract and the respondent Corporation have a free hand
            in setting the terms of the tender and court cannot strike down
            the terms of tender prescribed by the Government because it
            feels that some other terms of the tender would have been
            framed wiser or logical. On the factual aspect, contention was
            raised that the work in question involves highly technical and
            methodological work such as lifting of sludge from sludge beds
            of effluent treatment plants, packing and loading of sludge as
            per Gujarat Pollution Control Board prescribed procedure,
            transportation of sludge and disposal thereof by the approved
            TSDF operator. After came into force Rules 2016, framed
            under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">Environment Protection Act</a> and the guidelines
            issued by the Pollution Control Board, it is mandatory for the

     respondent Corporation to obtain membership of common
     TSDF site for the disposal of waste and the occupier of the
     unit shall have to obtain membership of active TSDF site.
     Thus, the impugned eligibility criteria having been incorporated
     on account of statutory provision. Therefore, in absence of any
     proof of malafide, arbitrariness, or unreasonableness, the
     eligibility criteria cannot be examined or amend under the
     power of judicial review. In support of this submission, learned
     counsel for the respondent heavily relied on the decisions
     rendered by this Court and Supreme Court in case of (i) Gold
     Stone Infratech Limited Vs. State of Gujarat, reported in
     (2018) SCC On-line 262. (ii) Director of Education and
     others Vs. Educom Datamatics Ltd, reported in (2004) 4
     SCC 19, (iii) Central Coal Fields Ltd Vs. SLL - SMN (Joint
     Venture Consortium), reported in (2016) 8 SCC 622, (iv)
     Municipal Corporation, Ujjain and others Vs. BVG India
     Limited and others, reported in (2018) 5 SCC 462.
</p>
<p id="p_55">11.2 It was further contended by learned advocate Mr. Kunan Naik
     that the notice inviting tender being a highly technical matter,
     may not offer large participation considering requirement high
     priority qualification and high level expertise. Therefore, the
     petitioner company without acquiring such eligibility, challenge
     for removal of eligibility criteria, which is statutory in nature, is
     not permissible in eye of law.
</p>

<p id="p_56">11.3 It was further contended that the allegation of favouritism
     being made by the petitioner against the respondent
     Corporation, alleging that the eligibility criteria having been
     drafted to favour the certain entities like DETOX/ SEPPL
     group. On this issue it was submitted that the petition is liable

         to be dismissed for non-joinder of necessary parties like
         DETOX/SEPPL group. There is no material to substantiate
         the eligibility criteria contained in the NIC are tailor made suit
         to the said group.
</p>

<p id="p_57">  11.4    It was further submitted by the learned advocate Mr. Kunan
         Naik that the petitioner has no locus to file present petition as
         the company has no even submitted the tender bid.
</p>

<p id="p_58">  11.5 It was further submitted by the learned advocate for
         respondent Corporation that at the time of pre-bidding
         conference, the petitioner company was informed and
         explained that the eligibility and experience criteria have been
         framed to cater the ONGC requirement rather than any
         particular capability or lack of any bidder and detailed reply to
         the query raised during pre-bid conference of the subject
         tender has been uploaded in the ONGC tender site. In view of
         this, rather taking remedial recourses, the petitioner company
         did not take prompt action and on this ground of inordinate
         delay, the petition require to be dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_59">  11.6 It was further submitted by learned advocate Mr. Kunan Naik,
         for the respondent     that the subject NIT for treatment and
         disposal of hazardous and other waste is a highly complex
         contract which demands specialized skill as provided under
         the Rules 2016. Therefore, the CVC guidelines, as contended
         by the petitioner having not applicable to the present case.
</p>

<p id="p_60">12.   Making the above submissions, Shri Kunan Naik, learned
      advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent has tried to
      justify the eligibility criteria of the NIC of which the petitioner is
      aggrieved and seeks to modify and/or amend.

</p><p id="p_62">13.   No further and other submissions / contentions / grounds have
      been raised by the learned advocates for the respective parties.
</p>
<p id="p_63">14.   We have considered oral as well as written submissions
      advanced by learned advocates for respective parties and have
      perused the records carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_64">15.   The scope of judicial review in award of contract has been
      defined by the Supreme Court in various decisions on which the
      reliance has been placed by the petitioner as well as
      respondents. The ultimate conclusion culled out from the
      decisions of the Supreme Court is that the High Court can
      interfere in the contractual matter when the action of the
      tendering authority is found to be malicious, discriminatory for the
      process adopted or decision made is so arbitrary and irrational
      that the court can say the decision is such that no responsible
      authority reasonably and in accordance with relevant law could
      have reached. It has also been held that when the public interest
      is affected, the Court can also interfere with the contractual
      matter.
</p>

<p id="p_65">16.   In the present case, the challenge is the terms and conditions of
      the NIC , more particularly, called as Bid Eligibility Criteria
      B.1.2.0. The petitioner company had suggested what should be
      the technical eligibility criteria and requested to rewrite or amend
      or modification of the same by issuing corrigendum. It is also the
      grievance of the petitioner that the said conditions were drafted to
      exclude the petitioner company and to favour the other group,
      consequently the eligibility criteria being arbitrary, unreasonable,
      actuated by malice and discriminatory.

      raised before the Supreme Court in case of Michigan

      administrative discretion to decide the matters on the one hand,
      and the need to remedy any unfairness on the other, and
      observed:

            reviews the manner in which the decision was made.
            (3) The court does not have the expertise to correct the
            administrative decision. If a review of the administrative
            decision is permitted it will be substituting its own
            decision, without the necessary expertise, which itself
            may be fallible.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">            (4) The terms of the invitation to tender cannot be open to
            judicial scrutiny because the invitation to tender is in the
            realm of contract. ... (5) The Government must have
            freedom of contract. In other words, a fair play in the joints
            is a necessary concomitant for an administrative body
            functioning in an administrative sphere or quasi-
            administrative sphere. However, the decision must not
            only be tested by the application of Wednesbury principle
            of reasonableness (including its other facts pointed out

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">       "15. While the discretion to change the policy in exercise
       of the executive power, when not trammelled by any
       statute or rule is wide enough, what is imperative and
       implicit in terms of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_9">Article 14</a> is that a change in policy
       must be made fairly and should not give the impression
       that it was so done arbitrarily or by any ulterior criteria.
       The wide sweep of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_10">Article 14</a> and the requirement of
       every State action qualifying for its validity on this
       touchstone irrespective of the field of activity of the State
       is an accepted tenet. The basic requirement of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_11">Article
       14</a> is fairness in action by the State, and non-arbitrariness
       in essence and substance is the heartbeat of fair play.
       Actions are amenable, in the panorama of judicial review
       only to the extent that the State must act validly for a
       discernible reason, not whimsically for any ulterior
       purpose. The meaning and true import and concept of
       arbitrariness is more easily visualized than precisely
       defined. A question whether the impugned action is
       arbitrary or not is to be ultimately answered on the facts
       and circumstances of a given case. A basic and obvious
       test to apply in such cases is to see whether there is any
       discernible principle emerging from the impugned action
       and if so, does it really satisfy the test of reasonableness.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">       16. Where a particular mode is prescribed for doing an act
       and there is no impediment in adopting the procedure, the
       deviation to act in a different manner which does not
       disclose any discernible principle which is reasonable
       itself shall be labelled as arbitrary. Every State action
       must be informed by reason and it follows that an act
       uninformed by reason is per se arbitrary.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">       22. If the State acts within the bounds of reasonableness,
       it would be legitimate to take into consideration the

       above, the ultimate test is whether on the touchstone of
       reasonableness the policy decision comes out unscathed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">       23. Reasonableness of restriction is to be determined in
       an objective manner and from the standpoint of interests
       of the general public and not from the standpoint of the
       interests of persons upon whom the restrictions have
       been imposed or upon abstract consideration. A
       restriction cannot be said to be unreasonable merely
       because in a given case, it operates harshly. In
       determining whether there is any unfairness involved; the
       nature of the right alleged to have been infringed, the
       underlying purpose of the restriction imposed, the extent
       and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby,
       the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing
       condition at the relevant time, enter into judicial verdict.
       The reasonableness of the legitimate expectation has to
       be determined with respect to the circumstances relating
       to the trade or business in question. Canalisation of a
       particular business in favour of even a specified individual
       is reasonable where the interests of the country are
       concerned or where the business affects the economy of
       the country.

main grievance of the appellant therein was that all notices
inviting tenders (NITs) which were issued by various State
Governments, contained conditions which were tailored to favour
companies having foreign collaboration. Their further grievance
was that the tender conditions were discriminatory as per <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_19">Article
14</a> of the Constitution and were being aimed at excluding
indigenous manufacturers from the tender process. It was also
contended that in all the cases, the work of supply of high
security registration plates for all existing vehicles and new
vehicles was being entrusted to a single licence plates
manufacturer in a State or a region and for a long period of 15
years thus creating monopoly in favour of selected bidders to the
complete exclusion of all others in the field.
</p>
<p id="p_73">16)    The further contention advanced therein was that creation
of monopoly in favour of a few parties having connection with
foreign concerns is violative of the fundamental right of trade
under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_20">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and discriminatory under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_21">Article 14</a> of the
Constitution. It was also pointed out that in the name of
implementing the amended Rule 50 of the Motor Vehicles Rules,
1989, the States are imposing conditions in the tender that would
take away the existing rights of the manufacturers of plates in
India.
</p>
<p id="p_74">17)     On the condition laid down for prescribed minimum
turnover of business, the challenge made on behalf of the
petitioners therein was that fixing such high turnover for such a
new business is only for the purpose of advancing the business
interests of a group of companies having foreign links and
support. It is impossible for any indigenous manufacturer of
security plates to have a turnover of approximately 12.5 crores
from the high security registration plates which were sought to
be introduced in India for the first time and the implementation of
the project has not yet started in any of the States.

read with the Statutory Order of 2001 leaves it to the discretion
of the State concerned to even choose a single manufacturer for
the entire State or more than one manufacturer regionwise. It
was pointed out that such a selection cannot be said to confer
any monopoly right by the State on any private individual or
concern. He further pointed out that the tender conditions were
formulated taking into account the public interest consideration
and aspects of high security.
</p>
<p id="p_76">19) While considering the above submissions, the three- Judge
Bench held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">       "38. In the matter of formulating conditions of a tender
       document and awarding a contract of the nature of
       ensuring supply of high security registration plates,
       greater latitude is required to be conceded to the State
       authorities. Unless the action of tendering authority is
       found to be malicious and a misuse of its statutory
       powers, tender conditions are unassailable. On intensive
       examination of tender conditions, we do not find that they
       violate the equality clause under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_23">Article 14</a> or encroach
       on fundamental rights of the class of intending tenderers
       under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_24">Article 19</a> of the Constitution. On the basis of the
       submissions made on behalf of the Union and State
       authorities and the justification shown for the terms of the
       impugned tender conditions, we do not find that the
       clauses requiring experience in the field of supplying
       registration plates in foreign countries and the quantum of
       business turnover are intended only to keep indigenous
       manufacturers out of the field. It is explained that on the
       date of formulation of scheme in Rule 50 and issuance of
       guidelines thereunder by the Central Government, there
       were not many indigenous manufacturers in India with
       technical and financial capability to undertake the job of
       supply of such high dimension, on a long-term basis and
       in a manner to ensure safety and security which is the
       prime object to be achieved by the introduction of new
       sophisticated registration plates.</blockquote>
<p id="p_77">       39. The notice inviting tender is open to response by all
       and even if one single manufacturer is ultimately selected
       for a region or State, it cannot be said that the State has
       created a monopoly of business in favour of a private
       party. Rule 50 permits the RTOs concerned themselves to
       implement the policy or to get it implemented through a

    selected approved manufacturer.
</p><p id="p_78">    40. Selecting one manufacturer through a process of
    open competition is not creation of any monopoly, as
    contended, in violation of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_25">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the
    Constitution read with clause (6) of the said article. As is
    sought to be pointed out, the implementation involves
    large network of operations of highly sophisticated
    materials. The manufacturer has to have embossing
    stations within the premises of the RTO. He has to
    maintain the data of each plate which he would be getting
    from his main unit. It has to be cross-checked by the RTO
    data. There has to be a server in the RTO's office which is
    linked with all RTOs in each State and thereon linked to
    the whole nation. Maintenance of the record by one and
    supervision over its activity would be simpler for the State
    if there is one manufacturer instead of multi-
    manufacturers as suppliers. The actual operation of the
    scheme through the RTOs in their premises would get
    complicated and confused if multi-manufacturers are
    involved. That would also seriously impair the high
    security concept in affixation of new plates on the
    vehicles. If there is a single manufacturer he can be
    forced to go and serve rural areas with thin vehicular
    population and less volume of business. Multi-
    manufacturers might concentrate only on urban areas
    with higher vehicular population.
</p><p id="p_79">    43. Certain preconditions or qualifications for tenders
    have to be laid down to ensure that the contractor has the
    capacity and the resources to successfully execute the
    work. <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_26">Article 14</a> of the Constitution prohibits the
    Government from arbitrarily choosing a contractor at its
    will and pleasure. It has to act reasonably, fairly and in
    public interest in awarding contract. At the same time, no
    person can claim a fundamental right to carry on business
    with the Government. All that he can claim is that in
    competing for the contract, he should not be unfairly
    treated and discriminated, to the detriment of public
    interest. Undisputedly, the legal position which has been
    firmly established from various decisions of this Court,
    cited at the Bar (supra) is that government contracts are
    highly valuable assets and the court should be prepared
    to enforce standards of fairness on the Government in its
    dealings with tenderers and contractors.

</p><p id="p_81">       44. The grievance that the terms of notice inviting tenders
       in the present case virtually create a monopoly in favour
       of parties having foreign collaborations, is without
       substance. Selection of a competent contractor for
       assigning job of supply of a sophisticated article through
       an open-tender procedure, is not an act of creating
       monopoly, as is sought to be suggested on behalf of the
       petitioners. What has been argued is that the terms of the
       notices inviting tenders deliberately exclude domestic
       manufacturers and new entrepreneurs in the field. In the
       absence of any indication from the record that the terms
       and conditions were tailor-made to promote parties with
       foreign collaborations and to exclude indigenous
       manufacturers, judicial interference is uncalled for." After
       observing so, this Court dismissed all the writ petitions
       directly filed in this Court and transferred to this Court
       from the High Courts.

<blockquote id="blockquote_24">       "22. Judicial review of administrative action is intended to
       prevent arbitrariness, irrationality, unreasonableness, bias
       and mala fides. Its purpose is to check whether choice or
       decision is made "lawfully" and not to check whether
       choice or decision is "sound". When the power of judicial
       review is invoked in matters relating to tenders or award
       of contracts, certain special features should be borne in
       mind. A contract is a commercial transaction. Evaluating
       tenders and awarding contracts are essentially
       commercial functions. Principles of equity and natural
       justice stay at a distance. If the decision relating to award
       of contract is bona fide and is in public interest, courts will
       not, in exercise of power of judicial review, interfere even
       if a procedural aberration or error in assessment or
       prejudice to a tenderer, is made out. The power of judicial
       review will not be permitted to be invoked to protect
       private interest at the cost of public interest, or to decide
       contractual disputes. The tenderer or contractor with a
       grievance can always seek damages in a civil court.

      who possessed requisite qualifications and experience to execute
      the work as per the State Pollution Control Board guidelines.
      Record further indicates that both the entities are completely
      different and have submitted their bid for group A and group B as

<p id="p_88">22.   In view of the aforesaid rule and considering the bid eligibility
      criteria, it is mandatorily for the respondent Corporation to obtain
      "consent to establish" under the Rules 2016. The record indicates
      that on 14.11.2017, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board has

          C/SCA/7493/2020                                      ORDER



      issued the "consent to establish" to the respondent Corporation
      which mandates to obtain membership of TSDF site for disposal
      of hazardous waste as per the Rules 2016.         The authorization
      issued by the authority has been produced by the respondent
      Corporation (Annexure-R1, R2 at page156 to 162) . It is also
      mandatory for the unit like successful bidder to obtain
      membership of active TSDF site for disposal of ETP sludge. The
      successful bidder in the present case has obtained the same,
      which is produced at Annexure - R3 page-163 to 176. Therefore,
      necessary permission for disposal of ETP sludge is granted only
      to certain qualified agencies who meet with the requirements and
      qualifications as prescribed by the authority under the statutory
      provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_89">23.   In view of the above, we are of the considered opinion that the
      bidder should have Gujarat Pollution Control Board authorized
      site. It is statutory requirement for corporation respondent as well
      as all the occupiers who are in possession or generate hazardous
      or other waste. Therefore the criteria as prescribed for the work
      shows that bidder should be a TSDF which is approved by the
      competent authority on the date of opening technical bid and
      further the bidder should have facility for direct land feeling /
      direct sludge disposal for participating in group A or facility for
      incinerable sludge disposal for participating in Group B and
      should submit a copy of GPCB approval along with the
      documents to comply the eligibility criteria clause B.1.2.0


</p><p id="p_90">24.   It is admitted facts that the petitioner was aware of the condition
      of the NIT and had an opportunity to obtain the necessary
      approvals as required by the authority. However, the petitioner
      did not obtain the same, meaning thereby, the petitioner company

      do not possess the requisite expertise / qualification to execute
      the work mentioned in the NIT. The statutory requirement
      required to be followed by the respondent corporation for
      inclusion of the impugned clauses having not been denied by the
      petitioner in the rejoinder affidavit. Even the petitioner company
      failed to produce the necessary authorization of the GPCB to
      show their eligibility to execute the work.
</p>
<p id="p_91">25.   In view of the above, we are unable to accept the contention that
      the inclusion of the impugned clauses in the bid document is
      malafide, arbitrary, unreasonable and is motivated to ensure that
      the DETOX / SEPPL group is qualified to submit bids pursuant to
      the NIC floated by the respondent Corporation.
</p>
<p id="p_92">26.   The other contention raised by the petitioner Company is that
      other PSUs such as NTPC, GAIL, IOCL, BPRL and GSPC are
      not following such eligibility criteria. On this issue, the respondent
      ONGC Corporation has clarified in the affidavit in reply and draw
      the attention of this Court towards the bid documents of other
      PSUs produced by the petitioner Company, wherein, it appears
      that the GAIL, IOCL, BPRL floated the tender in the year 2019,
      2015 and 2018 respectively, wherein, the same eligibility criteria
      having been prescribed. Thus, after Rules 2016 came into force,
      it is mandatory to obtain consent authorisation as provided under
      Rule 6(1) and 6(2). Therefore, the other PSU company have the
      Bid Evaluation Criteria, as suggested by the petitioner Company,
      is misconceived. Even otherwise, the bid eligibility criteria as
      prescribed in the NIT (Clause B.1.2.0, 2.1(a)), which is statutory
      requirement and accordingly, by inclusion of the same clause in
      the NIT,     the action of the respondent Corporation cannot be
      termed as discriminatory and arbitrary.

</p><p id="p_94">27.   The third contention raised by the petitioner Company that the
      respondent Corporation has not followed the Central Vigilance
      Guidelines, while formulating the technical criteria, as a result, the
      scope of healthy competition having been minimized. We have
      carefully examined the copy of the Office Memorandum dated
      17.12.2002 (Annexure - F, page-126). The Office Memorandum
      relates to procurement of computer hardware, DG sets, Civil and
      Electrical works. It is specifically mentioned therein that while
      framing the pre-qualification criteria the end purpose should be
      kept in mind. We have noticed the scope of the NIT in the present
      case, which is related to disposal of hazardous waste generated
      in various effluent plants of respondent Corporation, regulated
      and    managed       under    the     Hazardous   and    Other        Waste
      (Management and Transboudary Movement ) Rules 2016,
      notified under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_38">Environment Protection Act</a>. The respondent
      Corporation as rightly stated in the affidavit in reply that the CVC
      guidelines are not applicable to the subject NIT which involved
      highly technical and specialized skill job of treatment and disposal
      of hazardous waste. Therefore, considering the statutory
      provisions as discussed above as well as the scope of the work,
      the respondent Corporation has formulated the impugned bid, so
      as to avoid environmental pollution, huge adverse impact on the
      public at large. Thus, the bid clause under challenge has been
      rightly included in the bid documents by the respondent
      Corporation and CVC guidelines are not applicable to the subject
      NIT. Even otherwise, it appears from the record that except the
      petitioner Company the other 10 companies were technically
      qualified for the execution of work of the subject NIT, which
      fortifies the contention of the petitioner Company that the
      impugned bid clause having been incorporated with an intention
      to exclude the petitioner Company from the bid and no other


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                   Page 28 of 30</span>

      company would become eligible and/or to fulfil the technical
      specifications. Thus, we are convinced that the impugned bid
      criteria so far eligibility clause incorporated as per the statutory
      requirement and for proper disposal of hazardous waste.
</p>
<p id="p_95">28.   It is required to be noted that the petitioner company has not
      submitted its bid and the company is alien to the contract and
      there is no any privity of contract. The challenge is to bid clause
      of the NIT. Considering the dispute raised by the petitioner
      Company, it is purely a private dispute and no any public interest
      affected on account of inclusion of impugned bid clause.
      Therefore, the petitioner Company failed to make out the case
      that the action of the respondent Corporation for inclusion of
      impugned bid is contrary to public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_96">             It is also required to be noted that the condition in question
      provided by the authority justifies the rational of such a condition,
      as the work involved requires strict compliance of disposal of
      hazardous waste as provided by the guidelines and therefore, the
      provision of such condition on the contrary enhances the element
      of public utility and ensures disposal of hazardous waste in a
      proper organized manner.
</p>
<p id="p_97">29.   In view of the aforesaid discussion and reasons thereof, we are of
      the view that action of respondent Corporation for the inclusion of
      bid clause B.1.2.0, 2.1(a) in the NIT is neither malafide, arbitrary
      nor intended to favour anybody and the same does not adversely
      affect the public interest, consequently, the petitioner has
      miserably failed to make out the case for interference in exercise
      of extra ordinary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_39">Article 226</a> of Constitution of
      India and we accordingly, hold that there is no reason to exercise
      the power of judicial review in the present matter, as the petitioner
