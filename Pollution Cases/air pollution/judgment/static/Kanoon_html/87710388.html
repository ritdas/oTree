          rarest of rare cases; that the court will not be justified in

           embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or

           genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the

           FIR or the complaint and that the extraordinary or

           inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on

           the court to act according to its whim or caprice."

           The point in controversy in the present case is only to the

effect as to whether the petitioners had got the Environment

Clearance Certificate before starting the work or thereafter.

</p><p id="p_18">           In the present case, notification was issued by the

Ministry of Environment and Forests dated 14.9.2006, whereby the

company was required to get the prior Environment Clearance

Certificate before starting its business. Admittedly, the petitioners

were granted the clearance certificate by the Government of India,

Ministry of Environment and Forests vide letter dated 12.6.2007

(Annexure P-6).
</p>
<p id="p_19">           A perusal of the complaint (Annexure P-12) reveals that

the complaint was filed against the petitioners and others on the

allegation that the petitioners had started new construction project

without obtaining any prior Environment Clearance Certificate from

the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The complaint has been

filed in January, 2009, whereas, the clearance certificate has been

issued to the petitioners on 12.6.2007 (Annexure P-6). In the

complaint it has not been mentioned as to when the construction

project was started by the company. A perusal of the complaint also

reveals that the allegations levelled therein are vague as it has not

been stated therein as to how the offence under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_18">Section 15</a> of the Act

had been committed by the petitioner -company. The case of the

petitioners is that they had started the construction on 20.6.2007,

after they were granted clearance by the Ministry of Environment and

Forests, Government of India. In these circumstances, it cannot be

said that the company had started its work before the issuance of the

Environment Clearance Certificate. On the day the complaint was

filed, the petitioner-company was already having the Environment

Clearance Certificate. In these circumstances, the continuation of the

criminal proceedings against the petitioners would be nothing but an

abuse of process of law.

<p id="p_20">           Accordingly, the present petition is allowed. Complaint

No.17/ 2009 dated 9.1.2009 (Annexure P-12) under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_19">Section 15</a> of the

Act as well as summoning order dated 25.8.2009 (Annexure P-13)

and all the subsequent proceedings arising therefrom, are quashed.
