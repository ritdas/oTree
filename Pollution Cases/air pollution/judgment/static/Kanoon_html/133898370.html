<div class="doc_title">Harsh Vardhan Bajaj vs The State Of Jharkhand on 18 November, 2019</div><pre id="pre_1">      IN THE HIGH COURT OF JHARKHAND AT RANCHI
                            Cr.M.P No. 1011 of 2019
      Harsh Vardhan Bajaj                             .... .... Petitioner(s).
                                  Versus
      1. The State of Jharkhand

</p><p id="p_3">      FOR THE PETITIONER(S) : Mr. Pandey Neeraj Rai, Advocate

</p><p id="p_5">04/18.11.2019
        Heard Counsel for the parties.
</p><p id="p_6">       By filing this Criminal Miscellaneous Petition, petitioner has challenged
the order taking cognizance dated 9.9.2014 in C.G. No. 17 of 2014 whereby
cognizance of offence has been taken under <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_1">Section 16</a> of the Pollution (Control)
Act, 1986.
</p><p id="p_7">       Counsel for the petitioner submits that from perusal of the impugned order
it would be quite clear that without application of mind the cognizance order has
been passed. He submits that there is no legislation known as the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Pollution Control
Act</a>. He further submits that even if for the sake of argument the act is taken to be
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986 then also cognizance cannot be taken under 16
of the said Act. He submit that this clearly shows that cognizance order is
mechanical without there being any application of mind.
</p><p id="p_8">       Learned APP tries to support the order by taking this Court through the
complaint petition saying that offence has been made out but so far as question of
taking cognizance is concerned he admits that no cognizance can be taken under
<a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_4">Section 16</a> of the Pollution (Control) Act. He further submits that there is no
legislation as <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Pollution Control Act</a>, 1986.
</p><p id="p_9">        I have gone through the impugned order. It is necessary to quote the entire
impugned order:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             " The case Record put up for hearing on the point of
       cognizance.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              Case record, it is perusal from it transpires that the
       offence cum it's petition has been submitted in this case against
       the accused 1) Harsh Vardhan Bajaj, Director, Resident of
       Parijat, OPP. Shivajee Maidan Daltonganj and 2) M/s Prijat
       Mining Industrial (I) Pvt. Ltd. For the offence u/s:- 15 of

                 <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_6">Environment (Protection) Act</a> 1986, and 19 of the same nature of
                 offence.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                        Perusal of the case record further transpires that there is
                 a prima facie case is made out against the aforesaid accused and
                 its company Pvt. Ltd. For the offence u/s :- 16 of the Environment
                 ( <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_7">Protection) Act</a>, 1986. Therefore cognizance is taken for the
                 offence u/s:- 16 of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Pollution (Control) Act</a>, 1986 against the
                 aforesaid accused persons and its company Pvt. Ltd. Issue
                 summons to the accused and put up on 24.2.2015."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                From the impugned order, it is clear that a complaint was filed under
         <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_9">Section 15</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court found that
         offence under <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_10">Section 16</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 is made out
         and thereafter cognizance under <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_11">Section 16</a> of the Pollution (Control) Act. 1986
         has been taken. There are two glaring errors in the impugned order. First one is
         that <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_12">Section 16</a> of the Environment Protection Act relates to offence committed
         by the company. It is not a penal provision. It only enables attraction of vecarious
         liability upon every person, who at the time of offence, was directly in-charge of
         the company and was responsible to the company. Thus no cognizance can be
         taken under <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_13">Section 16</a> of the Environment Protection Act. Secondly, I find that
         cognizance has been taken under <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_14">Section 16</a> of the Pollution (Control) Act, 1986.
         There is no <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Pollution (Control) Act</a>, 1986 which is in existence. Thus, the
         cognizance has been taken in absolutely mechanical manner without application
         of mind. Thus, the impugned order dated 9.9.2014 is set aside and the instant
         Criminal Miscellaneous Petition stands allowed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                The matter is remanded to the court below for passing a fresh order in
         accordance with law after going through the specific provision of law. Only on
         this ground alone, the order taking cognizance is set aside and I have not
         entertained the other points which has been raised by the petitioner.</blockquote>
