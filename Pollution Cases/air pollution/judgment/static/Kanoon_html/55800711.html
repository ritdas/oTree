                           JUDGMENT
</pre>


<p id="p_1">(Judgement Delivered by the Bench)


      This appeal is referred from the order dated 8.6.2012 made by the
Goa State Pollution control Board, the respondent herein:
</p>
<p id="p_2">        Short facts necessary for the disposal of this appeal can be stated
thus. The appellant is an industry carrying on business in production of
Fumigant (a class of Insecticide) Methyl Bromide which is used for
quarantine and pre-shipment fumigation. The respondent board by its
order dated 7.8.2008 bearing No. 6/1629/08-PCB/3231 granted consent
to the appellant to operate under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of
Pollution) Act</a> 1974 and under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of
Pollution) Act</a> 1981. Pursuant to the said order the appellant established
its unit and operate the same in accordance with the law.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       While so, on 12.4.2012 an accident had taken place and the
Member Secretary of the respondent who is presently residing at house
No. 70/1 AraboDhargalPernemGoa which is situated near to the
appellant's industry personally visited the place and challenged that he
would not allow the appellant to run the industry because it would cause
damage to the health of his family members. Following the same a show-
cause notice dated 21.5.2012 was served on the appellant on 23.5.2012
and only one day was given to the appellant to put forth his explanation.
Accordingly the appellant appeared on 25.5.2012 and placed his
explanation. On the day certain directions were issued to the appellant by
the Chairman of the respondent as well as by the scientist and a period of
one month was granted to comply with the said direction.The appellant
also made all his sincere effort to follow the said directions passed by the
respondent. While the respondent was granted one month time to
comply with the directions the respondent, to the utmost shock of the
appellant, the respondenthas made the impugned order on 8.6.2012. The
proceedings dated 25.5.2012was attended by the Member Secretary also
and hence in order to wreck vengeance the Member Secretary of the
respondent was in a hurry to pass the impugned order within 15 days.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                    Page 2 of 14</span>
<p id="p_4"> While 15 days notice should have been given, the show-cause notice
dated 21.5.2012 was served on the appellant on 23.5.2012 calling upon
him to appear and show cause on the hearing dated 25.5.2012 and thus it
was a case of denial of reasonable opportunity of being heard. Apart from
that, after granting a month's time on 8.6.2012 thepassing of the
impugned order would clearly indicate the personal grudge of the
Member Secretary of the respondent and also illegal. The principle raw
material liquid Bromide was imported from USA and the same material
worth Rs.4crores is kept in the port of Nhavasheva since last three
months. The appellant who is supplying methyl bromide to Government
Agencies could not supply as per the purchase orders. The appellant, a
small scale industry has bank loans amounting to Rs. 11.60 crores and the
appellant is not in a position to pay back its debt. The unit has 80-100
people employed in Goa and 200 household peoples who are dependent
on the unit directly or indirectly remained unemployed.Hence the
impugned order has got to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       The respondent has filed an affidavit in reply containing
thefollowing averments. The appellant has made certain allegations
against the officials which were personal in nature and hence the
respondent can neither admit nor deny the same. The appellant cannot
take advantage of those uncontroverted allegations. By the Order bearing
No. 5/2127/02-PCB/3232 dated 7.8.2008 and bearing No. 6/1629/08-
PCB/3231 dated 7.8.2008 consent to operate was granted to the appellant
by Goa State Pollution Control Board under the Water (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974 And under Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of
Pollution) Act</a> 1981, respectively. An accident occurred at the appellant's
unit on 12.4.2012 during which there was a leakage of bromine gas which
was highly toxic in nature. During the course of an inspection conducted
by the board officials on 25.4.2012, it was observed that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">    1. Empty barrels used to store Sulphuric acid are stored within
       the unit's premises.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">    2. The plant is maintained very badly and urgent repairs are
       needed         particularly     with       respect        to
       replacement/modification/alteration to the rusted portion of
       the plants structure and framework.
</blockquote>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                  Page 3 of 14</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     3. Effluent Treatment Plant has not been set up to effectively
       treat and dispose off waste water from the reactor of the
       unit.</blockquote>

<p id="p_6">       It was also observed that the area/soil adjacent to the unit
particularly at the point the raw material was transferred from the tankers
to the holding tank of the unit has been contaminated. The officials of the
board came to know that the appellanthad not complied with the
conditions as stipulated in the consent to operate order issued to the unit
by the Board and the unit was very poorly maintained leading to the
leakage of Bromine Gas from the unit. Thus from the state of affairs it was
clear that there was need for remediation of the vicinity around the unit
as far as the already contaminated area was concerned. Apart from the
same steps were required to be taken for further safeguarding of the area
in view of the other violations found existing. Hence it became necessary
to issue directions to the appellant in that behalf. In exercise of the
powers under the above enactments the Board by its letter dated
21.5.2012 firstly directed the appellant unit to immediately stop/suspend
the operation of the unit and to remain present before the Chairman of
the Board on 25.5.2012 in order to give its reply on the finding as contents
in the report of inspection and also directed to submit a detailed action
plan and also the measures for remediation. The appellant unit was also
directed to show-cause before the Chairman of the Board as to why the
board should not cancel and withdraw the consent to operate order
issued on 7.8.2008. Thus the letter/order 21.5.2012 consisted of two parts
in respect of the directions for immediate remediation within one month
while the other part was a show-cause notice. The said two parts were
independent of each other and thus the appellant without understanding
the same has come forward to state that though a month's time was
granted for complying with directions the respondent has made an order
even before the end of one month and thus the appellant could not make
out a ground out of the same. While the appellant on receipt of the show-
cause notice dated 21.5.2012 has submitted a reply on 24.5.2012 in
respect of directions of the Board and thus it would be clear that not only
an opportunity of hearing was afforded to the appellant but the same was
also availed by the appellant and hence the appellant cannot be allowed
to state that reasonable opportunity was not given to him. In so far as
hearing on 25.5.2012 was concerned it was only to enable the appellant

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                    Page 4 of 14</span>
 unit to submit its explanation on the findings in inspection report and also
to show cause as to why Board should not cancel and withdraw the
consent order dated 7.8.2008. Thus a requirement to remediate the area
and the show-cause were independent. The Chairman of the Board after
hearing the representative of the appellant has recorded a finding that the
reply submitted by the appellant was unsatisfactory and appellant unit
has committed gross violation of the conditions as contained in the
consent to operate Order dated 7.8.2008 issued by the Board which
thereby resulted in the accident that occurred in the unit on 12.4.2012.
The authority came to the conclusion that due to the said negligence by
the appellant unit the environmental degradation in the vicinity of the
unit has occurred. A reading of the Order would make it clear that with
regard to safe storage of chemical at the site and the remediation of the
degraded area at the site certain directions were issued to the appellant
unit and one month time was granted for remediation of the soil in the
vicinity of the unit. Under the afore stated circumstances and in exercise
of the powers vested in the Board under <a href="/doc/30564828/" id="a_5">Section 27</a> read with <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_6">Section
25</a>/<a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_7">26</a> under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_8">Section 33</a> A of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of
Pollution) Act</a> 1974 and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_10">Section 21</a> read with <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_11">Section 31A</a> of the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981 the Board by its Order
dated 8.6.2012 has cancelled the consent to operate order issued to the
appellant on 7.8.2008 and the appellant was also directed to immediately
stop/suspend the operation of the said unit also to comply with certain
measures.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      The points that arise for consideration in this appeal are:
</p>
<p id="p_8">      1. Whether the impugned order dated 08.06.2012 made by the
         respondent Board has to be set aside for not following the
         principles of natural justice?
</p>
<p id="p_9">      2. Whether the proceedings dated 25.05.2012 and the impugned
         order dated 08.06.2012 were vitiated on the ground that they
         were based on the unfounded show-cause notice as alleged by
         the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      3. To what relief the appellant is entitled?
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                    Page 5 of 14</span>
<p id="p_11">        Advancing the arguments on behalf of the appellant the Learned Sr.
Counsel Mr. Vijay Hansani would submit that the appellant industry is
carrying on business of production of fumigant- methyl bromide out of
which a major part is being exported. The appellant has been supplying
methyl bromide to Government as per the purchase orders. Being a small
scale industry the appellant has raised bank loans in crores of rupees for
carrying on its business at its unit and it has given employment for more
than hundred persons. Following an accident that took place on 12.4.2012
in the unit the Member Secretary of the respondent Pollution Control
Board who is residing in the neighborhood made a personal visit and at
the time he made it out that he would not allow the unit to run at any cost
because it was causing injury to the health of his family members and thus
the personal grudge of the said officer has resulted in the impugned
order. A show-cause notice dated 21.5.2012 was served on the appellant
on 23.5.2012 calling upon him to appear and explain on 25.5.2012 and
thus only one day was given to the appellant to put forth his version
before the Chairman of the respondent though as per law 15 days' notice
should have been given to the appellant by the respondent. The
respondent who appeared on 25.5.2012 placed a hurriedly prepared
explanation along with a request to give him further time to place his full
explanation. Instead the authority has made an impugned order cancelling
the order of consent to operate and thus the impugned order is one made
by the authority in violation of principle of natural justice.
</p>
<p id="p_12">       Added furtherthe Learned Sr. Counsel for the appellant, even at the
time of the hearing on 25.5.2012 certain directions were issued to the
appellant by the Chairman of the respondent to comply with the same
within a period of one month therefrom. It is pertinent to find out that the
granting of a month's time was also incorporated in the last part of the
impugned order. In order to substantiate this content the Learned Sr.
Counsel took the Tribunal to the relevant part of the impugned order.
Having granted one month time to do a needful remediation the
respondent has made the impugned ordervery hastily on 8.6.2012 behind
the back of the appellant. The Learned Sr. Counsel pointed out that the
proceedings dated 25.5.2012, was attended by the Member Secretary
also and thus the order came to be passed in a hurry within 15 days and
this would also speak of the ill-will and grudge of the Member Secretary.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                    Page 6 of 14</span>
<p id="p_13">        The Learned Sr. Counsel would further submitthat following the
directions passed by the Chairman of the respondent on 25.05.2012, the
appellant took sincere efforts to follow the directions. Though it was
brought to the notice of the authority, the impugned order came to be
passed on 8.06.2012, to the utmost shock of the appellant. Pointing to site
inspection report by the board officials and inspection report dated
02.05.2012 (page no. 26-31 of volumeII) a show-cause notice dated
25.05.2012, (page no. 32-35 of volume II) and also the copy of the
impugned order dated 7.08.2008, the Learned Counsel with vigour and
vehemence would urge that the particulars contained in the show-cause
notice dated 21.05.2012, did not have the basis and also unfounded since
the contents of the inspection report dated 25.04.2012 and show-cause
dated 21.05.2012, were different and discrepant and apart from that the
impugned order based on such show-cause notice and passed without
considering the acceptable reply of the appellant dated 24.05.2012,
cannot stand in law and hence it has to be set aside and the appeal has
got to be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        In answer to the above contentions the Learned Counsel for the
respondent Board would submit that it is true that the appellant industry
is carrying on business of production of fumigant-methyl bromide after
getting an order of consent to operate dated 7.8.2008. A site inspection
by the respondent Board officials took place on 25.4.2012 and an
inspection report was submitted on 2.5.2012. Following a show-cause
notice on 25.5.2012 the appellant filed its reply dated 24.5.2012. The
Chairman of the Board in the proceedings dated 25.5.2012 has made the
impugned order after finding the explanation tendered by the appellant
unit was quite unsatisfactory. It is true that the show-cause notice dated
21.5.2012 was issued calling upon the appellant to appear and answer on
25.5.2012. It is well admitted by the appellant that the appellant
submitted its reply on 24.5.2012. The same was well considered in the
proceeding by the respondent Board that took place on 25.5.2012 and the
impugned order was passed. Though the appellant was not given longer
time to tender its explanation, appellant has prepared and placed the
explanation as per the show-cause notice. Having availed the opportunity
by filing the reply and also by participating in the proceeding dated
25.5.2012 now the appellant cannot be allowed to say that no reasonable
opportunity was given and hence it cannot be a ground on which the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                   Page 7 of 14</span>
 impugned order can be assailed. Pointing to the Board proceedings dated
25.5.2012 as found in page no 151-155 in volume II, the Learned Counsel
would urge that the impugned order has two parts. While the first part
was pertaining to the cancellation of consent to operate in view of the
violation of the contents found therein, the second part of the order was
with regard to a safe storage of chemicals at the site and remediation of
the degraded area at the site. The reading of the minutes will make it
apparent that the first part was pertaining to cancellation while the
second part was in respect of the direction for remediation within a
period of one month. While so, the appellant should not be allowed to
state that the respondent Board has granted a month's time in its
proceedings on 25.5.2012 to comply with the directions and even before
the said time interval the Board has hastily passed the impugned order
and hence the said contention of the appellant has to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      In his further submission the Learned Counsel would submit that in
so far as the allegation made by the appellant against the Member
Secretary of the board they do not require any consideration for the
simple reason that he was not added as party. The respondent Board in
the absence of any personal knowledge of the visit by the Member
Secretary or the verbal exchange that took place cannot admit or deny the
same hence the appellant cannot take advantage of the uncontroverted
allegations.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      The Learned Counsel would further submit that there were no
discrepancy between the inspection report submitted by the officials
before the Chairman and contents of the show-cause notice. The show-
cause notice was well founded. The appellant on service of the said show-
cause notice tendered his reply on 24.4.2012 and also participated in the
proceedings. Since the explanation tendered was unsatisfactory and the
Board noticed gross violation of the condition found in the consent order
to operate, the Board in exercise of its power vested has cancelled the
consent order to operate and has also issued direction and thus the
appellant has no ground much less valid ground by which the impugned
order could be set aside and hence the appeal has got to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      The Tribunal paid its anxious consideration on the submission made
on both sides and made a scrutiny of the document available in particular
relied on by the parties.

<p id="p_18">       Admittedly the appellant industry pursuant to the grant of consent
order to operate under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution)
Act</a> 1974 and under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981
commenced and carried on its business of production of fumigant- methyl
bromine. A site inspection of the appellant's unit was made by the
respondent board officials 25.4.2012 and a report in that regard dated
2.5.2012 was submitted before the board. Following the same a show-
cause notice dated 21.5.2012 along with directions under Section 31 (A)
read with <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_15">Section 21</a> (4) of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">Control of the

calling upon the appellant to show-cause why not appellant be directed to
immediately stop/suspend the operation of the unit and remain present
before the Chairman of the board at 11.00 AM on 25.4.2012. On service of
the said notice the appellant submitted its explanation in response to
query raised in said show-cause notice on 24th May, 2012 before the
respondent Board. The respondent Board took the matter for
consideration on 25.5.2012, when it recorded its proceeding of personal
hearing held before Chairman of the respondent Board. During the said
proceeding the representatives of the appellant were also present.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      Inter alia the said proceedings minuted on 25.5.2012 contained the
following.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      "The Chairman stated that the reply and say submitted by the unit in
today's hearing was not satisfactory, particularly as it did not satisfactorily
address the issue pertaining to safe storage of chemicals at the site and
safe remediation of the degraded area at the site. As such the Chairman
directed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     1. All chemicals stored at the unit including raw materials and
        entire stock, raw materials etc. are to be removed from the
        unit premises latest by 31.5.2012 and an undertaking to this
        effect has to be submitted by the unit to this office.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     2. On removal of all the chemicals from the unit and after
        approval by the inspectorate of Factories and Boilers the unit
        is to be sealed.

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      3. The unit is then directed to submit a new detailed
        comprehensive application for obtaining fresh Consent of
        Operate from the Board under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_20">Water Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_21">Air Act</a> and

        also be taken by the Board prior to considering grant of any
        application in the future considering the safety of residents
        and environmental degradation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">    Mr. Connie Fernandes. Scientist "C" of the Board further suggested
    the representative of the unit to submit detailed plan of action on:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">    (a) Mode of disposal of scrapped tankers especially in view of
        possible Bromine (residual) presence.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">    (b) The collection, in sealed, labeled containers storage (in safe

<p id="p_21">       The Chairman further directed the unit to take immediate steps to
remediate the soil in the vicinity of the unit that has been contaminated
due to the flow/discharge of chemicals/effluents from the unit within a
period of one month."
</p>
<p id="p_22">       While the matter stood thus, the order dated 8.6.2012 whereby the
consent to operate order was cancelled along with a direction to the
appellant to immediately stop/suspend the operation of the unit and
comply with certain directions made therein within 7 days therefrom was
made which is the subject matter of challenge in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_23">       The appellant has assailed the impugned order on the ground that
the order was an outcome of the ill-will and grudge of the Member
Secretary of the respondent Board, that the order cannot be sustained
since the respondent Board has violated the principles of natural justice
while passing the order on the said show-cause notice pursuant to which

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                  Page 10 of 14</span>
 the impugned order came to be passed and apart from the inspection
report, the show-cause notice and the impugned order were quite
contrary to each other. It is also the ground of the appellant that after
granting a month's time to comply with directions by taking remedial
measures, the impugned order came to be passed within 15 days
therefrom willalso affect said order. The respondent Board has flatly
denied of the above grounds and that the said order is valid and legal.
</p>
<p id="p_24">       After careful consideration of the contentions put forth and
scrutiny of the documents, the tribunal is of the considered view that the
order of the respondent under challenge cannot be sustained for more
reasons than one. It is not in controversy that an inspection of the
appellant's unit was made on 25.4.2012. It is contented by the respondent
that a report pursuant to inspection was submitted before the Board on
02.05.2012. No material is available to indicate that a copy of the report
was served on the appellant soon after the inspection but given only along
with the show- cause notice. It is true that a show-cause notice dated
21.05.2012 along with the directions was served on the appellant calling
for a reply and also the presence before the Chairman, of the Board.The
said so called show-cause notice was defective on the material aspects
and one which could not be acted upon. Admittedly show-cause notice
was issued on 21.05.2012. It reads "hereby directed to immediately
stop/suspend the operation of your unit at 33/1A. DhargalInsdustrial
Estate, Oppo. RTO Naka, Dhargal, Pernem, Goa and to remain present
before the Chairman of the Board on 25.04.2012 at 11.00 a.m. in order to
submit your say as containedin the enclosed report of inspection..".
Needless to say the day of appearance before the authority to explain the
allegations made in a show-cause notice is a material and vital particularly
in respect of which the addressee should be put on clear notice.
Surprisingly, the show-cause notice dated 21.05.2012 and served on the
appellant on 23.05.2012 has called upon the appellant to appear at 11.00
a.m. on 25.04.2012 before the Chairman of the Board. This cannot be
considered as a mistake but it has to be termed as a defect in the show-
cause notice. While the show-cause notice was served on 23.05.2012 the
appellant has submitted his reply on 24.05.2012 and appeared on
25.05.2012. Thus it would be clear that the appellant was given a day's
time to put forth his reply. Considering the contents of the report the time
granted to the appellant to meet all the allegations was too short and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                   Page 11 of 14</span>
 appellant could not but have prepared the reply hastily and hurriedly and
placed before the authority below. It is also pertinent to note that the
appellant at the end of its reply to the show-cause notice has requested
further time to explain all the points in detail. The authority instead of
granting sufficient time to put forth the reply, gave a day's time to tender
an explanation and it also denied further time despite the request of the
appellant. All the above would indicate the anxiety of the authority below
to pass an order of cancellation of the consent order to operate which was
originally granted in favor of the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_25">        A perusal of the order under challenge will make it abundantly
clear that the reply put forth by the appellant was not considered by the
authority while passing the order. Except making acomment that the reply
placed by the appellant was not satisfactory, the authority had neither
discussed not considered the contents of the reply. While the inspection
was made on 24.04.2012 by the official of the Board, the report was
submitted on 02.05.2012. Though the show-cause notice dated
21.05.2012 was served on appellant on 23.05.2012 and the proceedings
before the Chairman were minuted on 25.05.2012, the impugned order
cancelling the consent to operate order was made only on 08.06.2012. If
really there was any immediate necessity to stop operation of the industry
due to the leakage of bromide gas during inspection from the unit as
found in the show-cause notice, there was no reason for the authority to
wait till 21.05.2012 to issue a show-cause notice. Having given a day's
time to the appellant to submit its reply, the respondent Board has made
an impugned order after an interval of 15 days. The above factual
situation as could be seen from the records would indicate that there was
no immediate need or imminent danger to heath or degradation of
environment. It remains to be stated that pursuant to the directions by
the Member Secretary, the Board officials conducted an inspection on
25.04.2012 in order to ascertain on-site status of the plant activity. After
making the inspection, the Board officials categorically observed that the
unit was not in operation and only maintenance such as painting of the
portion of the plant was in progress and empty barrels were seen. From
the very report it would be quite clear that the appellant unit was not in
operation and the painting work was in progress. Nowhere in the said
report was any indication of pollution made a mention of. If really there
was any act of pollution like gas leakage there was no impediment for the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                   Page 12 of 14</span>
 officials who conducted inspection to state the same. Contrarily, the
inspection report dated 02.05.2012 referred to the gas leakage reported
in newspapers and on inspection the inspection officials reported "the
inspection of protective clothing and safety equipment was carried out. It
was observed that the company was in possession of all required
equipment in working condition.It is also stated therein that there was
wind flow during the same time because of which there was dispersal of
gas in the surrounding area and officials were informed by appellant unit
that the leakage was controlled by using all possible sources and the
problem was resolved. At this juncture it has to be pointed out that the
report dated 02.05.2012 did not speak of any gas leakage or air pollution
or health hazard. Both the inspection report dated 02.05.2012 and the
proceedings dated25.04.2012 do not indicate anything about the gas
leakage or air pollution. The Tribunal is at a loss to understand the basis
for the said show-cause notice stating that there was leakage of bromine
gas from the unit on 12.04.2012 due to the poor maintenance of the unit
and thus the appellant has not complied with the conditions as stipulated
in the consent to operate order issued by the Board. Hence the show-case
notice was not only to be termed as defective but also unfounded. No
doubt all the proceedings which followed the same get vitiated and have
to be declared as unsustainable in law.
</p>
<p id="p_26">       True it is,that someallegations were made against the Member
Secretary of the respondent Board and he was also not added as a party
to these proceedings and hence the contentions put forth by the
appellant side in that regard cannot be considered. But the report made
by the official dated25.04.2012 speaks to the fact that the inspection was
made only on the directions of the Member Secretary. It is not disputed
anywhere that he was also present at the time of the proceedings on
25.05.2012 and it was he who signed the order under challenge.From all
the above it is noticed that the contents of the earlier reports and the
show cause notice were different. The order under challenge has been
made not only not adhering to,and inviolation of principles of natural
justice but also an outcome of non-application of mind. It is quite evident
that the show-cause notice and the pursuant proceedings were prepared
so hurriedly without caring about the contents of the same.The
authorities not exercising the due care made an order with a drastic
decision of closing the industry. In view of the above circumstances and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                  Page 13 of 14</span>
 for the reasons stated above the impugned order has to be set aside and
is set aside accordingly. Appeal is allowed leaving the parties to bear the
costs.
