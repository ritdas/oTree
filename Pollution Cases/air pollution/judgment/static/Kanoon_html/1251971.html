</pre>
<p id="p_1">                                                This writ petition is filed by
a religious institution, Church of God, Purasawakkam, Chennai.  The petitioner
prays for a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to call for the  records  relating
to  the  order  of the second respondent in his letter dated 22.3.2001 and the
order passed by the first respondent in G.O.(D)  No.594,  Housing-cumMunicipal


Administration  Department dated 23.7.2002 to quash the same and to direct the
second respondent to consider the petitioner's application for  regularisation
dated 29.5.2001.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                                2.   The  petitioner  contends
that the petitioner is a registered society under the provisions of  <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_2">Societies
Registration Act</a>,  1860.  The petitioner is engaged in establishment of Health
Care Centres throughout Tamil Nadu and had established 215 Churches  in  Tamil
Nadu.  In  Chennai,  33 Churches are under the control of the petitioner.  The
petitioner is an international organisation devoted to religious service.  The
property in question of an extent of 31295 sq.  ft.    in  plot  No.8  4,  KKR
Majestic Colony  was purchased on 16.9.1994.  The area falls within industrial
and  residential  area  and  the  Church  established  thereunder   has   been
functioning from 1995.  The Church has a fully closed prayer house and prayers
are  being  offered within the four walls of the Church and loud speakers have
been kept inside the premises for audibility to the members within the Church.
While so, the fifth respondent filed Crl.O.P.No.61 of 1998 before  this  Court
praying  for  a direction to the police authorities to take action against the
petitioner alleging that there was noise pollution.   The  petitioner  opposed
the  petition  and contended that they have not fixed any loud speaker outside
the Church and that the complaint itself was motivated.    By  judgment  dated
19.4.1992,  after taking note of the report submitted by the Pollution Control
Board, learned single Judge held that  the  noise  level  was  not  solely  on
account  of  the petitioner's Church but also due to interference of the noise
of the vehicles plying on the high road.  The police authorities were directed
to follow the rules and the directions contained in the judgment of a Division
Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1910096/" id="a_3">Apparao vs.  Government of Tamil Nadu</a>  (1995  WLR  Page
</p><p id="p_3">157).   This Court further directed that if there was loud noise exceeding the
permitted limits, the Church has to be directed to keep the speakers at  lower
level.   The  petitioner  preferred  an  appeal  before  the  Supreme Court in
Criminal Appeal No.732 of 2000 as against the judgment in  Criminal  O.P.No.61
of 1998.   The judgment of this Court was upheld by the Supreme Court by order
dated 30.8.2000 and it was held that the  directions  and  the  guidelines  in
Apparao's  case  and  the  rules  and regulations have to be strictly complied
with.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                                                3.   The  petitioner   further
submits  that they have not violated the permissible noise level till date and
that the prayer meetings are being carried on Sundays between 8.30 A.M.    and
12.30 P.M.   and there has been no complaint either from the Pollution Control
Board, local people or police authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                                                4.    By   proceedings   dated
13.5.1999,  the  petitioner  was  informed  by  the  third respondent that the
construction put up in the plot was in violation of the approved building plan
and that the Government had issued G.O.Ms.No.76 dated 27.2.1999 and  that  the
CMDA   had  also  issued  directions  dated  8.3.1999  for  regularisation  of
constructions already completed.  The petitioner was advised to avail the said
scheme  which  will  be  available  only  till  29.5.1999  and  to  seek   for
regularisation of  the  construction.  Accordingly, the petitioner applied for
regularisation of the existing prayer hall and remitted the requisite  fee  of
Rs.1,700/-  and  a  further  sum  of  Rs.11,150/-  towards regularisation fee.
However, the application was rejected on the ground that the appeal  filed  by
the petitioner  before  the  Supreme Court has been dismissed.  The petitioner
contends that the reason given by the respondent was baseless as the  judgment
in  the Criminal appeal had absolutely no bearing on the application submitted
by the petitioner for regularisation.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                                                5.  Thereupon  an  appeal  was
filed  by  the  petitioner  under  Section  113 (A) of the Tamil Nadu Town and
Country Planning Act, 16.4.2001.  The first respondent without  affording  any
opportunity  to  the  petitioner,  by  a  short  order in G.O.(D) No.594 dated
23.7.2002 dismissed the appeal filed by the petitioner by confirming the order
stated above.  Hence, the above writ petition.
</p>

<p id="p_7">                                                6.  In the  counter  filed  by
the second respondent, the Metropolitan Development Authority, it is contended
that   the   petitioner  had  applied  for  regularisation  on  16.7.1999  for
regularising the construction  of  the  prayer  hall.    The  application  was
rejected  by  the  District  Collector, Tiruvallur dated 17.11.2000, informing
that "No Objection Certificate" could not be processed in view of the judgment
of the Supreme Court in Criminal Appeal No.732 of 2000.  It is further  stated
that  while  disposing  of  Criminal O.P.No.61 of 1998, though directions were
given to the police to take necessary steps to control  the  noise  level,  no
direction  was  given  by  the learned Judge, for regularisation of the prayer
hall.  It is further submitted  that  the  K.K.R.    Majestic  Colony  Welfare
Association  (5th  respondent)  had sent an objection letter dated 15.10.1999,
objecting to  the  regularisation  and  they  have  also  mentioned  that  the
petitioner  was  convicted  by the Criminal Court for misusing the residential
premises at plot No.84 as a place for public worship in contravention  of  the
municipal approval   plan.    Therefore,  the  respondents  had  rejected  the
application for regularisation.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                                                7.  The fifth  respondent  who
had  objected  to  the  processing  of  the  regularisation application of the
petitioner, has also filed a counter contending that the petitioner's  conduct
resulting  in  noise pollution and the change of user as a place were illegal.
The trouble started when the petitioner chose to establish a place of  worship
in  a  purely residential lay out and were causing unwanted nuisance by fixing
cone speakers and amplifiers.  Added to the high volume of noise level already
existing, the  petitioner  constituted  further  nuisance.    The   respondent
Association  was formed for the welfare of the residents and to seek abatement
of the nuisance.  On the failure of the  police  machinery  to  redress  their
grievance, they had approached this Court for giving suitable directions under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_4">Section 482</a>  of  Cr.P.C.  Crl.O.P.No.61 of 1998 was allowed with directions to
the police to follow the guidelines issued by the Division Bench in  Apparao's
case and  to  take  necessary  steps  to  bring  down  the  noise  level.  The
petitioner's appeal to the Supreme Court was also rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                                                8.  The respondent also denies
the contention of the petitioners that the noise level was being kept  at  the
minimum and  permitted level.  In spite of repeated objections, the petitioner
was periodically exceeding the permitted limits and whenever police  complaint
is  given,  on  the  very  next  day  after the police leave the premises, the
petitioner indulges in resuming loud noise level  much  above  the  prohibited
limit.   The  majority of the residents are objecting to the activities of the
petitioner Church.  Within the vicinity  of  the  premises  there  are  houses
belonging  to  Hindus  and  as such, the noisy prayers which are against Hindu
faith, disturb the peace of the  colony.    It  is  also  stated  that  forced
religious  conversions also regularly take place on 15th of August and 26th of
January.  Therefore the decision of  the  CMDA/Government  was  in  the  right
direction  and  was  unbiased,  as  their  decision  was  to  enforce the law.
Therefore the various grounds alleged by the petitioner were not tenable.  The
writ petition was not bona fide.  The petitioner  seeks  to  do  things  in  a
surreptitious way  what  he  cannot  legitimately  do.   Any construction must
conform to the mode of user for which a sanctioned plan has to be issued.  The
plot on which the present place of worship is located is no t  meant  for  the
said purpose.    The petitioner could not have obtained the permission for the
construction if he had correctly indicated the purpose for which the  building
was being constructed.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                                                9.     Mr.R.Gandhi,    learned
Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner contended that the  entire  action
of  the respondents are motivated and impugned order is passed at the instance
of the fifth respondent.  The attitude of the  fifth  respondent  was  one  of
religious extremism and it is unfortunate that the official respondents should
have  succumbed to such illegal pressure without appreciating the scope of the
proceedings which went on appeal before  the  Supreme  Court.    The  Criminal
Original  Petition  filed  before  this  Court by the fifth respondent and the
appeal filed thereon by the petitioner as against the  order  of  this  Court,
related  only  to  alleged  violation  of  the  provisions  relating  to Noise
Pollution Control, in having allegedly exceeded the permitted noise  level  by
using cone  speakers.  The said proceedings related only to the issue of noise
pollution and the directions of this Court in the said context was only  given
to  the  police  officials to take appropriate action to ensure that the noise
level was kept within legal limits.  The proceedings have nothing to  do  with
the regularisation  scheme.    It  was  always  open to the respondents or any
member of the public, to make appropriate  complaint  before  the  police,  if
there was any violation of the noise pollution regulations.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                                                10.   Learned  counsel for the
CMDA contends that considering the objections from the local  people  and  the
judgment  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  Criminal  Appeal No.732 of 2000, it was
decided by the Collector not to issue "No Objection Certificate".    Therefore
in  order to maintain peace and law and order, it was decided not to issue "No
Objection Certificate".
</p>
<p id="p_12">                                                11.     Mr.Kannan,     learned
counsel  for  the  fifth  respondent,  contended very vehemently that the Town
Planning authorities while sanctioning plan or while considering  applications
for  regularisation,  were  also  obliged to look into other complaints by the
local citizens.  Learned counsel  in  particular  refers  to  Rule  7  of  the
Regularisation   Rules  viz.,  G.O.Ms.No.76,  Housing  and  Urban  Development
Department dated 27.2.1999, which is as follows:-
</p><p id="p_13">"(1) The competent authority shall, on receipt of an  application  made  under
rule  3, examine the same with reference to the provisions of the Act or other
laws, for the time being in force and rules and regulations  made  thereunder,
call  for  any  additional details or particulars, if necessary, and decide on
the regularisability of the development.  If it is  found  regularisable,  the
competent  authority  shall  assess  the  regularisation  fee and issue to the
applicant a demand notice for the payment of  regularisation  fee  along  with
other fees and charges normally leviable.
</p><p id="p_14">(2)  On  receipt  of  the demand notice, the applicant is liable to pay to the
competent authority the regularisation fee and  other  charges  within  thirty
days from  the date of communication of the said demand notice.  If payment is
not made within the time stipulated above, it shall attract  interest  at  the
rate of  six  per  cent  per  annum.  If the above said amount is not remitted
within ninety days from the date of receipt of the demand notice  the  deposit
made  under  clause (b) of subrule (3) of rule 3 above, shall be forfeited and
the planning permission shall be refused" (emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_15">                                                12.  Learned counsel refers to
the expression "other laws" and would  contend  that  as  the  petitioner  was
admittedly  violating  the  provisions  under  the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Pollution Control Act</a>s, the
second respondent was  entitled  to  consider  the  same  and  to  reject  the
application on  the said ground.  Therefore, according to the learned counsel,
violation of Pollution Control  regulations  is  also  a  relevant  issue  for
considering   the   sanction   of   planning  permission  or  application  for
regularisation.  Even otherwise, according to the learned  counsel,  the  area
being a residential area, no permission can be granted for locating a place of
worship.   The  petitioners did not disclose the reason for which the hall was
being constructed.  When the object of putting up of the hall was not properly
disclosed as for locating  a  prayer  hall,  it  was  certainly  open  to  the
authorities to refuse the regularisation.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                                                13.    Learned  counsel  would
also strongly urge  that  the  refusal  by  the  second  respondent  to  grant
regularisation  on  the  ground  that  there was noise pollution was a welcome
measure and Town Planning Authorities should perceive  all  issues  which  may
give  rise  to violation of any legal provision and should not feel restricted
only to provisions relating to Town and Country Planning Act or the  Municipal
Laws.   Any  situation  which  may  give rise to serious law and order problem
should also be considered.  Consideration of the said issues were not  outside
the purview  of  the  rules  or  the  power  vested on the respondents.  Noise
pollution is also an issue which should be considered while granting  planning
permission or considering application for regularisation.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                                        14.  I have considered the submissions
of both  sides.  A perusal of the judgment delivered by this Court in Criminal
O.P.No.61 of 1998 filed by the fifth respondent and the judgment in the appeal
by the Supreme Court in Criminal Appeal No.732 of 2000 clearly  disclose  that
the  only  issue which was raised and considered was noise pollution allegedly
created by the petitioner/church.  Following the judgment in  Apparao's  case,
the  learned  Single Judge of this Court held that if the noise created by the
petitioner exceeded the permissible limits, then it has to  be  abated.    The
learned  Judge  also  found  that as per the findings of the Pollution Control
Board, the petitioner alone was not the sole contributor to  the  noise  level
but  there were also other factors such as noise created by vehicles which was
mostly responsible.  In the end, the learned Judge directed strict  compliance
of  the  directions contained in Apparao's case and directed the petitioner to
keep their speakers at a lower level.   On  appeal  also,  the  Supreme  Court
confirmed the  order  of  the  High  Court.    Therefore,  it does not require
repeated emphasis that the only issue dealt with by this Court and the Supreme
Court in the criminal proceedings was the alleged noise pollution  and  it  is
further  more  important  to  bear  in  mind  that all that the petitioner was
directed was to lower the noise level and that the usage of the loud  speakers
and  voice  amplifiers  should  strictly conform to the requirements under the
Madras Town Nuisance Act, 1889 and Noise Pollution  (Regulation  and  Control)
Rules, 2000.    In fact, both the Courts have not restrained or prohibited the
petitioner from using the premises as a prayer hall.    Such  an  issue  never
arose for  consideration.    Therefore  the  stand taken by the respondents is
without any basis and cannot be sustained.  In the impugned order reliance  is
placed  on  the judgments of the Supreme Court and the High Court for refusing
to consider the regularisation  application  while  the  said  judgments  have
nothing to  do  with the application for regularisation.  It is rather strange
that the authorities should have chosen to rely on  the  judgments  as  though
there was a direction to the petitioners to stop their prayer activities or to
reject the application for regularisation.  The only embargo on the petitioner
is  as  regards  the  manner  of  usage  of  the  loud  speakers and the voice
amplifiers.  There is no direction to  the  petitioners  not  to  perform  any
prayers.   The only direction is that in doing so, the petitioner shall comply
with the statutory requirements as aforementioned and the guidelines contained
in Apparao's case.  Therefore, reference to the judgment of the Supreme  Court
for  rejecting  the  application  for  regularisation  is  very  improper  and
discloses total non application of mind.  The respondents appear to have taken
this stand due to pressure from the fifth respondent.

<p id="p_18">                                        15.  Law and order is an issue for the
police to look after as directed by the High Court and the  Supreme  Court  in
the criminal proceedings.  If the kind of objections as in this case are to be
entertained  and  upheld as under the impugned order, sooner we can expect the
already existing communal and religious tensions to grow further in  different
dimensions,  namely different communities/religious organisations indulging in
mutual and baseless objections even for  any  harmless  and  normal  religious
activity or  construction being put up by any religious institution.  If there
is noise pollution, there are specific authorities to deal  with  it  and  the
town  planning  authorities  dealing with building regulations have no role to
play on the said issue.
</p>
<p id="p_19">                                        16.   I  am  unable  to  sustain   the
contentions  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the  fifth  respondent  that  the
expression "Other Laws" in Rule 7 of the  Regularisation  Rules,  1999,  would
take  within  its  meaning  any  and  every  provision  of law and need not be
restricted to Town and Country Planning Act alone (TCP Act).  It  is  needless
to  mention that the rules made under an Act cannot go beyond or over step the
limits of the parent Act itself.  TCP Act 1971 has been enacted to provide for
planning the development and use of rural and urban land in the State and  for
the purposes  connected  therewith.  The Rules made thereunder can also relate
only to those matters or issues which are dealt with under the Act.  The  word
"development" has been defined under <a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_6">Section 2(13)</a> of the Act, as follows:-
"(13)  "development"  means  the  carrying  out  of  all  or  any of the works
contemplated in a regional plan, master plan, detailed development plan  or  a
new  town  development  plan  prepared  under  this Act, and shall include the
carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, or  over
or under land, or the making of any material change the use of any building or
land:
</p><p id="p_20">                Provided  that  for  the  purposes  of this Act, the following
operations or uses of land shall not be deemed to involve development  of  the
land that is to say--
</p><p id="p_21">                (a)   the   carrying  out  of  any  temporary  works  for  the
maintenance, improvement or other alteration  of  any  building,  being  works
which do not materially affect the external appearance of the building;
</p><p id="p_22">                (b)  the  carrying  out  by a local authority of any temporary
works required for the maintenance or improvement of a road, or works  carried
out on land within the boundaries of the road;
</p><p id="p_23">                )   the  carrying  out  by  a  local  authority  or  statutory
undertaker of any temporary works for the purpose of inspecting, repairing  or
renewing  any  sewers,  mains, pipes, cables or other apparatus, including the
breaking open of any street or other land for that purpose;
</p><p id="p_24">                (d) the use of any buidling or other land within the cartilage
of a dwelling house for any purpose incidental to the enjoyment of the welling
house as such; and
</p><p id="p_25">                (e) the use of  any  land  for  the  purpose  of  agriculture,
gardening  or  forestry  (including afforestation) and the use for any purpose
specified in this clause of this proviso of  any  building  occupied  together
with the land so used;"
</p>
<p id="p_26">                                17.   A  perusal of the above quoted provision
would  clearly  show  that  the  Act  is  concerned  only  with  developmental
activities,  viz.,  original  plan,  regional  plan,  master plan and detailed
development plan  and  carrying  out  any  building,  engineering  and  mining
operations  and making any material change in the usage of the building or the
land.  Even in respect of those areas of operations  ,  the  proviso  excludes
temporary  works which do not materially affect the external appearance of the
building.  Therefore, when the scope of the Act  itself  is  narrow  and  well
defined,  the  expression "Other Laws" in the rules, cannot have the effect of
vesting any power on the authority under the Act to  go  beyond  the  Act  and
Rules  and  deal  with  issues  which  do  not  fall  within  their  power  or
jurisdiction.  The expression "Other Laws", is subject to the rule of "Ejusdem
Generis" (of the same kind or nature) and has to be interpreted as limited  to
things  or  issues of the same kind or nature as specified or dealt with under
TCP Act.  There is sufficient indication in the Act itself of the area of  its
application and  what  the  Act  proposes  to regulate.  The issues dealt with
under the Act belong to a class or genus  and  hence  the  authorities  cannot
arrogate  themselves  as  having  the  power  to  implement  and  execute  the
provisions of other Acts like the City Police Act, District Police Act or  the
Rules and  Regulations  framed thereunder or the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Pollution Control Act</a>.  There
are other specified authorities to implement those provisions and take  action
against violations of the said Acts and Rules wherever and whenever complaints
of violations  are  brought  to  their  notice.    Hence  the reason given for
rejecting the application for regularisation is totally irrelevant  disclosing
non-application of mind and beyond the jurisdiction of the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_27">                                        18.   Even  assuming for a moment that
the respondents herein can also require  the  applicant  to  comply  with  the
provisions  relating  to Anti Pollution Act and Regulations, all that could be
done is to grant regularisation, subject to an undertaking being filed by  the
applicant  with  them  to strictly comply with the Anti Pollution Laws and the
directions of the Supreme Court.   As  already  stated,  this  Court  and  the
Supreme   Court   have  only  directed  the  petitioner  to  comply  with  the
requirements under the noise pollution regulations strictly.   The  petitioner
had not  been  restrained from carrying on with their activity.  Therefore the
impugned order over reaches and is violative of the order of  this  Court  and
the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_28">                                        19.   Learned  counsel  for  the fifth
respondent  also  contends  that  there  are  other  objections  relating   to
violations  of  building  regulations  in  the  construction  put  up  by  the
petitioner and such objections have to be considered by the respondents.    In
this  writ  petition,  this  Court  is  not  concerned  with  such  objections
considering that the only reason given in the impugned order  is  the  alleged
violation  of  noise pollution control regulations and the order passed by the
Supreme Court.  No other reasons have been stated.  It is  certainly  open  to
the  respondents  to  reject the application for regularisation if it does not
satisfy the requirements and terms of the scheme for regularisation.
</p>
<p id="p_29">                                        20.  While parting with this  case,  I
am  also  inclined  to  caution  the  petitioners  as  well as such regligious
enthusiasts/ fundamentalists, to practice their respective faith in a cultured
way and not to resort to aggressive or  unfair  methods  and  resorting  to  a
method of worship which is inhuman.  God, to whichever religion He belongs to,
is  said to be present everywhere and does not require a blaring and deafening
amplifier to hear the prayer of his devotees.  The nature of evil and  adverse
effects  which  noise pollution causes to the children, aged, sickly, pregnant
women and even normal individuals and how it disturbs  the  student  community
etc.,  have  been repeatedly emphasised with scientific facts and figures, any
number of times in newspapers, magazines, health  journals  and  other  media.
Whether any individual has a legal or fundamental right to affect the body and
mind  of another person has been dealt with in detail by the Division Bench in
Apparao's case and by the Supreme Court in the very appeal by  the  petitioner
and there  is  no need to repeat them.  Suffice it to say that religious faith
existed and flourished in the past during several centuries in a better manner
without the aid of amplifiers or other gadjets which have come into being only
during the past few years.  Belief in religion is and should remain a  private
and personal affair.  When it crosses the four walls of the house or the place
of worship and becomes a public issue, it is the singular most factor and root
cause  for  all  the  violence,  extremism,  terrorism  and  strife we are now
witnessing, national and international.  The amplifiers probably  signify  the
growing trend  of  intolerance  between  different  groups.  Religion is not a
trade requiring advertisement by amplifiers.  It is a pity that the police  as
well  as  the  Pollution Control authorities are yet to strictly implement the
rules and regulations in spite of repeated directions by  the  Court  and  the
Government.   There  is no impediment to enforce them provided the enforcement
is carried out impartially and uniformly.  Marriage  halls  also  have  become
noisy  with  music  parties  forcing the invitees to run away at the earliest.
Music and melody  which  should  be  soothening,  instead  make  the  audience
frightened and  terror  stricken.    It  is  paradoxical  to claim that we are
becoming more and more civilised and at the same time we indulge in such  acts
which are most uncivilised.  Even animals run away from noisy areas.  Not only
animals in forests but also in zoos are protected from noise pollution because
they cannot survive in noisy atmosphere.  Motorists passing through the forest
and  protected areas are warned against using the horn and the visitors to the
zoo are directed to pass through silently.  Why should we human beings  reduce
ourselves  to  less  than  animals,  is the question which the petitioners and
their counterparts in other religions should address themselves.

<p id="p_30">                                        21.   With  the   result,   the   writ
petition is  allowed  subject  to  the  observations  in para No.19 above.  No
costs.  Consequently, connected WPMP Nos.51405 and 51406 of 2002 are closed.
