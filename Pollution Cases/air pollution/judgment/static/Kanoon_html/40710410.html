CORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE T.P.S. MANN

Present :   Mr. Rajinder Goyal, Advocate
            for the petitioner.

            Mr. Amarjit Singh Virk, Advocate
            for respondents No.1 to 3/Caveators.

T.P.S. MANN, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            In a suit for mandatory injunction and permanent injunction

filed by respondents No. 1 to 3/Caveators, learned trial Court, while

disposing of their appliction under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 read

with Section 151 C.P.C., restrained the defendants, i.e. petitioners and

respondents No. 4 and 5 from running their Bhatties at the spot till the

crops of the plaintiffs were harvested or till the time they themselves

complied with the suggestions made by the expert with regard to the

construction of room and height of chimney. The said decision was

upheld in appeal by learned lower appellate Court. Hence, present

revision under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Civil Revision No. 5147 of 2008                                        -2-</span>

</p><p id="p_2">             The plaintiffs are agriculturists by profession, whereas the

defendants have installed aluminum/peter salt/naushadar Bhatties in

their land, which is contiguous to the land of the plaintiffs, without

getting necessary licence/permission from the Pollution Control Board

wherein the plaintiffs have also set up their farm and residential houses.

According to the plaintiffs, operation of the Bhatties of the defendants

damaged their standing crops and also on account of the smoke

emanating therefrom, it was difficult for the plaintiffs to live in their

houses. Even their servants refused to stay with them.

</p><p id="p_3">             The stand of the defendants is that they do not require any

licence or permission from the Air Pollution Control Board for running

their Bhatties as the area had not been declared as Air Pollution Control

Area. Further, the plaintiffs have not been able to place any material on

the record to show that their crops were damaged on account of the

smoke/fumes coming out on account of operation of the Bhatties.

</p><p id="p_4">             It may be that the area, in which the plaintiffs live and carry

out agricultural operations, has not been declared an Air Pollution

Control Area, but that would not give a licence to the defendants to

carry on with such an activity, which would result in smoke and fumes

coming out and polluting the clean environment of the villages. In fact,

by their operations, the right to fresh air and of clean environment to the

plaintiffs, stands interfered.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Civil Revision No. 5147 of 2008                                       -3-</span><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">            Learned trial Court had constituted a Committee of a

Regional Officer of Air Pollution Control Board, who, along with

Dr. Bahadur, visited the village of the parties and reported that two units

were in operation at the spot, which were engaged in purifying of crude

ammonium chloride.      The process required conversion of waste of

bangles which was put in bottle shaped conical bulbs to which crude

ammonium chloride was filled and the neck of the bulb thereafter

closed. These bulbs /bottles are kept in the Bhatties, which is shown the

fire by waste of rice husk and Parali, along with wood at side. These

Bhatties emit smoke in the atmosphere. Another source of pollution

was the bursting of the bulbs/bottles, as a result of which white fumes

having odour of ammonia gas, besides ammonium chloride and

hydrochloric acid come out and pollute the atmosphere. Height of the

chimney was only 30 ft. According to the Committee, height of the

chimney was not adequate. Though the Committee opined that the

report regarding damage to the crop could be sought only from the

Expert of some agriculture university, yet the Committee informed the

learned trial Court that the fumes emitted from the Bhatties were

harmful to the crops of the plaintiffs, which were in the close vicinity of

the Bhatties of the defendants.       Learned trial Court required the

defendants to construct a room and raise height of the chimney as

suggested by the Expert but a Local Commissioner appointed by the

Court reported back that no compliance had been made by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Civil Revision No. 5147 of 2008                                       -4-</span>

defendants. On the other hand, defendants kept on harping upon their

stand that they had already applied to the Air Pollution Control Board

for taking the control measures and would comply with the

conditions/suggestions as soon as the concerned authority required them

to do so. It was under these circumstances that the learned trial Court

had to pass an order of restraint against them from running the Bhatties

at the spot till the crops of the plaintiffs were harvested or till the time

they complied with the suggestions made by the Expert with regard to

the construction of room and height of chimney.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            Learned counsel for the plaintiffs-respondents has also

drawn the attention of the Court to notification dated April 25, 1985

issued by Secretary to Government, Haryana, Environment Department

vide which whole of the State of Haryana was declared as the Air

Pollution Control Area for the purposes of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            In view of the above, no case is made out for any

interference in the impugned orders passed by learned lower Courts.


</p><p id="p_9">            The revision is, accordingly, dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
