    the petitioner was entitled to raise construction in terms of the sanctioned





    plan to the extent of 415.50 square meters, he raised construction to the

    extent of 662.00 square meters. Undisputedly, such construction raised is

    even beyond the compoundable limits stipulated under the provisions of the
