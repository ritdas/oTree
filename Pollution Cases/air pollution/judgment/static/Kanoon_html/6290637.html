PRAYING TO QUASH THE JUDGMENT PASSED BY THE
APPELLATE AUTHORITY IN APPEAL NOS.16/12 C/W
17/12 C/W 42/12, C/W 43/12 DATED 30.01.2013
PRODUCED AT ANNEXURE-P AND ETC.,

    THESE WRIT PETITIONS COMING ON FOR
PRELIMINARY HEARING THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE
MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                           ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">D.H.WAGHELA, CJ (Oral)

</p><p id="p_2">1.   The petitioner has called into question judgment

dated 30.01.2013 of the Appellate Authority under Water

and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>s, 1974

and 1981, in Appeal Nos.16-17/2012 and 42-43/2012 and

prayed for quashing the orders dated 02.07.2012 and

09.10.2012,   refusing   consent    for   operation   of   the

petitioner's plant under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.     When these orders refusing

consent and directing the petitioner to close down its

industrial operation and processes as also directing the

electricity company to cut off power supply to the petitioner

were carried in appeals before the Karnataka State

Appellate Authority in the aforesaid appeals, the appellate

authority was pleased to hold that Appeal No.16/2012 was

not maintainable and the connected Appeal No.17/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>

could not survive for consideration, for the reason briefly

recorded in the impugned judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2.   Having regard to the facts and circumstance and the

futility of carrying the matter further, it was fairly

submitted on behalf of the petitioner by learned senior

advocate Mr.Ashok Haranahalli that the petitioner proposes

to follow the positive and constructive course of applying

afresh for necessary permission and consent under the

provisions   of   the   Water   (Prevention   and   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control   of

Pollution) Act</a> and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of

Pollution) Act</a> with fees and submission of necessary

documents.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.   Responding to that, it was fairly stated at the bar on

behalf of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board by

learned counsel Mr.D.Nagaraj that, if and when the

proposed applications were made by the petitioner, they

will be expeditiously processed in accordance with law,

without being influenced by the orders impugned herein or

before the Appellate Authority.      He also stated that the

consequential orders issued under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_5">Section 33A</a> of the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a> would not

survive, if and when consent under the relevant Acts is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>

granted; and if such consent were granted, the pollution

control board would itself issue direction to reconnect

power supply to the petitioner for early commencement of

production.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">4.    The     petitioner   having   been   satisfied   with   the

recording of the above statements in this order, the

petitions were not pressed for any further relief or decision

on merits regarding the contentions contained in the

petitions. Therefore, by consent, the petitions are disposed

after recording the above observations and statements, with

no order as to costs.
