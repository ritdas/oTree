             [W.P.(C) Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019]


                Dated this the 29th day of October, 2019




              W.P.(C) No.41275/2018 has been filed by two

    industrial companies seeking to set aside Exts.P3 and P4

    integrated consent issued by the Kerala State Pollution

    Control Board to the extent they restrain operation of furnace

    of the industrial units from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.          W.P.(C)

    No.4576/2019 has been filed by two permanent residents of

    Kanjikode in Palakkad District challenging Exts.P40 and P41

    integrated consents issued to the petitioners in W.P.(C)

    No.41275/2018 in its entirety. Since both these writ petitions
 WP(C)Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  6</span>

    relate to the alleged pollution caused by the petitioner

    companies in W.P.(C) No.41275/2018, they are being heard

    and disposed of together.     Parties are referred to in this

    judgment, as they are arrayed in W.P.(C) No.41275/2018, for

    convenience.
</p>
<p id="p_2">         2.   The facts revealed from the pleadings show that

    M/s. Paragon Steels Private Limited and M/s. S.M.M Steel

    Re-Rolling Mills Private Limited, the petitioners in W.P.(C)

    No.41275/2018, are running steel re-rolling mills in the

    Industrial Development Area, Kanjikode in Palakkad District.

    The units were established in the year 1995 and 1996. Those

    units were originally run by one Mr. M. Paramasivam.

    Consequent to a resolution plan approved by the Company

    Law Tribunal under <a href="/doc/731012/" id="a_3">Section 31</a> of the Insolvency and

    Bankruptcy Code, 2016, the units have now come under the

    ownership of the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.41275/2018.

</p><p id="p_3">         3.   The petitioner companies state that these units

    situate in an Industrial Development Area which originally

    housed 40 different industrial units. On account of various
 WP(C)Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  7</span>

    adverse circumstances, 25 units have been closed and at

    present, only 15 units including two of the petitioners, are

    functioning. Each unit is liable to remit a minimum electricity

    charge of ₹20,00,000/- to KSEB every month. The electricity

    tariff during peak hours (6 a.m. to 10 p.m.) is ₹8.25 and during

    off peak time (10 p.m. to 6 a.m.), it is ₹4.125. The units are

    functioning under the monitoring of the Pollution Control

    Board. The Pollution Control Board has issued Exts.P3 and

    P4 renewal of integrated consent to operate, on 27.11.2018.

    However, in those consents, a condition has been stipulated

    that operation of furnace as well as loading and unloading

    activities shall not be carried out during night time (10 p.m. to

    6 a.m.). Petitioners state that they are not doing any loading

    or unloading activities during night time. However, the

    condition in the integrated consent restraining functioning of

    the factory during night time not only causes huge financial

    burden on the units towards energy charges but also

    discriminates the industrial units. The units are located in an

    approved Industrial Development Area and pollution norms
 WP(C)Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  8</span>

    relating to industrial areas should be made applicable to the

    units. Petitioners, therefore, pray that Exts.P3 and P4

    integrated consents be set aside to the extent they restrain the

    operation of the furnace of the units, from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.

</p><p id="p_4">         4.    W.P.(C) No.4576/2019 has been filed by additional

    3rd and 4th respondents in W.P.(C) No.41275/2018. Additional

    3rd and 4th respondents state that they are permanent

    residents of Kanjikode. Additional 3rd respondent owns 15.75

    cents of land and it shares the boundary of the industrial unit

    of the 1st petitioner. Additional 4th respondent owns 7 cents of

    land where he resides and the said house is hardly at a

    distance of 30 meters from the two units. They state that the

    two industrial units of the petitioners have been established in

    violation of the distance criteria and the industries are causing

    heavy air and sound pollution. The units are engaged in

    production of steel ingots. Shredded steel scrap and sponge

    iron are used as raw materials. The process involves shelting

    of the said raw materials. Unloading of the scrap and tearing

    down the same by the units, cause loud          and unbearable
 WP(C)Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   9</span>

    noise pollution in the locality and such scrap is unloaded

    during night hours. The pollution control measures installed in

    the units are not working properly. Due to the pollution, the

    members of the families of additional 3 rd and 4th respondents

    suffer    from   various   respiration   ailments.   Though   the

    Environmental Engineer of the Pollution Control Board issued

    show cause notice to the units on 13.04.2016, no effective

    steps were taken to improve the air quality.          Inspections

    conducted in 2016 found that online stack monitoring system

    was not functioning.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         5.     Additional respondents 3 and 4 further contend that

    no effective steps were seen taken to reduce the sound and

    air pollution and the pollution is still persisting. When renewal

    of the consent was refused by the Pollution Control Board, the

    units filed W.P.(C) Nos.6924/2017 and 7193/2017, and by

    Exts.P24 and P25 judgments, this Court directed the Pollution

    Control Board to examine the issue of pollution and take a

    decision in the matter.       Pursuant to Exts.P24 and P25

    judgments, the industrial units made some make shift
 WP(C)Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  10</span>

    arrangements and managed to obtain renewal of consent.

    Even thereafter, sound and air pollution continued to persist.

    They contended that issuance of Exts.P40 and P41 renewal

    of consent is improper, mala fide, ultra vires and per se illegal.

    They have an unbridled right under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_4">Article 21</a> of the

    Constitution of India to live in a clean environment. They have

    no alternate efficacious remedy. The conditions laid down in

    the impugned consent letters violate the provision of the Air

    (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and the Noise

    Pollution   (Regulation   and      Control)   Rules,   2000.   The

    conditions prescribed by the Pollution Control Board are

    consistently violated. There is heavy emission of black smoke

    by the units.   Scrap metal are still unloaded in a careless

    manner causing considerable noise pollution. The permission

    granted to the units to operate near the residence of the

    petitioners in W.P.(C) No.4576/2019 is in violation of the

    dictum laid down by this Court in <a href="/doc/58949928/" id="a_6">Mumthas K.O. v. Steel and

    Industrial Forgings Ltd. &amp; Others [W.P.(C) No</a>.9289/2015].

    The impugned renewal of consent letters, viz. Exts.P40 and
 WP(C)Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  11</span>

    P41, are therefore liable to be set aside and steps should be

    initiated to prosecute the industrial units for violating

    provisions of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

    1981.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         6.    The Environmental Engineer, Kerala State Pollution

    Control Board, Palakkad, filed a report dated 16.01.2019 in

    W.P.(C) No.41275/2018. The report noted that the main

    pollutant from the industry is the emission of particulate matter

    (PM) from the furnace. The air pollution control devices

    installed in the unit to attain the emission standards, are gas

    cooler, primary bag filter, secondary bag filter, two-stage

    ventury scrubber, moisture separator and scrubbed water

    re-circulation system, which are in place. The emissions are

    released to the air through a chimney of 30 meters height.

    The Environmental Engineer noted that if all the air pollution

    control devices are operated satisfactorily, the air pollutants

    will be within the limits of emission standards. Water used for

    the scrubbing and cooling is completely re-circulated. The

    solid waste generated are moved from the unit regularly. The
 WP(C)Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  12</span>

    unit has installed TOD-type electricity meter exclusively for

    recording the electricity consumption of the air pollution

    control devices and it would ensure monitoring the functioning

    of the devices.
</p>
<p id="p_7">         7.   The Environmental Engineer noted that there are

    many residences around the unit within a distance of 100

    meters. Complaints have been received from the residents.

    The main problem not solved by the units is frequent fugitive

    emission and noise created during the operation of furnace

    and while unloading steel scrap particularly at night hours. In

    order to alleviate the noise pollution, the Board instructed the

    units not to operate and unload scrap during night hours.

    However, the units never came up with a foolproof

    arrangement to avoid such pollution and they continued to

    operate at night time also, based on interim orders of this

    Court. The Environmental Engineer further stated that during

    the sound level monitoring conducted by the Board on

    08.12.2017, it was found that the equivalent sound level

    obtained was Leqt = 61.8 dB(A). The instantaneous sound

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                    13</span>

    generated while unloading scraps was found in the range of

    85-90 dB(A). The ambient air quality standards as per the

    Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, during

    night time is 70 Leqt. limits in dB(A) in industrial area and 45

    Leqt. limits in dB(A) in residential area. Since the particulate

    matter     exceed   ambient     air   quality standards,   it   was

    considered fit to restrict the time of operation of the units. The

    restriction is justified in the facts of the case.

</p><p id="p_8">          8.    The learned counsel for the petitioners contended

    that neither the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_8">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 nor the Air

    (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 authorises the

    Pollution Control Board to order closure of a running industrial

    unit in an industrial area from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. As long as

    pollution parameters are within the permissible limits, there is

    no justification in the restriction. Such time-restrictions cannot

    be imposed for the further reason that the units in question are

    situated in an Industrial Development Area. The restrictive

    conditions offend Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.

    The Pollution Control Board has not conducted any study on
 WP(C)Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                     14</span>

    the allegation of pollution resulting in health hazard and for

    that reason also, the night-time restriction is illegal, urged the

    learned counsel for the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_9">          9.   The counsel for additional respondents 3 and 4,

    who    have      filed   W.P.(C)      No.4576/2019,   argued   that

    applications of the petitioners for renewal of consent were

    rejected as per Exts.P38 and P39 in W.P.(C) No.4576/2019

    and grant of consent subsequently is totally illegal and

    unwarranted.       Additional respondents 3 and 4 and their

    families have a right to live in unpolluted environment, which

    has been violated offending <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_10">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.

    Exts.P15    to    P23,    P33,     P34    and   P42   (in   W.P.(C)

    No.4576/2019) would show that the petitioners are violating

    the conditions laid down by the Pollution Control Board. The

    petitioners continue to cause fugitive emissions from their

    units and are using contaminated scrap to manufacture steel

    ingots, in gross violation of the norms prescribed by the

    Pollution Control Board. Still, the Board has renewed their

    consent. The 2nd petitioner in W.P.(C) No.41275/2018 appears

    not to possess requisite certificate under the Hazardous

    Wastes (Management, Handling &amp; Transboundary Movement)

    Rules, 2008. The petitioners are liable to be stopped from

    running their units for that reason also, contended the learned

    counsel for additional respondents 3 and 4.

</p><p id="p_10">         10. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners,

    learned Government Pleader representing the 1st respondent,

    the learned Standing Counsel for the Pollution Control Board

    and the learned counsel for additional respondents 3 and 4 /

    petitioners in W.P.(C) No.4576/2019.
</p>
<p id="p_11">         11.   The prime ground urged by the petitioners is that

    the Pollution Control Board has no authority to order closure

    of a running industrial unit during night time. <a href="/doc/75233928/" id="a_11">Section 7</a> of the

    Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 provides that no person

    carrying on any industry, operation or process shall discharge

    or emit or permit to be discharged or emitted any

    environmental pollutant in excess of such standards as may

    be prescribed. Environmental pollutant means any solid or

    gaseous substance present in such concentration as may be
 WP(C)Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                  16</span>

    or tend to be injurious to health. The industrial units of the

    petitioners emit particulate matters (PM) from their furnace.

    The Central Government, in exercise of its powers under

    <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_12">Sections 6</a> and <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_13">25</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986,

    has framed Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules,

    2000. The said Rules, 2000 prescribe different ambient air

    quality standards in respect of noise for day-time and

    night-time for different areas/zones.         The report dated

    16.01.2019 filed by the Environmental Engineer clearly states

    that observed value of sound level of the units during nights

    exceeded the permissible limits under the Rules, 2000. When

    the duly framed statutory rules prescribe different air quality

    standards for day-time and night-time, necessarily the

    Pollution Control Board, which is authorised to enforce the

    pollution control norms, has authority to direct that an industry

    not satisfying the air quality standards prescribed for the

    night-time, shall not function during night-time. The argument

    to the contrary, on behalf of the petitioners, is therefore only to

    be rejected.
</p><p id="p_12"> WP(C)Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                  17</span>

</p><p id="p_13">         12. Another argument of the petitioners is that since the

    industrial units in question are situated in an industrial area,

    parameters prescribed for residential areas cannot be thrust

    upon the petitioners. In the case on hand, the Environmental

    Engineer has reported that there are many residences around

    the units, within a distance of 100 meters and the nearest

    residence will be less than 10 meters distance.             <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_14">The

    Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 is intended to provide for

    the protection and improvement of environment and for the

    prevention of hazards to human beings, other living creatures,

    plants and property. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_15">The Act</a> and the Rules made thereunder,

    therefore, provide for separate parameters and norms for

    industrial and residential areas. <a href="/doc/32517048/" id="a_16">Section 6(2)(a)</a> and (b) of the

    Act, 1986 empowers the Central Government to make rules to

    regulate the standards of quality of air, water or soil for

    various areas and purposes and to prescribe the maximum

    allowable limits of concentration of various environmental

    pollutants including noise for different areas. What is sought

    to be achieved by the Act, 1986 and Rules, is to strive for and
 WP(C)Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                  18</span>

    achieve certain minimised pollution levels in industrial,

    residential and other areas/zones.      Therefore, no industrial

    unit can claim that it need to comply only with the parameters

    prescribed for industrial area, though the noise or emissions

    from the industry results in pollution of the nearby residential

    area violating the parameters prescribed for the residential

    area. An industry though functioning in an industrial area,

    cannot function in such a manner resulting in violation of

    pollution control norms and parameters prescribed for nearby

    residential areas.
</p>
<p id="p_14">         13. The petitioners have not established with sufficient

    materials that other industrial units functioning in the Industrial

    Development Area and which are permitted to function at

    night, are also similarly situated and those units also violate

    norms and parameters in nearby residential area.              The

    arguments of the petitioners based on Articles 14 and 19(1)(g)

    are therefore without any factual foundation. The contention

    of the petitioners on lack of study by the Pollution Control

    Board on the resultant health hazard, is also unsustainable.
 WP(C)Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                  19</span>

    To pursue the statutory mandate under Section 3 of the

    Environmental Protection Act, the authorities have statutorily

    prescribed parameters and permissible pollution limits and

    there will be a statutory presumption that violation of pollution

    control parameters will result in health hazard.        Separate

    studies on the actual health hazard caused by individual

    industrial units, are therefore unnecessary. Exts.P3 and P4,

    renewal of integrated consent to operate, issued by the Kerala

    State Pollution Control Board are therefore not liable to be

    interfered with and to that extent, the writ petition filed by the

    petitioners is liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_15">         14. As      regards    W.P.(C)      No.4576/2019   filed   by

    additional 3rd and 4th respondents, the argument that the

    industrial units do not satisfy the distance criteria, cannot be

    accepted since admittedly the units are functioning inside an

    approved Industrial Development Area.          It is alleged that

    pollution control norms are being violated. The report filed by

    the Environmental Engineer indicates that the petitioners have

    installed air pollution control devices like gas cooler, primary
 WP(C)Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                   20</span>

    bag filter, secondary bag filter, two-stage ventury scrubber,

    moisture separator and scrubbed water re-circulation system.

    The air pollution chimney installed is at 30 meters height.

    Water used for scrubbing and cooling is completely

    re-circulated. Solid waste is removed regularly. According to

    the Environmental Engineer, the TOD-type electricity meter

    installed exclusively for recording electricity consumption of air

    pollution devices will ensure continuous running of the

    devices, through monitoring by inspecting officials.

</p><p id="p_16">         15. The sound level obtained from the units shows that

    the sound level exceeded the limits prescribed for night-time

    for residential areas.      It is for the said reason that the

    integrated consent issued to the units imposes restrictions to

    night-time operations. Taking into account all the above facts,

    there is no reason to hold that the units create air or sound

    pollution   beyond    the    permissible   limits.     Additional

    respondents 3 and 4 have a case that the units consistently

    violate the conditions even now. If these units still violate the

    conditions, it will be open to additional respondents 3 and 4 to
 WP(C)Nos.41275/2018 &amp; 4576/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                  21</span>

    bring the same to the notice to the Pollution Control Board.

    There is no reason to believe that the Board will not act, if

    such violations are noticed.       For the aforesaid reasons,

    Exts.P40    and    P41    integrated   consents      in   W.P.(C)

    No.4576/2019 are not liable to be interfered with.

</p><p id="p_17">         16. The petitioners face a genuine issue inasmuch as

    the night-time power tariff is almost fifty percent less than the

    day-time tariff and the night-time restriction imposed by the

    Pollution Control Board will not only adversely affect

    productivity but also financial viability, if not profitability.

    Therefore, if the petitioners take necessary steps to bring

    down the sound pollution caused by their units within the

    parameters prescribed and thereafter make applications to lift

    the restriction, the 2nd respondent shall consider such

    applications, in accordance with law. The 2 nd respondent also

    shall look into the complaints, if any, made by additional

    respondents 3 and 4, regarding persistent violation of

    conditions in the integrated consent issued by the Board and

    ensure that the units are functioning without violating the
