                  Karattampatti Village, Musiri Taluk, Tiruchirappalli District, seeks for

                  respondent, dated 14.08.2018, granting permission to the fourth respondent

                  for quarrying stone in Survey No.63 of Karatampatti Village, Musiri Taluk,

                  a water body, but has been wrongly shown in the revenue records as a rocky

                  terrain. It is stated that in the said land, there is a Kasivu Neer Kuttai (frpt[ ePh;

                  Fl;il) and a check dam constructed by the Public Works Department during

                  the year 1985 – 1986 with a bund (fz;kha; fiu), measuring a breadth of 20

                  Feet and height of 15 Feet. A borewell was installed inside the water body

                  cost of Rs.3,00,000/-, which is the main drinking water source for the said

                  Village.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

                  water body and several trees are planted on the bund margin. An electricity

                  transformer is located within the radius of 100 Meters, Pulivalam forest is at a

                  distance of about 500 Meters and there are houses also nearby the water

                  body. It is further stated that periodically, the villagers undertake cleaning

                  and deepening work of the water body and roughly 4000 men are deployed,

                  who are all villagers in and around the said area. This is done because the

                  said water body is the main source for irrigating the crops. It is submitted

                  that the official respondents, without conducting any spot inspection and

                  without ascertaining the physical and geographical condition of the land and

                  without undertaking environmental impact assessment, mechanically passed

                  the impugned order, dated 14.08.2018, granting stone quarry lease to an

                  extent of 2.71.0 Hectares in favour of the fourth respondent. On coming to

                  know about the grant of stone quarry lease in favour of the fourth respondent,

                  which will have a great impact on the water body as well as the flora and

                  fauna in the area, the villagers submitted a representation requesting the

                  Authority concerned to make a spot inspection and cancel the lease granted in

                  favour   of    the   fourth   respondent.   According   to    the   petitioner,   the

                  representation did not evoke any response from the Authority concerned and

                  therefore, he, on behalf of himself as well as the villagers, has approached this

                  Court by filing this writ petition.

                  after reiterating the above factual contentions, submitted that the grant of

                  lease in favour of the fourth respondent is wholly illegal as it has been done

                  without any inspection and the Authorities have failed to appreciate the efforts

                  put in by nearly 4000 villagers in deepening and cleaning the water body and

                  ignoring the plight of the villagers, in a mechanical manner, have granted the

                  stone quarry lease to the fourth respondent. It is submitted that if the fourth

                  respondent commences quarry operation, it will not only damage the water

                  body, but the check dam, trees, tank bund, graveyard and also affect the

                  drinking water supply, which is made through the borewell installed inside the

                  water body utilising the funds of the Member of Legislative Assembly.

                  attention to the photographs placed in the typed set of papers to show the

                  physical features of the land in Survey No.63. It is submitted that the Public

                  Works Department having constructed a check dam, it goes without saying

                  that the Government has recognized the same as a water body and when all

                  the villagers have jointly given a representation, the Authorities failed to take

                  note of the same and have arbitrarily granted lease.

                  newspaper reports, which have extensively covered the agitation done by the

                  people of the area objecting to the grant of quarry lease, wherein there is a

                  reference to the assurance given by the District Collector that he will look into

                  the complaint and redress the grievance.

                  to show that the Authorities have admitted the existence of the water body,

                  copies of the reports submitted by the officials, which have been filed in the

                  typed set of papers by the learned Special Government Pleader and submitted

                  that the report of the Village Administrative Officer, Karatampatti Village,

                  clearly shows the existence of the water body. Further, it is submitted that

                  Trichirappalli, who is one of the Members of DECA Committee, in his remarks

                  has stated that if mining depth intersects the water table or continuous

                  seepage occurred in the pit, then the applicant should inform to the concerned

                  Department. Thus, it is submitted that the Authorities were fully aware of the

                  physical features of the area and despite that, the Committee has

                  recommended for grant of stone quarry lease. Therefore, it is submitted that

                  this Court should interfere in the matter and quash the impugned proceedings

                  of the first respondent granting stone quarry lease in favour of the fourth

                  However, when he started using explosives, he was prevented from doing any

                  quarry work.   It is, therefore, submitted that the pits, in which water are

                  evidence to show that it is a water body. Three aspects are brought before this

                  Court to state that the proposed quarry site lies within the water body. The

                  first is a sluice, which has been constructed by the Public Works Department.

                  Secondly, tank bund showing clear evidence of existence of a water body and

                  thirdly, existence of a deep borewell inside the water body, which caters to the

                  drinking water needs of the villagers. The petitioner has further stated that

                  the villagers have got together and conducted mega cleaning and deepening

                  drives to maintain the storage area of the water body. Apart from that, it has

                  affidavit, it is clear that the first respondent has not categorically stated that

                  the pits were formed due to manual quarrying in the earlier years, but, has

                  stated that it may have been formed due to manual quarrying. This averment

                  as the first respondent states that due to rain, water may be stored in the pits.

                  There is a candid admission of construction of a sluice for the purpose of

                  regulating the flow of water, which according to the first respondent is the

                  overflow of water from the pits. The existence of the bund on the eastern side

                  of the proposed quarry site is admitted and the distance between the bund

                  and the proposed quarry site is 5 Meters. Having said so, the first respondent

                  states that the fourth respondent should be instructed to maintain 10 Meters

                  safety distance from the eastern border of the proposed quarry site. Thus, it is

                  clear that there is a bund within the prohibited distance. A bund is a natural

                  formation and the corollary is that there is an existence of a water body and

                  the bund protects the water body and helps for retention of water.            The

                  statement made in the counter affidavit that the fourth respondent should be

                  directed to maintain 10 Meters safety distance clearly shows that the proposed

                  quarry site is within the prohibited distance, as the distance is only 5 Meters.

                  constructed, it cannot be stated that the land in question is a water body. We

                  are unable to appreciate such a stand taken by the first respondent.          The

                  Public Works Department or any other Department of the Government, which

                  deals with water resources, will not mechanically permit construction of sluice

                  unless and until it is established that there is a water body and there will be

                  flow or overflow of water. The purpose of constructing sluice is to regulate the

                  flow of water to help agriculturists and villagers of the area. Therefore, the

                  first respondent is not justified in discrediting the officials, who with due

                  application of mind, had permitted construction of sluice.



</p><p id="p_59">                             33. We have come across cases, where demand is made by the

                  riparian land owners for the construction of sluice at appropriate places in

                  rivers, canals, channels etc., with a view to obtain uninterrupted supply of

                  water for their agricultural operation. This request is invariably opposed by

                  the lower riparian land owners stating that if a sluice is constructed at a

                  higher level, their entitlement to the water will be affected.    Thus, a lot of

                  thought process goes into before a decision is taken to construct a sluice.

                  Therefore, unless and until there is flow of water, no official decision would be

                  taken for construction of sluice. The money spent for construction of sluice is

                  public funds, which further would legitimise the plea of the petitioner to

                  substantiate the existence of a water body. Similarly, the existence of bund,

                  which in most cases is a natural formation, is a strong evidence to come to the

                  conclusion that there is a water body. Merely because there is no water in the

                  tank or in the pond, it will not change the classification of the land. In the

                  instant case, the first respondent would state that the land is classified as

                  cannot be a percolation pond or a tank or any other form of water body.

                  the campus of the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court.           During summer

                  season, after the water recedes, the bed of the tank is fully exposed and it is a

                  rocky terrain.   The Public Works Department, Madurai, while sinking deep

                  borewells in the campus, have found that upto a depth of about 20 Feet, it is

                  rock and only thereafter, the water table can be accessed by further drilling

                  upto a minimum of about another 200 Feet. Therefore, the stand taken by the

                  first respondent in the counter affidavit can in no manner advance the case of

                  the Department. In other words, even if the entire area is a rocky terrain, still

                  it can be a water body.

                  quarrying in a water body, which is a rocky terrain. Unless and until earth

                  moving equipments and heavy machineries are deployed, quarrying to great

                  depth cannot be done. Therefore, if manual quarrying was permitted or done

                  illegally for three years, it could have resulted in small pits and not deep pits,

                  where there would be a necessity to construct a sluice to regulate the overflow

                  of water.    Thus, the averments set out in the counter affidavit and the

                  additional counter affidavit can in no manner substantiate the stand taken by

                  the first respondent to justify the grant of permission to quarry stones in the

                  Ground Water Division, Tiruchirappalli, who is one of the Members of DECA

                  Committee, has qualified his recommendation by stating that if mining depth

                  intersects the water table or continuous seepage occurs in the pit, then the

                  applicant should inform the concerned Department. This qualification made

                  by the Public Works Department, Member of the Committee, is very relevant,

                  because it indicates that there is a water table underneath the proposed site.

                  The recommendations made by the other Authorities are not speaking orders,

                  but, a mere recommendation with their signature.

                  recommended the period of grant for five years only, whereas the first

                  respondent, in the impugned order, has granted permission for ten years.

                  any condition while granting clearance or granting lease is of little avail as the

                  selection of the site itself is illegal. We cannot accept the submissions made

                  on behalf of the fourth respondent that it is a common knowledge that the

                  entire area is a rocky terrain and therefore, there is no error in granting

                  permission.   Admittedly, the subject land has been selected for grant of

                  permission to quarry stone for the first time and as per the averments made in

                  the counter affidavit of the first respondent, for a brief period of three years,

                  manual stone quarrying was permitted, but, because of violation of condition,

                  the same was stopped. If illegal quarrying has been done in any area, then it

                  is the officials, who have to be first blamed for not enforcing the law and they

                  cannot be permitted to take advantage of their own wrong.
