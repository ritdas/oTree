      On an earlier occasion, in this very case, this

      Court  in A.P.  Pollution Control Board (I) Vs.  Prof.
M.V.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      Nayudu  ( 1999(2) SCC 718) ( dated 27.1.1999) referred
to

      the 'precautionary principle' and the new rule of

      'burden of proof' in the matter of environmental

      pollution.  This Court in that judgment emphasised the

      need for scientific inputs before adjudicating

      complicated  issues of pollution to environment.	 The
said

      approach	of  this Court was based  upon	contemporary
trend

      in  the  adjudication  of	  environmental	 matters  in
various

      countries	 and was not intended to restrict the powers
of

      this  Court  under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1">Article 21</a> of the  Constitution  of
India

      to safeguard environment from pollution.



      Our efforts to get at the best scientific evidence

      on the issues involved in the case, have yielded

      satisfactory results in the sense that we have today

      greater confidence about the correctness of our

      conclusions and further that this is a fit case for

      affirming the orders of the appellant ( Andhra Pradesh

      Pollution Control Board) not to grant 'consent' to the

      seventh respondent ( M/s.	 Surana Oils &amp; Derivatives

      (India) Ltd.) under the statute for establishing its

      industry.	  We are now more sure that, on facts,	this
is a

      pre-eminently fit case which requires grant of an

      injunction to prevent irreversible pollution to the

      drinking water reservoirs of Osman Sagar and Himayaat

      Sagar  catering to the needs of over 50 lakhs  people,
in

      Hyderabad and Secunderabad.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
      Drinking water is of primary importance in any

      country.	 In fact, India is a party to the Resolution
of

      the UNO passed during the United Nations Water

      Conference in 1977 as under:
</p>
<p id="p_5">      "All  people, whatever their stage of development	 and
their social and economic conditions, have the right to have
access	to drinking water in quantum and of a quality  equal
to their basic needs."
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      Thus, the right to access to drinking water is

      fundamental to life and there is a duty on the State

      under  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2">Article  21</a> to provide clean drinking water  to
its

      citizens.</blockquote><p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">      Adverting to the above right declared in the

      aforesaid Resolution, in Narmada Bachao Andolan Vs.

      Union  of India ( 2000(7) Scale 34 ( at p.124), Kirpal
J

      observed:

<p id="p_8">
      "Water  is  the basic need for the survival  of  human
beings	and  is	 part of right of life and human  rights  as
enshrined  in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_3">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of	 India....."
There is therefore need to take into account the

      right to a healthy environment along with the right to

      sustainable development and balance them.


      Competing	 human	rights	to healthy  environment	 and
sustainable development:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      There is building up, in various countries, a

      concept that right to healthy environment and to

      sustainable development are fundamental human rights

      implicit in the right to 'life'.</blockquote><p id="p_9">



</p><p id="p_10">      Our Supreme Court was one of the first Courts to

      develop  the concept of right to 'healthy environment'
as

      part of the right to "life" under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_4">Article 21</a> of our

      Constitution.   [ See Bandhua Mukti Morcha Vs.   Union
of

      India  (	1984(3) SCC 161)].  This principle  has	 now
been

      adopted in various countries today.






      In today's emerging jurisprudence, environmental

      rights  which  encompass a group of collective  rights
are

      described as "third generation" rights.  The "first

      generation" rights are generally political rights such

      as  those	 found	in the International  Convention  on
Civil

      &amp;	 Political  Rights while "second generation"  rights
are

      social   and   economic  rights  as   found   in	 the
International

      Covenant	on  Economic,  Social and  Cultural  Rights.
"Right

      to Healthy Environment".	(See Vol.25) 2000 Columbia

      Journal of Environmental Law by John Lee P.283, at

      pp.293-294 fn.29)



      The right to sustainable development has been

      declared	by  the	 UN  General   Assembly	 to  be	  an
inalienable

      human right ( Declaration on the Right to Development

      )(1986).	The 1992 Rio Conference declared that Human

      beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable

      development.   Human beings are entitled to a  healthy
and

      productive  life	in harmony with nature.	  (Principle
</p><p id="p_11">1).
</p>
<p id="p_12">      In order to achieve "sustainable development,

      environmental protection shall constitute an integral

      part  of development process and cannot be  considered
in

      isolation	 of  it".  The 1997 Earth Summit meeting  of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">100</span>

      nations  in  New York reflected the above	 principles.
The

      European Court of Justice, emphasised in Portugal Vs.

      E.C.  Council, the need to promote sustainable

      development while taking into account the environment.

      (3 C.M.L.R.331)(1997) (ibid Columbia Journal of

      Environmental Law, p.  283)

      In Lopez Ostra Vs.  Spain ( 303-C,

      Eur.Ct.H.R.(Ser.A) 1994), the European Court at

      Strasbourg has held that the result of environmental

      degradation might affect an individual's well being so

      as to deprive him of enjoyment of private and family

      life.  Under <a href="/doc/691208/" id="a_5">Article 8</a> of the European Convention,

      everyone is guaranteed the right to respect for his

      private  and family life.	 ( See also, Powell &amp; Rayner
Vs.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      U.K.   (	172  Eur.  Ct H.R.(Ser.A,  p.5)(1990).	 The
Inter-
</p>
<p id="p_14">      American	Commission  on	Human  Rights  has  found  a
similar

      linkage (Yanomani Indians Vs.  Brazil) ( Inter-

      Amer.C.H.R.  7615 OEA/Ser.L.V/II/66 Doc.10 rev.  1

      (1985).  The Commission found that Brazil had violated

      the Yanomani Indians' right to life by not taking

      measures to prevent the environmental damage.  The

      Philippine Supreme Court dealt with the action against

      Government not to continue licensing agreements

      permitting deforestation so that the right to a

      'balanced and healthful ecology in accordance with the

      rhythm  and  harmony  of nature' is not  affected.   (
Minors

      Opasa Vs.	 Department of Environment and Natural

      Resources ( 33, I.L.M.  173)(1994).  The judgment was

      based on 'intergenerational responsibility'.  In

      Fundepublico Vs.	Mayor of Bugalagrande &amp; Ors.  , the

      Constitutional Court of Columbia ( 17.6.1992) held in

      favour of the right to healthy environment as a

      fundamental  human right and treated the right as part
of

      customary	 international	law.   The  Court  permitted
popular

      action  mechanism.  The Supreme Court of South Africa,
in

      a recent case in Wildlife Society of Southern Africa &amp;

      Ors.   Vs.   Minister  of	 Environmental	affairs	 and
Tourism

      of the Republic of South Africa and Ors.	(

      Dt.27.6.1996)(  1996(9)  BCLR 1221 (Tk);	 1996  SACLR
LEXIS

</p><p id="p_15">      30)  dealt  with	the right  to  healthy	environment.
About

      60 nations since 1990 have recognised in their

      constitutions a right to a healthy environment as a

      corollary duty to defend the environment.	 ( Columbia

      Journal of Environmental Law, ibid PP.318-319).



      Thus, the concept of a healthy environment as a

      part  of	the fundamental right to life, developed  by
our

      Supreme Court, is finding acceptance in various

      countries side by side with the right to development.


      Events after 27.1.99 judgment:

      We shall now refer to the events subsequent to our

      order dated 27.1.99.  They are as follows:

      The question is whether in the event of the

      seventh respondent being permitted to establish its

      industry	 within	  10   Kms.	of   the   lakes   -
notwithstanding

      the  Government's	 policy	 to  the  contrary  and	 the
refusal

      of the appellant Board to grant NOC - there is

      likelihood  of serious pollution to the drinking water
in

      these lakes.  This Court in its judgment dated 27.1.99

      referred	 the   said  question	 to   the   National
Environmental

      Appellate Authority ( constituted under the National

      Environmental Appellate Authority Act, 1997) for its

      opinion.	The said authority visited the site of the

      industry at Peddashpur village near Hyderabad and

      submitted a detailed and exhaustive report to this

      Court, after receiving oral and documentary evidence.

      The  Report  went	 against   the	seventh	  respondent
industry.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      The industry filed objections to the said Report.


      When the matter was thereafter heard, the seventh

      respondent industry relied upon an order passed by the

      appellant-Board on 16.7.97, suggesting that if certain

      safeguards were provided by the industry to prevent

      pollution,  NOC could be granted.	 The said order	 had
to

      be passed at one stage by the Board because of the

      direction of the Government of Andhra Andhra contained

      in an order granting exemption from the 10 KM rule.


      Before this Court heard arguments on the merits on

      the  question of validity of the exemption granted  by
the

      Government, this Court wanted to first ascertain -

      without prejudice to the contentions of the parties -

      whether the precautions which were suggested by the

      appellant	 Board on 16.7.97 pursuant to the  directive
of

      the State Government would be adequate and whether any

      further precautions were to be taken.  The limited

      question relating to adequacy or otherwise of the

      "safeguards" as stated above was then referred to

      another expert body, namely, the University Department

      of   Chemical  Technology,  (  Autonomous),   Matunga,
Bombay,

      headed by Prof.  D.N.  Bhowmick.	It was stated in the
said

      order  of	 this Court that Prof.	Bhowmick could	take
the

      assistance of the National Geophysical Research

      Institute, Hyderabad (hereinafter called the 'NGRI').


      Thereafter, Dr.  Bhowmick submitted his Report

      dated 16.8.2000 together with a report of June 2000

      furnished by the NGRI, Hyderabad.	 In as much as the

      Reports - particularly, that of NGRI- had gone against

      the   7th	 respondent  -	 industry,  it	again  filed
objections

      thereto.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
      We then finally heard learned Additional Solicitor

      General of India, Sri R.N.  Trivedi for the appellant

      Board  and  of  Sri  P.S.	   Narasimha  for  the	writ
petitioner

      (respondent 1) who supported the appellant and Sri A.

      Subba Rao, learned counsel for the 7th respondent-

      industry.	  Thus,	 we  have  now	the  Report  of	 the
National

      Environmental Appellate Authority, the Report of Dr.

      Bhowmick, ( Bombay) and the Report of the National

      Geophysical Research Institute, (NGRI) Hyderabad.

      Basic facts leading to the grant of exemption:

      We may now refer to certain basic facts.	The

      Ministry of Forests and Environment, Union of India

      issued a Notification dated 27.9.88 listing various

      industries as hazardous and included them in a 'Red'

      list.   Item  37	of  the	  said	list  of   hazardous
industries

      is the industry which produces 'Vegetable oils

      including solvent extracted oils'.  The above

      notification was expressly stated to be issued by the

      Government of India in exercise of its powers vested

      under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution)

      Act</a>,   1974,  the	 Air   (Prevention  and	 <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control  of
Pollution)

      Act</a>, 1981 and the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_8">Control of

      Pollution) Cess Act</a> 1977 and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_9">Environment

      (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, directing that whenever any

      industry sought consent from the Pollution Control

      Boards, the said Boards, "while processing the consent

      application, should decide, keeping in view the

      pollution - causing potential of the industry, as to

      which category the industry belongs."


      Consequent to the directive of the Union

      Government  the  State  of  Andhra  Pradesh  initially
issued

      notification in GO 192 dated 31.3.94 (Municipal

      Administration).	Therein, the State Government relied

      upon the interim report of an Expert Committee of the

      Hyderabad	 Metropolitan  Water   Supply  and  Sewerage
Board,

      called   HMWSSB),	 and   prohibited  industries  being
located

      within 10 K.M.  of the two reservoirs.


      In spite of the prohibition contained in GO 192

      dated 31.3.94 prohibiting industries within 10 KM.  of

      the reservoirs, the seventh respondent industry

      purchased land of 12 acres on 26.9.95 in Peddashpur

      village situated on the outskirts of Hyderabad, within

      10 KM of the reservoirs.	Initially, the industry

      applied  for  consent  from  the	appellant  Board  in
November

      1995, through the Industries Department of the State

      Government.   The	 State of Andhra Pradesh, by  letter
dated

      28.11.95,	  wrote	 to  the   Government  of  India  on
28.11.95,

      recommending  grant of letter of intent in  relaxation
of

      10  K.M.	rule, subject to the industry obtaining	 NOC
from

      the  appellant Board.  On 9.1.96, Government of  India
gave

      letter  of intent but required the industry to  obtain
No

      Objection Certificate from the environmental authority

      of the State.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
      At that stage, the Government re-affirmed the 10

      K.M.  prohibition in GO 111 dated 8.3.96, after

      obtaining the second interim report of the HMWSSB.

      Consequent thereto, in the pre-scrutiny by the Single

      Window Clearance Committee Meeting of the Pollution

      Control Board held on 24.5.96, the application of the

      industry stood rejected because of the 10 K.M.

      prohibition.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
      Undeterred, the industry proceeded to obtain

      permission from the Gram Panchayat on 31.5.96 for

      establishing a 'factory'.	 Even though, on 31.5.96 the

      Commissioner of Industries, specifically informed the

      industry that it should better select an alternative

      site, instead of heeding to the said advice, the

      industry obtained permission of the District Collector

      on 7.9.96 for change of land use from agricultural to

      non-agricultural use.  It then proceeded to execute

      various	civil  works  in  spite	  of  the  10	k.m.
prohibition

      rule.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
      Thereafter, the Industry proceeded further with

      construction of civil works and then applied to the

      appellant	 Board	on  7.4.97 under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_10">Section 25</a>  of	 the
Water

      Act  for permission to establish the factory.  One  of
the

      bye-products mentioned in the said application was:

      "Glycerine, spent bleaching earth and carbon and spent
nickel catalysts".
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">      On 1.6.97, the appellant Board wrote to the

      Commissioner of Industries that the industry would be

      generating  'nickel'  catalyst  and  other  pollutants
which

      could find their way to the lakes either directly or

      indirectly.  Even the solid waste such as activated

      carbon bleaching earth and sodium sulphate might find

      entry during rainy season from the storage yard

      resulting in polluting to lakes.


      In spite of the said opinion of the appellant

      Board, the Commissioner of industries, in his letter

      dated 6.6.97 stated that there would be no liquid

      effluent or acidic fumes and that the limited aqueous

      effluent	was  totally  bio-degradable and  the  solid
wastes

      were disposable.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
      On 25.6.97, the appellant Board once again

      rejected	the application of the industry inasmuch  as
the

      said industry was in the 'Red' list annexed to the

      Notification dated 1.2.89 of the Ministry of Forests &amp;

      Environment, Government of India.


      Confronted with the above problems, the industry

      approached the State Government on 24.6.96 seeking

      exemption from the 10 k.m.  rule contained in GO.111

      dated 8.3.96 on the ground that it had invested huge

      amounts  to  establish  the industry and that  it	 had
almost

      completed the civil works, and had purchased machinery

      and  installed  the  same.  The State  Government,  in
spite

      of the prohibitory directions issued by it earlier,

      issued  GO.  153 dated 3.7.97 granting exemption	from
GO

      111 dated 8.3.96 on the ground that the Government of

      India had issued letter of intent on 9.1.96, that the

      Commissioner of Industries, in his letter dated 6.6.97

      opined  that  there would be no liquid  effluents	 and
that

      the solid wastes would be disposable.  Government then

      granted exemption stating as follows:


      "The  Government	had  considered the  matter  in	 its
entirety  and feel that if proper control over treatment  of
aqueous	 and solid wastes is exercised, then there can be no
objection  to setting up of the industry under reference  at
the proposed site".
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">      The Government then directed the Board to prescribe

      conditions for treatment/disposal of aqueous/solid

      waste.
</p>
<p id="p_26">

      Compelled by the above direction, the appellant Board

      passed   an  order  on   16.7.97	 requiring   various
precautions

      to be taken by the industry.  (In fact, after 8.3.96,

      Government of Andhra Pradesh issued GO 181 dated

      7.8.1997 modifying GO 153 dated 3.7.97 and clarifying

      that the exemption granted did not relate to para (1)

      of GO 111 but related only to para 3(f)), that para

      being   the  one	which  related	 to  the   10	K.m.
prohibition.
</p>
<p id="p_27">

</p><p id="p_28">      Meanwhile, the Society for Preservation of

      Environment and Quality Life ( SPEQL) filed W.P.

      16969/97 for quashing the exemption order in GO 153

      dated 3.7.97 and obtained stay on 25.7.97.


      The appellant-Board stuck to its decision to

      refuse NOC.  On 30.7.97, it finally rejected the

      application for NOC relying upon GO 111 dated 8.3.96

      and also upon the Government of India's notification

      dated 1.2.89 which showed this type of industry in its

      'Red'  list.   The  Board	 stated	  that	it  was	 not
desirable

      to  locate  such an industry in the catchment area  in
view

      of  GO.	111 dated 8.3.96.  It also referred  to	 the
fact

      that earlier the Board had already rejected the NOC on

      24.5.96 at the pre-scrutiny level.


      Aggrieved by the order of rejection dated 30.7.97

      of   the	appellant   Board,  the	  seventh-respondent
industry

      filed appeal under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_11">Section 28</a> of the Water Act, 1974

      before  the appellate authority.	For the first  time,
in

      the said appeal, it filed an affidavit of Prof.  M.

      Santappa, ( a former Vice Chancellor) who was the then

      Scientific Officer of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control

      Board.   The  said  opinion  was	 in  favour  of	 the
industry.
</p>
<p id="p_29">      By order dated 5.1.98, the appellate authority

      (presided over by a retired Judge of the A.P.  High

      Court) allowed the appeal and set aside the orders of

      the Board.  It held that the categorisation into 'Red'
as

      made  by	the  Government	 of   India  on	 1.2.89	 was
applicable

      only to the industries set up in the Doon valley.	 It

      relied on the affidavit of Prof.M.Shantappa to the

      affect that the industry had adopted the latest

      technology  which	 was  eco-friendly   and  that	 the
Chairman

      of  the  Board  of  Directors   of  the  industry	 was
Dr.Siddhu,

      formerly Director General of CSIR, that the technology

      was obtained by the industry from the Indian Institute

      of  Chemical Technology, Hyderabad (IICT) which issued
a

      certificate that the industry will not discharge any

      acidic effluents and solid wastes, and that they could

      be collected in M.S.Drums mechanically.  The appellate

      authority	 referred  to Dr.  Santappa's  report  which
stated

      that none of the bye products would fall on ground and

      that  the	 conditions  laid   down  by  the  Technical
Committee

      of the appellant Board on 16.7.97 would be fulfilled.

      There would be no liquid effluents or acidic fumes as

      certified	 by  IICT.  The nearest spread would be	 8.5
Kms.
</p>
<p id="p_30">      There   was  no  possibility  of	seepage	  into	 the
reservoirs.
</p>
<p id="p_31">      The appellate authority also held that principle of

      'promissory estoppel' applied inasmuch as permission

      for  change  of land-use was given and  permission  to
erect

      factory  was also given.	It was brought to the notice
of

      the said appellate authority that under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">Water Act</a>,

      long   before   the  State   Government	issued	 the
prohibiting

      notification,  there  was	 an  earlier  categorisation
dated

      27.9.88 made by the Government of India showing

      'Vanaspati Hydegenerated vegetable oils for industrial

      purposes' in the red category.  Even so, the appellate

      authority	 allowed  the appeal of the  7th  respondent
filed

      under  <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_13">Section 28</a> of the Water (Prevention and Control
of

      pollution) Act, 1974 and directed NOC to be issued by

      the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
      Writ petition 2215/98 was a PIL case filed

      for quashing the order dated 5.1.98 of the appellate

      authority.   The	said  writ  petition  and  the	writ
petition

      of SPEQL ( WP.  16969/97 already referred to) and the

      W.P.    11803/98	filed  by  the	 respondent-industry
seeking

      mandamus against the appellant Board for grant of NOC,

      were all disposed of by the High Court on 1.5.98,

      upholding the orders of the appellate authority and

      directing grant of NOC by the appellant.


      The present appeals have arisen out of the said

      judgment.	  We  first  rendered	the  judgment  dated
27.1.99

      as stated earlier.  We have already set out the

      subsequent  facts	 relating to the reference  made  by
this

      Court   to   the	 National  Environmental   Appellate
Authority

      on  the  main point relating to pollution and also  to
its

      report dated 25.6.99.  Further, we have said that this

      Court then made a further reference by order dated

      5.5.2000 to the University-Department of Chemical

      Technology, Bombay and the latter submitted its Report

      dated 16.8.2000 together with Report of National

<p id="p_39">
      It is necessary first to refer to the following

      provision of the Environment (Protection)Act, 1986.

      Under <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_24">Section 2(b)</a>, 'environmental pollution'

      means  any solid, liquid or gaseous substance  present
in

      such concentration may be, or tend to be, injurious to

      environment.    <a href="/doc/379900/" id="a_25">Section	2(e)</a>	defines	  'hazardous
substance'

      as  any  substance or preparation which, by reason  of
its

      chemical or physio-chemical properties or handling, is

      liable to cause harm to human being, other living

      creatures, plants, micro-organism, property or the

      environment.   <a href="/doc/1081844/" id="a_26">Section  3</a>	 refers	  to  the  extensive
process

      of the Central Government to take measures to protect

      and  improve  environment.    Sub-clause	(2)  permits
measures

      to be taken ( see clause (v)) by imposing

      "restriction  of areas in which industries, operations
or processes or class of industries, operations or processes
shall  not be carried out or shall be carried out subject to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">181</span>

      dated 7.8.1997 as exempting para 3(f) of GO 111 and

      directed A.P.Pollution Control Board:


      "	 to prescribe conditions for treatment/ disposal  of
aqueous/solid wastes."
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      The result of exemption from the purview of para 3(f)

      of GO.111 dated 8.3.96 was that the seventh respondent

      industry	could be located within 10 KM of the  lakes.
</blockquote><p id="p_55">The

      question is whether this exemption can be valid ?



      Under <a href="/doc/1954365/" id="a_38">Section 3(2)(v)</a> above extracted, the Central

      Government or the State Government as its delegate,

      could issue directions as permitted by <a href="/doc/68540/" id="a_39">Section 5</a>.	 Now

      <a href="/doc/1954365/" id="a_40">Section 3(2)(v)</a> permits restriction specifying "areas"

      in  which industrial operations or processes shall not
be

      carried out or shall be carried out subject to certain

      safeguards.  The notification issued by the State

      Government  in  GO 111 dated 8.3.96 falls	 within	 the
first

      part i.e.	 where industries shall not be carried out.

      This is a total prohibition within 10 KM of the two

      reservoirs.  When such a prohibition was in force, the

      State  Government	 could	not   obviously	 grant	 any
exemption

      to a specified industry like the seventh respondent,

      located within the 'area'.  Nor was it permissible for

      the State to direct the appellant-Board to prescribe

      conditions for grant of NOC.
</p>
<p id="p_56">
      Coming to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_41">Water Act</a>, 1974,

      it  is  clear that in view of Sub-<a href="/doc/379900/" id="a_42">sections 2(e)</a>,	<a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_43">2(k)</a>
read

      with <a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_44">Sections 17</a> and <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_45">18</a> of the Water Act, the

      fundamental  objective  of the statute is	 to  provide
clean

      drinking water to the citizens.  Having laid down the

      policy  prohibiting location of any industries  within
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">10</span>

      Kms under GO 111 dated 8.3.1996, the State could not

      have granted exemption to the 7th respondent industry,

      nor  to any other industry, from any part of the	main
GO

      111 dated 8.3.96.	 <a href="/doc/660281/" id="a_46">Section 19</a> permitted the State to

      restrict the application of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_47">Water Act</a>, 1974 to

      particular area, if need be, but it did not enable the

      State  to	 grant	exemption to a	particular  industry
within

      the area prohibited for location of polluting

      industries.  Exercise of such a power in favour of a

      particular industry must be treated as arbitrary and

      contrary to public interest and in violation of the

      right to clean water under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_48">Article 21</a> of the

      Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_57">

      The above reasoning given by us does not mean

      that exemption can be given to all industries within a

      particular radius of the reservoirs unmindful of the

      possible danger of pollution to the lakes.  In fact,

      exemption granted even to a single major hazardous

      industry may itself be sufficient to make the water in

      the reservoirs totally unsafe for drinking water

      purposes.	 Government could not pass such orders of

      exemption having dangerous potential, unmindful of the

      fate of lakhs of citizens of the twin cities to whom

      drinking water is supplied from these lakes.  Such an

      order of exemption carelessly passed, ignoring the

      'precautionary principle', could be catastrophic.



      Therefore, the GO 153 dated 3.7.97 granting

      exemption must be held to be without statutory backing

      and also wholly arbitrary and violative of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_49">Article 21.</a>

      Points 1 and 2 are decided against the 7th respondent.


      Point 3:
</p>
<p id="p_58">      In our earlier judgment in A.P.  Pollution Control

      Board (I) Vs.  Prof.  M.V.  Nayudu and Ors.  ( 1999(2)
SCC

</p><p id="p_59">      718), this Court had occasion to refer to the basis of

      the  precautionary principle and to explain the  basis
and

      content  of  the	very  principle.   This	 Court	also
explained

      the new principle of burden of proof.


      Therefore, it was for the 7th respondent industry

      to  establish  that  there  would	  be  no  danger  of
pollution

      to the two reservoirs even if the industry was

      established   within   10	 Km   radius  of  the	said
reservoirs.
</p>
<p id="p_60">      In the present proceedings, the 7th respondent has

      failed to discharge the said onus.


      Before the State Government, the industry produced

      no  expert  opinion except to say that it had got	 the
new

      technology from the Indian Institute of Chemical

      Technology, Hyderabad ( IICT) and it relied on a

      statement	  of  Dr.   Siddhu,   Chairman	of  the	 7th
respondent

      and  formerly Director General of CSIR.  The affidavit
of

      Dr.  Santappa was produced only before the appellate

      authority under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_50">Section 28</a> of the Water Act, 1974.



      But, in the light of the subsequent reports now

      obtained	by this Court, the position is quite  clear.
We

      shall now refer in some detail to the three exhaustive

      reports furnished by the National Environmental

      Appellate	 Authority, New Delhi (NEAA), Dr.   Bhowmick
of

      Bombay and the NGRI.
</p>
<p id="p_61">
      (A)   Report  of	 National  Environmental   Appellate
Authority, New Delhi (NEAA):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      The said authority was presided over by a retired

      Judge of the Supreme Court of India, Sri Justice N.

      Venkatachala.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">
      The NEAA framed two points (a) and (b):</blockquote><p id="p_62">

</p><p id="p_63">      (a)  (i)	Is  the	  respondent-industry  a   hazardous
industry or?
</p>
<p id="p_64">      (ii)  What  is  the   pollution  potentiality  of	 the
respondent  industry, taking into account, the nature of the
products, its effluents and its location?

</p><p id="p_65">      (iii)  Whether the operation of the industry is likely
to   affect  the  sensitive   catchment	 area  resulting  in
pollution  of  the  Himayat  Sagar  and	 Osman	Sagar  lakes
supplying drinking water to the twin cities of Hyderabad and
Secunderabad?
</p>
<p id="p_66">

</p><p id="p_67">      On point (a)(i), it noticed that the industry is

      to  use,	among 12 major items, - 70 Kgs.	  of  nickel
based

      catalyst	( Pellets) per day and that the raw material
is

      to be stored atleast for 30 days.	 It observed that

      according	  to   Chapter	  8.0	 of   NFPA,   Hazard
classification,

      the raw materials used by the industry are serious

      health hazards, highly inflammable and re-active at

      elevated	temperatures  and  pressures.	Four  items,
Nickel,

      Ammonia,	Methanol  and Hydrochloric Acid are used  in
the

      process.	After referring to the various plants and

      processes, the NEAA referred to the provisions of the

      <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_51">Factories Act</a> ( as amended in 1987) and <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_52">Section 2</a> (cb)

      defining	'hazardous processes and Schedule I  thereof
in

      which item 25 refers to 'extraction of oils and fats

      from vegetable and animal sources" as hazardous

      processes.    It	 referred  to	Rule  2(h)  of	 the
'Manufacture,

      Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989'

      issued  under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_53">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,  1986.
It

      referred to the provisions in the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_54">Environment

      (Protection)  Act</a>,  <a href="/doc/379900/" id="a_55">Section 2(e)</a>, <a href="/doc/71230/" id="a_56">2(f)</a> and  <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_57">2(d)</a>.	  It
agreed

      that  merely because an industry is hazardous does not
by

      itself debar it but then <a href="/doc/119227/" id="a_58">Section 8</a> of that act would

      come into play.  It answered question (i) in the

      affirmative that the industry is hazardous.


      On point a(ii), it referred to the definition of

      'pollution' in <a href="/doc/547105/" id="a_59">section 2(c)</a> of the Water Act, <a href="/doc/71230/" id="a_60">section

      2(f)</a> which defines 'sewage effluent' and <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_61">section 2(k)</a>

      which defines 'trade effluent' and observed that the

      'pollution potential' of the industry was to be

      assessed.	   After  referring  to	  the  effluents   -
Commercial

      Castor oil, Bleaching earth, Activated carbon, Nickel

      catalyst,	 Hyflo	supercel,  Sulphuric  Acid,  Caustic
Soda,

      Methanol, Calcium Oxide, Alum - in all 1463 MTs per

      month  and  noticed that the monthly requirement of  3
Hydrogen was 76 500 NM.	 As the industry is coal based,

      large  quantity  coal is required.  It  would  produce
huge

      quantities of BSS, HCO, HSA, Methyl, Fatty acids,

      Epoxidise, Glyceren etc.	Hydroxy Stearic Acid, methyl

      Hydroxy Stearic Acid and methanol are serious health

      hazardous.  Items in part II list of Schedule I to the

      'Manufacture,   Storage	and   Import  of   Hazardous
Chemicals

      Rules, 1989' are the raw materials and RW2 ( Dr.	G.S.

      Siddhu)	in  his	 evidence   agreed  that  these	 are
hazardous

      (	 toxic)	 chemicals.  The solid	effluents  generated
every

      day are (i) spent bleaching earth 1250 Kgs, (ii) spent

      bleaching	 carbon 250 kgs, (iii) spent nickel catalyst
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">45</span>

      kgs.  and (iv) sodium sulphate 3820 Kgs.	(12-HSA) and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">170</span>

      kgs.  ( from CME).  Monthly turn out of effluents will
be

      400  MT.	 Every day 55 kgs.  of nickel  is  consumed.
Every

      day,  27,830  litres  of	water are  to  be  used	 and
normally

      the   effluent   will  carry   all   these   hazardous
substances,

      including nickel.	 'As it is said that the water used

      could be re-used for cultivation of lands in the

      premises	of  the industry, the toxic chemicals  which
get

      lodged  in  the surface layers of the soil  will	flow
down

      in  storm run offs or percolate into the ground water,
to

      ultimately reach the water body of the two reservoirs.

      The NEAA further stated that Dr.Santappa in his

      evidence as RW-1 made admissions regarding gaseous

      effluents - - fly ash, SO CO Oxides of Nitrogen,

      Oxides  of  Sulphur and suspended particulate  matter.
The

      solid  and  liquid  effluents could  reach  the  lakes
through

      seepage.	 The  factory  cannot  be  located  in	 the
catchment

      area because run-offs due to rain will carry hazardous

      material along surface and through seepage.  The NEAA

      adverted	to  the	 'Drainage Basic  Analysis'  by	 the
Central

      Ground Water Board, to the effect that the Basin "has

      moderate	run-off and moderately high permeability  of
the

      terrain.	As such the amount of infiltration is

      considerably  high".   The  said	 Report	 shows	that
rainfall

      in 796 mm ( heaviest being 1326 mm) and there is every

      likelihood of the solids being "transported down along

      the  gradient".	The  said Report of  Central  Ground
Water

      Board,  referred	to "dolerite dykes" in the  vicinity
and

      the  possibility of flow even more.  Having regard  to
the

      location of the dyke and the speed and angle, the

      polluted	water  could  reach Himayat Sagar  which  is
hardly

      2	 m  bgl.   since  the dam height  is  1763.50  feet.
Satellite

      maps of NSRA were also examined and relied for this

      purpose.	Among the substances stored are nickel,

      sulphuric acid, HCA, which are well-known 'hazardous'

      substances.
</p>
<p id="p_68">      The NEAA pointed out that the 'Engineering

      Package'	provided  by  the  IICT to  the	 industry  (
Ex.p.29)

      as  found	 in the agreement with the IICT,  "does	 not
refer

      at all to the nature of pollutants to be generated in

      this  industry  or to the methods adopted	 to  control
them,

      as  asserted  by RW2".  The NEAA pointed out  that  in
fact

      clause  17(5)  of Annexure IV to the agreement  stated
that

      'the scope of supply (engineering package) does not

      include design of effluent treatment system'.  On this

      ground the article in IICT Bulletin ( Ex.R 1) was

      rejected by the NEAA.
</p>
<p id="p_69">

      The NEAA also referred to the Report of the three

      man   Technical  Committee  of   the  Andhra   Pradesh
Pollution

      Control  Board  consisting of Dr.	 J.M.  Dave ( PW  3)
and

      that  "accidents	and  human   failure  are  the	most
probable

      causes for spillage and it is unrealistic to give a

      'zero spillage', and specially to their report on

      'nickel'	and  held that the respondent  industry	 has
high

      pollution potentiality under issue a(ii).



      The NEAA, then took up issue (b) as to the

      likelihood of the industry affecting the sensitive

      catchment area.  It referred to the Expert Committee

      Report of the HMWSSB and its recommendations which led

      to the issuance of the GO 192 dated 31.3.94 and GO 111

      date d8/.3.96.  The NEAA concluded that the

      "establishment of any chemical industry, carries with

      it, the imminent dangers of the chemicals or chemical

      effluents	 polluting  the water of Himayat  Sagar	 and
Osman

      Sagar.
</p>
<p id="p_70">
      Thus, the exhaustive Report of the NEAA has gone

      against the 7th respondent industry.



      (B)Report	 of Bombay University Department of Chemical
Technology headed by Dr.  Bhowmick:


</p><p id="p_71">      The Department of Chemical Technology, Bombay

      University,  in  its Report dated 16.8.2000 have	gone
into

      the  other aspects as to what should be the safeguards
to

      be taken by the industry if the appellant-Board's

      letter dated 16.7.97 is to be applied.  Dr.  Bhowmick

      suggested that 'No nickel catalyst whether present in

      any solid waste or in any solution be allowed to spill

      on floor/ground.	The process should not emit gaseous

      harmful  vapours.	 Adequate and ready safety  measures
must

      be made available for accidental leakage/spillage

      situations.  They then gave six suggestions - storage

      tanks to be surrounded by bunds;	that it is not

      advisable to use hydrochloric acid but sulphuric acid

      may  be  used.  Again, accidental leakage	 of  ammonia
will

      be catastrophic.	Alternately, hydrogen gas may be

      brought in cylinders.  He expressed doubts about plate

      and  frame filter press or of leaf filters.   Quantity
of

      methanol stored should not exceed more than a week's

      requirement.   The  floor	 washing water	should	pass
through

      oil traps and then properly treated in an effluent

      treatment plant.	If salt and ionic impurities are not

      removed, it may produce ground water contamination.


      (C)Report	 of National Geophysical Research Institute,
Hyderabad


      Finally, the NGRI, Hyderabad has given a very

      detailed and exhaustive report about "IMPACT OF DYKE".

      They conducted (i) field investigations, (ii)

      Hydrogeological studies, (iii) Geophysical

      investigation, (iv) Electric Resistivity investigation

</p><p id="p_72">      (v)  Magnetic  survey  and (vi) Tracer  studies.	 The
Report

      is a voluminous one.
</p>
<p id="p_73">
      The final conclusion after an exhaustive analysis

      of various types of data "from results of multi-

      parameter investigations carried out in the area, is

      that hydraulic connectivity exists across the dolerite

      dyke located between Chouderguda and Sirsilmuktha

      facilitating the ground water movement.....In the post

      monsoon scenario, the groundwater tabel will go up and

      thereby may result in more groundwater flow across the

      dyke.
</p>
<p id="p_74">      Our conclusion on the basis of these Reports:


      In the light of the above exhaustive scientific

      Reports of the National Environmental Appellate

      Authority, New Delhi the Department of Chemical

      Technology, Bombay University and the National

      Geophysical  Research Institute, Hyderabad - it cannot
be

      said that the two lakes will not be endangered.  The

      package of the IICT - which did not deal with the

      elimination of effluent effects, the opinion of Dr.

      Santappa, the view of Director of Industries, and the

      view  of the Government of Andhra Pradesh must be held
to

      be base on insufficient data and not scientifically

      accurate.
</p>
<p id="p_75">

      It is no doubt stated by the 7th respondent that

      it  is prepared to adopt the safety measures suggested
by

      the appellant Board on 1.7.97 and also those suggested

      by Dr.  Bhowmick, by trying to see that during storage
of

      raw materials and after release of the hazardous

      liquids, they are put in containers and removed.


      In respect of these drinking water -reservoirs

      which cater to the needs of about 70 or 80 lakhs

      population, we cannot rely upon a bare assurance that

      care will be taken in the storage of serious hazardous

      materials.  Nor can we rely on an assurance that these

      hazardous substances would be effectively removed

      without spillage.	 It is, in our view, not humanly

      possible for any department to keep track whether the

      pollutants  are  not  spilled over.  This	 is  exactly
where

      the 'precautionary principle' comes into play.  The

      chance of an accident, within such close proximity of

      the reservoirs cannot be ruled out, as pointed out in

      the Reports.  Thus, we are led to the inference that

      there is a very great risk that these highly hazardous

      material	could  seep  into the earth  and  reach	 the
tanks,

      after  passing through the dolerite dykes, as  pointed
by

      the National Geophysical Research Institute.  Our

      inference from facts and the reports is that of a

      reasonable person, as pointed out in the main judgment

      in A.P.  Pollution Board Vs.  Prof.  M.V.	 Nayudu.



      On the basis of the scientific material now

      obtained by this Court from three highly reputed

      sources,	this  is  certainly  not   a  fit  case	 for
directing

      grant  of	 NOC by the Pollution Control Board.  It  is
not

      also possible to hold that the safeguards suggested by

      the appellant Board - pursuant to the direction of the

      Government  dated	 3.7.97,  will be adequate,  in	 the
light

      of  the Reports.	We therefore hold that in the  facts
of

      this case, the Board could not be directed to suggest

      safeguards   and	there  is   every  likelihood	that
safeguards

      could fail either due to accident, as stated in the

      report, or due to human error.  We, therefore, hold on

      point 3 against the 7th respondent-industry.


      Point 4:
</p>
<p id="p_76">
      This point deals with the principle of promissory

      estoppel applied by the appellate authority, on the

      ground  that  once building permission and  permission
for

      change of land use were granted, the appellant Board

      could   not  refuse  NOC.	   The	learned	  Additional
Solicitor

      General,	Sri R.N.  Trivedi referred to the  amendment
to

      <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_62">Section 25(1)</a> in this connection.



      Under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_63">Section 25</a> (1) of the Water (Prevention and

      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_64">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 as it original stood,

      sub-section (1) thereof read as follows:


      "<a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_65">Section	25(1)</a>:	 Subject to the provisions  of	this
section,  no  person shall, without the previous consent  of

trade effluent into a stream or well".



</p><p id="p_77">      <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_66">By  Central  Act</a> 53/1988, the sub-section was  amended
and

      reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      After the amendment, the prohibition now extends even

      to 'establishment' of the industry of taking of steps

      for that process and therefore before consent of the

      Pollution	 Board is obtained, neither can the industry
be

      established  nor	any steps can be taken to  establish
it.</blockquote><p id="p_79">




</p><p id="p_80">      The learned Additional Solicitor General of India,

      Sri Trivedi is right in contending that the 7th

      respondent industry ought not to have taken steps to

      obtain  approval	of plans by the Gram Panchayat,	 nor
for

      conversion of land use by the Collector, nor should it

      have proceeded with civil work in a installation of

      machinery.   The action of the industry being contrary
to

      the provisions of the Act, no equities can be claimed.


      The learned Appellate Authority erred in thinking

      that because of the approval of plan by the Panchayat,

      or conversion of land use by the Collector or grant of

      letter of intent by the Central Government, a case for

      applying principle of "promissory estoppel" applied to

      the facts of this case.  There could be no estoppel

      against the statute.  The industry could not therefore

      seek an NOC after violating the policy decision of the

      Government.  Point 4 is decided against the 7th

      respondent accordingly.

      Point 5:
</p>
<p id="p_82">
      In this Court's earlier judgment dated 27.1.99,

      this Court referred to the need for constituting

      environmental Courts, tribunals, or appellate bodies

      comprising of environmental scientists/experts as

      members.	 We  had  then	referred   to  the  need  to
constitute

      Environmental Courts as done in New South Wales in

      Australia.    In	 this	Court's	 earlier   judgment,
responses

      of various States and Universities were called for in

      this behalf.  Some States &amp; Union Territories have

      responded but several have not responded.


      We may in this connection refer to the recent

      report   entitled	  'Environmental    Court   Project'
published

      on 18.2.2000 by a Research team at the Department of

      Land Economy, University of Cambridge, UK, headed by

      Prof.  Malcoum Grant.  (See Journal of Planning and

      Environment, May, 2000 p.453 titled 'The use for

      Environmental Courts').  The aim of the team was to

      explore the concept of an Environmental Court in the

      light of the experience in other jurisdictions and in

      Australia and New Zealand in particular.	The concepts

      referred to in the Report are


</p><p id="p_83">      (a) a specialist and exclusive jurisdiction;

</p><p id="p_84">      (b) a power to determine merits appeals;

</p><p id="p_85">      (c)  vertical  and horizontal integration, by this  is
meant  a  wide environmental jurisdiction  which  integrates
both   subject	 matter	 and   different  types	  of   legal
proceedings;
</p>
<p id="p_86">      (d) hall marks of a Court or tribunal;

</p><p id="p_87">      (e)  dispute resolution powers, it is pointed out that
this  Court  extend  to disputes over the formu-  lation  of
policy as well as more traditional adjudication;

</p><p id="p_88">      (f)  expertise,  the  members would be  specialist  in
environmental matters;
</p>
<p id="p_89">      (g)  access, there would be broad rights of access  to
the Court;
</p>
<p id="p_90">      (h)  informality	of procedures - such as the  use  of
alternative dispute resolution procedures;

</p><p id="p_91">      (i)  costs - this is linked to the need for access and
involves  means	 of  overcoming the problem  of	 high  costs
crihibifing access;  or

</p><p id="p_92">      (j) capacity for innovation.
</p>
<p id="p_93">
      The Report puts forward a proposal for a two-tier

      Environmental   Court.	The	Court	would	have
jurisdiction

      and  powers  including  judicial	 review	 and   civil
procedure

      powers while dealing with environmental matters.


      Inasmuch as most of the statutes dealing with

      Environment are by Parliament, we would think that the

      Law Commission could kindly consider the question of

      review of the environmental laws and the need for

      constitution of Environmental Courts with experts in

      environmental law, in addition to judicial members, in

      the  light of experience in other countries.  Point  5
is

      decided accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_94">
      Point 6:
</p>
<p id="p_95">
      Learned counsel for the seventh respondent

      referred to the existence of several other industries

      within  the  10  k.m.  radius of the  two	 reservoirs,
which

      have  been  granted permission earlier.  According  to
him,

      these  industries	 are also polluting industries.	  In
our

      view, the Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986 and the

      <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_68">Water Act</a>, 1974 and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_69">Air Act</a>, 1981 have enough

      provision	 applicable  not  only	 to  new  industries
proposed

      to be established but also to existing industries.



      The State of Andhra Pradesh is therefore directed

      hereby to identify these industries located within 10

      K.M.  radius of these two lakes and to take action in

      consultation with the A.P.Pollution Control Board to

      prevent pollution to the drinking water in these two

      reservoirs.  The State and the Board shall not permit

      any polluting industries within the 10 k.m radius.  A

      report  shall be submitted to this Court by the  State
of

      Andhra Pradesh in this behalf within four months from

      today,  in  regard  to   the  pollution  or  pollution
potential

      of industries, if any, existing within 10 K.M.  of the

      lakes.   After the Report is received, the matter	 may
be

      listed.  Point 6 is decided accordingly.







      In the result, the appeal is allowed, the

      judgment of the High Court and the order of the

      appellate authority under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_70">section 28</a> of the Water Act,

      1974  are	 set  aside and the order of  the  appellant
Board

      refusing permission to the seventh respondent under

      <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_71">section 25</a> of the Water Act is restored.



      Before parting with the case, we acknowledge the

      excellent Reports submitted to this Court by the three

      expert bodies on the basis of scientific/technological

      research	of  a very high order.	The amount  of	hard
work

      done by these three bodies is commendable.  But for

      these expert reports it would have been very difficult

      for this Court to resolve the complicated scientific

      issues  involved	in this case, with  confidence.	  It
will

      be open to the three expert bodies (1) National

      Environmental Appellate Authority, New Delhi (2) The

      University Department of Chemical Technology

      (Autonomous),  Matunga, Bombay headed by Dr.  Bhowmick
and

      (3) The National Geophysical Research Institute,

      Tarnaka,	Hyderabad, to submit their list of  expenses
or

      fee,  if any, to the State of Andhra Pradesh,  through
the

      appellant	 Board.	 If any claims for monies are  made,
the

      same shall be paid by the State of Andhra Pradesh.







      Appeals are allowed as stated above.  No costs.

      List the matter after 4 months, after the Report

      of the State of Andhra Pradesh as directed above, is

      received.
