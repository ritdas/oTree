<p id="p_1">                            The first respondent herein filed a complaint against the

                      petitioners and the respondents 2 to 7 under Section 25 of Tamil Nadu

                      Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (herein after

                      referred to as “the Act”), before the learned District Munsif-cum-

                      Judicial Magistrate, Sriperumbudur, which was taken on file in

                      C.C.No.219 of 2015. Pending the above case, the petitioners along

                      with respondents 2 to 7 have filed a miscellaneous petition in

                      C.M.P.No.1822 of 2015, seeking discharge. The learned Magistrate,

                      after hearing both sides, had dismissed the petition by an order dated

                      29.12.2015, against which, the accused 1 &amp; 2 have filed the present

                      criminal revision before this Court.

                      would submit that the first respondent has no locus standi to file a

                      private complaint against the petitioners. The petitioner had obtained

                      consent from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (herein after

                      referred to as “the Board”)      for establishment of the factory and

                      operated the same. The Board has sent a notice for violation of

                      certain conditions and soon after receiving the said notice, the




http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                          3</span>

                      petitioner had closed the factory and therefore they have not

                      committed any offence.      Since the petitioners had violated certain

                      conditions, the Board had sent notice, for which, the petitioners had

                      sent a proper reply, and hence it is between the Board and the

                      petitioners . The first respondent, being a private person, has no locus

                      standi to file a complaint against the petitioner Company. Further, the

                      allegations made in the complaint does not constitute an offence under

                      <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_5">Section 25</a> of the Act. If there is any violation of the conditions by the

                      petitioners, it is for the Board to take any action against the

                      petitioners. The Board has not taken any criminal action against the

                      petitioners and they only returned the application submitted by the

                      petitioner and sent a notice and the petitioners    also replied for the

                      said notice. The trial Court failed to consider these aspects and

                      erroneously dismissed the petition, seeking discharge, which warrants

                      serious interference.

                      that   <a href="/doc/117249249/" id="a_6">Section 49(b)</a> of the Act enables any person to file a private

                      complaint after effecting 60 days prior notice to the Board, which has

                      been complied with by the first respondent and hence the contention

                      of the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners that this

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                         4</span>

                      first respondent has no locus standi to file a complaint against the

                      petitioners is not acceptable. Further in the complaint, there are

                      allegations, which clearly reveals that the petitioners had committed

                      offence under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_7">Section 25</a> of the Act. The learned Magistrate had

                      elaborately discussed all the contentions raised by the learned Senior

                      Counsel and given reasons for dismissal of the petition, seeking

                      discharge. Therefore, the petitioners have to face trial for the offence

                      committed by them.

                      petitioners and the learned counsel appearing for the first respondent

                      and perused the materials available on record.

<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">                            5     Admittedly the petitioners had obtained consent from the

                      Board to establish the Factory and subsequently, for the violation of

                      certain conditions by the petitioners, the Board had issued a notice and

                      as per <a href="/doc/117249249/" id="a_8">Section 49</a> (b) of the Act, the Board or any person can file a

                      private complaint, after compliance of 60 days notice. The first

                      respondent had issued notice as contemplated under <a href="/doc/117249249/" id="a_9">Section 49</a> (b) of

                      the Act and therefore question of locus standi does not arise and the

                      learned Magistrate also answered accordingly. <a href="/doc/117249249/" id="a_10">Section 49</a> (b) of the

                      Act reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                “(b) any person who has given notice of not less than
                                sixty days, in the manner prescribed, of the alleged
                                offence and of his intention to make a complaint, to
                                the Board or officer authorised as aforesaid, and no
                                court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a
                                judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any
                                offence punishable under this Act.”
                              6    Therefore, the first respondent has locus standi to file a

                      complaint against the petitioners. Further there are prima facie

                      allegations against the petitioners and while deciding petition, seeking

                      discharge, the Court has to see the allegations made in the complaint

                      and the documents annexed with the complaint and not defence of the

                      accused. The probative value of the materials need not be gone into at

                      this stage and the same cane be done only after trial.</blockquote><p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">                              7      In the result, the criminal revision is dismissed as there is

                      no illegality or infirmity in the order passed by the Court below, and

                      the Court below is directed to proceed further, in accordance with law.

                      Further, the personal appearance of the petitioner before the Court

                      below is dispensed with. However, the petitioner is directed to appear
