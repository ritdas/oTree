             The complainants have filed this complaint, under <a href="/doc/24424029/" id="a_2">Section

17(1)(a)(i)</a> of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (in short 'the Act')

seeking following directions to the opposite parties:

                 respective dates of payment with interest at the rate of

<p id="p_11">Facts of the Complaint

</p><p id="p_12">2.           Brief facts, as averred in the complaint are that the

complainants approached the opposite parties in June, 2014 to

purchase a residential plot for their own residence. The opposite

party No.3 showed a plot measuring 200 sq. yards in Mega

Housing Project named as Altus Muirwoods Ecocity at New

Chandigarh, Mohali. On 16.06.2014, an agreement was executed

between         the     complainants   and   opposite   party   No.3   and

complainants paid a sum of Rs.10,00,000/-                by cheque and

Rs.6,00,000/- as cash as registration charges and earnest money

for the plot 200 sq. yards at the rate of Rs.15,550/- per sq. yards.

The total sale consideration of the plot was fixed as Rs.35,00,000/-

including all types of charges etc. Further the complainants on

10.02.2015 paid Rs.1,40,000/- by cheque to opposite party No.1.

Later, the complainants requested opposite party No.1 to change

the plot size from 200 sq. yards to 150 sq. yards due to some

domestic problem. On 03.07.2015, the opposite party No.1 got

signed a pre-prepared and pre-drafted Buyers Agreement with

opposite party No.1. In the said agreement, the cash payment of

Rs.6,00,000/- was not shown in the agreement and also price of

the plot was shown as Rs.16,497/- per sq. yards as per which the

total sale consideration of the plot is Rs.26,23,518/- for the plot size

measuring 159.03 sq. yards. On asking about the receipt of

Rs.6,00,000/-, the opposite parties assured that the receipt will be

handed over within time. Against the total sale consideration, the

complainants have paid a sum of Rs.27,40,001/- to the opposite

parties on different dates.         On 14.07.2015, opposite party No.1

issued a Tentative Plot Allotment Letter without any size

specifications to the complainants and allotted plot No.1642 in their

name. Further, on 30.08.2015, a Provisional Allotment Letter was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Consumer Complaint No.298 of 2019                                      4</span>



issued to the complainants without any size and specifications. On

demand of Rs.3,00,000/-, the complainants told the opposite

parties that Rs.27,40,001/- has already been paid to the opposite

parties and the excess amount be adjusted. However, on

23.12.2015, the complainants were forced to pay Rs.3,00,000/-. In

this way, the complainants paid a sum of Rs.30,40,001/- to the

opposite parties. As per the agreement, the possession was to be

delivered to the complainants within 30 months with extended

grace period of 6 months from the date of agreement i.e. by

03.07.2018. However, the possession was not delivered within the

time frame. It has been further averred that the complainants

shocked to see on visit to the site that there was no development

and opposite parties were delaying the matter on one pretext or

other. It also came to know to the complainants that necessary

approvals have not been obtained by the opposite parties. The

opposite parties have violated the provisions of PAPRA. Alleging

deficiency in service and unfair trade practice on the part of the

opposite parties, the complainants filed the complaint seeking the

above mentioned reliefs.
</p>
<p id="p_13">3.        Upon notice, the opposite parties appeared through their

counsel, however, opposite parties No.3 &amp; 4 did not file their written

statement with the prescribed period, therefore, the defence of

opposite parties No.3 &amp; 4 struck off vide order dated 02.09.2019.

</p><p id="p_14">4.        Opposite parties No.1, 2, 5, &amp; 6 filed their written statement

taking preliminary objections that the CLU was approved for the

Residential Housing Project by the Government for 127.58 acre of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> Consumer Complaint No.298 of 2019                                      5</span>



land. Prior to that CLU for 229.77 acre of land was granted on

17.11.2011 for 26.41 acre was granted on 14.05.2012 and CLU for

23.75 acre was granted on 25.06.2013. The Chief Town Planner,

Punjab on 31.03.2015 cleared the layout plan. It has been further

contended that a Plot Buyers Agreement dated 03.07.2015 was

executed between the complainants and opposite party No.1. As

per clause 5.1(a) of the agreement the possession was to be

handed over within 30 months or with an extended period of 6

months, subject to timely payments. Further as per clause 5.1(d)

Developer shall be entitled to reasonable extension in offering /

delivery of possession of the plot to the purchaser. As per Clause

5.1(c) of the agreement the opposite party No.1 is liable to pay

Rs.5/- per sq. yards per month of the area of the plot for delaying in

handing over the possession. As per clause 5.3(c) if for any reason

the developer is not in a position to offer the plot, he would offer the

purchaser an alternative property or refund the amount in full with

interest at the rate of 9% per annum without any further liability.

The opposite parties have environmental clearance from the

government authorities.              The agreement contains Arbitration

Clause i.e. <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_3">Article 13</a>, hence this Commission has no jurisdiction to

entertain the complaint.            The Plot bearing No.1642 has already

been allotted to the complainant.               The plots are ready for

possession to be handed over as per stipulated terms and

conditions in the agreement. The complainants are not consumers

as they have purchased the plot, in question, for investment

purposes. On merits, it is submitted that the development of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Consumer Complaint No.298 of 2019                                    6</span>



project is at final stage and plots are ready for possession. There is

no deficiency in service or unfair trade practice on the part of the

opposite parties. Rest all the other averments as averred by the

complainants in their complaint were denied and prayed to dismiss

the complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_15">5.        To prove their claim, the complainants have filed their join

affidavit along with documents as Ex.C-1 to Ex.C-12.

</p><p id="p_16">6.        On the other hand, the opposite parties No.1,2,5 &amp; 6 have

filed the affidavit of Narinder Singh Sidhu, General Manager /

Authorized Signatory along with documents as Ex.OP-1/1 to

Ex.OP-1/6, Ex.OP-1/7(coll) &amp; Ex.OP-1/8(colly).

</p><p id="p_17">7.        I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have

carefully gone through the record.
</p>
<p id="p_18">8.        It has been vehemently argued by the learned counsel for

the complainants on 16.06.2014 entered into an agreement with

the opposite parties for purchasing a plot measuring 200 sq. yards

in their project and paid a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- by cheque and

Rs.6,00,000/- as cash as            earnest money. The total sale

consideration of the plot was fixed as Rs.35,00,000/- including all

types of charges etc. However, the complainants due to domestic

problem requested to change the said plot from 200 sq. yards to

150 sq. yards. On this, another Buyer's agreement was entered

into between the parties on 03.07.2015, in which the opposite

parties had not shown the detail of Rs.6,00,000/- received in cash

and moreover the price of the plot was shown as Rs.16,497/- per

sq. yards, according to that total sale consideration of the plot is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> Consumer Complaint No.298 of 2019                                            7</span>



comes to Rs.26,23,518/- for the plot size measuring 159.03 sq.

yards. Against the total sale consideration, the complainants have

paid a sum of Rs.30,40,001/- to the opposite parties on different

dates. On 14.07.2015, opposite party No.1 issued a Tentative Plot

Allotment        Letter       without   any   size   specifications   to   the

complainants. Further, on 30.08.2015, a Provisional Allotment

Letter was issued to the complainants without any size and

specifications. As per the agreement, the possession was to be

delivered within 30 months with extended grace period of 6 months

from the date of agreement i.e. by 03.07.2018. But the possession

was not delivered with the time frame. On visit to the site, the

complainants found no development at site and the opposite

parties put off the matter on one pretext or other. The opposite

parties have also not obtained the necessary approvals from the

competent authorities. The opposite parties have also violated the

provisions of PAPRA. This act and conduct of the opposite parties

amounts to deficiency in service and unfair trade practice on their

part. Hence, the present complaint seeking the above mentioned

reliefs.
</p>
<p id="p_19">9.         Per contra, it has been vehemently contended by the

learned counsel for the opposite parties that the complainants are

investors, who have invested their money in order to earn profits

and, as such, they do not fall in the definition of "consumer" as

defined in the C.P. Act. There is arbitration clause 13.1, 13.2 and

13.3 in <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_4">Article 13</a> of the Buyer's Agreement and, as such, this

Commission has no jurisdiction to try the complaint. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> Consumer Complaint No.298 of 2019                                       8</span>



development works of the project are at final stage and the plots

are ready for possession. The complainants failed to make the

payment and have filed the complaint because of slump in real

estate sector. However, for the delayed period the complainants

are entitled to Rs.5/- per square yard per month of the area of the

plot as per clause 5.1(c) of the said Buyer's Agreement. The CLU

and layout plans have already been approved by the competent

authorities. There is no deficiency in service on the part of the

opposite parties and the complaint filed by the complainants is

liable to be dismissed with costs.
</p>
<p id="p_20">10.       I have given my thoughtful consideration to the respective

contentions raised by the learned counsel for both the parties.

</p><p id="p_21">11.       At the outset it is pertinent to mention that identical matters

have already been decided by this Commission in the following

cases:
</p>
<p id="p_22">   i)      Consumer Complaint No.433 of 2019 (Anil Kumar

           Sharma Vs. The M/s Altus Space Builders Pvt. Ltd. &amp;

           Anr.) decided on 17.10.2019.
</p>
<p id="p_23">   ii)     Consumer Complaint No.297 of 2019 (Sukchain Singh &amp;

           others) decided on 03.10.2019;

</p>
<p id="p_25">12.       The matter in the present complaint is squarely covered by

the orders passed in above said cases, so I intend to decide the

present complaint in view of orders passed in above said cases.

</p><p id="p_26">13.       Firstly, I would like to dispose of preliminary objections

raised by opposite parties in its written statement that the

complainants do not fall under the definition of "consumer" as

defined in the Act, on the ground that they purchased the plot for

speculative purposes.
</p>
<p id="p_27">14.       In this regard, it is relevant to mention here that there is no

evidence from the side of the opposite parties to prove that the

complainants are indulging in sale/purchase of property for

commercial purpose. Therefore, simple assertion in this regard in

the reply of opposite party No.1, without any cogent and

convincing evidence in support thereof, is not sufficient to prove

this fact. Hon'ble National Commission in <a href="/doc/86361597/" id="a_5">M/s IREO FIVERIVER

PVT. LTD. v. SURINDER KUMAR SINGLA &amp; OTHERS First

Appeal No</a>.1358 of 2016, decided on 29.11.2016, while relying

upon its earlier decision in <a href="/doc/87137813/" id="a_6">KAVITA AHUJA &amp; OTHERS v.

SHIPRA ESTATE LTD. &amp; JAI KRISHNA STATE DEVELOPERS

PVT. LTD. &amp; OTHERS Consumer Case No</a>.137 of 2010, decided

on 12.02.2015, held the complainants as consumers, observing

that the appellant failed to show any cogent evidence, which may

indicate that the respondents/complainants or any of them has

been indulging in sale/purchase of the properties or that the

complainants or any one of them had booked the subject plots in

the development project undertaken by the appellant with the

intention to sell the plot on subsequent date for earning profit. The

Hon'ble National Commission in III (2015) CPJ 63 (NC) Beatty
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> Consumer Complaint No.298 of 2019                                  10</span>



Tony versus Prestige Estate Projects Pvt. Ltd., also held that

merely on booking of the plot it cannot be presumed that it is

booked for 'commercial purpose' and the complainant was

considered as a 'consumer'. In the instant case also, as already

discussed above, there is no evidence led by the opposite parties

to prove that the complainants indulged in sale/purchase of

properties or that they purchased the plot, in question, for further

sale or for earning profits. Accordingly, the above said

objection/contention of opposite parties is rejected and the

complainants are held to be 'consumers', under the Act.

</p><p id="p_28">15.       So far as the other objection of opposite parties that the

matter is to be referred to arbitration under clause 13.1, 13.2 and

13.3 of the Buyer's Agreement dated 16.06.2014, Ex.C-1, is

concerned, it is relevant to mention that the Larger Bench of the

Hon'ble National Commission, vide order dated 13.07.2017,

passed in Consumer Complaint No.701 of 2015 titled as "Aftab

Singh Versus EMAAR MGF Land Limited &amp; Anr. held that an

Arbitration Clause in the afore-stated kind of Agreements between

the complainants and the builder cannot circumscribe the

jurisdiction of a Consumer Fora, notwithstanding the amendments

made to <a href="/doc/1232861/" id="a_7">Section 8</a> of the Arbitration Act. The Civil Appeal No.(s)

23512-23513 of 2017 (M/s EMAAR MGF Land Limited &amp; Anr.

National Commission had also been dismissed by the Apex Court,

Apex Court on 10.12.2018. Consequently, the existence of an

Arbitration Clause is not a bar to resolution of this dispute by this

Commission. Accordingly, the said objection of opposite parties is

hereby rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_29">16.       Now, coming to merits of the case, admittedly, the an

agreement dated 16.06.2014, Ex.C-1, was executed into between

the complainants and opposite parties, wherein the complainants

agreed to purchase a plot measuring 200 sq. yards in the project

of the opposie aprties for the total sale consideration of

Rs.15,500/- per sq. yards, which includes CLU charges only. In

the agreement, it has been specifically mentioned that a sum of

Rs.16,00,000/- has been received by the opposite parties and rest

Rs.14,50,000/- was to be given at the time of offer of allotment

and Rs.500/- per sq. yard at time of possession. Vide letter dated

19.04.2015, Ex.C-3, the complainants requested the opposite

parties to change the plot from 200 sq. yards to 150 sq. yards.

Thereafter, a Plot Buyer's Agreement dated 03.07.2015 was

executed between the complainants and opposite parties, wherein

the complainants were allotted a plot measuring 159.03 sq. yards

at the Basic Sale Price of Rs.16,30,058/- excluding other charges.

As per <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_8">Article 5.1(a</a>), the possession was to be delivered within a

period of thirty months or within an extended period of six months

from the date of signing of the agreement. The relevant <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_9">Article

</p><p id="p_31">          Further as per <a href="/doc/507956/" id="a_10">Article 5.3(c)</a> in case the Developer is not at

all in a position to offer the plot, he would give alternate property

or refund of the amount in full along with interest at the rate of 9%

        further liability to pay damages or any other compensation."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">17.       Against the total sale consideration the complainants have

paid Rs.30,40,069/- to the opposite parties. To prove this fact, the

complainants have placed Agreement to Sell dated, 16.06.2014,

Ex.C-1, Receipts, Ex.C-2, Ex.C-5, Ex.C-6, Ex.C-7, Ex.C-8 and

Ex.C-11. As per the agreement dated 03.07.2015, the stipulated

period for delivery of possession expired on 03.07.2018, but the

opposite parties failed to complete the development works and

deliver possession of the plot to the complainant till today.

</p><p id="p_33">18.       Opposite parties in their written statement stated that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> Consumer Complaint No.298 of 2019                                    13</span>



development works of the project are at final stage and they are

ready to hand over possession of the plot to the complainants. It

has got environmental clearance as well as other required

clearances from the Government authorities. However, no

evidence has been led by the opposite parties to evident

development at the site. This admission of opposite parties belies

their own stand that the development of the project is at final

stage.
</p>
<p id="p_34">19.       The Hon'ble National Commission in its order dated

13.06.2018 passed in First Appeal No.855 of 2018 (<a href="/doc/131354966/" id="a_12">Vision India

Realtors Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. Sanjeev Malhotra</a>), categorically

held that legal possession cannot be delivered in the absence of

Completion Certificate issued by the Competent Authority. It was

held in Para No.5 as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">    1. During the course of hearing, it was submitted by the
        learned counsel for the appellant that the completion
        certificate in respect of the project was obtained by the
        appellant on 15.03.2016. A copy of the communication
        dated 15.03.2016 from Municipal Council, Kharar has been
        placed on record. It is therefore, evident that the completion
        certificate having been received only on 15.03.2016, the
        appellant could not have offered legal possession of the
        apartment to the complainant at a ny time before that date.
        As noted earlier, the amount of Rs.1,81,375/- was
        demanded on 20.04.2015 and the amount of Rs.2,12,489/-
        was demanded on 06.02.2016. The complainant was
        requested to pay the aforesaid amount so that the appellant
        could offer the possession of the flat.

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">        The said offer of possession was meaningless being
        unlawful as the requisite c ompletion certificate had not been
        obtained by that date......."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_35">20.       However,          no Completion           Certificate issued   by the

competent authority has been produced by the opposite parties on

the record, which itself is violation of above reproduced Section 14

of PAPRA and Clause 3.12 (i) of the Notification dated 7th July,

2015 published in the Punjab Government Gazette Extraordinary

by Department of Local Government (Town Planning Wing) as

well as Section 272 of The Punjab Municipal Corporation Act,

1976, reproduced above. Even till today, no Completion Certificate

has been produced before this Commission. Thus, in view of the

law laid down by the Hon'ble National Commission in the above

noted authority, in the absence of such a certificate issued by the

competent authority, it cannot be said that development at the site

has been completed in all respects and that opposite parties are is

in a position to deliver physical possession of the plot to the

complainants.
</p>
<p id="p_36">21.       Furthermore,              the   Hon'ble    National   Commission    in

Consumer Case No. 70 of 2015 (Aashish Oberai Vs. Emaar MGF

Land Limited), decided on 14.09.2016, held that the complainant

cannot be compelled to take possession, if the same has not been

given within the promised period. It was observed as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">          "12. During the course of hearing, it was contended by the
          learned counsel for the opposite party that on 06.4.2016,
          they have already obtained post-completion certificate in
          respect of the villa allotted to the complainant. He also
          submitted that vide letter dated 06.5.2016, they have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14"> Consumer Complaint No.298 of 2019                                    15</span>



          already informed the complainant about grant of the part
          occupancy certificate and asked him to pay an additional
          amount of Rs.3,01,200/- on account of revision of EDC by
          Government of Punjab. The learned counsel for the
          complainants however, maintained that considering the
          breach of its contractual obligation by the opposite party,
          the complainant is not obliged to accept the offer of
          possession at such a belated stage, particularly when the
          said offer is not accompanied by an offer to pay adequate
          compensation for the delay in offering possession of the
          villa. I am in agreement with the learned senior counsel for
          the complainant that considering the default on the part of
          the opposite party in performing its contractual obligation,
          the complainant cannot be compelled to accept the offer of
          possession at this belated stage and therefore, is entitled to
          refund the entire amount paid by him along with reasonable
          compensation, in the form of interest."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_37">22.       The opposite parties pleaded in its reply that CLU for

229.77 acre of land was granted on 17.11.2011, vide letter

Ex.OP1/1; CLU for 26.41 acres was granted on 14.05.2012, vide

letter Ex.OP1/2; CLU for 23.75 acres was granted on 25.06.2013,

vide letter Ex.OP1/3 for the first phase of the project and the CLU

Ex.OP1/4 and the layout plan was approved on 08.05.2014, vide

letter Ex.OP1/5. However, I find that the said CLUs were granted,

subject to compliance of various terms and conditions mentioned

therein, such as obtaining of NOC from PPCB under the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, Municipal solid

dated 14.09.2006 of the Ministry of Environment and Forest,

Government of India, permission from Forest Deptt. under <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_14">Forest

Act</a>, 1980 and P.L.P. Act etc. Opposite party No.1 has failed to

bring any evidence on record to prove that the opposite parties

have complied with the terms and conditions mentioned in the

above said letters, in letter and spirit, and in the absence of such

evidence, an adverse inference is to be drawn against the

opposite parties that they have not complied with those terms and

conditions. Besides this, the opposite parties have violated various

provisions of the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act,

1995 (in short, "PAPRA").
</p>
<p id="p_38">23.       As per Section 3 (General Liabilities of Promoter) of the

PAPRA, the opposite parties were required to make full and true

disclosure of the nature of their title to the land, on which such

colony is developed or such building is constructed or is to be

constructed, make full and true disclosure of all encumbrances on

such land, including any right, title, interest or claim of any party in

or over such land. They were also required to give inspection on

seven days' notice or demand of the layout of the colony and plan

of development works to be executed in a colony as approved by

the prescribed authority in the case of a colony. However, the

opposite parties failed to lead any evidence to prove that they

have complied with Section 3 of the PAPRA.
</p>
<p id="p_39">24.       As per <a href="/doc/1877623/" id="a_15">Section 5</a> (Development of land into Colony) of

PAPRA, a builder/developer is liable to obtain permission from the

competent authority for developing the colony. However, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16"> Consumer Complaint No.298 of 2019                                  17</span>



opposite parties have also not led any evidence to prove that they

have obtained the requisite permission/approvals etc. from the

competent authorities before setting up their project. Thus, they

violated Section 5 of PAPRA.
</p>
<p id="p_40">25.       As per Section 9 of PAPRA, every builder is required to

maintain a separate account in a scheduled Bank, for depositing

the amount deposited by the buyers, who intend to purchase the

plots/flats, but no evidence has been led on the record by the

opposite parties to prove that any account has been maintained by

them in this respect. As such, they also violated Section 9 of the

PAPRA.
</p>
<p id="p_41">26.       As per Rule 17 of the "Punjab Apartment and Property

Regulation Rules, 1995, framed under Section 45 of the PAPRA, it

has been provided as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">        17. Rate of interest on refund of advance money
        upon cancellation of agreement.- The promoter shall
        refund full amount collected from the prospective
        buyers under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1536207/" id="a_16">section 6</a> together with
        interest thereon at the rate of twelve per cent per
        annum payable from the date of receipt of amount so
        collected till the date of re-payment."
</blockquote><p id="p_42">27.       <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_17">The Act</a> came into being in the year 1986. It is one of the

benevolent pieces of legislation to protect the consumers from

exploitation. The spirit of the benevolent legislation cannot be

overlooked and its object is not to be frustrated. The complainant

has made payment of substantial amount to the opposite parties,

with the hope to get the possession of the unit within a reasonable

time. The circumstances clearly show that the opposite parties
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17"> Consumer Complaint No.298 of 2019                                            18</span>



made false statement of facts about the goods and services i.e.

allotment of land and development thereof within a stipulated

period and ultimate delivery of possession. The act and conduct of

the opposite parties is a clear case of misrepresentation and

deception, which resulted in injury and loss of opportunity to the

complainant. There is escalation in the price of construction also.

The builder is under obligation to deliver the possession of the unit

within a reasonable period. From the facts and evidence brought

on the record of the complaint, it is clearly made out that the

opposite parties, i.e. builders, knew from the very beginning that

they had not complied with various provisions of the PAPRA and

the Rules framed thereunder and would not be able to deliver the

possession          within      the   stipulated   period   and,    thus,   by

misrepresentation induced the complainant to book the unit, due

to which she has suffered mental agony and harassment. It is the

settled      principle        of    law   that   compensation      should   be

commensurate with the loss suffered and it should be just, fair and

reasonable and not arbitrary. The builder is bound to compensate

for the loss and injury suffered by the complainant for failure to

deliver the possession, so has been held in catena of judgments

by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the Hon'ble National

Commission. To get the relief, the complainant has to wage a long

drawn and tedious legal battle. As such, the complainant was at

loss of opportunities.

<p id="p_43">28.       In view of our above discussion, this complaint is allowed

and following directions are issued to the opposite parties:-
