226</a> of the Constitution in the Hon'ble High Court at Calcutta in

its constitutional writ jurisdiction.       They mainly challenged

fixation of lower noise level impulse at 90 dB(A) at 5 meters from

source for manufacturing and sale of firecrackers instead at 125

dB(A) at 4 meters from source which is prescribed by the

Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests (MoEF) vide Notification

dated 05.10.1999.     They further sought more liberally fixed

standards of noise level for firecrackers in keeping with the

maximum limit provided at serial no. 89 of Schedule -1

appended to Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986.               They

challenged West Bengal Pollution Control Board's Order dated

03.10.1997 as well as the Notification of the MoEF [No.

EN/3346/T-IV-6/001/2007(Pt.          II)]   issued   on   29.12.2009.

Incidentally, they also sought injunction restraining the WBPCB

and others from giving effect to the impugned Notifications.

However, the incidental relief sought by them is not now the

</p><p id="p_58">3.         The litigation, as projected through the bunch of the

applications, has got a chequered history, which goes back to

1985.    The Applicants in the leading case is Association of

traders and some manufactures, dealing in manufacturing

firecrackers in the State of West Bengal. Respondent No. 1 is

West Bengal Pollution Control Board (for short, WBPCB).

Respondent No. 2 is the State of West Bengal (for short, State).

Respondents No. 3 to 5 are officials of the State attached to the

Department of Environment, Government of West Bengal and

Police Commissioner's Office.

<p id="p_59">
</p><p id="p_60">4.         The case put forth by the Applicants may be stated in

the following way:
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">           The Applicants and a large number of public members

celebrate "Diwali" festival with lights and firecrackers. It is also

traditional that there is celebration of Durga Pooja, Kali Pooja

and other festivals.       Those are also celebrated by using

firecrackers.   In "Om Birangana Religions Society Versus the

State of West Bengal &amp;Ors."(WP (CO)No. 4303 9W0 of 1995),

certain restrictions were imposed by the Hon'ble High Court of

Calcutta on the use of loudspeakers, firecrackers, etc.         The

Hon'ble High Court directed that WBPCB shall take suitable

measures to stop creating sound pollution means, other than the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                 11</span>
 microphones, such as use of electric air horns of public vehicles,

fireworks and other sources of sound nuisance.         On further

request, by order dated 23.05.1997, the Hon'ble High Court of

Calcutta modified its earlier order and permitted manufacturing

of firecrackers which were meant for sale outside the State of

West Bengal. At the same time, the Hon'ble High Court clarified

that in case of violation of the order, the police authorities may

seize and confiscate the fireworks and raw material used in the

manufacture of such firecrackers. It was further re-iterated by

the Hon'ble High Court vide order dated 10.06.1997 that the

fireworks (crackers) which were banned should not be permitted

to be used in any part of the State of West Bengal. Though, they

could be sold or dispatched to other states where there is no

restriction for use thereof.    Thus, the fireworks generating

ambient noise over and above 65 dB(A) was declared as unfit for

manufacturing, trading and use. A memo dated 28.10.1996 was

accordingly issued by the Member Secretary of WBPCB.


</p><p id="p_63">5.        The matter did not stop at that place. Subsequently,

Burabazar Dealers Association filed a writ petition bearing WP

No. 2725/1996. The Hon'ble High Court of Calcutta gave certain

directions including a direction that maximum permissible noise

level of the firecrackers at the time of bursting shall be 90 dB(A)

impulse noise at 5 meters from the source.       In pursuance to

such   directions,   WBPCB     passed   impugned     order   dated

03.10.1997 bearing Memo No. 721(1).-13/WPB-Q/96.               The

relevant part of the impugned order is as follows:


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                12</span>
 "(i).   The maximum permissible noise level of the fireworks at the time

of bursting is fixed upto 90 dB(A) impulse noise at 5 meters from the

source.
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><p id="p_65">(ii).   All the fireworks which produce or create noise at the time of

bursting more than 90 dB(A) impulse noise at 5 meters from the source

should not be allowed to be used or sold within the State of West

Bengal."
</p>
<p id="p_66">
</p><p id="p_67">6.           In "M/s Mohan fire Works and Another Versus State of

West Bengal &amp;Ors." the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India dealt

with issue of said directions of the Hon'ble High Court in

"Burrabazar       Fire   Works     Dealers   Association&amp;       Ors.      Vs.

Commissioner of Police, Calcutta &amp; Ors." That SLP No. 19169 of

1997came to be dismissed. It is pertinent to mention here that

while dismissing that SLP, Hon'ble Supreme Court observed :

"we approve the view taken by the Calcutta High Court in the

impugned judgment and the directions given therein regarding fixing of

the noise limit. The special leave petition is dismissed."


</p><p id="p_68">7.           Needless to say, the challenges made by various

traders and a society of the traders, including Burrabazar

Association,     had     failed.    Subsequently,     by     order     dated

27.09.2001,      Hon'ble     Supreme     Court   allowed     use     of   the

firecrackers generating the noise level upto 125dB(A-I) or 145

dB(C)pk at 4 meters distance from the point of bursting and

prohibited any use of firecrackers beyond the above limit of

decibels.      However, it was by way of interim order dated

27.09.2001 in WP (C) No. 72/1998 that such interim directions


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                    13</span>
 were given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. However, the Apex

Court disposed of that SLP with observations that the issue may

be re-examined by the Hon'ble High Court.

Hon'ble High Court of Calcutta vide order dated 26.09.1997

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">9.         As stated before, taking cue from the above directions,

the WBPCB passed impugned order dated 03.10.1997 whereby

maximum noise level from fire crackers was fixed at 90 dB(A-I) at

5 meters distance from the point of bursting. The manufacturing

of firecrackers which would produce sound of more than 90

dB(A-I) was thus banned. The restrictions were clamped on the

 Applicants for manufacturing and sale of the firecrackers which

created sound of 90dB(A-I) at 5 meters from the point of

bursting. It appears that National Committee on Noise Pollution

Control had conducted four meetings for dealing with the issue

of Noise caused by firecrackers. In the fourth (4th) meeting dated

18.09.1998, the National Committee on Noise Pollution Control

(NCNPC) discussed various study reports on the noise level of

firecrackers. The National Committee on Noise Pollution Control

recommended that maximum noise level upto 125dB(A-I) at 4

meters from the point of bursting may be proper.                   The

recommendations of the National Committee on Noise Pollution

Control, ultimately, were approved. Therefore, Notification dated

05.10.1999 was issued by the MoEF in exercise of its powers

under Section 6 and <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_2">Section 25</a> of the Environment (Protection)

Act, 1986.    The mater did not stop there.          The order dated

03.10.1997 and the Notification dated 05.10.1999 were again

subjected to challenge in I.A. Nos. 57-58 and 60-61 in W.P. No.

72/1998which was pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

</blockquote><p id="p_71">By order dated 13.09.2010, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that

petitions had been filed by them in the High Court of Calcutta.

Those petitions are transferred to this Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_75">11.       According to the Applicants, ambient air quality

standards do not apply to firecrackers and pollution in the

context thereof. The impugned order is without any logical basis

and the Notification issued by the MoEF is without application of

mind. No research and empirical study was conducted by the

WBPCB for fixing noise level at 90dB(A-I). The WBPCB failed to

consider the import of the earlier orders for various Hon'ble High

Courts.   Though, in the fourth (4th) meeting, the National

Committee came to the common conclusion that standard for

firecrackers could be 125 dB(A-I) with impulse level of 4 meters

from the source, yet, without considering such decision, the

WBPCB simply stuck to the order of the Hon'ble High Court of

Calcutta dated 26.09.1997. Though the Hon'ble High Court and

the Apex Court permitted flexibility in the noise level for

firecrackers. The Applicants have come out with a case that the

Members of the WBPCB did not ascribe tangible reasons,

founded on scientific study reports, to lower down the noise level

of firecrackers at 90dB(A-I) impulse at 5 meters distance from

the source. The reasons stated in the minutes of the meeting are

generic in nature and are not backed up by any scientific study.

It is for such reason that the impugned order of the WBPCB is

invalid and liable to be quashed. So also, the Notification issued

by the MoEF is illegal and deserves interference because it also


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                16</span>
 does not indicate basis for fixing of the standards as enumerated

therein.
</p>
<p id="p_76">
</p><p id="p_77">12.        According to the Applicants, it was necessary for the

WBPCB      to   examine   whether     the   impugned   order   dated

03.10.1997 ought to be reconciled in the light of MoEF

Notification dated 05.10.1999 and accordingly it should have

been amended by issuing a fresh Notification in keeping with the

required higher norms of 125dB(A-I). It is further alleged that

the impugned order of the WBPCB is arbitrary. It is pointed out

that Dr. Abirlal Mukherjee represented the State of West Bengal

as an expert and gave his opinion in the meetings of the National

Committee. His opinion was also not taken into account by the

WBPCB. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has fixed noise standards

of 125dB(A-I) with impulse level at 4 meters from the source vide

the interim order dated 27.09.2001 (Annex-P-9). Inspite of clear

directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the WBPCB has not

withdrawn the illegal order nor the MoEF has revised its

impugned Notification. Feeling aggrieved by cracking of whip on

manufacturing and trading of firecrackers, the Applicants again

had approached the Hon'ble High Court. As stated before, the

Writ Petitions are transferred to this Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_78">13.        The WBPCB and the other Respondents denied all the

material averments made by the Applicants. It is the stand of

the WBPCB that in accordance with the Rule-3(2) of the

Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, it has power for providing

stringent standards from those provided in the Schedules (I) to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                 17</span>
 (IV) in respect of any specific industry, operation or process. It is

averred that sufficient reasons have been recorded as to why the

WBPCB desired to specify more "stringent standards" for the

firecrackers in the State of West Bengal. The WBPCB submitted

that lower standards of noise level in context of the firecrackers

is desirable in view of thickly populated areas of Kolkata. The

WBPCB supported the order dated 03.10.1997 on the basis of

observations made by the Hon'ble High Court of Calcutta in W.P.

No. 2725/1996 (Burrabazar Fire Works Dealers Association &amp;

Ors. Vs. Commissioner of Police, Calcutta &amp; Ors.) and WP No.

4303(W) of 1995 (OM Birangana Religious Society Vs. The State

of West Bengal &amp; Ors.).     The MoEF supported its Notification

dated 05.10.1999 as being legal and proper in view of the powers

available to the authority under <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_5">Section 6</a> and <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_6">Section 25</a> of the

(Protection) Act, 1986 such standards for emission or discharge

of environmental pollutants from various sources may be fixed

by the Government in order to prevent environmental pollution.

It is pointed out that sound is included under the Air (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and, therefore, the control of

excessive limit of such pollutant is within powers of the SPCB

      5 meters from the source and so specifically ban sale or use of

      the following firecrackers generating noise level exceeding 90

      dB(A) impulse at a distance of 5 meters from the source and to

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">
</blockquote><p id="p_83">16.         On behalf of the Appellants, Learned Senior Counsel

Mr. U. Hazarika argued that the limit of 90dB(A-I) for

firecrackers only for State of West Bengal is impermissible

having regard to national norms of 125dB(A-I).             He further

argued that the State of West Bengal could not have given goby
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                   19</span>
 to the ultimate decision arrived at in the fourth (4th) meeting of

the NCNPC and the State Boards.                He points out that expert

representative of State of West Bengal was present in the

relevant meetings and therefore, according to him, the State of

West Bengal is stopped from fixing the lower limit of decibels for

firecrackers.   His further contention is that Rule 3(2) of the

Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 is not strictly followed by

the WBPCB. According to the Learned Senior Counsel, Rule 3(2)

is enabling provision but it may be invoked only when

appropriate reasons are recorded, depending upon the quality of

the recipient system. But that exercise is not undertaken by the

WBPCB.     He, therefore, submits that the impugned order is

arbitrary, improper and illegal. He invited our attention to the

observations    of     the   Hon'ble        High   Court    of   Calcutta      in

"Burrabazar     Fire    Works    Dealers       Association       &amp;     Ors.   Vs.

Commissioner of Police, Calcutta &amp; Ors." case. He pointed out

that prior to the impugned decision of the WBPCB, it was

necessary to examine all the aspects of the matter including

suggestions     and    recommendations             given   by    the    National

Committee on Noise Pollution Control and after giving due

hearing   to the Applicants.       So also, the views of Dr. Abirlal

Mukherjee, who represented the State of West Bengal as an

expert in the meetings of the National Committee and his

recommendation also were required to be considered. In other

words, chief bone of his contention is that the impugned order of

the WBPCB is not in keeping with directions of the Hon'ble High



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                       20</span>
 Court of Calcutta nor it is justifiable for want of due compliances

of Rule 3(2) of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986.


</p><p id="p_84">17.         He argued that the impugned order dated 03.10.1997

passed by the WBPCB is practically "non-speaking order". He

pointed out that the recommendations of NCNPC and Dr. Abirlal

Mukharjee were not considered and evaluated prior to fixing

90dB(A-I) as benchmark for the firecrackers manufacturing and

sale in the State of West Bengal. According to Learned Senior

Counsel, the unanimous decisions arrived at by the National

Committee on Noise Pollution Control (NCNPC) ought to have

been adopted by the State of West Bengal inasmuch as it is

founded on detailed studies and due examination of the material

available   before   the   said    Committee.   So   also,   when

representative of the West Bengal was one of the member of the

NCNPC and signed the minutes of fourth (4th) meeting held on

18.09.1998, the WBPCB should have amended the benchmark

equivalent to the National standard.        He argued that the

standard fixed by the impugned order passed by the WBPCB is

lowest, as compared to other States. Therefore, the State of West

Bengal is singled out and discriminated in this context.      With

the result, manufacturing and trading in firecrackers at

Shivkashi and other places will be given booster dose whereas

the local poor people, who are employed in the factories,

manufacturing fireworks, are likely to be seriously affected.

Consequently, he urged to quash the impugned order of the

WBPCB.

<p id="p_85">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                  21</span>
</p><p id="p_86"> 18.       Per contra, it is argued on behalf of the Respondents

that the impugned order is issued by the WBPCB in view of

enabling powers available under Rule 3(2) of the Environment

(Protection), Rules, 1986. It is further argued that the excessive

noise of the firecrackers is serious threat to the environment.

Counsel argued that the impugned order is based upon the

observations of the Expert Committee consisting of scientists. It

is contended that when the Apex Court confirmed the Judgment

of High Court of Calcutta in "Burrabazar Fire Works Dealers

Association &amp; Ors. Vs. Commissioner of Police, Calcutta &amp; Ors."

case, the limited question that was kept open, pertained to

examination of issue as to whether the Notification dated

05.10.1999 issued by the MoEF and the impugned order of the

WBPCB could be reconciled.      It is argued that the impugned

order of the WBPCB could not be reconciled with the said

Notification inasmuch as the impugned order is based on special

circumstances like population density and number of festivals in

the State of West Bengal. It is argued that since the impugned

order dated 03.10.1997 is issued in compliance with judgment of

the Hon'ble High Court of Calcutta in "Burrabazar Fire Works

Dealers Association's" case, and, therefore, no illegality is

committed by the WBPCB. The Counsel invited our attention to

the minutes of the meeting held on 03.10.1997 in the office of

the WBPCB. It is pointed out that due reasons have been

ascribed during course of the discussions in that meeting for

lowering of the benchmark to 90dB(A-I) (impulse)noise at 5

meters from the source of use of the firecrackers.     He argued
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                22</span>
 that the subsequent formal order issued by the WBPCB on

03.10.1997 is founded on reasons discussed in the 102ndBoard's

meeting held on 03.10.1997. So, it cannot be termed as "non-

speaking order". In this view of the matter, the Counsel for the

Respondents sought dismissal of the Applications.


</p><p id="p_87">19.         Having heard Counsel for the parties, we deem it

proper to formulate following points for determination :-


</p><p id="p_88">(i)     Whether in the facts and circumstances of the present

case, the WBPCB could legally and validly exercise the powers

available under Rule 3(2) of the Environment (Protection) Rules,

1986 and as such, the impugned order issued by it is immune

from challenge?
</p>
<p id="p_89">
</p><p id="p_90">(ii)    Whether in the facts and circumstances of the present

case, the Notification issued by the MoEF can be held as valid

and will supersede the impugned order of the WBPCB due to its

issuance under main provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_10">Environment (Protection)

Act</a>, 1986?
</p>
<p id="p_91">
</p><p id="p_92">(iii)   Whether in the facts and circumstances of the present

case, the Applicants are entitled to claim fixation of higher

standards for manufacturing of noise over and above the limits

prescribed by the MoEF Notification dated 05.10.1999?


</p><p id="p_93">20.         We have carefully gone through the record. We have

also perused the Judgment delivered by the Hon'ble High Court

of Calcutta on 03.09.1996 which is the main foundation of the

impugned order passed by the WBPCB. We have considered the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                23</span>
 minutes of the four (4) meetings which have been referred to by

the Applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_94">
</p><p id="p_95">21.         Before we proceed to examine the rival contentions

put forth by the Learned Counsel for the parties, it would be

useful to mention that subsequent judgment of the Apex Court

in "Noise Pollution (V), in RE: with Forum Prevention of

Environmental and Sound Pollution Vs. UOI and Anr." (2005)

5SCC 733, impacts all the points involved in the present bunch

of Applications. The judgment of the Apex Court, in fact, covers

a large area with detailed consideration of various issues. The

subject of "Noise Pollution" is dealt with from various angles.

However, so far as, noise pollution in the special context of

firecrackers is concerned, the Apex Court observed:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">      "46. Fireworks are used all over the world to celebrate special

      occasions.    In India, fireworks are bursted on festivals like

      Dussehra, Diwali and on special occasions like social gatherings,

      marriages, Independence day, Republic day, New Year day, etc.

      In other countries of the world, fireworks are generally burst

      either on the New Year day or on the birthday of their respective

      countries. However, bursting of firecrackers is a health hazard

      since it is responsible for both air pollution and noise pollution.


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">      47.   The use of fireworks has led to air pollution in the form of

      noise and smoke. Their excessive use has started to be a public

      hazard and violation of their fundamental rights as enshrined in

      the Constitution.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                     24</span>
</blockquote><p id="p_96"> 48.   It has been held in the case of "Om Birangana Religious

Society Vs. State" that the


      "Freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under

<a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_11">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India includes, by necessary

implication, freedom not to listen and/or to remain silent.        A

citizen has a right to leisure, right to sleep, right not to hear and

right to remain silent. He also has the right to read and speak

with others."
</p>
<p id="p_97">
Because of the tremendous sound and noise, the citizens cannot

exercise all these fundamental rights.


</p><p id="p_98">49.   It has been seen that firecracker noise is an impulsive noise

and is hazardous. Bursting of a firecracker near the ear can lead

sometimes to non-recoverable hearing loss.


</p><p id="p_99">50.   Diwali is the most important festival of India. The bursting

of firecrackers during this period is a widespread practice. The

unpredictable, intermittent and impulsive noise produced by

bursting of crackers all around, turns the festival of lights into a

cacophony of noise. People are unable to even sleep due to this

excessive noise pollution. Several people are injured due to the

noise produced by firecrackers every year.


</p><p id="p_100">51.   Firecrackers not only increase the ambient noise level but

also contribute significantly in increasing the air pollution by

means of toxic gases and particles due to their blast wave

resulting from a rapid release of energy.


</p><p id="p_101">52.   In order to assess the situation of noise pollution caused by

firecrackers at the time of Diwali, the Central Pollution Control

Board (CPCB) has been conducting ambient noise level monitoring

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                              25</span>
 during Diwali festival regularly at various locations in Delhi since

1993, to find increased ambient noise level caused by intensive

burning of crackers.    As in the past, the noise and air-quality

monitoring have been carried out in the years 1999, 2000, 2001

and 2002. The noise monitoring locations have been selected to

cover almost all areas of Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_102">
</p><p id="p_103">53.   An analysis of the reports prepared in the years1999, 2000,

2001 and 2002 reveals that the ambient noise level on Diwali

day exceeded the limit at almost all the places during these

years.   The noise level was higher during Diwali - 2000 as

compared to the values recorded during Diwali festival in the

years 1999, 2001 and 2002.
</p>
<p id="p_104">
</p><p id="p_105">54.   The percentage of violation in Leq32noise level varied from 2

to 49% in the year 2002, 12 to 55% in the year 2001, 11 to 58% in

the year 2000 and 22 to 47% in the year 1999 with respect to the

daytime standards at all the areas.
</p>
<p id="p_106">
</p><p id="p_107">55.   The ambient noise level during the years 1999 to 2002 on

Diwali festival, exceeded the limit at all places in every year and

the percentage of violation varies from 2% to 58%.       Thus, the

study does reveal that the noise levels that have been measured

on all these occasions have been more than the prescribed norms.

This is a point of worry as it has been discussed that noise

pollution does tend to have adverse effects on a person. Thus,

immediate steps in this direction need to be taken.


</p><p id="p_108">56.   The problem of noise pollution due to firecrackers is not only

limited to India. Similar problems are being experienced in other

countries as well. In fact, in the United Kingdom, in Nottingham


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                              26</span>
       the "Be Safe Not Sorry" campaign was launched after the post

      was inundated with letters from readers to the newspaper saying

      they were fed up with the noise, nuisance and the distress that

      fireworks cause."
</p>
<p id="p_109">
</p><p id="p_110">22. It is pertinent to note that the sound level for the

firecrackers is fixed by the MoEF under Entry No. 89 of Schedule

</p><p id="p_111">-I appended to the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986. The

benchmark is as shown below:
</p>

          "................ Keeping all these submissions in mind it does

          seem that the present noise standards as prescribed in

          India by the Government of India, are correct and do not

          need to be altered at the moment.               However, if the

          Government is of the opinion that this sound level needs to

          be increased or reduced at a later date it is free to do so."


</p><p id="p_121">24.       In the face of the Judgment of the Apex Court, it does

not stand to reason that the benchmark fixed by the MoEF could

have been changed by the WBPCB. Conversely, in compliance to

the order dated 13.09.2010 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in I.A. Nos. 57-58 and 60-61 (Civil) No. 72 of 1998, the

WBPCB ought to have reconciled the impugned order dated

03.10.1997   in     tune    with    the   MoEF's      Notification    dated

05.10.1999 and only if both i.e. Order of the WBPCB dated

03.10.1997 and the Notification of the MoEF dated 05.10.1999,

are not reconciled, the Applicants were directed by the Apex

Court to move the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_12">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution, if so advised. That they have already done. Those

writ petitions are now transferred to this Tribunal and as such it

is necessary to broadly examine whether the stand of the

WBPCB to stickup to the impugned order dated 03.10.1997 is

legal and proper.

</p><p id="p_123"> 25.        While examining legality of the benchmark fixed by

the WBPCB under the impugned order dated 03.10.1997, it is

essential to understand the nature of liberty which was given to

the WBPCB by the Hon'ble High Court of Calcutta while deciding

the case of "Burrabazar Fire Works Dealers Association &amp; Ors.

Vs. Commissioner of Police, Calcutta &amp; Ors."(Supra). The Hon'ble

High Court of Calcutta only clarified that the WBPCB can lower

down the benchmark in case of special circumstances and on

basis of scientific study. The Apex Court approved findings in

"Burrabazar      Fire   Works     Dealers    Association     &amp;    Ors.   Vs.

Commissioner of Police, Calcutta &amp; Ors." (Supra) to the extent of

interpretation    of    <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_13">Article   19(1)(g)</a>   and   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_14">Article   21</a>     of   the

Constitution. These observations are stated in the judgment of

Hon'ble Apex Court in "Noise Pollution (V), in RE: with Forum

Prevention of Environmental and Sound Pollution Vs. UOI and

</p>
<p id="p_125">
</p><p id="p_126">26.         There cannot be duality of opinion that <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_21">Article 19(i)(g)</a>

does not give free license or fundamental right to carry on any

trade or business which creates pollution or is otherwise

hazardous. Nobody can be deprived of right to expect reasonable

silence surrounding him. Once it is found that the limit of 125

dB(A-I) fixed as maximum permissible limit is approved by the

Apex Court in paragraph 143 of the judgment in Noise Pollution

(V) in RE: (Supra) then it does not stand to reason that the

WBPCB could deviate from such benchmark by sticking itself to

the order dated 03.10.1997. One cannot be oblivious of the fact

that when Hon'ble High Court of Calcutta passed order dated

26.09.1997 in WP No. 2725/1996 (Burrabazar Fire Works

Dealers Association &amp; Ors. Vs. Commissioner of Police, Calcutta &amp;

Ors.), the WBPCB was called upon to take a decision by fixing

the benchmark with the help of Expert Committee appointed by

the Hon'ble High Court.        Immediately, thereafter, the WBPCB

took the decision in the meeting dated 03.10.1997.              In that

meeting,    the   recommendations        of    the   Expert   Committee

appointed by the Hon'ble High Court were immediately accepted

like a gospel truth. The whole exercise was completed within 3 -

4 days.    The recommendations of that Expert Committee were

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                    30</span>
 not appreciated, evaluated and considered in comparison with

any other material. Needless to say, such exercise was hastily

done without giving proper thought to the available material as

well as views of the Applicants. Though, it was directed by the

Hon'ble High Court of Calcutta that views of expert, namely, Dr.

Abirlal Mukherjee also should be considered. Yet impugned order

does not show compliances of this part of the Hon'ble High

Court's order. For this reason too, it is unsustainable in the eye

of    law.   The      impugned   order,   therefore,    is   reflection   of

impropriety, undue haste and arbitrariness.


</p><p id="p_127">27.          No doubt, WBPCB has powers to lower down the

benchmark of the decibels for firecrackers under Rule 3(2) of the

Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986.               Still, however, the

stringency of standards must be based upon sufficient reasons

depending upon the quality of recipient system.              It cannot be

done arbitrarily and hastily without conducting scientific study

of the impact of the firecrackers on recipient system.


</p><p id="p_128">28.          Rules 3(1)&amp;(2) of the Environment (Protection) Rules,

1986 reads as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">       3.    "Standards for emission or discharge of environmental

       pollutants:- (1) For the purposes of protecting and improving the

not indicate as to how the quality of recipient system was found

incompatible to the benchmark fixed by the National Committee

in its fourth (4th) meeting. We have noticed that minutes of the

meeting held on 03.10.1997 (102nd meeting of the Board) also

give only generic views of the Members which do not adequately

address the issue pertaining to quality of recipient system. In

our opinion, the impugned order is hurriedly passed without due

consideration of the experts opinion comparable with other

it is difficult to countenance the same.            First, the MoEF

Central Government has the authority to make rules by issuing

Notification   and    may       fix   maximum       allowable       limit    of

concentration of various environmental pollutants including

noise for different areas; the MoEF Notification dated 05.10.1999

has been issued, in the exercise of powers available under

<a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_28">Section 6</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.                        The

Environment      (Protection)     Rules,     1986   is   a     subordinate

legislation.   The MoEF Notification issued by invoking powers

under main sections i.e. <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_29">Section 6</a> and <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_30">Section 25</a> of the

 <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_31">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 will have to be given

precedence over the subordinate legislation. The powers to make

subordinate legislation are derived from enabling provisions of

the main provisions of the concerned Act and hence the

delegatee on whom such power is conferred has to act within

limits of the authority conferred upon it by the Act. This legal

position is explicit from Judgment in "Hukam Chand Etc, Vs.

Union of India&amp; Ors" 1972 (1973) SCR(1)8961972)SCC(2)601.

It is observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">            "The fact that the rules framed under the Act have to be laid

      before each House of Parliament would not confer validity on a

      rule if it is made not in conformity with S.40 of the Act. The act of

      the Central Government in laying the rules before Parliament

      would not prevent the Courts from scrutinizing the validity of the

      rules and holding them to be ultra vires. [902D] Caries on Statute

      Law, Sixth Edition, pp. 304-306 referred to."


</blockquote><p id="p_131">32.         It follows, therefore, that the subsequent MoEF

Notification will override the impugned order dated 03.10.1997

passed by the WBPCB. Precisely, the benchmark fixed by the

MoEF as uniform standard for all States, though it is termed as

maximum limit, could not have been lowered down by the

WBPCB on the ground that such power is available under Rule

3(2) of    the    Environment     (Protection)   Rules,    1986.      The

Notification issued under the main provisions of the Act should

be respected and abided by the State Boards. The Rules must

sub-serve the provisions of the Act.          This is also one of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                    34</span>
 reasons as to why the impugned order of the WBPCB is

unsustainable in the eye of law.
</p>
<p id="p_132">
</p><p id="p_133">33.         We have noticed that the impugned Notification issued

by the WBPCB is said to have been issued under provisions of

the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_32">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, the

directions of the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court and under

provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_33">Environment (Protection) Act</a>. We have further

noticed that WBPCB has not specified any particular provision of

the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_34">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 or that of

the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_35">Environment (Protection) Act</a> under which the impugned

Notification has been issued.           Coming to the provisions of

<a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_36">Section 19</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_37">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1981, the subject of power to declare air pollution control areas

is within the domain of the State Government.         The power to

issue directions or notification by the State Board is governed by

<a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_38">Section 17</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_39">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1981. It is important to consider the nature of functions of the

State Board as enumerated in <a href="/doc/69926654/" id="a_40">Section 17</a>.            For the present

purpose, it would suffice to reproduce <a href="/doc/69926654/" id="a_41">Section 17(g)</a> of the said

Act. It reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_134">"17. Functions of State Boards. - (1) Subject to the provisions of

this Act, and without prejudice to the performance of its functions,

if any, under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_42">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 (6 of 1974), the functions of a State Board shall be -

      having regard to the standards for the quality of air laid

      down by the Central Board, standards for emission of air

      pollutants into the atmosphere from industrial plants and

      automobiles or for the discharge of any air pollution into the

      plants;"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_135">34.         If the provision is read by applying golden rule of

interpretation, it goes without saying that the standards for

emission of air pollutants into the atmosphere from industrial

plants and automobiles and for the discharge of any air

pollutant are required to be provided in consultation with the

Central Board.     In other words, the State Board cannot take

unilateral decision on such a question. For this reason too, we

find that the impugned Notification issued by the WBPCB will

have to be held as illegal and inoperative.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                 36</span>
</p><p id="p_136"> 35.           Considering the foregoing discussion, we have no

hesitation in recording finding on point no. (i) as "negative". It

follows that the finding on point no. (ii) shall be recorded as

"positive".    We record our finding on the point no. (iii), in the

"negative" particularly, for the reason that the issue is foreclosed

in view of the Dictum of the Apex Court is in "Noise Pollution (V),

in RE: with Forum Prevention of Environmental and Sound

Pollution Vs. UOI and Anr." (2005) 5 SCC 733". Accordingly, we

hold that the WBPCB is required to amend the order dated

03.10.1997 and reconcile the same in keeping with the MoEF

Notification dated 05.10.1999. The WBPCB shall issue amended

order, accordingly, within a period of one (1) month hereafter. In

the meanwhile, the benchmark fixed by the MoEF Notification

dated 05.10.1999 shall continue to apply for the production and

sale of firecrackers in the State of West Bengal. The impugned

order of the WBPCB is hereby quashed with direction to modify

the same in keeping with the discussion made hereinabove.


</p><p id="p_137">36.           However, we cannot overlook the fact that much water

has flown from under bridge due to the passage of time between

the Judgment of the Apex Court and the subsequent increase in

the   population,        attitude    of        the      society,     urbanisation,

industrialisation, increase in traffic density and the health

problems of the public members.                      Therefore, we direct the

Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)/Ministry of Environment

&amp; Forests (MoEF) to conduct a fresh study on "Noise Pollution

and    its    Impacts"     and      to        suggest     specific    norms    for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                         37</span>
 manufacturing, sale and distribution of the firecrackers inter-

state and intra-state. In case, it is found that the sound decibels

shall be lowered down due to change in the circumstances, the

Central Board/MoEF may take a decision if so needed and if so

advised, may file appropriate application before the Apex Court

for   the   purpose   of   vetting        such   decision.   The   Central

Board/MoEF may, however, appropriately suggest the norms in

keeping with the scientific study conducted with the help of

experts. We deem it proper to ask the competent authority to

have a fresh look in the matter because day by day the festivals

are being organised like entertainment shows and "social events"

which is not the real purpose of the festivities. We direct that

the Central Board/MoEF shall examine the relevant issues

afresh and take decision within a period of six (6) months and if

so required by taking legal opinion of the Attorney General's

Office or Department of Law and Justice, Ministry of Law &amp;

Justice.

<p id="p_138">
</p><p id="p_139">37.         We make it clear that the WBPCB is at liberty to take

independent decision in accordance with the powers available

under the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_43">Control of Pollution) Act</a> in

consultation with the CPCB if the reduction of the noise level

emanating from firecrackers is found necessary for certain

specific reasons, having regard to the recipient quality thereof.
