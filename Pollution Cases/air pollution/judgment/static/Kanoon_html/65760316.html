<p id="p_12">                          2.           At the outset, the learned Advocate-General
                          appearing for the State of Jharkhand and Mr. Rajiv Sinha,
                          the learned counsel appearing for the respondent-Union of
                          India    have    raised       a   preliminary   objection   to   the
                          maintainability of the writ petition on the ground that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                       2</span>

petitioner has already availed statutory remedy under
<a href="/doc/698051/" id="a_3">Section 30</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Development and
<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_4">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957.
</p><p id="p_13">3.        The petitioner has pleaded that on 10.07.1972 it
was granted a non-captive lease for iron and manganese ore
for a period of 30 years, and before expiry of the lease
period it applied for renewal of the mining lease on
09.07.2001, however, no decision was taken by the
respondent-State on the application for renewal. The
petitioner was granted environmental clearance for quantity
of 1,00,000 MT per annum on 23.01.2007, which was
revised /modified on 19.07.2013 by which it was permitted
mining to the extent of 8,00,000 MT per annum. In
paragraph no. 7 of the writ petition, the petitioner has
asserted that it has been granted all statutory clearances,
however, these documents have not been produced. In the
chart appended to the demand notice dated 12.09.2017 it has
been mentioned that the maximum permissible quantity of
minerals to be mined, in terms of judgment in "Common
Cause" [W.P.(C) No. 114 of 2014], was 382 MT per annum
from 2000-01 till 2005-06, however, the petitioner has
extracted mineral to the extent of 12,86,624 MT in the year
2005-06. Details of royalty and other statutory payments
have not been disclosed by the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_14">4.        Partner of the petitioner-firm namely, Sri Raj
Kumar Shah, through whom this writ petition has been filed
and supported by his affidavit, is directed to file his personal
affidavit disclosing the amount of royalty, dead rent/ surface
rent and all statutory taxes paid by the petitioner-firm since
2000-01, year-wise, with documentary proof thereof. The
statutory clearances granted to the petitioner-firm under
Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, Air
(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981,           <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_7">Forest
(Conservation) Act</a>, 1980, E.I.A., E.P.A., Pollution Control
Board, approved mining plan, mining scheme etc. from
2000-01 to 2016 shall be produced along with the affidavit.
</p><p id="p_15">5.        The Secretary, Department of Industries, Mines
and Geology, Government of Jharkhand shall also file an
affidavit disclosing the amount of royalty, dead-rent/surface
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>

          rent   and   other     statutory   payments   made     by   the
          petitioner-firm from 2000-01 till 27.03.2017. In the affidavit,
          the respondent-Secretary shall also disclose the decision
          taken on the order of remand by the revisional authority
          through order dated 20.09.2017 to the demand raised by the
          State on 02.05.2015.
</p><p id="p_16">          6.        The petitioner has already approached the
          revisional authority challenging the demand notice dated
          12.09.2017 which, it appears was taken up for hearing on
          19.03.2018. In the writ petition one of the prayers made by
          the petitioner is to direct the revisional authority to hear the
          application for interim relief. Mr. Rajiv Sinha, the learned
          counsel for the respondent-Union of India submits that
          several applications by the mining lease holders from the
          State of Jharkhand have been filed which are taken up for
          hearing together.
</p><p id="p_17">          7.        In the above facts, the revisional authority shall
          hear the petitioner's application in the 2nd week of May,
          2018. In the meantime, the petitioner shall furnish all
          necessary details and documents within one week by filing
          supplementary affidavit to its Revision Application.
</p><p id="p_18">          8.        Post the matter on 15.05.2018.
</p><p id="p_19">          9.        Let a copy of order be given to the learned
          counsels for the parties."
</p><p id="p_20">2.             In compliance of order dated 17.04.2018 now
the parties have filed affidavits.
</p><p id="p_21">3.             In the counter-affidavit the respondent-State
has taken a preliminary objection to the maintainability of
the writ petition. It has also taken a stand that in view of
order dated 21.02.2018 passed in W.P.(C) No.7286 of 2017
and batch cases this writ petition may be referred to the
larger Bench for consideration. However, referring to
certain lessees in paragraph no. 13 of the counter-affidavit
the respondent-State has taken a stand in paragraph no.14
that the petitioner-M/s Shah Brothers is similarly situated
as other mining lease holders who have made part-payment
of the demand raised against them. The petitioner claims
that it has also made part-payment of the demand.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           4</span>

<pre id="pre_2">     4.           Now         by    an        order   dated     28.05.2018         the
     revisional   authority         has       quashed    the        demand    dated
</pre><p id="p_22">     12.09.2017, for non-payment of which the respondent-State
     has stopped issuing mining challans to the petitioner, on the
     ground of violation of the principles of natural justice. At
     about the same time, that is, on 26.05.2018 a Three-men
     committee constituted by the respondent-State vide order
     dated 11.01.2018 has issued a direction to the D.M.O to
     correct the demand for financial year 2005-06 on the basis
     of official communication from I.B.M.
</p><p id="p_23">     5.           The respondent-State shall clarify the aforesaid
     stand   taken      in    the    counter-affidavit,             particularly    in
     paragraph nos. 14 and 19.
</p><p id="p_24">     6.           For        seeking      instructions        on,     whether      the
     respondent-State intends to challenge the revisional order
     dated 28.05.2018 or not, the learned Advocate-General
     seeks adjournment.
