JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON)

     Applicant No. 1 is a registered society while the Applicant No.

2 is its principal convenor. They both claim to have participated in

the 'Save Western Ghats March' on several occasions and in various

aspects.      According to them, they are responsible for certain

landmark events in the environmental activism.           Both these

applicants have approached the Tribunal with the following prayers:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "(i).    Direct   the   Respondents    not   to   issue    any

      consent/Environment Clearance/NOC/Permission under the

      <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, Water (Prevention and

      <a href="/doc/548841/" id="a_5">Biological Diversity Act</a>, 2002 within the Western Ghats area in

      respect of areas which have been demarcated as ESZ1 and

      ESZ2 as mentioned in Para No. 19 above;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  5</span>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       (ii).   Pass such order/s as this Hon'ble Tribunal may feel fit

      and proper in the facts and circumstance of the case.


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      (iii). To direct the Respondents to discharge their obligations by

      exercise of the powers conferred upon them under the

      respective enactments mentioned in Schedule I of the NGT Act,

      2010 for protection and preservation of Western Ghats in the

      framework as enunciated by the WGEEP in its report dated

      31.08.2011."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">
</blockquote><p id="p_43">2.   These prayers are founded on the premise that the Western

Ghats cover States like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka,

Kerala and Tamil Nadu.       Nearly 44 districts fall under the eco-

sensitive area of the Western Ghats. The areas of Western Ghats

have subjected to a rapid erosion of natural capital with the

building up of manmade capital, regrettably imposing excessive

accepted unnecessary environmental damage in the process,

accompanied by a degradation of social capital as well.


</p><p id="p_44">3.   By relying upon the judgements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

in the cases of "T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad Vs. Union of

India &amp; Ors." (2012) 3 SCC 277 and 'M.C. Mehta Vs. Kamal

Nath and Ors." (1997) 1 SCC 388 the contention of the Applicant

is that applying the settled principles of environmental justice like

polluter pays principles, precautionary principle, equity and the

public trust Doctrine, it is obligatory upon the states particularly

the MoEF to provide protection to the Western Ghats and ensure




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                   6</span>
 that activities prejudicial to the ecology and environment of the

Western Ghats are not permitted to be carried on in that area.


</p><p id="p_45">4.     As is evident from the prayers made in this application, the

Applicants    pray   that   recommendations    made      in   the   report

submitted by the WGEEP (in formally called Dr. Gadgil's Report) are

to be implemented to protect the Western Ghats in furtherance to

its constitutional obligations emerging from <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_6">Article-14</a> and <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_7">21</a> read

with <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_8">Article-48</a> and <a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_9">51-(A</a><a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_10">), (g)</a> of the Constitution of India.


</p><p id="p_46">5.     During the pendency of this application, the MoEF had taken

a conscious decision to constitute another High Level Working

Group (HLWG) under the Chairmanship of Dr. K. Kasturirangan.

This    Committee     (informally   termed    Dr.   K.   Kasturirangan

Committee) submitted its report to the MoEF which in turn initially

took a decision to accept the said report in principle and proposed a

draft notification under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_11">section 5</a> of the Environment<a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_12">(Protection)

Act</a>, 1986 (for short, 1986 Act) and invited objections from all

stakeholders including the States.


</p><p id="p_47">6.     Thereafter, the matter remained pending before the MoEF and

various applications came to be filed before the National Green

Tribunal claiming reliefs dependent upon the acceptance or

otherwise of the report submitted by Dr. K. Kasturirangan

Committee or even otherwise. The Applicant continued to persist

with the prayer that the areas of Western Ghats, which were not

included in the Dr. K. Kasturirangan Committee Report and

consequently, not covered by the draft notification should still be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                    7</span>
 protected as eco-sensitive zone in the interest of the environment

and ecology.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">7.   We may also notice at this stage that Dr. K. Kasturirangan

Committee Report excluded substantial parts of the eco-sensitive

area of the Western Ghats, which have been included so in the

report of Dr. Gadgil.      Certain questions in relation to the

jurisdiction of the Tribunal and maintainability of the application,

which were raised by the respondents, were treated as preliminary

objections and disposed of by a detailed judgment of the Tribunal

dated 18.07.2013. During the pendency of the proceedings, it came

to light that the stand taken by the MoEF was ambiguous,

uncertain and did not provide clarity even in relation to the

proceedings pending before the MoEF in exercise of its powers

under the Act of 1986. Having provided sufficient time to MoEF to

make its stand before the Tribunal clear and the Ministry have

failed to do so.    In the order dated 25.08.2014, the Tribunal

specifically noticed that despite specific directions, MoEF had failed

to file appropriate affidavit and a vague affidavit has been

presented. On 27.08.2014, it was stated on behalf of the MoEF that

it does not wish to process Dr. Gadgil Report and would take

subsequent action only in relation to Dr. K. Kasturirangan Report.

In furtherance to that report, a draft notification had been issued

and objections were being considered by the Ministry.        On that

date, learned Counsel appearing for the MoEF prayed for time to

seek instructions in relation to the implementation thereof. After

hearing Counsel for the parties and MoEF still persisting its

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                  8</span>
 ambiguity, vide order dated 09.09.2014, the Tribunal passed the

following order :-
</p>
<p id="p_50">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">           "Let the Secretary, MoEF shall file a personal Affidavit in

        relation to the submissions made by the Counsel appearing

        for the MoEF. In the Affidavit it should be stated whether the

        areas which are called Eco Sensitive Zone stated in the draft

        Notification now issued are the areas which shall alone form

        part of the final Notification and whether the States are at

        liberty to show any areas, from the notification, can and

        should be included/excluded, which are not stated in the

        proposed notification.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">             In variance to the stand taken by the MoEF earlier on the

        last date of hearing, the Counsel appearing for MoEF, upon

        instructions from Mr. Amit Love, Dy. Director, MoEF, has

        stated that Dr. Kasturirangan Report, in fact has been

        accepted by the Ministry and the draft notification has been

        issued in furtherance thereto and the WGEEP is not to be

        processed by the Ministry any further. In the Affidavit which

        has been brought before the Tribunal today, again a vague

        language has been used which suggest that objections may

        be filed by any person interested on the proposals contained

        in the draft Notification, including those relating to the area

        proposed to be brought under the regulation. We may further

        notice that Press report has been brought to the notice of the

        Tribunal saying that the MoEF proposes to conduct a new

        survey on the premises as the two Panels have relied on

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                  9</span>
         satellite data to identify No Development Zone, but the

        survey will find actual situation on the ground and on that

        basis a decision would be taken.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">             It is indicated in the report that if the move would mean

        overriding the previous recommendations and having huge

        No Development Zone. Before we proceed any further, it will

        be appropriate that a definite stand is taken by the MoEF.

        Thus, we direct the Secretary, MoEF to file an Affidavit on

        this aspect within one week from today.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">
        List this matter for hearing on 22th September, 2014."


</blockquote><p id="p_51">8.   From the above order, it is clear that unambiguous and clear

stand of the MoEF was required to be placed before the Tribunal,

before the Tribunal would pass any appropriate order in accordance

with law.
</p>
<p id="p_52">
</p><p id="p_53">9.   In furtherance to the above order, Secretary, MoEF filed an

affidavit dated 19.09.2014. Usefully, we can make reference to the

relevant part of the said affidavit.


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     "(J). That the Ecologically sensitive area as stated in the draft

     notification S.O. No. 733(E) dated 10.03.201 forms the basis for

     demarcation     ESA   by   physical    verification   by   the   State

     Governments of Western Ghats region. The State Governments

     of Western Ghats region, may after undertaking demarcation of

     ESA by physical verification, propose the exclusion/inclusion of

     certain areas from/in the Ecologically Sensitive Area as stated

     in the draft notification S.O. No. 733(E) dated 10.03.2014. Such

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                       10</span>
      proposals of the State Governments received after physical

     verification, would be examined by the Ministry before taking a

     view on further appropriate action including inter-alia issuing a

     fresh draft notification, if required, to seek objections from the

     public on the proposals received from the State Governments of

     Western Ghats.

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">
     (I).   That the Direction issued      under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_13">Section 5</a> of      the

     Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, on 13th November, 2013 for

     providing immediate protection to the Western Ghats and

     maintain its environmental integrity is in force."


</blockquote><p id="p_54">10. We accepted the stand taken by the MoEF in the affidavit filed

by the Secretary, MoEF as the clear and unambiguous stand of the

Government of India for finally settling this crucial issue which

remains pending for years and in fact, pending before this Tribunal

since the year 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">11. In view of the affidavit filed by the Secretary, MoEF, we are of

the considered view that there is no occasion for the Tribunal to

keep this main and other applications pending any longer. MoEF is

expected to discharge and perform its statutory obligations

expeditiously and in accordance with law. According to the affidavit

of the Secretary, MoEF particularly the portion as re-produced

above, MoEF is considering exclusion/inclusion of certain areas

from/in the ecological sensitive areas, as stated in the draft

notification dated 10.03.2014. In other words, MoEF has decided to




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                   11</span>
 examine all aspects regarding the ecologically sensitive areas before

issuing final notification in terms of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_14">section 3</a> of the Act of 1986.


</p><p id="p_57">12. Most importantly, it has also been stated in the affidavit that

the Ministry is going to take further appropriate action inter-alia

issuing fresh draft notification in that behalf.


</p><p id="p_58">13. We are of the considered view that it is not for this Tribunal to

pass any anticipated orders or to provide any limitations in the

exercise of statutory power vested in the Ministry in terms of the

Act of 1986.    It is for the Ministry to take all the initiatives in

relation to defining the eco-sensitive areas in the Western Ghats

region and take it to its logical end by issuing final notification. The

only pious hope that we express in the order is that the Ministry

should act with utmost expeditiousness and ensure that the

interests of the States, individuals, and all concerned stakeholders

are not jeopardised any longer.         The MoEF itself has stated in

paragraph-I of its affidavit that directions under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_15">section 5</a> of the Act

of 1986 have been issued on 13.11.2013 for providing immediate

protection to the Western Ghats to maintain its environmental

integrity, which is in force.    It will be in the interest of all the

stakeholders, including MoEF, that the matters are not further

complicated and third party interest are not put into jeopardy that

these directions will operate to the entire eco-sensitive area of the

Western    Ghats   and    no    fresh   Environmental    Clearance     or

permissions are issued by the MoEF till it issues the final

notification in terms of section-3 of the Act of 1986.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                   12</span>
</p><p id="p_59"> 14. Thus, it is now exclusively for the MoEF to determine and

decide the rival contentions, and the period for which the

restrictions as issued by the MoEF in its order dated 13.11.2013

should remain operative.      It is the duty expected of the MoEF to

maintain the environmental tranquillity and ecology of the areas

under consideration, in the condition as they exist today, and not to

allow irreversible alteration of the areas in question by granting

Environmental Clearance or permitting activities which would have

an adverse impact on the eco-sensitive areas.


</p><p id="p_60">15. We may also notice that on behalf of the State of Kerala, it was

specifically contended before us that they have already submitted

not only their objections but even their physical measurements of

the area that could be declared as "eco-sensitive area" and the

matter is pending with the MoEF now for a considerable time. All

that we can direct is that this matter should also be dealt with by

the MoEF with utmost expeditiousness. It will be obviously open to

the MoEF to declare the ecologically sensitive areas, State-wise or

collectively, for the entire Western Ghats which is relatable to all six

the states afore-indicated.
