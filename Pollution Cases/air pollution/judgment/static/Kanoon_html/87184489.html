                       Dated this the 28th June , 2011

<p id="p_1">      The petitioner has approached this Court with the following

prayers:
</p>
<p id="p_2">           "A.       To direct the second respondent to

           consider and pass appropriate orders on Ext.

           P1 application and Ext.P3 clarification within a

           reasonable time frame to be fixed by this

           Honourable Court.</p><pre id="pre_2">

           B.     Any other relief which this Honourable

           Court         deems            fit       in      the         facts         and

           circumstances of the case. "




</pre><p id="p_3">      2. The grievance of the petitioner is that the petitioner with

intent to pursue the business dealing with the import of iron

metal scraps filed Ext. P1 application dated 01.12.2010 before

the second respondent for issuance of licence under the

provisions of the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and

Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008. It is the case of the

petitioner that inspite of furnishing clarification in respect of

W.P.(C) No.10415 OF 2011

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>

Ext.P2 query, the matter is still kept in the cold storage, which

made the petitioner to approach this Court to have the

proceedings finalised.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     3.   When the matter came up for consideration, it was

pointed out by the learned Counsel appearing for the Central

Government that, in view of the objection referred to in Ext.P2,

the State Pollution control Board was very much a necessary

party to the proceedings and it was accordingly, that the State

Pollution Control Board has been impleaded in the party array as

additional 3rd respondent, by virtue of order dated 23.06.2011 in

I.A.No. 9498 of 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     4. The learned Standing Counsel appearing for the State

Pollution Control Board submits that no application whatsoever

has been received from the petitioner and no proceeding is

pending at the hands of the Board in connection with the issue

projected in the writ petition; which statement is strongly

rebutted by the learned counsel for the petitioner, referring to

the   communication stated as issued by the Pollution Control

Board in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_6">W.P.(C) No.10415 OF 2011

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>

</p><p id="p_7">      5. The learned Central Government Counsel submits that,

as clearly given at Sl.Nos. (ii) and (iii) of Ext.P2, it is essential for

the petitioner to forward the Registration Certificate and

Authorisation obtained from the concerned            Pollution Control

Board and further the 'Consent to operate' issued by the Board

under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">Section 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_2">26</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; Control of

Pollution)Act, 1974 and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of Air (Prevention &amp; Control

of Pollution)Act, 1981. The learned Counsel further asserts that

the idea and understanding of the petitioner, that the petitioner's

duty will be over once he sends a copy of the application to the

Pollution control Board and the rest is to be finalised by the

second respondent, is thoroughly wrong and unfounded.              It is

brought to the notice of this Court by the learned Counsel for the

respondents that Ext. P1 application itself is not liable to be

entertained, as it does not bear any signature or date.

</p><p id="p_8">      In the above circumstance, this Court finds that the

petitioner is not entitled to have any relief at the hands of this

Court. The writ petition fails and it is dismissed, however without

prejudice to the rights of the petitioner to pursue the matter,

W.P.(C) No.10415 OF 2011

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                4</span>

satisfying all the requirements as insisted by the second

respondent vide Ext.P2, on which event, it will be open for the

second respondent    to finalise the proceedings accordingly, in

accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible.




</p><p id="p_9">                                P.R. RAMACHANDRA MENON,
                                         JUDGE.
