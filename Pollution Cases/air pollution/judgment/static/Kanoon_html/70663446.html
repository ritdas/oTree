      IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT BOMBAY

<p id="p_4">2.      It is a case where the desire to improve the environment i.e.
to ensure that river Mula Mutha in Pune is made free from the
discharge of untreated effluent, the National Green Tribunal
exceeded its jurisdiction in O.A. No.55 of 2015.

</pre><p id="p_6">4.     One Mr. Subhash Ramkrishna Patil invoked the jurisdiction
of the National Green Tribunal under <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_1">Section 14</a> of the National
Green Tribunal Act, 2010 pleading that on account of untreated
effluent being discharged in river Mula Mutha, its water had
turned so polluted that far from being a river, it became a drain.
</p>

<p id="p_7">5.     Issuing notice to the Government of Maharashtra and the
Maharashtra Pollution Control Board the latter being obliged to
ensure compliance with the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, the National Green Tribunal got the
response that of the 189 project proponents in Pune, 30 were non-
complaint and against whom the Pollution Control Board had
already issued a notice on 10th March, 2017 proposing the action
referred to in the notice.
</p>

<p id="p_8">6.     The National Green Tribunal noted the reply as also the
action proposed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and
thereafter issued notice to the said 30 project proponents and while
issuing the show cause notice informed the project proponents to
show cause why they should not be saddled with environmental
compensation for not discharging their obligations under the
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986.
</p>

<p id="p_9">7.     Now, the show cause notice issued by the Maharashtra
Pollution Control Board itself informs the project proponents that
action proposed against them was firstly to disconnect the water

and electricity supply to the project and secondly to initiate action
under the Environmental Acts and Rules.
</p>

<p id="p_10">8.     Thus, the National Green Tribunal could have at best
directed Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to pass necessary
orders pursuant to the notice dated 10th March, 2017 issued by the
Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and not to take over the task
of passing final order pursuant to the notice in question. The
reason is obvious. The statutory right of appeal available to the
Petitioner was being taken away by the National Green Tribunal.
</p>

<p id="p_11">9.     Under the circumstances, we dispose of the Writ Petition
quashing the notice issued by the National Green Tribunal to the
Petitioner but simultaneously direct the Maharashtra Pollution
Control Board to pass a final order pursuant to the show cause
notice which was issued to the Petitioner by the Board on 10 th
March, 2017.
</p>

<p id="p_12">10.    Needless to state that the procedures of the law contemplated
post notice issued till final order passed shall be followed. If the
order is against the Petitioner, the Petitioner shall be entitled to
remedy as per law.

<p id="p_13">11.    No costs.
