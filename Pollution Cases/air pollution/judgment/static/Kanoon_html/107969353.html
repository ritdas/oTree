                                        JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">         This        writ   petition          is        filed       by    the        petitioner

  seeking the following reliefs:

              directing respondents 1 to 4 to take effective
              steps    to    stop       the   operation             of    the    mill    in
              building           No.KMC        13/365               of        Kayamkulam
              Municipality by the 5th respondent                              forthwith,
              until    necessary         licence         and    consent         has    been

              directing      respondents            1    to     4    to       take    penal
              action    against         the   5th       respondent             under    Air

              any other appropriate writ, order or direction
              directing respondents 1 to 4 to take effective
              steps to ensure that the 5th respondent                                desist
              from     operating        the    mill        in       building         No.KMC
              13/365        of      Kayamkulam            Municipality                until
              necessary licence and consent has been obtained
              from the 3rd respondent.

</p><p id="p_3">         2.    Apparently          the    subject             issue       relates       to    the

  year    2015-2016.              The     grievance             put        forth        by    the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> WP(C).No. 9638 of 2015                      3</span>

  petitioner is that, the party respondent i.e., the 5th

  respondent         is     conducting      a   mill    without     securing

  necessary clearances from the Kayamkulam Municipality

  as well as the Kerala State Pollution Control Board.

  The Municipality has issued a stop memo and challenging

  the    same    the        party    respondent    preferred       an   appeal

  before    the             Municipal      Council.        These    are       the

  circumstances available on record as on the date of

  filing this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         3. The writ petition was pending before this court

  from    the    year       2015,    however,     an   interim     order      was

  passed    by       this    court    on   7.6.2018    directing        the   5th

  respondent not to operate the unit except with the

  consent       of    the     3rd   respondent     i.e.,    the    Pollution

  Control       Board. Now if at all party                 respondent         has

  secured any licence from the                  Municipality, it is due

  to expire on 30.1.2019 and consequent to the interim

  order passed by this court specified above, the party

  respondent is unable to carry on with functioning of

  the unit.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         4. Therefore, this writ petition is disposed of

  leaving open the liberty of the petitioner to file

  suitable objection to any licence application/consent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> WP(C).No. 9638 of 2015                4</span>

  application submitted before the respective statutory

  authorities by the party respondent and contest the

  proceedings. If any such objection is filed by the

  petitioner    before     any   of   the   statutory     authorities,

  notice     shall   be    issued     to    the   petitioner    before

  finalising     any      application       submitted     by   the   5th

  respondent and a decision shall be taken only after

  providing     sufficient       opportunity      of      hearing    and

  participation to the petitioner and the 5th respondent.

</p><p id="p_6">         The writ petition is allowed to the above extent.
