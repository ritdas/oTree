     Hazaribagh in Cr. Appeal Nos.17 of 2015 and 24 of 2015, whereby the

<p id="p_17">            Further challenge has been made to the judgment of conviction
     and order of sentence dated 28th January, 2015 passed by the Sub
     Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Hazaribagh in connection with G.R.
     No.2303 of 2011, whereby the petitioners have been convicted for the

     all the sentences have been directed to run concurrently.
</p><p id="p_18">3.   The case of the prosecution, as it appears from the written report of
     Birendra Prasad Rai, Manager, Personnel of Ramgarh Sponge Iron
     Private Limited, Hosir (P.W.5), in brief, is that on 25th August, 2011
     the informant was working in his factory office at Hosir. During that
     time, one Randhir Gupta- the petitioner of Cr. Revision No.972 of 2017
     (hereinafter to be referred as 'P-1'), the personal associate of Yogendra
     Sao, a Congress Worker, the petitioner of Cr. Revision No.576 of 2017
     (hereinafter to be referred as 'P-2') called the informant at the factory
     gate and asked him as to why he did not pay the demanded money of
     Rs.5.00 lacs to P-2. Thereafter, P-1 contacted P-2 on his mobile phone
     and forced the informant to talk to him whereupon P-2 threatened the
     informant as to why the demanded money of Rs.5.00 lacs was not sent
     to him as yet. P-2 further threatened the informant that the said
     factory would be closed and also threatened him to kill. It was further
     alleged in the written report that 3-4 months prior to the said
     occurrence when P-2 was a member of the Committee of Jharkhand
     Legislative Assembly on Pollution Control, he and P-1 had threatened
     the informant on his Mobile No.9386613800 from different mobile
     numbers    i.e.   9431501558,    9131819971     and    9431168642     by
     demanding Rs.5.00 lacs near Argadda Check Post. It was also alleged
     by the informant that P-1 was inhabit of coming to the factory on
     regular intervals and used to threaten him to fulfil the demanded
     money failing which he would be killed.
</p><p id="p_19">            On the basis of the said written report, a first information
     report, being Giddi P.S. Case No.55 of 2011, was registered against
     the petitioners under <a href="/doc/752609/" id="a_13">Sections 385</a> and <a href="/doc/1688284/" id="a_14">387</a> of the Indian Penal Code
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>




     on 25th August, 2011. The police after investigation submitted the
     charge sheet against the petitioners and, thereafter, the cognizance of
     the offences under <a href="/doc/752609/" id="a_15">Sections 385</a>, <a href="/doc/1183069/" id="a_16">386</a> and <a href="/doc/1688284/" id="a_17">387</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_18">34</a> of the Indian Penal
     Code was taken against the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_20">4.   The trial of the case commenced and the prosecution in order to prove
     the charges against the petitioners examined altogether nine
     witnesses. P.W.1- Bandi Ram Toppo is the Investigating Officer of the
     case; P.W.2- Madan Mohan Singh, second Investigating Officer of the
     case; P.W.3- Nand Kishore Mahato, caretaker of Gymkhana Club,
     Ramgarh; P.W.4- Ram Awadh Singh, General Supervisor of Ramgarh
     Sponge Iron Factory; P.W.5- Birendra Prasad Rai, informant of the
     case; P.W.6- Kameshwar Prasad, Security Guard; P.W.7- Ranjeet
     Kumar Jha, Liaisoning Officer of Ramgarh Sponge Iron Factory; P.W.8-
     Mahavir Prasad Rungta, owner of Ramgarh Sponge Iron Factory; and
     P.W.9- Alok Kumar, Police Inspector, who proved the call details report
     (for short 'CDR'), marked as Ext.6.
</p><p id="p_21">            The defence also examined one witness, namely, Radhe Shyam
     Sahu (D.W.1) in support of its case.
</p><p id="p_22">5.   The learned Trial Court after appreciating the evidences of the
     prosecution and the defence came to a finding that the informant gave
     the vivid description of the occurrence, which was supported by the
     testimony of P.Ws.5, 6 and 7. The prosecution story of committing of
     extortion by the petitioners was also supported by P.W.8, who
     specifically deposed that he got an amount of rupees one lac paid to
     P-2 through P-1. P.W.8 also deposed that he gave rupees one lac to
     P-2 at Gymkhana Club in presence of P.W.7. The fact stated by P.W.8
     regarding his visit to Gymkhana Club was also supported by P.W.3.
     Learned Trial Court also came to a finding that the CDR of the mobile
     phones proved the fact of talk between the petitioners and the
     informant. The trial court also held that the petitioners were duly
     identified by the informant and reached a finding that there were
     clinching evidence against the petitioners who in furtherance of
     common intention put the informant in fear of injury in order to commit
     extortion and they also managed to extort the part amount.
</p><p id="p_23">6.   The learned Additional Sessions Judge, Hazaribagh, while disposing of
     the appeal preferred by the petitioners, dealt with the grounds urged
     by them. The learned appellate court observed that all the prosecution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>




     witnesses proved the fact that the petitioners, prior to 25th August,
     2011, were committing extortion against the informant and P.W.8- the
     owner of the factory by putting them in fear of grievous hurt/death
     and lastly on 25th August, 2011, P-1 committed extortion against the
     informant at the factory gate and made him to talk to P-2 who
     threatened him with dire consequence and demanded Rs.5.00 lacs as
     extortion by putting him in fear of death. It was also held by the
     learned appellate court that no inconsistency was found in the version
     of the prosecution witnesses regarding place, date, time and manner
     of occurrence, whereas the defence failed to draw any contradiction in
     the testimony of the prosecution witnesses so as to create any doubt
     on the prosecution story.
</p><p id="p_24">7.   Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials
     available on record.
</p><p id="p_25">8.   Mr. K.T.S. Tulsi, learned senior counsel, appearing on behalf of the P-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     2, and Mr. Kaushik Sarkhel, learned counsel, appearing on behalf of
     the P-1, have assailed the impugned judgment on various grounds
     touching the merit of the respective cases. It has been contended that
     the learned courts below have passed the impugned judgments in
     mechanical manner without appreciating the evidences in true
     perspective. In support of their contentions, learned counsel appearing
     on behalf of both the petitioners have contended regarding the
     irregularities committed during investigation claiming acquittal of the
     petitioners from the charges levelled against them. All the factual pleas
     taken on behalf of both the petitioners would be elaborately dealt with
     in the latter part of the judgment. Mr. K.T.S. Tulsi, learned senior
     counsel appearing for P-2 has also contended that despite the fact that
     P-2 was discharging the constitutional duty as public representative
     being an MLA, Jharkhand Legislative Assembly during the relevant
     period, no sanction for prosecution under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_19">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. was
     taken by the prosecution and, thus, the prosecution of P-2 gets vitiated
     in law.
</blockquote><p id="p_26">9.   On the contrary, Mr. Jay Prakash, learned Additional Advocate General,
     appearing on behalf of the State of Jharkhand has submitted that the
     matter regarding pollution was between the factory and the Jharkhand
     State Pollution Control Board in which P-2 being the member of the
     Committee of Legislative Assembly on Pollution Control had no role to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   5</span>




     play, requiring any sanction for prosecution under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_20">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C.
     It has further been submitted by the learned Additional Advocate
     General that the plea of P-2 that he raised the issue of pollution
     regarding Ramgarh Sponge Iron Factory before the Legislative
     Assembly does not connect the present offence with his official duty.
     In fact, the issue of pollution had already ended after the compliance
     of the direction issued by the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board
     was made by the said factory by depositing the bank guarantee of
     Rs.5.00 lacs for taking precaution in the matter of pollution. Even after
     disposal of the case regarding pollution by the Jharkhand State
     Pollution Control Board, the petitioners demanded "Rangdari"/
     committed extortion against P.Ws.5 and 8 with the threatening that
     non-payment of the same would lead to closure of the factory and they
     would be killed. It has also been submitted that the fact of the case
     clearly suggests that the said offence committed by the P-2 cannot be
     connected with his official duty. Moreover, D.W.1 has also not deposed
     that the alleged act of P-2 was in discharge of his official duty. Even
     during recording the statement of P-2 under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_21">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C.,
     specific question was put to him by the learned Trial Court relating to
     the alleged offence, however, he did not make any statement that the
     alleged act was done by him in discharge of his official duty. The issue
     of sanction is a mixed question of law and fact, which is required to be
     established during trial. P-2 had ample opportunity during the trial to
     take the plea of sanction which he failed to do and, thus, the said issue
     cannot be raised at the revisional stage.
</p><p id="p_27">10. Mr. Pandey Neeraj Rai, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
     intervener, while assisting the learned Additional Advocate General,
     has submitted that the issue of sanction for prosecution raised on
     behalf of P-2 should have been agitated during the trial itself. Though
     a defence witness was also examined, yet he did not disclose any fact
     that P-2 was implicated in this case while he was discharging his official
     duty.
</p><p id="p_28">11. It, thus, appears that the issue with regard to sanction for prosecution
     of P-2 was neither raised during the trial nor at the appellate stage and
     the said point has been raised before this Court for the first time in
     revisional jurisdiction. Thus, it would be appropriate to go through the
     judgments cited by Mr. K. T. S. Tulsi, learned senior counsel appearing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    6</span>




    for P-2 to find out as to whether the issue of sanction for prosecution
    can be raised at this stage.
</p><p id="p_29">12. In the case of Matajog Dobey Vs. H. C. Bhari, reported in
    (1955)2 SCR 925, the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme
    Court has held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                  "20. Is the need for sanction to be considered as soon as the
                  complaint is lodged and on the allegations therein contained? At
                  first sight, it seems as though there is some support for this view
                  in Hori Ram case [(1939) FCR 159, 178] and also in Sarjoo
                  Prasad v. King-Emperor [(1945) FCR 227] . Sulaiman, J. says
                  that as the prohibition is against the institution itself, its
                  applicability must be judged in the first instance at the earliest
                  stage of institution. Varadachariar, J. also states that the
                  question must be determined with reference to the nature of the
                  allegations made against the public servant in the criminal
                  proceeding. But a careful perusal of the later parts of their
                  judgments shows that they did not intend to lay down any such
                  proposition. Sulaiman, J. refers (at P-179) to the prosecution
                  case as disclosed by the complaint or the police report and he
                  winds up the discussion in these words: "Of course, if the case
                  as put forward fails or the defence establishes that the act
                  purported to be done is in execution of duty, the proceedings
                  will have to be dropped and the complaint dismissed on that
                  ground". The other learned Judge also states at p. 185, "At this
                  stage we have only to see whether the case alleged against the
                  appellant or sought to be proved against him relates to acts done
                  or purporting to be done by him in the execution of his duty". It
                  must be so. The question may arise at any stage of the
                  proceedings. The complaint may not disclose that the act
                  constituting the offence was done or purported to be done in the
                  discharge of official duty; but facts subsequently coming to light
                  on a police or judicial inquiry or even in the course of the
                  prosecution evidence at the trial, may establish the necessity for
                  sanction. Whether sanction is necessary or not may have to be
                  determined from stage to stage. The necessity may reveal itself
                  in the course of the progress of the case."</blockquote>

    can be raised and considered at any stage of the proceedings.
    While considering the question as to whether the sanction for

    itself to the allegation made in the complaint, rather it can take into
    account all the materials available on record at the time when the said
    question falls for consideration.

    thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                  "39. The principles emerging from the aforesaid decisions are
                  summarised hereunder:
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              7</span>




<blockquote id="blockquote_4">            39.1. Protection of sanction is an assurance to an honest and
            sincere officer to perform his duty honestly and to the best of
            his ability to further public duty. However, authority cannot be
            camouflaged to commit crime.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">            39.2. Once act or omission has been found to have been
            committed by public servant in discharging his duty it must be
            given liberal and wide construction so far its official nature is
            concerned. Public servant is not entitled to indulge in criminal
            activities. To that extent <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_23">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. has to be construed
            narrowly and in a restricted manner.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">            39.3. Even in facts of a case when public servant has exceeded
            in his duty, if there is reasonable connection it will not deprive
            him of protection under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_24">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. There cannot be a
            universal rule to determine whether there is reasonable nexus
            between the act done and official duty nor is it possible to lay
            down such rule.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">            39.4. In case the assault made is intrinsically connected with or
            related to performance of official duties, sanction would be
            necessary under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_25">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C., but such relation to duty
            should not be pretended or fanciful claim. The offence must be
            directly and reasonably connected with official duty to require
            sanction. It is no part of official duty to commit offence. In case
            offence was incomplete without proving, the official act,
            ordinarily the provisions of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_26">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. would apply.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">            39.5. In case sanction is necessary, it has to be decided by
            competent authority and sanction has to be issued on the basis
            of sound objective assessment. The court is not to be a
            sanctioning authority.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">            39.6. Ordinarily, question of sanction should be dealt with at the
            stage of taking cognizance, but if the cognizance is taken
            erroneously and the same comes to the notice of court at a later
            stage, finding to that effect is permissible and such a plea can
            be taken first time before the appellate court. It may arise at
            inception itself. There is no requirement that the accused must
            wait till charges are framed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">            39.7. Question of sanction can be raised at the time of framing
            of charge and it can be decided prima facie on the basis of
            accusation. It is open to decide it afresh in light of evidence
            adduced after conclusion of trial or at other appropriate stage.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">            39.8. Question of sanction may arise at any stage of
            proceedings. On a police or judicial inquiry or in course of
            evidence during trial. Whether sanction is necessary or not may
            have to be determined from stage to stage and material brought
            on record depending upon facts of each case. Question of
            sanction can be considered at any stage of the proceedings.
            Necessity for sanction may reveal itself in the course of the
            progress of the case and it would be open to the accused to
            place material during the course of trial for showing what his
            duty was. The accused has the right to lead evidence in support
            of his case on merits.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">            39.9. In some cases it may not be possible to decide the
            question effectively and finally without giving opportunity to the
            defence to adduce evidence. Question of good faith or bad faith
            may be decided on conclusion of trial."

<p id="p_32">      In the case of Om Prakash &amp; Ors. Vs. State of Jharkhand

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                    8</span>




     has held that the question as to whether the sanction for prosecution
     is necessary or not is to be decided from stage to stage. The said
     question may arise at any stage of the proceeding. In a given case, it
     may arise at the very inception. There may be unassailable and
     unimpeachable circumstances on record establishing at the outset that
     the police officer or public servant was acting in performance of his
     official duty and was entitled to protection provided under Section 197
     Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_33">               In the case of Prakash Singh Badal &amp; Anr. Vs. State of
     Punjab &amp; Ors., reported in (2007)1 SCC 1, it has been held by
     the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the question relating to the
     requirement of sanction under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_27">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. is not necessarily to
     be considered as soon as the complaint is lodged on the basis of the
     allegations contained therein. The said question may arise at any stage
     of the proceeding. The question whether sanction is necessary or not
     may have to be determined from stage to stage.
</p><p id="p_34">               In the case of Rama Dayal Markarha Vs. State of Madhya
     Pradesh, reported in (1978)2 SCC 630, the Hon'ble Supreme
     Court while dealing with a case relating to the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_28">Contempt of Courts Act</a>
     has held that the explanation appended to <a href="/doc/1121027/" id="a_29">Section 3</a> of the said Act
     clearly shows that the proceeding either civil or criminal is deemed to
     continue to be pending until it is finally heard and decided i.e. to say
     in a case where a forum of appeal or revision is provided, until the
     appeal or revision is heard finally and decided or where no appeal or
     revision is preferred until the period of limitation prescribed for the
     same expires.
</p><p id="p_35">13. Thus, the issue as to whether the question of sanction can be raised
     at any stage of the proceeding is no more res integra. It is not
     necessary that the same should be raised at the very inception of
     lodging of the prosecution, rather it can be raised even at the appellate
     or revision stage. The said question may have to be determined from
     stage to stage. If it is found that there is unassailable and
     unimpeachable circumstances on record that the public servant was
     acting in discharge of his official duty, he is entitled to protection under
     Section 197 Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_36">14. Now, the question falls for consideration of this Court is as to whether

    <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_31">197</a> Cr.P.C. so as to invoke the requirement of sanction before

</p><p id="p_37">15. In the case of Matajog Dobey (Supra.), the Constitution Bench of
    the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">                  "17. Slightly differing tests have been laid down in the decided
                  cases to ascertain the scope and the meaning of the relevant
                  words occurring in <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_33">Section 197</a> of the Code; "any offence alleged
                  to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act
                  in the discharge of his official duty". But the difference is only in
                  language and not in substance. The offence alleged to have
                  been committed must have something to do, or must be related
                  in some manner with the discharge of official duty. No question
                  of sanction can arise under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_34">Section 197</a>, unless the act
                  complained of is an offence; the only point to determine is
                  whether it was committed in the discharge of official duty. There
                  must be a reasonable connection between the act and the official
                  duty. It does not matter even if the act exceeds what is strictly
                  necessary for the discharge of the duty, as this question will arise
                  only at a later stage when the trial proceeds on the merits. What
                  we must find out is whether the act and the official duty are so
                  inter-related that one can postulate reasonably that it was done
                  by the accused in the performance of the official duty, though
                  possibly in excess of the needs and requirements of the
                  situation. In Hori Barn Singh v. Crown [(1939) FCR 159, 178]
                  Sulaiman, J. observes:

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">                  "The section cannot be confined to only such acts as are done
                  by a public servant directly in pursuance of his public office,
                  though in excess of the duty or under a mistaken belief as to the
                  existence of such duty. Nor is it necessary to go to the length of
                  saying that the act constituting the offence should be so
                  inseparably connected with the official duty as to form part and
                  parcel of the same transaction."

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">                  The interpretation that found favour with Varadachariar, J. in the
                  same case is stated by him in these terms at p. 187: "There must
                  be something in the nature of the act complained of that
                  attaches it to the official character of the person doing it". In
                  affirming this view, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
                  observe in Gill case [(1948) LR 75 IA 41] : "A public servant can
                  only be said to act or purport to act in the discharge of his official
                  duty, if his act is such as to lie within the scope of his official
                  duty ... The test may well be whether the public servant, if
                  challenged, can reasonably claim that, what he does, he does in
                  virtue of his office". Hori Ram case [(1939) FCR 159,
                  178] is referred to with approval in the latter case of Lieutenant
                  Hector Thomas Huntley v. King-Emperor [(1944) FCR 262] but
                  the test laid down that it must be established that the act
                  complained of was an official act appears to us unduly to narrow
                  down the scope of the protection afforded by <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_35">Section 197</a> of the
                  Criminal Procedure Code as defined and understood in the earlier
                  case. The decision in <a href="/doc/1596041/" id="a_36">Meads v. King</a> [(1948) LR 75 IA 185] does
                  not carry us any further; it adopts the reasoning in Gill's
                  case [(1948) LR 75 IA 41]."

<p id="p_39">      In the case of State of Orissa &amp; Ors. Vs. Ganesh Chandra
Jew, reported in (2004)8 SCC 40, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">             "7. The protection given under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_40">Section 197</a> is to protect
             responsible public servants against the institution of possibly
             vexatious criminal proceedings for offences alleged to have been
             committed by them while they are acting or purporting to act as
             public servants. The policy of the legislature is to afford
             adequate protection to public servants to ensure that they are
             not prosecuted for anything done by them in the discharge of
             their official duties without reasonable cause, and if sanction is
             granted, to confer on the Government, if they choose to exercise
             it, complete control of the prosecution. This protection has
             certain limits and is available only when the alleged act done by
             the public servant is reasonably connected with the discharge of
             his official duty and is not merely a cloak for doing the
             objectionable act. If in doing his official duty, he acted in excess
             of his duty, but there is a reasonable connection between the
             act and the performance of the official duty, the excess will not
             be a sufficient ground to deprive the public servant of the
             protection. The question is not as to the nature of the offence
             such as whether the alleged offence contained an element
             necessarily dependent upon the offender being a public servant,
             but whether it was committed by a public servant acting or
             purporting to act as such in the discharge of his official capacity.
             Before <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_41">Section 197</a> can be invoked, it must be shown that the
             official concerned was accused of an offence alleged to have
             been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the
             discharge of his official duties. It is not the duty which requires
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                               11</span>




             examination so much as the act, because the official act can be
             performed both in the discharge of the official duty as well as in
             dereliction of it. The act must fall within the scope and range of
             the official duties of the public servant concerned. It is the
             quality of the act which is important and the protection of this
             section is available if the act falls within the scope and range of
             his official duty. There cannot be any universal rule to determine
             whether there is a reasonable connection between the act done
             and the official duty, nor is it possible to lay down any such rule.
             One safe and sure test in this regard would be to consider if the
             omission or neglect on the part of the public servant to commit
             the act complained of could have made him answerable for a
             charge of dereliction of his official duty. If the answer to this
             question is in the affirmative, it may be said that such act was
             committed by the public servant while acting in the discharge of
             his official duty and there was every connection with the act
             complained of and the official duty of the public servant. This
             aspect makes it clear that the concept of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_42">Section 197</a> does not
             get immediately attracted on institution of the complaint case.

             capable of a narrow as well as a wide interpretation. If these

             altogether sterile, for, "it is no part of an official duty to commit
             an offence, and never can be". In the wider sense, these words
             will take under their umbrella every act constituting an offence,
             committed in the course of the same transaction in which the
             official duty is performed or purports to be performed. The right
             approach to the import of these words lies between these two

</blockquote><p id="p_41">17. The learned senior counsel for the P-2 submits that P-2 has been
    implicated in the present case due to vengeance. It has been
    submitted that when P-2 was the member of the Committee of
    Legislative Assembly relating to pollution control, several complaints
    were received by him for violating the pollution norms by Ramgarh
    Sponger Iron Private Limited and as such he raised the said issue in
    the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly and by the orders of the Jharkhand
    State Pollution Control Board, the said factory was closed. However,
    subsequently, on furnishing of the bank guarantee of Rs.5.00 lacs, the
    order for closure of the factory was revoked with a further direction
    not to commit the said offence again. It has, thus, been contended
    that due to such action of P-2, which was in discharge of his official
    duty, the informant hatched a conspiracy with the owner of the factory
    and also the other employees to implicate the petitioners in the present
    case. Under the aforesaid circumstance, it was mandatory for the
    prosecution to seek sanction from the appropriate authority under
    <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_57">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. before proceeding with the case against P-2.

<p id="p_42">18. On the other hand, the case of the prosecution is that the petitioners
     were extorting Rs.5.00 lacs from the informant and the owner of the
     factory for which they threatened them to kill and also to close down
     the said factory.

                   today. All acts done by a public servant in the purported
                   discharge of his official duties cannot as a matter of course be

                   56: 1970 SCC (Cri) 292 : (1971) 1 SCR 317] the underlying

                   with the main object of causing embarrassment and harassment

                   be considered dehors the duties which a public servant is

        '6. ... It is not therefore every offence committed by a
        public servant that requires sanction for prosecution
        under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_62">Section 197(1)</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code,
        nor even every act done by him while he is actually
        engaged in the performance of his official duties but if
        the act complained of is directly concerned with his
        official duties so that, if questioned, it could be claimed
        to have been done by virtue of the office, then sanction
        would be necessary. It is the quality of the act that
        is important and if it falls within the scope and
        range of his official duties the protection
        contemplated by <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_63">Section 197</a> of the Criminal
        Procedure Code will be attracted. An offence may
        be entirely unconnected with the official duty as
        such or it may be committed within the scope of
        the official duty. Where it is unconnected with
        the official duty there can be no protection. It is
        only when it is either within the scope of the
        official duty or in excess of it that the protection
        is claimable.'

It has been widened further by extending protection to even
those acts or omissions which are done in purported exercise of
official duty. That is under the colour of office. Official duty
therefore implies that the act or omission must have been done
by the public servant in course of his service and such act or
omission must have been performed as part of duty which
further must have been official in nature. The section has, thus,
to be construed strictly, while determining its applicability to any
act or omission in course of service. Its operation has to be
limited to those duties which are discharged in course of
duty. But once any act or omission has been found to have been
committed by a public servant in discharge of his duty then it
must be given liberal and wide construction so far its official
nature is concerned. For instance a public servant is not entitled
to indulge in criminal activities. To that extent the section has to
be construed narrowly and in a restricted manner. But once it is
established that act or omission was done by the public servant
while discharging his duty then the scope of its being official
should be construed so as to advance the objective of the section
in favour of the public servant. Otherwise the entire purpose of
affording protection to a public servant without sanction shall
stand frustrated. For instance a police officer in discharge
of duty may have to use force which may be an offence
for the prosecution of which the sanction may be
necessary. But if the same officer commits an act in
course of service but not in discharge of his duty then
the bar under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_64">Section 197</a> of the Code is not attracted.

in discharge of his duty can be deemed to be official was

     the scope and ambit of the duty does not come in the purview of
     discharge of the official duty. Certainly, it is not within the scope of the
     duty of P-2 being an MLA to commit extortion by threatening the
     informant and the owner of the factory with dire consequences.
     Though the act done by using excessive force while discharge of the
     duty or in purported discharge of the duty, is not a good ground to
     deprive the public servant of such protection when there is a
     reasonable connection between the act and the performance of the
     official duty, yet in the facts of the present case, the alleged act of P-
     2 is completely foreign to the scope of his official duty. There is no
     connection between the scope of the duty of P-2 and the act alleged
     to have been done by him. By no stretch of imagination, P-2 could
     have asked for "Rangdari" (extortion) from the informant and,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                   17</span>




     thus, he certainly misused his power which cannot attract the
     requirement of protection under Section 197 Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_52">21. I do not find any unassailable and unimpeachable evidence on record
     which suggests that the act alleged to have been done by P-2 was in
     discharge of his official duty or it was related in any manner with his
     official duty. There can be no dispute with the proposition that the
     purpose of providing protection under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_68">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. is to protect
     an honest public servant from undue harassment in discharge of his
     official duty, however, at the same time the same protection cannot
     be given to a public servant who commits an offence totally foreign to
     the discharge of his official duty. In Gill's case (Supra.), specific
     illustration has been provided by the Privy Council for proper
     understanding as to what act may not be called to have been done "in
     discharge of official duty". It has been explained that when a Judge
     takes bribe for delivering a judgment, that act may not be treated in
     discharge of his official duty.
</p><p id="p_53">22. The learned senior counsel for the P-2 has further contended that the
     quantum of bank guarantee so ordered by the Jharkhand State
     Pollution Control Board to be deposited by the factory is same to what
     was alleged to have been demanded by the petitioners and, thus, the
     said fact also shows that the said offence alleged to have been
     committed by P-2 was in discharge of his official duty.
</p><p id="p_54">23. For better appreciation of the said argument advanced by the learned
     senior counsel for P-2, I have also perused the records of the case. On
     8th March, 2011, P-2 had raised the issue of violation of pollution norms
     by the factory before the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly and,
     thereafter, the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board took up the
     matter and a direction for closure of the factory was issued on
     29.3.2011 in terms with <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_69">Section 31(A)</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_70">Control
     of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. However, on deposit of the bank guarantee of
     Rs.5.00 lacs by the factory for taking further precaution, the earlier
     order issued for closure of the factory was revoked by the Jharkhand
     State Pollution Control Board vide order dated 30th April, 2011 and the
     said issue came to an end.
</p><p id="p_55">            So far as the Commission of extortion is concerned, the
     prosecution witnesses have consistently deposed that the extortion
     amount was demanded from the informant and the owner of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                 18</span>




     factory with threatening to kill them and to close down the factory. It
     has come in the evidence that Rs.1.00 lac was given to P-2 on
     2.4.2011. However, the petitioners continued to extort money and
     thereafter, the alleged occurrence dated 25th August, 2011 took place
     at the factory gate.
</p><p id="p_56">24. In view of the aforesaid facts, it transpires that even after the matter
     relating to violation of pollution norms by the factory came to an end
     on 30th April, 2011, the petitioners continued to make the extortion
     from the informant and the owner of the factory giving rise to the
     alleged occurrence dated 25th August, 2011. Thus, on the said factual
     premise also, it cannot be said that the alleged occurrence dated 25 th
     August, 2011 had any connection with the discharge of the official duty
     of P-2. Therefore, I do not find any substance in contentions of the
     learned senior counsel for the P-2 that the prosecution should have
     sought sanction for prosecution of P-2 in terms with Section 197
     Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_57">25. Now, the question arises as to whether the case of the petitioners has
     any merit warranting interference with the impugned judgments
     passed by the Trial Court and the Appellate Court under the revisional
     jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_58">26. The learned senior counsel for the P-2 and the counsel for the P-1 have
     submitted that the Trial Court passed the impugned judgment of
     conviction and order of sentence in a mechanical manner without
     appreciating the evidence available on record. The Appellate Court also
     erroneously affirmed the judgment of conviction and order of sentence
     without appreciating the materials available on record in true
     perspective. The petitioners have been implicated in the present case
     only on account of vengeance, as P-2 being the Member of the
     Committee of Legislative Assembly on Pollution Control had raised the
     issue of violation of pollution norms by the factory of P.W.8 due to
     which the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board took the action. It
     has also been submitted that there was an undue delay in sending the
     first information report to the Magistrate which makes the prosecution
     case doubtful. All the witnesses examined in the present case are
     highly interested, being the owner, manager, liaisoning officer and
     other employees of the factory. The courts below have miserably failed
     to consider the evidence of the defence witness as well as the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                    19</span>




     documentary evidence, which clearly indicate the manner in which the
     petitioners have been falsely implicated in the present case. The
     informant (P.W.5) has admitted in his evidence that he had never
     talked to the P-2 in his physical presence. The courts below have also
     miserably failed to appreciate that the alleged mobile phones, which
     were used for demanding extortion, did not belong to the petitioners.
     There is no evidence to suggest that the petitioners put the informant
     in fear of any injury or of grievous hurt in order to commit extortion.
     There is an error of omission in framing of charge, as there is non-
     mentioning of some relevant facts in the same. As per the charge, the
     petitioners were tried for the alleged occurrence dated 25.8.2011,
     whereas the prosecution witnesses have deposed that prior to the said
     date, the accused persons were demanding extortion and Rs.1.00 lac
     was given to P-2 in order to meet their demand. Though the entire
     case of the prosecution is based on mobile conversation, yet no alleged
     mobile phones or sim was seized by the Investigating Officer.
</p><p id="p_59">27. On this, Mr. Jay Prakash, learned Additional Advocate General, submits
     that both the courts below have given concurrent finding of fact after
     appreciating each and every point raised by the parties. The petitioners
     have, however, failed to show any illegality of infirmity in the impugned
     judgments of the learned courts below and, thus, there is no good
     ground to reverse the findings of the courts below under the revisional
     jurisdiction. It is also submitted by the learned Additional Advocate
     General that even if there is any procedural lapses on the part of the
     prosecution, the alleged offence has sufficiently been proved by the
     prosecution. The prosecution witnesses have consistently deposed the
     fact of alleged demand of Rangdari (extortion) and the defence has
     not been able to draw any major contradiction in their cross-
     examination.
</p><p id="p_60">28. Before appreciating the argument of learned counsel for the parties, it
     would be relevant to go through the extent and scope of the revisional
     jurisdiction of this Court.
</p><p id="p_61">            In the case of Sheonandan Paswan Vs. state of Bihar &amp;
     Ors. reported in (1987)1 SCC 288, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has

                   the case. The court in revision considers the materials only to
                   satisfy itself about the correctness, legality and propriety of the

</blockquote>
<p id="p_62">29. Coming back to the present case, P.W.1 is the Investigating Officer,
     who recorded the statement of the informant. P.W.1 has proved the
     endorsement made by Madan Mohan Singh, Officer-in-charge of the
     police station for lodging the first information report, which is marked
     as Ext.1. He has further proved the formal first information report,
     which is marked as Ext.2. P.W.2 is the second Investigating Officer,
     who has proved the charge sheet, marked as Ext.3. The present first
     information report has been lodged on the basis of the written report
     of P.W.5, who alleged that on 25th August, 2011 at about 2:00 p.m.,
     P-1 came to the factory gate of Ramgarh Sponge Iron Private Limited,
     Hosir and called him. On coming there, the informant was threatened
     by P-1 as to why the demanded amount of Rs.5.00 lacs was not sent
     to P-2. Thereafter, P-1 contacted P-2 on his mobile phone and handed
     over the same to the informant and, thereupon P-2 threatened him
     that if the owner of the factory does not send Rs.5.00 lacs, he will get
     the said factory closed. It has further been alleged that earlier also the
     petitioners had demanded money on mobile phone and had threatened
     to kill him and the owner of the factory. The informant proved the
     written report as Ext.4. P.W.6 deposed that on the date of occurrence,
     at the relevant point of time, he was performing the duty of guard at
     the gate of the factory. At that time, a person came to the gate and
     disclosed his name as Randhir Gupta, who asked for the informant,
     and, thereafter, P.W.6 informed the said fact to the informant. He
     further deposed that after talking to P-1 the informant was looking
     afraid. He also deposed that P-1 was demanding Rangdari (extortion).
     P.W.7 is the Liaisoning Officer in the factory, who deposed that the
     petitioners were demanding Rangdari from the informant and the
     owner of the factory, namely, Mahavir Prasad Rungta, who used to live
     in Delhi. He further deposed that the informant had given Rs.1.00 lac
     to P-2 through P-1, however, they continued demanding more money.
     Thereafter, P.W.7 went to Ramgarh Gymkhana Club with Mahavir
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                              21</span>




Prasad Rungta (P.W.8) and gave Rs.1.00 lac to P-2, who was
accompanied by P-1. The said witness also deposed that the
petitioners demanded further Rangdari (extortion) from the informant
for which the present case has been lodged. During cross-examination
also, the said witness deposed that Rs.1.00 lac was given in his
presence. P.W.8, who is the owner of the factory has supported the
allegation made in the first information report and has deposed that
the petitioners had called him in Jharkhand Bhawan at New Delhi,
however, he did not go there. The petitioners threatened him to kill
and to close down his factory. The said witness also deposed that he
gave Rs.1.00 lac to P-2 through the informant. However, the
petitioners continued to demand Rs.5.00 lacs due to which he came to
Ramgarh with P.W.7 and met the petitioners at Gymkhana Club,
Ramgarh on 2nd April, 2011. He further deposed that on the said date
there was a world cup match. He ordered the caretaker of the said
club, namely, Nand Kishore for food. It has also been deposed that he
gave Rs.1.00 lac to P-2, however, he was pressurized to give Rs.5.00
lacs. The said witness has further deposed that P.W.3 had given him
food bill, which was paid by him. The said food bill was also signed by
him. P.W.3- Nand Kishore Mahto also supported the deposition of
P.Ws.7 and 8. He disclosed that on 2nd April, 2011, P.Ws.6 and 7 had
come to Gymkhana Club, Ramgarh along with the petitioners. They
had taken dinner there. He heard that they were talking about money.
The said witness proved the carbon copy of the receipt relating to
service of food, which have been marked as Exts. Y, Y/1 and Y/2,
however, he was declared hostile on the point of identification. P.W.9
deposed that at the relevant time, he was in the additional charge of
System Administrator at S.P. Office. He proved the CDR of Mobile
No.9386613800, which has been marked as Ext.6.
</p><p id="p_63">       The only witness appearing on behalf of the defence, namely,
Radheshyam Sahu (D.W.1) deposed that a "Dharna" was organized on
3rd May, 2010 at the factory gate by him, however, the management
ordered its staff to chase and oust the protesters and they were beaten
up. He had lodged the first information report, being Giddi P.S. Case
no.46 of 2010, and the management of the factory put pressure upon
him to withdraw the said case and when it was not done, the present
false case has been filed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                   22</span>




<p id="p_64">30. It would, thus, appear that P.W.5, who is informant of the case, has
     supported the allegation made in the first information report. He
     further disclosed that P.W.6, who was guard of the factory, had
     informed him that P-1 was calling him at the factory gate. P.W.6 has
     also deposed that on the date of occurrence, he was on duty at the
     factory gate and had informed P.W.5 about the arrival of P-1. Though
     the said witness was declared hostile by the prosecution on the point
     of identification of P-1, yet rest part of his evidence cannot be
     disbelieved. Though the informant during his evidence further added
     that he gave Rs.1.00 lac to P-1 at the factory gate, which was not
     disclosed at the time of lodging of the first information, yet considering
     the fact that P.Ws.7 and 8 have duly supported the factum of giving
     Rs.1.00 lac to the petitioners at Gymkhana Club, Ramgarh, his
     testimony cannot be disbelieved in totality. P.Ws.7 and 8 have also
     consistently deposed that the petitioners were committing extortion
     and were threatening P.W.8 that non-payment of the same would lead
     to closure of the factory and they would also be killed. P.Ws.7 and 8
     have narrated the occurrence taking place at Ramgarh Gymkhana Club
     where they had a talk with the petitioners and also gave Rs.1.00 lac to
     them. P.W.3-caretaker of the said club has also supported the factum
     of their arrival at the club and has also stated that he heard them
     talking about money. The mere fact that there was some enmity
     between the petitioners and the informant does not by itself vitiate the
     prosecution case. Each case is to be decided on its peculiar facts. Even
     if it is assumed that any other case against some of the prosecution
     witnesses is pending, the same would be decided on the basis of the
     evidence led in that case.
</p><p id="p_65">31. The learned senior counsel appearing for the P-2 has also contended
     that CDR of mobile phone from which the alleged offence of extortion
     was made has not been proved by the prosecution and as such the
     petitioners are entitled to be acquitted of the charges. In support of
     the said contention, reliance has been placed on the judgment of the
     Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered in the case of Prashant Bharti Vs.
     State (NCT of Delhi), reported in (2013)9 SCC 293, wherein it
     was found through the CDR of the mobile phones that neither the
     appellant nor the complainant was present at the place of occurrence
     and as such the proof of that fact was held to be conclusive for all
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                  23</span>




     intents and purposes. Learned senior counsel has further put reliance
     on the judgment of Tripura High Court rendered in the case Sri
     Satyendra Nath Vs. Smti Kadambini Debnath, reported in
     2015 SCC Online Tri 600, wherein it has been held that
     documentary evidence has to prevail over the oral evidence. If a fact
     is proved by the documentary evidence, the Court of law is not
     required to elaborately discuss the oral evidence.
</p><p id="p_66">32. However, the facts of the present case is entirely different from the
     cases cited by Mr. Tulsi, learned senior counsel for the P-2. It is not
     the case of the petitioners that there was electronic evidence in form
     of CDR of mobile phone which disproves the case of the prosecution,
     rather in the present case, the informant in his written report has
     specifically claimed that prior to the occurrence dated 25th August,
     2011, the petitioners were talking to him on his mobile No.9386613800
     through three different mobile numbers i.e. 9431501558, 9131819971
     &amp; 9431168642. The informant has further supported the version of the
     first information report during his evidence in Court. The CDR of mobile
     No.9386613800 was also produced before the Court and the was
     proved by P.W.9, who asserted that the calls were made from mobile
     nos.9631819971     and    9431501558     on   mobile   no.9386613800
     belonging to the informant, which corroborates the claim of the
     informant that the phone calls were made to him from those mobile
     numbers. The version of extortion by the petitioners at Gymkhana Club
     on 2nd April, 2011 has also been supported by the prosecution
     witnesses. The occurrence dated 25th August, 2011 too has been
     supported by the prosecution witnesses. Though the CDR of the mobile
     phone number of P-1 was not proved by the prosecution in relation to
     the occurrence dated 25th August, 2011, yet if such defect in the
     investigation is noticed by the Court it has to be circumspect in
     evaluating the evidence, however, it would not be appropriate to
     acquit an accused solely on the ground of that defect, as the same
     would tantamount to playing the hands of the Investigating Officer, if
     the investigation is designedly defective. The said ratio has been laid
     down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Karnel Singh Vs.
     State of Madhya Pradesh, reported in (1995)5 SCC 518.
</p><p id="p_67">33. Relying on the said ratio it can be held that mere fact that the CDR of
     mobile phone of P-1 was not proved by the prosecution, will not be a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                    24</span>




     good ground to brush aside the entire case of the prosecution, if
     otherwise the rest evidence fully supports the case of the prosecution.
</p><p id="p_68">34. So far as the contention raised on behalf of the petitioners that the
     delay caused in forwarding the first information report to the
     Magistrate creates a doubt on the prosecution case, it would be
     appropriate to go through the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court
     in the case of Bimla Devi Vs. Rajesh Singh &amp; Anr., reported in
     (2016)15 SCC 448, wherein it has been held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">                   "9. The above two arguments were also pleaded before the trial
                   court as well as the High Court, and both the courts below
                   denied the averments and reasoned that the two errors did not
                   prejudice the investigation. Moreover, the prosecution case was
                   supported by six strong and cogent eyewitnesses, which was
                   further corroborated by the medical evidence and the recovery
                   memos. The High Court perused the testimony of PW 9, who is
                   the investigating officer, wherein it was deposed that he
                   recorded the statement (fardbeyan) at 4.30 p.m., thereafter he
                   went to the place of incident and the body of deceased Kashi
                   Nath Tiwary was recovered from the well after one hour of his
                   arrival, and the inquest and other proceedings were conducted.
                   Hence, he stated that the FIR was lodged at about 9.00 p.m.
                   The witness further stated that the FIR was sent to the
                   Magistrate through Special Messenger on 22-12-1998. Although
                   it is true that delay in sending the FIR to the Magistrate can
                   vitiate the investigation, but it is settled position that a cogent
                   reasoning can override this procedural lacunae. It is an accepted
                   fact that there was a delay of one day in sending the FIR.
                   However, no motive in manipulating with the FIR was proved.
                   The prosecution case is strongly backed by testimonies of the
                   six eyewitnesses who have testified the incident in almost similar
                   terms. A procedural lapse in not sending the FIR promptly, did
                   not prejudice the present case."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_69">35. It would, thus, emerge that the procedural lapse in not sending the
     first information report promptly will not always be fatal to the case of
     the prosecution. If the prosecution case is otherwise consistent and no
     motive is proved regarding manipulation of the first information report,
     the same cannot be taken as a good ground to brush aside the entire
     prosecution case.
</p><p id="p_70">36. So far as the contention made on behalf of the petitioners that all the
     witnesses examined by the prosecution are highly interested and as
     such their testimony cannot be relied upon for convicting the
     petitioners alone is concerned, it transpires that the petitioners have
     not been able to show any major contradiction and inconsistency in
     their evidence before the courts below, rather their oral evidence is
     also supported by the documentary evidence, as would be evident
     from the fact that P.W.3 has proved the carbon copy of the receipt of
     food bills dated 2nd April, 2011, marked as Exts. Y, Y/1 and Y/2.

<p id="p_71">        37. In view of the aforesaid discussions, I see no reason to interfere with
              the impugned common judgment dated 1st April, 2017 passed by the
              Additional Sessions Judge-II, Hazaribagh in Cr. Appeal Nos.17 of 2015
