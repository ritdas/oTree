one Smt.Sadhna Grover was forcibly dispossessed from tehbazari site in
1999 pursuant whereto she filed W.P.(C) No.6827/1999. The said writ
petition was allowed in favour of Smt.Sadhna Grover by the learned Single
Judge vide order dated November 26, 2005 against which an appeal was
preferred by MCD being LPA No.240/2006. During the pendency of the
appeal Smt.Sadhna Grover was directed to be put back in possession as per
the orders of the learned Single Judge by the Division Bench on March 31,
2009. Representation was made by the Retail Coal &amp; Fire Wood Traders
Welfare Association (Regd.) to the Chairman of Standing Committee of the
respondent No.2 to review the policy decision and a statement in this regard
was made by respondent No.2 before the Division Bench that they would be
framing a policy. Finally a policy dated July 06, 2011 was framed pursuant
to Resolution Nos.874 dated March 16, 2011 and 10 dated May 27, 2011

 which was placed on record in LPA No.240/2006. LPA No.240/2006 was
disposed of on March 18, 2015 with the following directions:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "22. We have considered the matter in the light of the
       contention raised and the history of these proceedings as
       noted hereinabove.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       23. Though it is quite evident from the orders made from
       time to time in the appeal that the direction issued by the
       learned Single Judge to the appellant MCD to allot a plot of
       land admeasuring 200 sq. yrds. on tehbazari basis to the
       respondent No.1/writ petitioner has been given a gobye and
       it has been held that the respondent No.1/writ petitioner is
       entitled to the same treatment as the other erstwhile coal
       depot tehbazari holders but we may also observe that we
       are unable to agree with the reasoning given by the learned
       Single Judge for issuing the direction to the appellant MCD
       to allot plot admeasuring 200 sq. yrds. to the respondent
       No.1/writ petitioner, even if on licence basis. The learned
       Single Judge appears to have been swayed into passing
       such a direction, dismayed at the false stand purportedly
       taken by the official of the MCD in the course of the
       proceeding in the writ petition. However, the stand, even if
       false, taken by some officials of the MCD also does not
       justify conferment of a benefit of allotment of land to the
       respondent No.1/writ petitioner, if otherwise not entitled to.
       We may also observe that the stand taken by the officials of
       the MCD of denial of grant of tehbazari rights to the
       respondent No.1/writ petitioner/her predecessor, was in the
       face of no records of such grant being available in the
       MCD. It cannot thus really be said that the stand was false;
       perhaps it was not properly worded.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       24. It cannot be lost sight of that the predecessor of the
       respondent No.1/writ petitioner was but a tehbazari holder.
       A tehbazari holder is merely a licensee, entitled only to use
       the land for the purpose licensed and has no right, title or
       interest in the land. It cannot also be lost sight of that the

        said tehbazari was expressly for running a coal depot. It is
       not in dispute that the business of running of coal depot
       came to an end in the year 1995 and beyond which it was
       not permissible in law to run a coal depot on the said land.
       In our opinion, the tehbazari of the respondent No.1/writ
       petitioner thus came to an end in 1995 itself and the
       respondent No.1/writ petitioner has not pleaded any right in
       law to continue in use of the said land for other purpose or
       to get any alternative land. The right of the respondent
       No.1/writ petitioner could at best be of rehabilitation in
       accordance with the policy, if any in this regard, as has
       rightly been observed in the orders aforesaid in this appeal.
       Reference may also be made to our judgment in Saptagiri
       Restaurant     Vs.    Airports      Authority    of     India
       MANU/DE/2575/2014 where, on a conspectus of case law it
       was held that owing to <a href="/doc/163357526/" id="a_1">Section 64</a> of Indian Easements Act,
       1882, a licencee, if evicted, even though grounds for
       revocation of licence do not exist, or is forcefully evicted,
       his only remedy is to recover compensation from grantor
       and not to resume occupation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       25. Thus, the order dated 22nd November, 2005 of the
       learned Single Judge impugned in this appeal cannot stand
       and is set aside.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       26. As far as the right of the respondent No.1/writ petitioner
       for rehabilitation is concerned, a policy in this regard has
       already been framed under the directions in this appeal
       from time to time. However, now the respondent No.1/writ
       petitioner and others similarly placed as the respondent
       No.1/writ petitioner are not satisfied with the said policy
       and have challenged the same in the other writ petitions

<p id="p_33">6.    The learned Single Judge vide the impugned order noted that though
concededly the health trade licenses produced and relied upon by at least 9
writ petitioners were forged and fabricated which would disentitle them for
any relief, however, since the issue of validity of the policy had been raised
which would affect a large number of persons, it was appropriate to decide
the challenge to the impugned policy on merits. The learned Single Judge
held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">      "12. Essentially, the petitioners have challenged the
      impugned policy on the ground that the same is a colorable
      exercise of power and lacks bona fides. The petitioners have
      further contended that the respondent corporation would not
      have the jurisdiction to take any action against the petitioners
      since the land in question has been transferred to DDA.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">      13. Insofar as the first contention is concerned, i.e. that the
      impugned policy lacks bona fide, there is no material to
      substantiate this contention. The proceedings in this court
      referred to by the petitioners must be considered in proper
      perspective. One Ms. Sadhna Grover had filed a petition in this
      court being W.P.(C) 6827/1999. In the said writ petition, the
      petitioner therein (Sadhna Grover) claimed that in 1969 her
      father-in-law, Madan Lal Grover, was allotted a plot
      measuring 200 sq. yards on tehbazari at Rs.20 per month for
      use as a coal depot. She further asserted that her father-in-law
      expired on 19.07.1979 and, thereafter, DDA had demolished


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">LPA Nos.542/2015 &amp; connected matters                             Page 25 of 40</span>
       the structure built up on the said plot. Sadhna Grover prayed
      that DDA and MCD be restrained from dispossessing her from
      the said land in question. MCD contended that Sadhna Grover
      was at best a licencee and the licence in the name of her father-
      in-law had not been extended beyond 31.12.1989 and, thus, she
      had no right or interest in the plot in question. The MCD also
      disputed that it had ever issued a tehbazari licence in favour of
      the Sadhna Grover's deceased father-in-law for running a coal
      depot. MCD asserted that there was no policy to issue tehbazari
      sites for coal depots and only tehbazari sites of an area
      measuring six feet by four feet had been granted. Subsequently,
      the MCD filed a counter affidavit which, inter alia, stated that
      the Sadhna Grover's father-in-law had been selling coal at the
      site near Shankar Road but there were no records available,
      which indicated that the site was allotted by MCD to Sh. Madal
      Lal Grover. A Coordinate Bench of this Court found that the
      stands taken by MCD were inconsistent. Further, DDA had
      taken a stand that the petitioner Sadhna Grover was not
      entitled for an alternate rehabilitation because of the stand
      taken by the MCD that it had not allotted any site to Madan Lal
      Grover.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_32">      14. In the circumstances, a co-ordinate bench of this the
      Court     passed     an     order     dated     22.11.2005     (in
      W.P.(C)6827/1999) directing the MCD to allot a site measuring
      200 sq. yards to the Sadhna Grover for running a coal depot on
      licence basis. The application filed by the MCD for
      recall/modification of the said order was dismissed by the
      Court on 30.11.2005. The MCD appealed against this order
      before a Division Bench of this Court in LPA 240/2006. During
      the course of the appellate proceedings before the Division
      Bench of this Court, the Additional Deputy Commissioner
      (Land and State) of MCD appeared and stated that in 1995 a
      policy decision had been taken by Delhi Administration that no
      fresh licences would be issued for coal depots and the existing
      licences would also not be renewed. He also asserted that in
      view of the aforesaid decision, all tehbazari sites were required
      to be re-possessed. In this context, the Division Bench observed
      in its order dated 31.03.2009 that either the respondent (the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">LPA Nos.542/2015 &amp; connected matters                             Page 26 of 40</span>
       writ petitioner) should be permitted to operate the coal depot or
      a uniform policy is adopted and implemented to close down
      coal depots and repossess the sites. Pursuant to the aforesaid
      order, an affidavit dated 30.04.2009 was filed by the concerned
      officer of MCD, inter alia, affirming that a decision had been
      taken to re-possess the tehbazari sites of all coal depots which
      had been shut down. The Court was also informed that there
      was a proposal to allot tehbazari sites measuring six feet by
      four feet to the erstwhile tehbazari holders. DDA filed an
      affidavit dated 04.05.2009 affirming that it did not allot plot for
      tehbazari or for coal depots. On 08.05.2009, the learned
      counsel for the MCD stated before the Division Bench that a
      policy decision had been taken and the necessary action would
      be taken in pursuance thereof. Subsequently, on 07.08.2009, the
      learned counsel for the MCD sought further time and it was
      contended that the matter was pending consideration before the
      Standing Committee. The Division Bench observed that there
      was some change in the stand of MCD since earlier it had
      contended that a policy decision had been taken. The matter
      before the Division Bench was deferred at the instance of the
      MCD on several occasions thereafter, as it was contended that
      policy matter was pending. Thereafter, the impugned policy
      was placed before the Division Bench. The impugned policy
      incorrectly recorded that the Court had passed an order in LPA
      240/2006 to frame a policy with regard to coal depots. The
      facts as narrated above, clearly indicate that no such order had
      been passed and the court (Division Bench) had only taken note
      of the submissions made on behalf of the MCD. It is in this
      context that the Division Bench by an order dated 04.05.2012
      passed in LPA 240/2006 clarified that no such direction had
      been given and their observations were limited for a uniform
      implementation of any policy devised by the MCD.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_33">      15. It is apparent from the above that the entire emphasis of
      the Division Bench, at the relevant time, was to ensure that a
      uniform policy is followed by the MCD and there is no pick and
      choose policy adopted by the concerned authorities.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">      16.    In the aforesaid perspective, it cannot be disputed that it

       was necessary for the respondent corporation to frame a
      uniform policy with respect to the tehbazari licences for coal
      depots.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">      17. Clearly, the respondent corporation had considered the
      relevance of granting the tehbazari licences for running coal
      depots and taken a policy decision which is embodied in the
      impugned policy. It cannot be disputed that coal has lost its
      relevance as a fuel for common man. It is no longer a
      commodity which is distributed under the PDS. It is in the
      aforesaid perspective that the MCD adopted the impugned
      policy. The relevant extract of which is quoted below:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">             "1. Since the business of coal is no longer permissible
             and relevant. In the present context, the Tehbazari

             Tehbazari site measuring 7' x 5' preferably in areas near
             their existing coal depot sites failing which in the same

<blockquote id="blockquote_37">             2.    The specific site allotment in each case would be
             made by the Zonal-Vending Committee/Authority after
             checking all documents establishing the identity and
             other credentials of the allottees.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_38">             3.     The MCD land where the coal depots were

             will also initiate steps to protect/secure the land so that
             encroachments are prevented. After checking the
             permitted land use and completing other formalities as

             immediately from them."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">      18. Undeniably, a comprehensive policy in respect of sites
      allotted for coal depots was warranted. The Division Bench had
      also emphasised that a policy be uniformly be implemented.
      Thus, in my view, the contention that the policy is a colourable
      exercise of power or lacks bona fide only because certain
      inaccurate statement had been made before the Division Bench
      in LPA 240/2006, is wholly unsustainable and without merit. It
      is relevant to note that on 30.01.2013, North Delhi Municipal
      Corporation has issued a corrigendum amending paragraph 1
      of the impugned policy. The relevant extract of the said
      corrigendum is quoted below:-

             issued by the Hon'ble High Court for framing a policy,

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">      19. In view of the above, the contention that the impugned
      policy was framed only to sustain a statement made before a
      Division Bench of this court, cannot be accepted.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_48">      20. The second aspect to be considered is whether the
      respondent corporation would have the jurisdiction to take any
      action for retrieval of the sites in question. It is not disputed
      that the tehbazari licence for the said sites had been issued by
      the MCD and the necessary licence fee in respect of the said
      sites was paid to MCD. It is well settled that a licencee is
      granted only a permissive user not conferred any right in
      respect of the said property. It is not disputed that the licences
      granted to the petitioners/their predecessors have expired; thus,
      indisputably, the petitioners have no right to continue to occupy
      the said premises. The DDA has also filed an affidavit, inter
      alia, stating as under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_49">             "b) It is submitted that the Petitioner herein is only an
             encroacher over the government land and has no right,

             pertinent to note that neither DDA nor the Ministry of
             Rehabilitation have ever permitted the Petitioner to run
             Coal Depot and firewood works at the said property.
             Moreover, the coal and firewood work is restricted under

              the Trade Policy in Delhi. Thus the Petitioner is an
             encroacher and is liable to be evicted from the said
             Property."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_50">      21. It is clear from the aforesaid that even according to
      DDA, the petitioners have no right to continue on the respective
      sites occupied by them. In the case of <a href="/doc/100405279/" id="a_3">MCD v. Sadhna Grover
      &amp; Anr</a>: LPA240/2006 decided on 18.03.2015, a Division Bench
      of this Court had set aside the order passed by a Single Judge,
      as the Division Bench had concluded that a licencee is only a
      permissive user and acquires no right, title and interest in the
      land. The relevant extract of the said decision is quoted below:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_51">             "24. It cannot be lost sight of that the predecessor of the
             respondent No.1/writ petitioner was but a tehbazari
             holder. A tehbazari holder is merely a licensee, entitled
             only to use the for the purpose licensed and has no right,
             title or interest in the land. It cannot also be lost sight of
             that the said tehbazari was expressly for running a coal
             depot. It is not in dispute that the business of running of
             coal depot came to an end in the year 1995 and beyond
             which it was not permissible in law to run a coal depot
             on the said land. In our opinion, the tehbazari of the
             respondent No.1/writ petitioner thus came to an end in
             1995 itself and the respondent No.1/writ petitioner has
             not pleaded any right in law to continue in use of the said
             land for other purpose or to get any alternative land. The
             right of the respondent No.1/writ petitioner could at best
             be of rehabilitation in accordance with the policy, if any
             in this regard, as has rightly been observed in the orders
             aforesaid in this appeal."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_52">      22. It is also necessary to bear in mind that the petitioners
      are claiming their rights to occupy the said premises based on
      licences issued by the MCD. In the circumstances, it would not
      be open for the petitioners to resist eviction from the site,
      particularly, in view of the finding that they have no right, title
      or interest in the land in question. Further, even according to
      DDA, the petitioners are land encroachers. Since the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">LPA Nos.542/2015 &amp; connected matters                                Page 31 of 40</span>
       predecessors of the petitioners were granted license for use of
      the property by MCD, its successor, North Delhi Municipal
      Corporation, would certainly have the power to retrieve the
      sites. It is well settled that the licencee only occupies the site
      pursuant to permissive use granted by the grantor. In the
      circumstances, it would not be open for a licencee to challenge
      the right of the grantor with whose permission the site is
      occupied. The decision in S. Thangappan (supra) would not be
      applicable in the facts of this case. In that case, the issue
      regarding applicability of <a href="/doc/20238/" id="a_4">Section 116</a> of the Evidence Act,
      1882 was in the context of a relationship of landlord and tenant
      and not that of a licensor and a licencee. This is significant,
      because whilst a lessee acquires interest in property, a licensee
      does not. As indicated above, a licensee occupies premises only
      on the basis of permission grated by the grantor and acquires
      no right, title or interest in the property. Once the license is
      revoked, the licencee does not have any right to continue in
      occupation of the premises and is liable to be evicted. Stricto
      Senso, <a href="/doc/20238/" id="a_5">section 116</a> of the Evidence Act, 1882 may not apply as
      it only postulates that a licencee is estopped from challenging
      the title to possession of the licensor at the beginning of the
      licencse. However, in this case, admittedly, the petitioners have
      no right to occupy the premises in question. In absence of any
      legal right, no relief under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
      India can be granted to the petitioners. It is relevant to note
      that it is not the case of the petitioner that DDA has permitted
      them to continue to occupy the premises. On the contrary, DDA
      has also asserted that the petitioners are trespassers and are
      occupying the premises without any authority.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_53">      23. I am also inclined to accept the contention that any
      controversy with regard to the ownership of the land in
      question between DDA and MCD cannot be used by the
      petitioners to extend their occupation of the respective sites.

<blockquote id="blockquote_54">      24. The petitions are, accordingly, dismissed. Pending

<p id="p_34"> 7.    Learned counsel for the appellants contends that a perusal of the
policy circular would reveal that the same was applicable to coal depots on
tehbazari basis on "Municipal Lands". The land occupied by the appellants
was not municipal land but belongs to respondent No.3 DDA as confirmed
in the replies to the applications filed under RTI. It is thus contended that in
the absence of MCDs being owner of the land, they could not have
dispossessed the appellants from the lands in question.            Further the
additional affidavit filed by the Additional Secretary (UD), Ministry of
Urban Development, Govt.of India clarifies that in 14 writ petitions, there is
a confusion with regard to the ownership/jurisdiction to the lands vesting in
DDA or MCD.
</p><p id="p_35">8.    In the meetings of the Committee, the MCD could not show any law,
rule, regulation or instructions of Government whereby it could claim that
collection of tehbazari gave it ownership rights in the lands in question.
Thus these disputed questions could not be decided by writ court but by a
competent civil court. It is thus urged that learned Single Judge erroneously
held that any controversy with regard to ownership of law between DDA
and MCD cannot be used by the appellants to extend their occupation of the
sites. It is urged that only the owner of the property could have disturbed
the settled possession of the appellants for more than 5 decades from the
properties in question which was even prior to the grant of tehbazari by the
MCD in 1965 and implementation of the public distribution system in 1971.
It is further urged that the appellants do not claim possession on the
properties in question pursuant to tehbazari rights and even prior thereto
they were in possession of the properties in question. Further the very basis
of the MCD policy that coal trade is impermissible in Delhi since 1994-95 is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">LPA Nos.542/2015 &amp; connected matters                              Page 33 of 40</span>
 false as in WP (C) No.6848/2000 it is revealed that DDA had been
regularizing the sites of coal depots. Appellants have been running pre-1962
commercial establishments and are thus protected under Clause 5.1 of the
latest Master Plan of Delhi 2021. The appellants being ready and willing to
pay regularization charges, damages and use and occupation charges, they
could be permitted to change coal trade to any permissible trade. The policy
framed by the MCD is arbitrary, discriminatory and colourable exercise of
power based on two fundamentally wrong premises that the Division Bench
of this Court in LPA No.240/2006 had directed MCD to frame that policy
and coal trade was not permissible in Delhi since 1994-95.
</p><p id="p_36">9.    The contentions on behalf of the two MCDs i.e. South Delhi
Municipal Corporation and North Delhi Municipal Corporation (in short „the
MCDs‟) are same. Learned counsels contend that appellants‟ claim only a
tehbazari right over the land in question and the tehbazari being a license,
the right was purely personal given to a particular person to do a particular
business at a particular place. Discretion is vested with the MCDs to renew
or not the tehbazari license and it cannot be sought as a matter of right. The
appellants have no right, title or interest over the land in question. The
appellants also cannot claim tehbazari rights over any particular piece of
land. Tehbazari right is merely a license for carrying out a particular trade at
a particular site and can be revoked/modified at any time. The license has
been revoked/modified by the MCDs as per their policy decision. The
appellants do not have any right to perpetual possession over the land in
question and having accepted tehbazari rights, they have acquiesced to the
ownership of MCDs to the properties in question in view of <a href="/doc/20238/" id="a_7">Section 116</a> of
Indian Evidence Act. The appellants are neither the owners of the land nor


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">LPA Nos.542/2015 &amp; connected matters                              Page 34 of 40</span>
 have any document to show permissible use by any authority whatsoever.
Since there is no malafide or arbitrariness or irrationality or illegality in the
policy, it is not subject to interference by the Courts. The appellants cannot
claim any right on public land.        The properties in question have been
retrieved in most of the cases by sealing and the appellants have not
challenged the final order hence no relief can be granted to them.
</p><p id="p_37">10.   The grievances of the appellants in the writ petitions were two fold
firstly that the policy decision as noted above is arbitrary, illegal and liable
to be struck down and secondly their right to possess the property in
question.
</p><p id="p_38">11.   The challenge of the appellants to the policy dated July 06, 2011
cannot be sustained on the reasons urged. The appellants claim that the
policy needs to be struck down for the reason the Division Bench of this
Court in LPA No.240/2006 did not direct MCD to frame the policy rather
recorded the statement of the counsel. Vide the amendment dated July 06,
2011 the expression "Hon'ble High Court of Delhi passed an order in LPA
No.240/2006 titled MCD Vs Sadhna Grover vide which MCD was directed
to frame a policy with regard to the Coal Depots. Pursuant to the above said
orders of the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi..." appearing in para-1 of the
Circular No.AO/CL&amp;EC/2011/87 dated 06.07.2011" has been deleted in the
policy and thus the challenge on this ground does not survive.
</p><p id="p_39">12.   Nothing has been placed on record to show that the policy as framed
is arbitrary, illegal or that the MCDs have no authority to lay down the
policy. No doubt coal as a utility has lost its value in day-to-day life of man.
Except being used in hotels, restaurants etc. the coal is not being used as a
commodity in the household on day-to-day basis and the storage spaces for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">LPA Nos.542/2015 &amp; connected matters                               Page 35 of 40</span>
 the coal depots as required earlier are not required in the present scenario.
The use of coal is further prohibited by the various orders passed under the
Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. Thus we find no reason
to strike down the policy dated July 06, 2011 of the respondent MCDs as
arbitrary and illegal.
</p><p id="p_40">13.   As regards the second issue of repossession of the properties in
question is concerned the learned Single Judge proceeded on a factual
fallacy with regard to the appellants in LPA Nos.542/2015, 575/2015,
593/2015, 594/2015, 622/2015 and 624/2015 that the properties in question
were occupied by them pursuant to the tehbazari rights issued to their
respective predecessors in interest and they were put in possession by the
MCDs. The relevant portion of para 1 of the impugned order is as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">        "1. The petitioners in these petitions are claiming rights to
        occupy premises which had been allotted as coal depots to
        their respective predecessors. Some of the petitioners are
        third parties who have allegedly acquired occupancy rights
        pertaining to the respective premises occupied by them,
        from the original allottees of those premises. Some of the
        petitioners are claiming to be the heirs of the original
        allottees...."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_41">14.   In LPA Nos.542/2015, 575/2015, 593/2015, 594/2015, 595/2015,
622/2015 and 624/2015 the appellants have stated in the writ petitions that
their father or predecessor in interest after partition started the coal business
at the properties in question even prior to tehbazari licenses were issued by
the MCDs. The counter affidavits in all these cases either state these facts to
be matter of record or do not deny these facts for want of knowledge. No
material has been placed by the MCDs to show that the properties in
question were allotted/granted by them. Thus the issue would be whether in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">LPA Nos.542/2015 &amp; connected matters                               Page 36 of 40</span>
 terms of the policy, the MCDs could have evicted the appellants in the
appeals as noted above from the properties in question.
</p><p id="p_42">15.   It is trite law that even a trespasser can be removed only by due
process of law that too by the owner or someone who has better title in the
property than the trespasser. [See: 2003 (7) SCC 350 <a href="/doc/64822048/" id="a_9">Ramesh Chand
Ardawatiya vs.Anil Panjwani</a>]. In LPA Nos.542/2015, 575/2015, 593/2015,
594/2015, 595/2015, 622/2015 and 624/2015 the claim of the appellants in
the writ petitions is that the properties in question were not allotted to them
by the MCDs, whereas in LPA Nos.579/2015, 581/2015, 592/2015,
619/2015, 621/2015 and 757/2015, the appellants state that the properties in
question where they were last doing the coal business was allotted to them
by the MCDs. Clause 6 of the policy notes that some coal depots are on
private lands. Once MCD put the appellants in possession of the properties
in question by issuing tehbazari licenses, the MCDs were within their right
to not only revoke the tehbazari rights which are mere licenses but also
repossess the property in question allotted by them. Whether MCDs are the
owners or not of such properties in question would not be relevant as it has a
better title than the allottee. However, the situation would be different in
cases where the properties in question have not been allotted by the MCDs
to the occupiers while issuing tehbazari licenses.
</p><p id="p_43">16.   The ground urged by the appellants that the MCDs have no
jurisdiction to take any action against the appellants for the reason that the
land in question belongs to DDA as is evident from the various RTI replies
received by the appellants cannot be determined in a writ petition. Clause 3
of the Policy itself provides that MCD lands where the coal depots were
running will be resumed. However, this does not mean that the MCD is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">LPA Nos.542/2015 &amp; connected matters                             Page 37 of 40</span>
 required to show absolute ownership of the properties in question. Suffice it
is to note that if the possession of the properties in question has been handed
over by the MCDs they would be within its rights to resume the same as a
licensee who enters upon a property pursuant to a license cannot have a
vested right in the property on revocation/expiry of the license. <a href="/doc/20238/" id="a_10">Section 116</a>
of the Evidence Act estops a licensee who came upon any immovable
property by a licence, to deny the title of the licensor to such property.
However, where the property in question has not been allotted/handed-over
by MCD though a tehbazari license has been issued the revocation/ expiry of
the said tehbazari license would only entail the person not to continue with
the trade of coal, however he cannot be dispossessed from the property in
question by MCD as it has no better title than the person occupying it.
</p><p id="p_44">17.      The contention of learned counsels for the MCD that the final order of
the MCD has not been challenged deserves to be rejected for the reasons that
in all the cases show cause notices issued to the appellants and the orders
dated November 16, 2011 cancelling the tehbazari licenses and retrieving
properties in question from the allottees/successors/occupiers pursuant to
which sites were sealed on various dates have been challenged besides the
policy.
</p><p id="p_45">18.      In view of the aforesaid discussion the Policy dated July 06, 2011 is
upheld. Consequently, LPAs No.579, 581, 592, 619, 621 and 757 of 2015
are dismissed. LPAs No.542, 575, 593, 594, 595, 622 and 624 of 2015 are
allowed. Impugned judgment and the orders of the MCD dated November
16, 2011 in LPAs No.542, 575, 593, 594, 595, 622 and 624 of 2015 are set
aside.
</p><p id="p_46">19.      This judgment has been passed on the basis of the pleadings of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">LPA Nos.542/2015 &amp; connected matters                              Page 38 of 40</span>
 parties in the writ petition. However, if the parties are in a position to prove
to the contrary on the issue of possession of the properties in question they
would be at liberty to take appropriate remedies before the Civil Court to
ascertain their rights on the properties in question. Any observation made
hereinabove will have no bearing thereon.
</p><p id="p_47">20.   Further if there is any rehabilitation policy in respect of tehbazari
rights or the land belonging to Central Government, the same would be
complied with.
