     I.A. No.5388 of 2019:-
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">1.     The instant interlocutory application is under <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_2">Section 5</a> of the

       Limitation Act for condoning the delay of 202 days in preferring the

       instant appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">2.     This Court, after taking into consideration the reason assigned in the

       instant application as also considering the fact that instead of

       dismissing the appeal on the ground of limitation it would be

       appropriate in the ends of justice to decide the appeal on its merit,

       accordingly, the delay in filing the appeal is condoned.


</p><p id="p_6">3.     In the result, the instant interlocutory application is disposed of.


</p><p id="p_7">     L.P.A. No.325 of 2018:-
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">4.     The instant intra-court appeal is directed against the order/judgment

       dated 12.03.2018 passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court

       in W.P.(C) No.5664 of 2017 whereby and whereunder the writ

       petition has been allowed by which the order dated 27.12.2016

       wherein the decision has been taken by the appellant/respondent

       authority holding the writ-petitioner/respondent not entitle for

       remission of the Demand Charge and Guaranteed Energy Charge

       under Clause 4 of the bilateral agreement for the period from

       03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005 as also with a direction upon the

       respondent    authorities         holding   the writ-petitioner/respondent

       entitled for interest in pursuance of Clause 10.7.4 of the Jharkhand

       State Electricity Regulatory Commission (Electricity Supply Code)

       Regulations, 2015 on the amount of demand charge and guaranteed
                                 [3]


     energy charge from the date it was paid to the DVC till this amount

     with interest is actually paid to it.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">5.   The brief facts as per the pleadings made in the paper-book which

     require to be enumerated herein for proper adjudication of the lis

     are :
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">                The writ-petitioner/respondent, namely, M/s Gautam

     Ferro Alloys, a unit of M/s Bihar Foundary &amp; Casting Ltd. is

     engaged in manufacture of Silico Maganese and Ferro Alloys. It

     was granted electric connection for a contract demand of 3000 KVA

     for which a bilateral agreement was entered between the parties on

     25.02.2003. On the allegation of violation of certain statutory

     provisions, the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (hereinafter

     referred to as the JSPCB) vide its order dated 20.12.2004 directed

     for closure of the writ-petitioner's unit, and on 03.09.2005 its

     factory premises was sealed by JSPCB.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">                The writ-petitioner approached to this Court by filing

     writ petition being W.P.(C) No.5033 of 2005 challenging the

     impugned action of the respondent-JSPCB and by an interim order

     dated 25.10.2005 the Pollution Control Board was directed to

     remove its seal from the factory premises of the writ-petitioner's

     company within three days, and in compliance of the said order,

     JSPCB removed its seal on 27.10.2005.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">                The period between 03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005 became

     the bone of dispute which led the writ-petitioner to file series of

     litigation. The appellant had issued an energy bill for the Month of
                         [4]


October, 2005 demanding the bill for the period from 03.09.2005 to

27.10.2005. The writ-petitioner came to this Court challenging the

demand of bill raised for the period from 03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005

by filing a writ petition being W.P.(C) No.5870 of 2009.


</p><p id="p_18">          The specific plea raised by the writ-petitioner was that on

account of circumstances beyond its control which would attract the

Force Majeure clause as incorporated under Clause-4 to the bilateral

agreement dated 25.02.2003, it is not liable to pay the Demand

Charge and Guaranteed Energy Charge to the respondent-DVC. The

writ-petitioner by that time has succeeded before the revisional

authority. The Member, Board of Revenue, Jharkhand who by an

order dated 05.12.2006 quashed the order passed by the Chairman,

Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board holding that the Pollution

Control Board had issued impugned order in breach of the second

proviso to <a href="/doc/64492593/" id="a_3">Section 21(4)</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">          The order passed by the Member, Board of Revenue is

the major defence raised by the writ-petitioner before the Writ

Court in W.P.(C) No.5870 of 2009 raising the plea that when the

writ-petitioner's unit has been closed for the period from

03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005, the same being in the nature of Force

Majeure as per the condition incorporated under Clause 4 to the

Bilateral Agreement dated 25.02.2003 and as such the Demand

Charge and Guaranteed Energy Charge for the aforesaid period are

not sustainable.
</p><p id="p_21">                              [5]


</p><p id="p_22">6.   The learned Single Judge had accepted the plea and vide order

     dated 29.03.2011 remanded the matter to the appellant-DVC to

     decide the claim of the writ-petitioner/respondent regarding

     adjustment of the energy bill for the period between 03.09.2005 to

     27.10.2005 vis-a-viS Clause 4 of the bilateral agreement.


</p><p id="p_23">7.   The order passed by the writ court was assailed in appeal by the

     DVC in intra-court appeal being L.P.A. No.283 of 2011. The

     Letters Patent Appeal was confined only to the finding recorded by

     the writ court in its order dated 29.03.2011 by which the Single

     Bench of this Court had held that the question of closure of writ-

     petitioner's unit on account of Force Majeure has already been

     decided by the Member, Board of Revenue. The said part of the

     order passed by the writ court was interfered with by the Division

     Bench of this Court in L.P.A. No.283 of 2011 by disposing of the

     said appeal vide order dated 12.03.2012 in the aforesaid terms.


</p><p id="p_24">               The claim of the writ-petitioner, on remand, was rejected

     by the Deputy Chief Engineer (Commercial) by a cryptic order

     dated 18.03.2013, being aggrieved with the aforesaid order the writ-

     petitioner again approached to this Court by filing a writ petition

     being W.P.(C) No.2408 of 2013, which was allowed vide order

     dated 10.09.2015 by which the impugned order dated 18.03.2013

     was quashed by the writ court and the matter was remanded before

     the Deputy Chief Engineer (Commercial) to pass a fresh order, in

     pursuance to the same, the order dated 27.12.2016 was passed,

     which has been quashed and set aside by the learned Single Judge

     and directed for making payment of interest for the aforesaid period
                              [6]


     which is under challenge, subject matter of the present intra-court

     appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">8.   Mr. Srijit Choudhary, learned counsel for the appellant/respondent

     has assailed the aforesaid order inter alia on the ground that the

     learned Single Judge has failed to consider that the dispute by and

     between the parties is related to the terms of agreement entered into

     by and between the parties which can either be decided by a

     competent civil court or by arbitrator in accordance with the

     agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">               The further ground has been agitated that the learned

     Single Judge erred in holding that the writ-petitioner was not liable

     to pay Demand Charge and Guaranteed Energy Charge from the

     period in between 03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005 and therefore, exempt

     the writ-petitioner of the above charges which is not in consonance

     with the terms of Clause 11.10.3, new Clause 10.7.4.


</p><p id="p_29">9.   The ground has been taken in assailing the impugned order whereby

     and whereunder the learned Single Judge has held the writ-

     petitioner liable for interest in terms of Clause 10.7.4 of the 2015

     Regulations.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">               The learned counsel for the appellant, on the ground

     mentioned hereinabove, has submitted that the impugned order is

     not sustainable in the eye of law and accordingly, the same is fit to

     be quashed and set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">10. Per contra, Mr. Nitin Kumar Pasari, learned counsel for the writ-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     petitioner/respondent has advanced his argument by taking aid of
                               [7]


    the condition of agreement pertaining to shortage of power supply

    to the extent that such failure or shortage is due to the Force

    Majeure on account of the events such as strike, lock-out, fire,

    accident, cyclone or any other act of God beyond the control of any

    party or due to any restraint or regulation of the State Government

    or Central Government or any other statutory authority, according

    to him, the learned Single Judge by taking into consideration the

    fact about closure of the unit by an order passed by the JSPCB

    which is a statutory authority and therefore, bringing the case of the

    writ-petitioner under the fold of the agreement as contained under

    Clause 4, has passed an order quashing the demand raised by the

    respondent-DVC for the period from 03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005 and

    as such, according to him, since the bilateral agreement contains a

    specific provision about the consequence of closure of the unit due

    to Force Majeure, no demand can be raised and if by taking into

    consideration the aforesaid condition the order has been passed by

    the learned Single Judge, it cannot be said to suffer from any

    infirmity.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">
</blockquote><p id="p_34">11. The contention about direction pertaining to interest is that since

    there is no fault lying on the part of the writ-petitioner in closure of

    the factory, therefore, if the order of interest has been directed to be

    paid in favour of the writ-petitioner considering the closure to be

    illegal since the same has been set aside by the order passed by the

    Member, Board of Revenue and as such the writ-petitioner since

    has suffered financial loss due to illegal closure of the unit, hence, is
                                [8]


    entitleD for interest for the aforesaid period due to loss sustained by

    the writ-petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">12. He, on the basis of the aforesaid submission, has submitted with

    emphasis that the learned Single Judge while passing such order in

    the facts and circumstances of the instant case, has not committed

    any error, therefore, the order impugned may not be interfered with.


</p><p id="p_37">13. This Court, having heard the learned counsel for the parties and

    after going across the material available on record as well as finding

    recorded in the impugned order has found some admitted fact which

    require to be referred herein.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">               The writ-petitioner has been granted with electric

    connection for a contract demand of 3000 KVA. As a condition

    precedent, a bilateral agreement was entered in between the parties

    on 25.02.2003. The aforesaid bilateral agreement contains a

    provision as under Clause 4 wherein it has been provided :

           terms of this agreement. However, no party shall be liable

           whatsoever arising out of the failure to carry out the terms
           of this agreement or shortage of power supply to the
           extent that such failure or shortage is due the Force-</blockquote><p id="p_40">

           fire, accident, cyclone or any other act of God beyond the
           control of any party or due to any restraint or regulation
           of the State Govt. or Central Govt. or any other statutory
           authority. But any party claiming the benefit under this
           clause shall satisfy the other party of the existence of such
           a Force-Majeure and shall make the best endeavour to
           perform its normal obligations as per terms of this
           Agreement as soon as possible after the cessation of such
           Force-Majeure. If at any time the consumer is prevented
           from receiving or using the electrical energy to be
                             [9]


       supplied under this agreement either in whole or in part
       or if the Corporation is prevented from supplying or
       unable to supply such electrical energy owing to any one
       of the aforesaid reasons, then the Demand Charge and the
       Guaranteed Energy Charge as set out in Schedule-II
       annexed hereto payable by the consumer shall be reduced
       in proportion to the ability of the consumer to take or the

       ground for the aforesaid reduction in Demand Charge
       and the Guaranteed Energy Charge."
</p>
<p id="p_43">             It is evident from the aforesaid condition which speaks

about Force Majeure on account of the events such as strike, lock-

out, fire, accident, cyclone or any other act of God beyond the

control of any party or due to any restraint or regulation of the State

Government or Central Government or any other statutory

authority.

Agreement as soon as possible after the cessation of such Force-

Majeure.

    filing a writ petition being W.P.(C) No.5870 of 2009 challenging

    the action of the appellant/respondent in raising such demand which

    the matter before the authority concerned by taking the plea about

    Force Majeure as provided under Clause 4 to the agreement as

    referred above.

    consideration the order passed on 20.12.2004 by the JSPCB as also

    the same having been quashed by the Member, Board of Revenue

    vide order dated 05.12.2006 has remanded the matter before the

    No.283 of 2011 but the part of the order has been interfered with by

    the Division Bench while disposing of the L.P.A. vide order dated

    12.03.2012 holding therein that since the closure of the writ-

    petitioner's unit on account of Force Majeure has already been

    decided by the Member, Board of Revenue, therefore, the part of

    the order by which the demand has been raised for the period from
                              [12]


    03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005 has been interfered with by remanding

    the matter before the authority, in pursuance thereto, the order has

    been passed on 18.03.2013 which has again been challenged by

    filing writ petition being W.P.(C) No.2408 of 2013 which was

    allowed vide order dated 10.09.2015 by which the impugned order

    dated 18.03.2003 was quashed by the writ court and again the

    matter was remanded to the Deputy Chief Engineer (Commercial)

    to pass a fresh order, in pursuance thereto, a fresh order was passed

    on 27.12.2016. It has been challenged before this Court in W.P.(C)

    No.5664 of 2017 which has been allowed, which is the subject

    matter of the present intra-court appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_58">
</p><p id="p_59">17. This Court, after going through the finding recorded in the

    impugned order, has found therefrom that two folds directions have

    been passed, first pertains to the demand for the period from

    03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005 and second pertains to interest on the

    payment made against the demand.
</p>
<p id="p_60">
</p><p id="p_61">18. So far as the grievance pertaining to demand for the period from

    03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005 is concerned, the admitted position herein

    is that JSPCB by an order passed on 20.12.2004 sealed the writ-

    petitioner's unit WHICH remained under seal for the period from

    03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005. The order of closure was challenged by

    the writ-petitioner before the Member, Board of Revenue. The

    Member, Board of Revenue quashed and set aside the order raising

    the demand. The writ-petitioner being aggrieved with the demand

    for the period from 03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005, the period for which

    the demand has been raised along with the guaranteed charge, the
                             [13]


    contention which has been raised and has been considered by the

    learned Single Judge pertaining to the provision of Clause 4 of the

    agreement which contains a clause for Force Majeure. Admittedly,

    herein the period of closure of the unit is due to an order passed by

    the JSPCB. The order of closure has been set aside by the Member,

    Board of Revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_62">
</p><p id="p_63">               It cannot be disputed that the JSPCB is a statutory body

    incorporated and enacted by virtue of force of law. The condition as

    contained under Clause 4 to the bilateral agreement contains a

    provision of Force Majeure and if the operation of the unit due to

    the Force Majeure will be stopped, no demand can be raised.


</p><p id="p_64">19. This Court has proceeded to examine the fact about the condition of

    closure of the writ-petitioner's unit which can be said to come under

    the fold of Force Majeure entitling the unit to take advantage of

    Clause 4 of the agreement dated 25.03.2005. As has been stated

    hereinabove, JSPCB is a statutory authority, as would appear from

    the condition stipulated under Clause 4 of the bilateral agreement

    that the closure of the factory unit due to order passed by the

    statutory authority/body, will come under the fold of Force

    Majeure. The admitted fact herein is that the JSPCB has passed an

    order OF the closure/sealing of the writ-petitioner's unit which has

    subsequently been quashed and set aside by the Member, Board of

    Revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_65">
</p><p id="p_66">               Now the question is that WHETHER the closure due to

    the order passed by the JSPCB will come under the fold of Force

    Majeure or not ? The same is required to be examined herein.
</p><p id="p_67">                                 [14]


</p><p id="p_68">20. The order passed by the JSPCB pertaining to sealing of the factory

     led the closure of the writ-petitioner's unit from 03.09.2005 to

     27.10.2005, however, finally the order passed by the JSPCB has

     been quashed and set aside by the Member, Board of Revenue. It is

     therefore, evident that the writ-petitioner's unit was closed due to

     the order passed by the JSPCB which is a statutory body and if any

     order has been passed by the statutory authority/body it cannot be

     said that the closure of the unit will go out of the purview of Clause

     4 of the bilateral agreement dated 25.03.2005.


</p><p id="p_69">21. This Court, therefore, is of the view that since the closure is by the

     JSPCB which is a statutory authority/body coming under the fold of

     condition underlying to cover the case under Force Majeure, will be

     attracted herein, and if the factory has been closed due to Force

     Majeure, the appellant/respondent will be prevented from raising

     any Demand Charge and Guaranteed Energy Charge in view of the

     condition stipulated under Clause 4 of the bilateral agreement.


</p><p id="p_70">22. The learned Single Judge after taking into consideration these

     aspects of the matter had rightly quashed and set aside the

     impugned decision taken by the authority raising the Demand

     Charge and Guaranteed Energy Charge for the period from

     03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005, therefore, we consider no reason to

     interfere with the same.
</p>
<p id="p_71">
</p><p id="p_72">23. So far as the direction pertaining to interest for the said period is

     concerned, in pursuance to the provision of regulation 11.10.3 of

     the Jharkhand State Electricity Regulatory Commission (Electricity

     Supply Code) Regulations, 2005 contains a condition for payment
                                 [15]


     of interest on the excess payment made by the writ-petitioner @

     DPS charged by the respondent-DVC.
</p>
<p id="p_73">
</p><p id="p_74">24. The writ-petitioner is making such claim on account of illegal

     closure of writ-petitioner's unit and even though the bill has been

     raised and the same has been paid, therefore, the interest is required

     to be paid by the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_75">
</p><p id="p_76">25. Mr. Srijit Choudhary, learned counsel for the DVC has questioned

     the aforesaid direction inter alia on the ground that however the

     closure of the writ-petitioner's unit is not in dispute but neither the

     closure of the unit has been informed nor the appellant-DVC has

     been impleaded party to the proceeding before the Member, Board

     of Revenue questioning the demand raised for the period from

     03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005.
</p>
<p id="p_77">26. In order to examine the issue raised in this regard, we have travelled

     to the provision of Clause 11.10.3 of the Jharkhand State Electricity

     Regulatory Commission (Electricity Supply Code) Regulations,

     2005 which is pari materia to Clause 10.7.4 of the Jharkhand State

     Electricity Regulatory Commission (Electricity Supply Code)

     Regulations, 2015 which reads hereunder as:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">              "If the consumer has paid any excess amount, it shall be
              refunded to the consumer within 15 days or, if consumer opts,
              be adjusted within two subsequent bills.     The Distribution
              Licensee shall pay to the consumer interest charges at the rate
              equivalent to the delay payment surcharge as per tariff on the
              excess amount outstanding on account of such wrong billing
              from the date of payment till the date of refund or adjustment
              in subsequent bills."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                              [16]


                It is evident from the aforesaid provision that if the

     consumer has paid any excess amount, it shall be refunded to the

     consumer within 15 days or, if consumer opts, be adjusted within

     two subsequent bills. The Distribution Licensee shall pay to the

     consumer interest charges at the rate equivalent to the delay

     payment surcharge as per tariff on the excess amount outstanding

     on account of such wrong billing from the date of payment till the

     date of refund or adjustment in subsequent bills. The admitted case

     herein is that the writ-petitioner's unit was closed by an order

     passed by the JSPCB which was questioned by the writ-petitioner

     before the Member, Board of Revenue but admittedly the appellant-

</blockquote><p id="p_78">     DVC was not impleaded party to the proceeding before the

     Member, Board of Revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_79">
</p><p id="p_80">                Demand has been raised for the period of closure of the

     writ-petitioner's unit i.e., 03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005, however, the

     bill for the aforesaid period has been paid. The payment of interest

     since is covered under Clause 10.7.4 of the Jharkhand State

     Electricity Regulatory Commission (Electricity Supply Code)

     Regulations, 2015 which contains a provision to make payment of

     interest to the consumer if the consumer has paid any excess

     amount, it shall be refunded to the consumer within 15 days along

     with the interest.
</p>
<p id="p_81">
</p><p id="p_82">27. It is admitted position herein that the writ-petitioner/respondent was

     the consumer having contract load of 3000KVA in pursuance to the

     agreement entered on 25.02.2003. It is not in dispute that once a

     consumer enters into an agreement for a contract demand for supply
                              [17]


    of certain quantity of energy, it is expected that the licencee will

    incur revenue but on any reason whatsoever if the supply would be

    interrupted the licencee would be put to loss. Admittedly, herein the

    writ-petitioner's unit was closed from 03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005 due

    to the order passed by the JSPCB on 20.12.2004.


</p><p id="p_83">28. The contract demand means demand in Kilowatt/Kilovolt, mutually

    agreed between the distribution licencee and the consumer or other

    written communication. The agreement for the aforesaid purpose

    also contains a condition about Demand Charge and the Guaranteed

    Energy Charge.
</p>
<p id="p_84">
</p><p id="p_85">               The demand charges are additional fees that utilities

    charge non-residential or commercial customers for maintaining

    constant supply of electricity.
</p>
<p id="p_86">
</p><p id="p_87">               These fees usually amount to a substantial sum of money

    that businesses must pay on monthly electric bills. Guaranteed

    energy charge payable by the consumer shall be reduced in

    proportion to ability of the consumer to consume or the corporation

    to supply such power.
</p>
<p id="p_88">
</p><p id="p_89">               Provided that the failure of the consumer to use any

    additional power during the period of allotment shall not be a

    ground for aforesaid proportionate calculation of demand charge,

    meaning thereby, in pursuance to the contract, the licensee is

    expected to incur revenue from the supply of the energy which is by

    way of demand charge and the guaranteed energy charge.
</p><p id="p_90">                               [18]


</p><p id="p_91">29. Admittedly herein energy has been supplied during the period from

    03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005, however, the same has not been

    consumed due to the closure of the unit on account of Force

    Majeure as has been decided hereinabove, therefore, making any

    demand for the period of closure of the unit with respect to the

    power supply, the same will be said to be unjustified in view of the

    specific provision as contained under condition No.4 to the

    agreement dated 25.02.2003 but so far as the interest is concerned,

    admittedly, due to the closure of the writ-petitioner's unit, the

    appellant/respondent has incurred loss in revenue due to the

    contract demand as because the said supply could not have been

    converted and diverted towards other consumer in view of the

    subsistence of the bilateral agreement. Now in such a situation can

    the writ-petitioner will be held to be entitled to get the interest ?


</p><p id="p_92">30. We, on examination of the factual aspect, are of the view that the

    writ-petitioner's unit since has not consumed the electricity,

    therefore, he has been held not liable to make payment of the bill

    pertaining to the period for which the unit was closed. Admittedly

    due to the closure, the electricity has not been consumed for the said

    period and hence, DVC-respondent has sustained revenue loss for

    no fault of his own.
</p>
<p id="p_93">
</p><p id="p_94">               However, the provision is there to make payment of the

    excess amount along with interest but in the facts and circumstances

    revolving round herein, the question of applicability of the aforesaid

    regulation which provides provision to make payment of interest

    will be applicable or not as because if a direction with respect to the
                              [19]


    payment of interest is passed, the same will lead to excess burden

    upon the State Exchequer and therefore, it is the position of law that

    while directing for making payment of interest, the Court is to be

    conscious on the basis of the fact that if any laches lies on the part

    of the authorities, the payment of interest can be directed to be paid.


</p><p id="p_95">31. This Court has examined the aforesaid grievance along with the

    finding recorded by the learned Single Judge pertaining to the

    direction for payment of interest and is of the view that admittedly

    the licensee, DVC, has not incurred any revenue due to non-

    consumption of electricity, however, the payment has been raised

    which has also been paid by the writ-petitioner but herein it is the

    admitted position that closure of the unit was not due to any laches

    or fault committed on the part of the DVC and if there is no laches

    on the part of the licensee and if there would be a direction for

    making payment of interest, it will be nothing but putting the

    licensee in loss in two fronts, first, loss in not incurring the revenue

    and second by making payment of interest.
</p>
<p id="p_96">
</p><p id="p_97">32. In view of the facts and circumstances and considering the reason

    mentioned hereinabove, this Court is of the view that the learned

    Single Judge ought to have taken into consideration these aspects of

    the matter before passing such direction.
</p>
<p id="p_98">
</p><p id="p_99">33. In view of the aforesaid reason, we are not in agreement with the

    finding/direction of the learned Single Judge pertaining to payment

    of interest, therefore, the same is held to be not sustainable in the

    eye of law, accordingly, quashed and set aside.
</p><p id="p_100">                                  [20]


</p><p id="p_101">   34. In the result, the appeal is allowed in part.


</p><p id="p_102">   35. In consequence thereof, the relief pertaining to demand for the

         period from 03.09.2005 to 27.10.2005 is allowed and pertaining to

         issuance of direction for payment of interest, stands dismissed.
