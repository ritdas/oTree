         Reportable                             The 17th, December, 2012

Prakash Tatia, CJ.    The petitioner has preferred this writ petition, seeking the

         following reliefs:-

                      "(1) For a declaration that (a) NOC granted by the Pollution

                      (c) Discharge consent orders issued under Reference No.1295
                                      -2-

Hazardous Wastes (Handling &amp; Management) Rules and Building Bye

Laws under Ranchi Regional Development Authority Act and emitting

fumes causing carcinogenic effect on human body."

2.           The factual background of this litigation is relevant.

             A letter dated 28.3.2007 complaining about construction of

one Maruti Car Showroom and Workshop dated 28.3.2007 addressed to

the then Hon'ble Chief Justice of Jharkhand was received by the High

Court and on 30.3.2007, it was ordered to be placed before the Bench

hearing PIL and therefore, it was registered as Public Interest Litigation

being W.P (PIL) No.1785/2007. On 3.5.2007 the Division Bench headed

by the then Hon'ble Chief Justice observed that the letter shows that some

personal interest is also involved and therefore, directed this petition to be

treated as regular writ petition (private person writ petition) and directed

to post before the Single Judge having the roster of the writ petition.

Faced with this situation, the author of the letter, the petitioner, moved an

interlocutory application for amendment in the writ petition obviously, for

the reason that the writ petition was registered on the basis of the letter to
                                     -3-


the then Hon'ble Chief Justice and detailed pleadings were not in the

letter. After hearing the parties, by the order dated 16.1.2009, learned

Single Judge allowed the application for amendment. In view of the above

liberty to file amended petition, the petitioner filed amended writ petition

and then respondents filed counter affidavit. Thereafter this petition was

tagged with another PIL being W.P (PIL) No.1076/2011. In W.P(PIL)

No.1076/2011, an order was passed that one I.A No.831/2011 filed in

W.P(PIL) No.1076/2011 would be heard along with the present writ

petition, being W.P (C) No.1785/2007 and it was also ordered that the writ

petition which was registered on the basis of the letter and was converted

into private interest litigation as W.P (C) No.1785/2007 would also be

heard along with W.P (PIL) No.1076/2011. However, W.P (PIL)

No.1076/2011 has been decided by a separate order dated 24th August,

2011 and therefore, the present writ petition, being W.P (PIL)

No.1785/2007 converted as W.P (C) No.1785/2007 and I.A No.831/2011

remain pending for decision of this Court. One another application I.A

No.870/2011 was also pending which was also heard along with this writ

petition.

3.          Coming to the facts of the case, it will be appropriate to

mention here that the petitioner, Dr.S.S.Narnoly, sent a letter to the High

Court in the name of the then Hon'ble Chief Justice on 28.3.2007 alleging

that he is a resident of purely residential area in the capital city, Ranchi,

of Jharkhand State at Kanke Road and the said area also houses the

residence of seniormost functionaries of the State and some of the   highest
                                    -4-


dignitaries of the State are residing in the same area. It is stated therein

that surprisingly in this residential area, a commercial complex in the

name of Premsons Motor Maruti Udyog Pvt. Ltd. of respondent no.6, has

come up. The petitioner stated in the letter that in the said commercial

complex, being a Maruti showroom cum service and repair centre, the

work of denting, painting and other associated works are being carried out

and during denting, lot of sound is produced which is disturbing his

children in their studies. The petitioner stated that he is a Surgeon and

starts working early in the morning in Nagarmal Modi Seva Sadan and

comes to residence at 3.00 pm for lunch for short rest and the sound

emitting from the workshop is disturbing his rest and thus, the petitioner

submitted that he is unable to perform his surgery properly. He also

alleged that apart from sound pollution, painting of cars emits fumes of

paint containing organic carbon, which spreads all around in the area

including the house of the petitioner. The petitioner claimed that he being

a Doctor knows that these fumes of paint are carcinogenic and may

produce (i) Bronchitis, (ii) Bronchopneumonia, (iii) Bronchial asthma, (iv)

Lung Cancer and (Voldemort) Cancer of Bladder. He submitted that in the

interest of the health of the communities, an industry producing sound, air

and water pollution must be barred from doing so in a residential area. The

petitioner also submitted that he had written letter to the State Pollution

Control Board and Ranchi Municipal Corporation but all in vain and

therefore, proper action may be taken to safeguard the health of the

community.
                                     -5-


4.          After conversion of the writ petition from PIL to the

petitioner's private interest litigation, the petitioner submitted detailed

facts and pointed out that for planned development of the city area of

Ranchi before bifurcation of State of Bihar,      there was Bihar Town

Planning and Improvement Trust Act, 1951, which was enacted in 1951,

by virtue of which Ranchi Improvement Trust was constituted. Under

section 33 of the Bihar Town Planning and Improvement Trust Act, 1951

<a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_14">(Bihar Act</a> XXXV of 1951) as amended by the Bihar Town Planning and

Improvement Trust (Amendment) Act, 1952 <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_15">(Bihar Act</a> XIV of 1952)

and the Bihar Town Planning and Improvement Trust (Amendment) Act,

1955 <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_16">(Bihar Act</a> VI of 1956) enjoined upon the Ranchi Improvement

Trust to prepare a master plan for Ranchi. In the petition the petitioner

gave the details of the objectives of the Ranchi Improvement Trust and

stated that, its duty was to prepare master plan and while preparing

master plan, to take care of its objectives for which these laws were

enacted, which are substantially and necessarily for the purpose of

planned development of the city area by segregating the industrial area

from residential area with provision for integrated road system as well as

integrated drainage and sewerage system and integrated water supply

system and provision for open space for built up areas and for

development for residential areas on neighbourhood principle, reservation

of suitable areas for various community needs, utilization of natural

amenities, stoppage of ribbon development and recovery of robbonated

road side lands after taking into account any other proposal bearing on the
                                      -6-


health, convenience and comfort of the people of the locality. Ranchi

Master Plan was prepared by the Ranchi Improvement Trust in the year

1965 with expertise provided by the State Town and Country Planning

Organization covering an area of 50 sq. miles which was approved by the

State Government in the year 1972, vide notification No.6972/L.S.G.

Patna dated 28.7.1972.

5.             It is submitted by the petitioner that the State Improvement

Trust could not deal with the problems posed by the rapid development of

cities in the then State of Bihar and therefore, an Ordinance, "The Bihar

Regional Development Authority" was promulgated in the year 1975 by

the Governor in exercise of the power conferred by clause (1) of <a href="/doc/860592/" id="a_17">Article

213</a> of the Constitution of India to regulate the growth pattern of the cities

and Ranchi Regional Development Authority was created in September

1975 by notification no.6012 U.D.D. Patna dated 23.9.1975 just after

three months of creation of Patna Regional Development Authority.

Ranchi Regional Development Authority (hereinafter called as R.R.D.A)

was made autonomous, raising it's fund, urban planning agency for

greater Ranchi replacing the Ranchi Improvement Trust. Ranchi Regional

Development Authority covers an area of 6,12,340 hectares, out of which

15,914 hectares are covered by urban centres       and 59,04,326 hectares

rural areas.

6.             According to the petitioner, respondent no.6, Premsons Motor

Udyog Pvt. Ltd., has constructed and set up an automobile service station

on plot no.502, 845, khata no.157/101, 157/102, mouza - Kathar Gonda,
                                      -7-


P.O. Kanke Road, P.S. Gonda in the district of Ranchi for servicing,

repairing, denting and painting of cars in the workshop. According to the

petitioner, it is, in fact, an industrial set up by the respondent no.6, which

was seriously objected by all the residents of the locality by way of filing

representation before the Deputy Commissioner, Ranchi, as well as to

other authorities even before construction of the workshop. The

petitioner's contention is that firstly, the said workshop, which is, in fact,

in the nature of an industry, could not have been permitted to be set up in

the exclusively residential area but it was permitted to be set up in the

residential area in violation to the restrictions imposed by the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and in violation of the

provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_19">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974

and of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_20">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and also

of the provisions of the Hazardous Waste (Management and Handling)

Rules, 1989 as well as had been permitted to be constructed in violation of

the Building Bye-laws framed by the R.R.D.A, which was known as the

Ranchi Planning Standards and Building Bye-Laws, 2002.

7.           It is submitted that as per Appendix - "M" of the R.R.D.A

Bye-laws of 2002, use of land have been divided into six zones - (1) Zone

A - Residential, (2) Zone B - Commercial (Retail), (3) Zone C -

Commercial, (4) Zone D - Industrial, (5) Zone E - Public and Semi-

Public Uses and (6) Zone F - Agricultural. It has been submitted that it is

true that under special appeal (in fact, special permission), R.R.D.A can

allow some other land uses but the respondent's unit is a factory and it
                                      -8-


obtained license under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_21">Factories Act</a> and therefore, in the residential

area, neither any factory or industry or factory having industrial activities,

can be allowed even as per permissible use given in Appendix - M of the

Bye-laws of 2002.

8.           It has also been alleged that the respondent no.6 got plan

sanctioned through misrepresentation of facts and when the Town Planner

of R.R.D.A objected to the sanction of the plan on the ground that the

proposed site was in a residential area, the respondent no.6 represented

before the Vice Chairman that they would be constructing a commercial

building as permissible in Appendix - M but they suppressed the fact that

they were going to construct a workshop, for which           initially factory

license was also obtained by the respondent no.6 in a different name, i.e.

M/s. Senwit Merchants Private Limited. The petitioner placed on record

the copy of the factory license as well as portion of the notesheet of the

R.R.D.A on record. In that situation, the petitioner wrote a letter to the

Deputy Commissioner, Ranchi on 8.1.2007 informing him that the paint

fumes emitting from the unit of respondent no.6 is hazardous to human

health and causes several bronchial ailments, but no action was taken even

after the petitioner represented before the respondent no.3, Member

Secretary, Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. However, thereafter

the Deputy Commissioner, in response to the petitioner's complaint,

ordered a Magisterial Enquiry against the respondent no.6 and the

Magistrate conducted a surprise raid and thereafter, the unit was ordered

to be sealed on 30.3.2007. However, the Deputy Commissioner directed to
                                    -9-


open the seal after instructing the respondent no.6 to have its premises

inspected by the Pollution Department within two weeks. Thereafter, the

Pollution Control Board conducted an enquiry and during enquiry, though

the petitioner did not object, so far as the construction of the showroom

was concerned, as, according to the petitioner, construction of showroom

would not cause pollution and hazards. The pollution and hazards would

be caused by the rest of the activities, like denting, painting, repairing

work etc. The petitioner further submitted that at that time, respondent

no.6 did not inform the petitioner that the respondent would establish such

industrial unit besides the showroom. Nor the petitioner was informed

about the pollution which the said unit was likely to cause. The Pollution

Control Board gave the enquiry report dated 5.11.2004, a copy of which

has been placed on record by the petitioner. The respondent no.6 was

further directed by the respondent no.3, vide letter dated 5.11.2004, to

obtain consent for establishment of the unit (NOC) under the Pollution

Laws and in response to that, the respondent no.6 applied for NOC, upon

which NOC was issued on 9.2.2005 under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_22">section 25</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_23">26</a> of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_24">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_25">section 21</a> of

the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_26">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, which, according

to the petitioner, was given to the respondent no.6 without application of

mind. However, this permission was also granted for automobile service

station having a capacity of servicing 15-20 cars per day. In the petition,

the petitioner also stated that the respondent no.6's unit cannot apply for

permission   under the Act of 1974, 1981 and Rules of 1989 after
                                     -10-


completion of the construction and it was granted all permissions but all

those permissions were also granted without application of mind and in a

mechanical manner. To substantiate his plea, the petitioner submitted that

from perusal of documents at Annexure - 9 series, it would be clear that

the respondents admit that the unit of M/s. Premsons Motor Udyog Pvt.

Ltd. is an industrial unit and from the above permission itself, it is clear

that the respondent no.6, was knowing it well that its industrial activities

would cause all sorts of pollution, like air, water and noise pollutions and

would emit hazardous effluents, applied and obtained the above orders

from the authorities. Therefore, the respondent no.6 or other respondents

cannot say that the respondent unit will not cause pollution or will not be a

hazardous unit. The petitioner drew our attention to the various reports,

which, according to the petitioner, prepared in distorted manner, yet are in

favour of the petitioner. The petitioner submitted that those reports clearly

indicate that the reports had been prepared just to favour the respondent

no.6 by making calculation in such a manner that true         facts may be

suppressed from the Court. For example in the report of Ambient Air

Quality, figures are shown by calculating suspended particulate for 8

hours time calculation whereas as per the National Standards, the basis is

of 24 hour's pollution. Same thing was done in the report of Noise Level

Measurement, for which standard       prescribed by the Central Pollution

Control Board is that at no time the noise level should be more than

55dB(A) Leq whereas the respondent no.6 causes noise level more than

above the maximum limit.
                                    -11-


9.          The petitioner also submitted that in the city of Ranchi, due to

gross neglect on the part of the officials of R.R.D.A, there has been

mushroom growth of industrial, commercial, commercial (Retail), and

manufacturing units in the residential areas causing serious violation of

the Building Bye-laws, 2002, as a result of which life and liberty of the

citizens/residents of Ranchi is at stake. It has also been stated that

according to the notification dated 9.2.2005 issued by the Jharkhand State

Pollution Control Board, automobile servicing station can be at a distance

of 25 meters from road in a populated area of not more than 200 persons

or if it is on a State Highway and this condition has also been ignored by

the     authorities      and       admittedly       respondent       no.6's

industry/factory/workshop is situated in the densely populated area of

more than 200 persons and the showroom is situated within the limit of 25

meter from the road.

10.         The petitioner then submitted that by passage of time and

growth of Ranchi, workshops of different car manufacturers gradually

shifted to the industrial area and the petitioner gave example of

showrooms of Sushila Motors, Hyundai Motors, Ford Motors, Chevrolet

and Ambassador, which have already been shifted obviously by those

concerned persons running those showrooms, whereas the respondent no.6

is running a unit wherein 100 workmen have been engaged, who are

carrying out different jobs of repair, maintenance and servicing works,

which includes denting, painting, mechanical engine repair and other

ancillary works in violation of all laws enacted for preventing pollution
                                     -12-


and emission of hazardous wastes. The petitioner submitted that he has

contacted the disease of bronchial asthma due to discharge of paint fumes

arising out of painting booth of the unit of respondent no.6 and because of

running of respondent no.6 workshop, service station and motor garage, it

is causing public nuisance and oil, lubricant and dust etc. collected during

cleaning and servicing of the vehicles are spilled into open municipal

drains meant for discharge of household residential wastes          and the

polluted water gets collected in the drain and percolates into the ground

water and during rainy season, it even flows into Dams like Kanke Dam

which is used for supply of drinking water.

11.         In view of the above facts, the petitioner prayed for a

declaration that NOC granted by the Pollution Control Board by memo

no.N-84 dated 9.2.2005 under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_27">section 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_28">26</a> of the Water (Prevention

Control of Pollution) Act and their subsequent renewals by declaring it

illegal and the concerned order issued by the Jharkhand State Pollution

Control Board by reference no.1294 dated 17.6.05 under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_29">section 21</a> of the

Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_30">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and its subsequent renewals

by declaring it illegal and same declaration be given for the consent order

given under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_31">section 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_32">26</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_33">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and its subsequent renewals. The petitioner also

prayed for a declaration that NOCs, consent orders and the license under

the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_34">Factories Act</a> to respondent no.6 in the residential area is arbitrary,

illegal and unconstitutional and prayed for a direction to the authorities to

declare that the respondent no.6's unit is running in contravention of the
                                       -13-


above referred Acts, Rules and Building Bye-laws.

12.         The petitioner has raised the following questions of law:-

                   Whether the R.R.D.A has any authority or

            jurisdiction to approve building plan under Building

            Bye-laws,    2002    in    respect   of   an   industrial

            establishment/undertaking or a workshop in the

            residential area; whether in the grab of building plan,

            R.R.D.A can approve running of an industry without

            any impediment in a residential area causing great

            inconvenience to the residents; whether public at

            large be allowed to suffer on account of inaction on

            the part of the local authorities, like R.R.D.A,

            Pollution Control Board by allowing to run industrial

            workshop in residential areas causing public nuisance

            and health hazards; and whether R.R.D.A has strictly

            followed Appendix M of Bye-laws of 2002?

13.         The petitioner further raised the question - whether the

respondent no.6 can be allowed to discharge industrial effluents such as

oil, lubricants, chemicals etc. in the open drain causing nuisance in the

entire locality and also polluting underground water endangering the life

and liberty of the citizens and whether release of chemical such as paints,

dusts in the air by the industrial establishment in a residential area can be

allowed to continue without any check or regulation?

14.         Considering all the allegations leveled by the petitioner, the

respondent no.6 submitted that Punit Kumar Poddar and Pankaj Kumar
                                     -14-


Poddar are the successors and owners of plot no.502 measuring 3826

sq.mt. (approx.) on Kanke Road and the adjacent plot is owned by the

petitioner, who runs a medical clinic, godown of medicine equipments,

Rosna and other consumer products and the petitioner gets waste cotton

burnt in his premises, which creates bio-medical waste of category - 4 and

during enquiry carried out by the Assistant Environment Officer on the

basis of anonymous letter, the petitioner and others informed that they had

no objection to the construction of showroom and workshop and the

Officer-in-charge of the area reported that even the people who having

their business near the property in dispute have no objection and the

dispute seems to be of business rivalry and by those people who made

efforts but failed to get the showroom and workshop of Maruti udyog. It

is also submitted that the petitioner himself gave his no objection to the

construction in question. It is submitted that the filing of the writ petition

has been result of personal rivalry of the writ petitioner as there was

boundary dispute with the petitioner and on 24.2.2006 settlement was

arrived at   for this boundary dispute between the petitioner and Punit

Kumar Poddar and Pankaj Kumar Poddar, but on 2.3.2006, the petitioner

sent a letter to the Maruti Udyog referring to the anonymous letters sent

earlier by unknown persons regarding air and noise pollution in residential

area. Not only this, even the respondent no.6 lodged police complaint

against the petitioner and his son regarding harassment and various

complaints. In addition to above, complaint dated 12..1.2007 was filed by

the petitioner for unauthorized construction on the spot and thereafter, on
                                       -15-


28.3.2007</pre><p id="p_1">, the petitioner wrote a letter to the then Hon'ble Chief Justice of

the High Court. Though earlier the letter was treated as Public Interest

Litigation but subsequently this Court found it to be personal interest

litigation, which is clear from the order dated 3.5.2007 passed in this

petition. It is submitted that after considering the complaint of the writ

petitioner, respondent no.6 revised the Building Plan No.1302/7, which

was duly sanctioned by the R.R.D.A and unauthorized construction case

being UC No.133/07 was closed by the R.R.D.A in favour of the

respondent no.6 against which no appeal was preferred by the petitioner

under section 54 of the R.R.D.A Act, 2001 and as such, the said order

became final.
</p>
<p id="p_2">15.         It has been submitted on behalf of the respondent no.6 that

the respondent no.6 duly applied for grant of permission under the Bye-

laws of 2002 and all facts were carefully considered by the competent

authority including the objections raised by the Officers of the R.R..D.A

about the       permission for commercial unit of the building of the

respondent no.6 and thereafter, after obtaining relevant inspection reports,

the construction    permission was granted with conditions of obtaining

relevant permission from the other Departments and no objections, which

were was duly granted by the various Department and this fact has been

admitted by the writ petitioner himself. The respondent no.6 has not been

granted permission for construction and service station in the premises in

violation of any of the conditions of the Bye-laws of 2002, which has been

decided by various      inspections    again   and again. Counsel for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     -16-</span>


respondent no.6 drew our attention to the various inspection reports which

are dated 5.11.2004, 24.1.2007, 13.4.2007, 7.7.2009,               8.10.2009,

14.12.2009, 19.6.2010, 27.7.2010, 5.8.2010,       26.2.2011, 12.3.2011 and

14.3.2011, and towards letters dated 14.2.2007 and 27.1.2010 as well as

last inspection conducted in the premises of the respondent no.6 pursuant

to the letter dated 26.3.2011, which has been issued pursuant to the order

passed by this Court in public interest litigation and submitted that all

these reports clearly indicated that the respondent no.6 had not violated

building bye-laws, nor was engaged in any prohibited activity, in the

residential area and it was granted all permissions by all the competent

authorities after careful consideration of all facts which are clearly

indicated in the reports and R.R.D.A has granted permission to the

respondent no.6 to construct service station, which is permissible under

the Schedule M of the Bye-laws of 2002 but because of the personal

grudge of the writ petitioner against the respondent no.6 and for ulterior

and oblique motive, the petitioner tried to obtain the relief by projecting it

to be public interest litigation, whereas the Court itself found that there is

involvement of personal interest of the writ petitioner and there is no

element of public interest. It is submitted that looking to the conduct of

the writ petitioner and vested interest as well as because of the

suppression   of the materials facts and attaining finality of the order

passed on the complaint of the petitioner, the writ petition of the writ

petitioner deserves to be dismissed. It is also submitted that writ petitioner

as well as interveners who moved I.A No.831 and 870 of 2011 had filed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      -17-</span>


several complaints in the last six years which have already been

investigated fully and after due inspection, nothing was found wrong in

the activities of the respondent no.6.
</p>
<p id="p_3">16.          So far details about           permission for construction and

establishment of the respondent no.6;s unit is concerned, it is submitted

that the respondent submitted application on 11th August, 2001 and

thereafter submitted special appeal on 11th October, 2004 with R.R.D.A

for sanction of the plan for carrying out construction for showroom cum

workshop for motor cars, which is a commercial activity but permissible

in residential area. On this application, detailed survey, investigation and

inspection were carried out which were duly considered in the file noting

dated 11.3.2004 to 18.4.2004 and thereafter sanction order was issued on

19th October, 2004. According to respondent no.6, a conjoint reading of

clauses 2.46(6), 18.4, 20.2 with Appendix M of the Building Bye-laws of

2002 clearly establish that building having            Mercantile/Commercial

activities is permissible construction in residential land use zones. The

showroom cum service station with workshop for Maruti cars is a

showroom cum retail shop and a service station, which is incidental to

such showroom and service centre. It is submitted that the unit of the

respondent     no.6     clearly    falls      within   the    definition   of

Mercantile/Commercial building. It is also submitted that for showroom,

there is no contravention of any provision and sanctions          granted for

building in question are in accordance with the valid laws in force and

thus, respondent no.6 cannot be prevented from utilizing his own property
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     -18-</span>


as lawful owner of the property and for lawful purpose. It is further

submitted that the primary business of Premson Motors is commercial in

nature, i.e. selling of cars/vehicles manufactured by Maruti and it uses the

showroom for storing, marketing, display and sale of cars and vehicles

and for providing after-sale service for the cars and vehicles sold by it

which is incidental to its mercantile activity and looking to the nature of

the works, which is "service" respondent no.6 is levied with service tax

under the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_35">Finance Act</a>, 1994 and therefore, it does not fall in the category

of industry, as it does not manufacture and is not producing anything. It is

submitted that as per <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_36">section 65(9)</a> of the Finance Act, 1994, authorized

service station means any service station or centre authorized by any

motor vehicle manufacturer to carry out service, repair, reconditioning or

restoration of any motor car or two wheeled motor vehicle manufactured

by the manufacturer; therefore, under the definition of authorized service

station, repairing of vehicle is permissible work. So far as obtaining

license under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_37">Factories Act</a>, 1948 is concerned, that cannot change the

nature of the work because of the application of the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_38">Factories Act</a>, which is meant for limited purposes to give benefit to the

labourers/workmen and cannot be used for any other purpose, particularly

for interpreting <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_39">Excise Act</a> or Building Bye-laws. Since the respondent

no.6 is running sale cum repair centre for Maruti cars and is not bringing

out any new commercial commodity into existence and as such, is not

manufacturing any product, it is not an industry.
</p>
<p id="p_4">17.         It is submitted by learned counsel for the respondent no.6 that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    -19-</span>


Kanke Road is a State Highway and has heavy traffic which is an indicator

of urban growth and on this very Kanke Road, there are 32 automobile

units which are running without any complaint and there are more than

500 automobile workshops, mostly in residential area. A report on Kanke

Road clearly indicates that this road is full of commercial activities and

pollution and pollution is not because of respondent no.6's unit. The

respondent also placed on record          copies of the notification dated

23.7.2004 declaring Kanke Road as State Highway and a map of Kanke

Road and Expert Report dated 14.12.2009 of High Powered Committee of

CPCB and JSPCB for Kanke Road and list of other automobile workshops

on Kanke Road filed by the Secretary Urban Development Department

dated 16.9.2009 and various other documents.          The respondent also

questioned the jurisdiction of the Secretary Urban Development

Department who made noting dated 16.9.2009, which, according to the

respondent, has been written without any authority of law and in gross

violation of the principles of natural justice, whereby directions were

bgiven for closure of the respondent's unit, which was never acted upon. It

is submitted that the issue of commercial activities in the residential area

has already been determined by the authorities according to rules and have

been considered on several times and now there is no reason to permit the

petitioner and other persons to re-agitate the issue in the present writ

petition or PIL.
</p>
<p id="p_5">18.          Learned counsel for the respondent no.6 submitted that the

petitioner misrepresented the facts before this Court and therefore, stated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     -20-</span>


that,   because of the activities in the premises of respondent no.6,

pollution is created and drew our attention to the documents placed on

record indicating that the processes in the service stations have radically

changed and now with the cost of manual labour going high, use of

modern technology of denting is undertaken using "Miracle Repair

System", which uses pneumatic force          and there is a high level of

replacement of part of vehicles because of comprehensive insurance and

therefore, now in workshop/service station, even in cases of replacing of

parts of vehicles, no noise pollution is there. Not only this, for painting of

vehicles, modern "Painting Bake Booths" fitted with three layers of filters

prevents any possibility of air pollution of any significance. However, the

maximum number of employees working under the respondent no.6 is less

than 40. Therefore, in sum and substance, according to the respondent

no.6, the complaint of the writ petitioner and other persons is motivated

with different aims and objects as well as mala fide based on wrong facts

as well as now      the issue,   which has already been decided by the

competent authorities several times after due inspections of the premises

of the respondent and permission granted to the respondent no.6 for

construction and running of the building and unit, cannot be challenged in

the writ petition without preferring appeal and therefore, the writ petition

of the petitioner be dismissed on above grounds with heavy cost.

</p><p id="p_6">19.          I.A No.831/2011 has been filed by the interveners, Dev

Narayan Prasad Jaiswal and Narendra Nath Mangla, stating therein that

this Court took cognizance of news report whereby it was brought to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                    -21-</span>


notice of the High Court that the authorities of R.R.D.A and Ranchi

Municipal Corporation, in complete disregard of their bye-laws and

master plans, have sanctioned plans in residential area and Kanke Road is

also a purely residential area under the master plan. These interveners also

submitted that in utter disregard to the bye-laws, respondent no.6 has

constructed and established an automobile showroom and workshop by

constructing a mercantile building in purely residential area of purely

industrial character and is running all activities which are purely of

industrial nature and it emits several times more industrial wastes which

are hazardous to the residents and repeated the same allegations which we

have referred above and which have been leveled by the writ petitioner

against the respondent no.6. Detailed facts of this I.A        will not be

necessary as substantially we have taken note of all the facts. Interveners

also placed on record photocopies of certain noting of the file of R.R.D.A

to show that material facts have been suppressed by the respondent no.6

for obtaining construction permission and respondent no.6 merely

submitted application that he may be permitted to construct a commercial

building in residential area for which several queries were raised. The

authorities directed the respondent no.6 to file fresh copy of drawing and

design which the respondent no.6 did not submit and did not show the

arrangement of mechanical ventilation and lighting in the basement,

which was found not sufficient. Interveners already placed on record the

copies of certain other documents which we have already referred. This

application was replied by the respondent no.6.

construction permission was granted in accordance with law. Number of

supplementary affidavits and counter affidavits were also submitted by the

parties, which we have considered.

important facts including the subsequent developments referred, one of

in the residential area. Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon the

judgments rendered in the cases of     K.Ramadas     Shenoy   Vs.    Chief

Officer, Town Municipal Council (1974) 2 SCC 506, Indian Council For

Enviro-Legal Action Vs. Union of India (1996) 3 SCC 212, Indian Banks'

<p id="p_14">26.         Learned counsel for respondent no.6, M/s. Premson Motors,

in support of his argument and to draw our attention towards the

distinction among the "residence", "commercial", "industrial", "service

station" etc. relied upon the judgments rendered in the cases of

      MSCO (P) Ltd. Vs. Union of India (1985) 1 SCC 51, G.L.Hotels Ltd.

Vs. T.C Sarin, (1993) 4 SSC 363,       State   of     Maharashtra      Vs.

SCC 30.
</p>
<p id="p_15">             With the help of the above judgments, leaned counsel for the

contesting respondent tried to advance his argument that the respondent

has obtained requisite permission from all Departments for establishing its

unit at the place and in view of the above judgments, nothing illegal has

been committed by the respondent in establishing its showroom and

service station.
</p>
<p id="p_16">27.          Learned counsel for the respondent no.6, M/s. Premson

Motor Udyog Ltd., also relied upon the judgment rendered in the cases of

Chhetriya Pardushan Mukti Sangharsh Samiti Vs. State of U.P, AIR 1990

SC 1460 and Greater Kailash Part II Welfare Association &amp; Ors. Vs. DLF

Universal Ltd. &amp; Ors., (2007) 6 SCC 448.
</p>
<p id="p_17">28.          We considered the submissions of learned counsel for the

parties and perused the records including construction permission record

produced by the R.R.D.A and judgments relied upon by the learned

counsel for the parties. We may recapitulate the facts in brief.

</p><p id="p_18">             There are some preliminary objections raised by the learned

counsel for the respondent no.6, Mr. A.Gupta, Senior Counsel, that it is a

personal interest litigation and the petitioner tried to project it as public

interest matter, therefore, originally it was registered as public interest

litigation but finding involvement of personal interest of the petitioner,

this petition, by the order of the Court, has been converted into personal

interest litigation. The petitioner's conduct has been challenged and it has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                       -26-</span>


been stated that petitioner, is a neighbour of the respondent and had

enmity with respondent no.6 and even some criminal cases were filed and

because of rivalry and for oblique motive, this petition has been filed. The

petitioner also gave in writing that the petitioner has no objection if

construction permission is granted to the respondent no.6. It is also

submitted that this Court dismissed such type of petition, being W.P

(PIL) No.5388/2009, holding that such dispute can be raised in Civil

Courts. Therefore, this petition may also be dismissed. Further,          the

petitioner has challenged the order of grant of permission of construction

given by the Ranchi Regional Development Authority and this order has

become final, which was an appealable order and petitioner did not prefer

any appeal against the said order, which now          cannot be    challenged

straightway in writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_19">             It is true that there is dispute between the petitioner and the

respondent no.6 and they are neighbours and there is a construction

permission    obtained   by     the   respondent    no.6   and   Unauthorized

Construction Case being U.C Case No.133/2007 has been closed by the

R.R.D.A and against that, no appeal was preferred by the petitioner under

section 54 of the Ranchi Regional Development Authority Act, 2001. But

we are of the considered opinion that in the present petition, parties have

pleaded their case in detail and placed on , letter of the petitioner was

treated to be a public interest case. Then it was converted into private writ

petition and thereafter both the parties submitted their replies, counters,

rejoinders, supplementary       affidavits and     voluminous    documentary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                      -27-</span>


evidence and several inspection reports also have been placed on record.

After going through the detail facts of the case and issues involved in this

petition, we are of the view that initially in the opinion of this Court it was

of public interest but since petitioner's interest was also involved, this

petition has been converted into a private petition. Normally, when

person's personal interest is involved in any petition, that petition is not

entertained in such a form. But when there is composite cause/causes, then

in that situation, dismissal of such petition after such delay and after

production of all materials before the Court requiring no oral evidence

and when issues can be decided on the basis of admitted or proved facts,

will be only multiplying the litigation and will cause avoidable delay.

However, such discretion is required to be exercised sparingly. Therefore,

at this belated stage it will be absolutely inappropriate to send the parties

back to the Civil Court, particularly in view of the fact that issues raised in

this petition are issues, substantially, of law and so far as facts are

concerned, they are not in dispute except question of interpretation of

reports which also constitute only legal issues. Further in addition to

above, this Court is of the view that now though, it is a private party

instituted writ petition, it also involves questions of law of          public

importance with respect to the power of the Local Body, i.e. Ranchi

Regional Development Authority, in the matter of grant of permission in

residential area having the activity which is not only of retail shopping but

is a big, large selling cars and other vehicles of Maruti brand wich has no

direct connection with      the   facilities and service requirement by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                         -28-</span>


residents of residential area and wherein about 100 employees are allowed

to work for commercial purpose. Therefore, we are not inclined to dismiss

the writ petition on the ground of personal interest of the petitioner in the

matter or because of private dispute between the petitioner and respondent

no.6 prior to filing of this petition or because of non-challenging of the

order of the Ranchi Regional Development Authority in appeal. Even if

alternative remedy may in some cases be sufficient ground for dismissal

of the writ petition but this is not such case. Hence, the preliminary

objections raised by the respondent no.6 are rejected.

having an area of 3826 sq.m. It is situated in capital city, Ranchi, of

</p><p id="p_60">32.         Firstly we may go through the best of the case of the

respondent no.6, M/s. Premson Motors Udyog Pvt. Ltd., and presume that

the orders were legally          passed by all authorities, i.e RRDA, Pollution

Control Board, under <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_42">Factories Act</a> etc. the certificates and permission

granted by various authorities under different Acts and <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_43">Factories Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_61">            In our opinion, R.R.D.A, petitioner and respondent no.6

including Pollution Control Board misunderstood the controversy and

therefore, went astray. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_44">The Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, Rules

framed thereunder the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, the Air

the laws framed for different purposes. By these laws as well as by several

other laws, it has been provided that no one, may it be an industry or

factory, may he be a person, should be allowed to create environmental

pollution in excess of the standards prescribed under the above

enactments. <a href="/doc/75233928/" id="a_49">Section 7</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, applies

not only to industries or factories but it also applies to persons. <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_50">Section 7</a>

says that "no person" carrying on any industry, operation or process shall

pollutant in excess of such standards as may be prescribed. The Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_51">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, empowers the State

Government, in consultation with the State Pollution Control Board, to

notify any area within the State as for air pollution control area for the

purpose of the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_52">State Act</a>, 1981 and <a href="/doc/95877183/" id="a_53">section 20</a> permits for prescribing the

standard of emission from automobiles as laid down by the State Board

and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_54">section 21</a> puts restriction on use of certain industrial plants and

<a href="/doc/195059463/" id="a_55">section 21(1)</a> prohibits any person from establishing or operating any

industrial plant in an air pollution control area without previous consent of

the State Pollution Control Board. <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_56">Section 22</a> of the said Air (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_57">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, further prohibits any person from

operating any industrial plant in any air pollution control area, which

discharge or cause or permit the emission of any air pollutant above the

standards laid down by the State Board. The Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_58">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, has been enacted for prevention and

control of water pollution and maintaining or restoring of wholesomeness

of water and functioning of the Boards constituted under the Act of 1974

is to promote cleanliness of streams and wells in different areas of the

State and also such powers are given in State and Central Boards to

advise on the State Government concerning prevention, control or

abatement of water pollution and their functions are given in various

clauses and under <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_59">section 16</a> and <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_60">17</a> for Central Board and State Board

respectively. Similar provisions as they are available in the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_61">Environment

(Protection) Act</a>, 1986, are in <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_62">section 25</a> of the Water (Prevention and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                    -35-</span>


<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_63">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, which provides that no person shall,

without previous consent of the State Board, establish or take any steps to

establish any industry, operation or process or any treatment and disposal

system or any extension or addition thereto, which is likely to discharge

sewage or trade effluent into a stream or well or sewer or on land and

further restrictions are also given. In sum and substance, prevention of

such pollutions may it be air, sound or water, are concerned, it is the duty

of each and every individual citizen and particularly, if the activities

relating to and is being undertaken in any residential area, the duty is

more onerous. Mere obtaining permission of all those authorities and

maintaining standards below the standard prescribed by those laws and

rules made thereunder will not make or change the nature of uses of the

land from one category to another. Absolutely non-polluting industry and

non-polluting commercial activity are not permissible use in the area

where they cannot be established in view of the Scheme of the planned

development of the city. In planned development of the city, only certain

essential activities, which may fall under different categories, can be

allowed in different categories, like certain shops within earmarked area

of residential area are essential for comfortable living as well as are

essential for residential uses of the property. Therefore, in Appendix - M,

in residential area in column 3 under special appeal permission, certain

services and retail shops have been allowed but with conditions that they

should be located in shopping centres or in concentrated location or at a

place shown in zonal development plan of the area, if prepared. Petrol
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                      -36-</span>


filling station, bus depots, railway passenger and freight station, non-

commercial poultry and cattle farms also have been allowed because of

this reason that these are the essential need of the residents which cannot

be far away from the residential area. It appears that the R.R.D.A, to meet

with the requirements of those laws enacted for specific purpose, may

have directed the respondent no.6 to obtain NOCs and permission from

competent authorities under those Acts but that will not change the nature

and character of the activities of respondent no.6, which, in our opinion, at

the most can fall under land use zone for "commercial (retial)" and that is

under clause 2 in special appeal permissible uses. In view of the above

reasons, the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the

respondent no.6 to show what is industry, what is factory and what tax is

leviable upon respondent no.6 under different Acts have no relevance in

the present controversy. The respondent no.6 wherever undertakes the

activities, he has to follow the above laws and rules and obtain the

requisite permission and licenses only to fulfill the requirement of

different enactments enacted for different purpose and not relevant for the

purpose of construction permission from the R.R.D.A, which has its own

Act and bye-laws covering the subject of construction permission.

</p><p id="p_62">             Then the question emerges is that whether RRDA has applied

its mind to the proposed construction and the purposes for which it has

granted permission to the respondent no.6. From Appendix M, it is clear

that in a residential area, the initial land uses permit   not only residences

but hostels, boarding houses with density limitations, nursery, kinder
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                     -37-</span>


garten, highschools, clinics, social and cultural institution with adequate

parking facilities, retail shopping and community facilities with adequate

parking facilities, neighbourhood recreational uses including clubs and

other such public recreational facilities with adequate parking facilities.

There may not be objection to the above uses of land and building in the

residential area. Such residential area can also be used for (1) place of

worship, (2) professional, commercial and Government offices, (3)

"services uses" and retail shops of a neighbourhood character when

located in local shopping centres or in concentrated locations or as shown

in the zonal development plan of the areas when prepared. In additional

to the above, other use permissible are for hotels, hospitals and sanitoria

(not treating contagious diseases or mental patients). However, it has been

made clear that for these uses, such permission can be granted provided

the set back and coverage of plots are such as not to create nuisance to the

residential area. Further permissible uses in residential area in Special

Appeal are for non-commercial poultry and cattle farms subject to

restriction that the building is not less than 50 ft. away from a dwelling or

property line. In addition to the above, further permissible uses in

residential area are institutions of higher learning, bus depots, railway

passenger and freight station, petrol filling stations on roads of 27 m.

width and above, service and storage yard, taxi and scooter stands. Such

use of land, building and area in residential area are having direct nexus

with the necessary facilities, convenience and are essentially required

services for the residents of residential area. The "service garage" has not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                      -38-</span>


been included in above permissible uses of residential use. In our opinion,

it has rightly not been included in residential use.

</p><p id="p_63">33.           The respondent no.6's contention is that in Special Appeal,

building plan of the respondent was sanctioned and such use is

permissible    in column 2 of Appendix "M" under permissible uses in

Special Appeal matters and also falls under clause 3 as it is providing

service, i.e. servicing of vehicles and it may further fall under column 9

under the Special Appeal permission clause which provides for permission

for "service and storage yard". In our opinion, permission granted to

respondent no.6 does not fall in either of clauses.          However, in

"commercial uses" category, construction permission under column 2 of

permissible uses under Special Appeal are for petrol filling stations and

service garages with adequate set back and coverage so that there is no

nuisance created in the locality. The respondent no.6 wants to convey that

"service use" is the permissible use for the establishment of the "service

station" of cars and also is a commercial activity. If argument of learned

counsel for the R.R.D.A and learned counsel for the respondent no.6 is

accepted and disputed construction permission has been granted under

column 3, then      RRDA misinterpreted the words, "service uses" as

mentioned in column 3 under heading of "permissible uses in Special

Appeal" and R.R.D.A has granted construction permission ignoring the

column 2 in special appeal for commercial area. . The said column 3,

which we may quote here again, is as under:-</p>
<p id="p_64"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                    -39-</span>

                                    created in the locality.
</p>
<p id="p_68">34.          From above columns, it is clear that "service" does not

include "service garage". Even permission under column 3 can be granted

only if the property is    located in shopping centres or in concentrated

locations or as shown in zonal development plan of the areas when

prepared. Respondent's property is not situated in "local shopping centre

or in (such) concentrated location", nor is of a neighbourhood character.

Service garages can be allowed in commercial area and in column 2

under special appeal permission, "service garages" has been included and

therefore, for service garages, construction permission could have been

granted only in commercial area. The contention of the respondent no.6

cannot be accepted that the respondent's activity since is commercial in

nature and    it falls in column 2 under special appeal provision for

residential area, then it is reading "commercial" out of the context. As per

uses given in original land uses permissible in residential area, certain

essential commercial activities have been made permissible, without

which the residents of residential area cannot have comfortable living and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                       -40-</span>


therefore, in residential areas, school, clinics, social and cultural

institutions as well as hotels and retail shopping centres are also allowed,

which are permissible commercial uses of the property in the residential

area. The word, "commercial" has been used in second column of special

appeal permission for residential area and that cannot be said to mean that

commercial activity of any magnitude ignoring certain restrictions put in

column 3 under the same column. Therefore, so far as service station of

the respondent no.6 is concerned, this permission could not have been

granted by RRDA even on special appeal application of respondent no.6

as the land in question falls in residential area.
</p>
<p id="p_69">35.           It will be worthwhile to mention here that it is the admitted

case of even respondent no.6 that in addition to providing car services

which involves cleaning and washing of the cars and other products of

Maruti Udyog Limited, respondent no.6 is engaged in the activity of

denting and painting. Denting and painting may not strictly fall within the

ambit of "manufacture" so as to hold the unit of the respondent no.6 to be

an industry but at the same time, such use of property as has been allowed

to respondent is not falling under any permissible uses as provided in

columns for land uses for residential area in original permissible use or as

such even in case of special appeal (special permission). Column no.9

against the residential permissible uses allowed the uses of the

land/building for "service and storage yard, taxi and scooter stands". The

word, "service" cannot be read as "service station", nor it can be

separated from the words, "service and storage yard". The respondent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                    -41-</span>


no.6's activity cannot be said to be an activity falling under "service and

storage yard". This view finds support from the reason that "service

garage" has been specifically included in commercial area construction

permission column.
</p>
<p id="p_70">36.         The words, "service", "uses" have been used in very many

places in 'M' schedule but this word, whenever has been used, is required

to be read with the context only.      However, activity of denting and

painting if can be included within any of the categories and if it can be

included in clause of "service garages" then also "service garages" is

permissible use in commercial area as per column B of Appendix M.

Therefore, permission granted to the respondent no.6 for establishment of

service garage in the residential area is in violation of the Ranci Planning

Standards and Building Bye-laws, 2002.
</p>
<p id="p_71">37.         Apart from the fact that there is no ambiguity that car service

station and service garage are not permissible activity under Appendix -

M in residential area and service garage is a commercial activity for

which permission can be granted on commercial land as per clause - B of

Appendix - M, it would be worthwhile to mention here that all land uses

permissible under clause - A "Residential" clearly indicates that only

those commercial activities are allowed in residential area which may

have direct connection with the facilities, convenience and service to the

residents of the locality, just like nursery, kinder garten, highschool,

clinics, social and cultural institutions, retail shopping and community

facilities, neighbourhood recreational uses including clubs and in special
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                    -42-</span>


appeal permission, permissible uses are places of worship, professional,

commercial and Government offices, service uses and retail shops with

condition that this should be of neighbourhood character and they should

be located in shopping centres or shall be earmarked as such in zonal

development plan obviously prepared, hotels, hospitals, sanitoria not

treating contagious diseases or mental patients, non-commercial poultry

and cattle farms, institutions of higher learning, bus depots, railway

passenger and freight station, petrol filling stations, service and storage

yards, taxi and scooter stands. All these uses have direct relation with

comfortable living of the resident of the area. Wherever there is any

chance of overcrowding or nuisance, caution has been mentioned in the

column, providing for permission. Therefore, grant of a service station of

large number of cars of a dealer having an agency of sale of cars with

facilities of painting and denting with employees of 100 persons without

taking care of those employees' parking space who (high ranking) may

come with cars or scooters which may be in large number and without

taking care of possibility of coming of vehicles of customers for servicing

and repairing and their movements in residential area is contrary to rules

and scheme and while granting permission the Table - 7 under clause

23.2 prescribing requirement of space for car parking off-street has been

ignored, which certainly vitiates the permission granted by the R.R.D.A to

respondent no.6 for establishing and running service garage of cars in the

property in dispute.
</p>
<p id="p_72">38.         Furthermore in commercial areas meant for retail or where
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                     -43-</span>


business, professional offices, social and welfare institutions can be

constructed but they can be in higher floor and even in retail commercial

area, taxi and scooter stands, bus terminals, if are allowed, then their

parking area requirements are also required to approved by the R.R.D.A.

If the respondent no.6 continues with its activities of servicing        and

painting and denting of the vehicles, in addition to sales of cars and its

owned products, "Maruti" are having large number of customers, then

certainly totality of the activity of respondent no.6 will create huge

nuisance in the residential area.
</p>
<p id="p_73">39.          However, in the facts of this case, we hold that grant of

permission by other Department under other Acts, other than R.R.D.A Act

and Bye-laws, are not relevant, yet we may consider the arguments

advanced by learned counsel as the issues of pollution         and hazards.

Learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr.Jitendra Singh, Senior Advocate,

vehemently submitted that in addition to impermissible use of the property

in residential area, several reports have shown that it will cause pollution

beyond the limit prescribed under the relevant Acts and will emit

hazardous wastes and drew our attention to the calculation, which,

according to learned counsel for the petitioner, itself clearly indicates, if

calculated rightly,   that respondent no.6's unit is creating      nuisance,

pollution and hazard for public health and hygiene. Learned counsel for

respondent no.6, Mr. Gupta, controverted the allegation and submitted that

in respondent's service station whatever denting and painting is done, it is

done not under traditional way but it is done in "Painting Bake Booths"
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                        -44-</span>


fitted with three filters and denting is undertaken by using "Miracle Repair

System" and not by traditional tools and hammers. Therefore, nuisance is

below the prescribed level under the various schedules of the relevant

provision of the Acts and all have certified by the said Departments. It is

also submitted that the property is situated on National Highway and road

nuisance is more as compared to any nuisance which may come out from

the activity of the respondent no.6.

<p id="p_74">40.          We have already observed that above fact is not of much

relevance and still we are of the considered opinion that both the parties

tried to impress us by submitting that either marginally water, air and

sound pollution is high or marginally it is below. That issue is not much

relevant in view of the fact that if an industry is not creating any air, sound

or water pollution and is not emitting any hazardous material, then it does

not mean that it can be established in residential area. The concept of

earmarking separate areas for residential, commercial (retail), commercial,

industrial has its own concept and are being taken care of by special laws

and not dependent upon other laws, which are applicable to the industries,

factories etc. There are different purposes for different laws as industrial

laws are framed so as to given protection to the workmen and prevent

exploitation of workmen and to give certain benefits to workmen and

employees of the industries and factories. The Pollution Control Laws

have been enacted so that workmen and employees working in even

industrial area and factories may not be exposed to air, sound and water

pollution as well as to hazardous wastes. Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                     -45-</span>


case of MSCO Pvt. Ltd. observed that it is hazardous to interpret on word

in accordance with its definition in another statute or statutory instrument

and so more when such statute or statutory instrument is not dealing with

any cogent object. In our view, any cogent object of the Urban

Development Act and its by-laws are entirely different, then the object

behind the other Acts dealing subject of pollution. The safeguards given in

these latter laws may be the reason to disallow construction permission of

building but it is not necessary that fulfillment of requirements of

pollution control standards will fulfill the requirements of provision of

building by-laws.   Thus, we are of the view that merely one commercial

establishment or industrial establishment is not creating air, sound and

water pollution or emitting hazardous materials, merely because of that

reason, both establishment cannot be allowed to run in the residential area.

</p><p id="p_75">41.         The argument of learned counsel for respondent no.6 that

sound and air pollution in the area may be because of the reason that the

property is situated on a National Highway and the traffic running in the

National Highway are creating sound and air and other pollutions. Even if

this is the position, then such pollution created by such traffic may not be

reduced but certainly the pollution created by one unit adding fuel in the

pollution can be stopped to make the residential area worth living. In view

of the above reasons, the inspection reports dated 5th November, 2004, 24th

January, 2007, 13th April, 2007, 7th July, 2009, 8th October, 2009, 14th

December, 2009, 19th June, 2010, 27th July, 2010, 5th August, 2010, 26th

February, 2011, 12th March, 2011 and 14th March, 2011 and lastly 26th
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                     -46-</span>


March, 2011 will not be of any help to either of the parties and those

reports only indicate that pollution is either slightly more or slightly less

but that is not decisive, nor very much relevant factor for deciding the

controversy of permissible land uses.

<p id="p_76">42.         The respondent no.6 tried take help of the definition "service"

from the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_64">Finance Act</a>, 1994 and submitted that since respondent no.6 is

paying service tax, it is not an industry and took the help of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_65">section 65(9)</a>

of the Finance Act, 1994, wherein it has been defined that service station

means service station or centre authrorized by any motor vehicle

manufacturer to carry out service, repairing, reconditioning or restoration

of any motor car or two-wheeled motor cycle manufacture by

manufacturers. It may be true that such definition may have been given

under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_66">section 65(9)</a> of the Finance Act, 1994 but R.R.D.A was not

concerned with this definition, when it has framed bye-laws and

specifically provided that service station shall be in commercial zone of

the area, then R.R.D.A could not have granted sanction for construction of

service station in residential area and that too of such magnitude wherein

huge land of 3826 sq.m was sought to be used for showroom cum service

garage with accommodation of about 100 employees to give services to

service and repair cars in large number.
</p>
<p id="p_77">43.         In the case of K.Ramadas Shenoy (supra), Hon'ble Supreme

Court held that the Municipal authorities owe a duty and obligation under

the statute to see that the residential area is not spoilt by unauthorized

construction and the scheme is for the benefit of the residents of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                       -47-</span>


locality and the rights of the residents in the area are not invaded by any

illegal construction and emphasized that it has to be remembered that a

scheme in a residential area means planned orderliness in accordance with

the requirements of the residents and if the scheme is nullified by arbitrary

acts in excess and derogation of the powers of the Municipality, the Courts

will quash orders passed by Municipalities in such cases.

</p><p id="p_78">44.          In the case of Indian Council For Enviro-Legal Action

(supra), Hon'ble Supreme Court held that Municipal authorities have not

taken the action required of them by law and their inaction is jeopardizing

the right to life of the citizens of this country or of any section thereof, it is

the duty of this Court to intervene and further held that in such a situation,

the Court can make appropriate directions to ensure compliance with law

and lawful directions made thereunder. In the case of Bombay Dyeing &amp;

Mag.Co.Ltd. (supra), Hon'ble Supreme Court held that interpretation of a

town planning statute, which        has an environmental aspect leading to

application of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, cannot be held to be

within the exclusive domain of the Executive. In the case of M.C.Mehta

(supra), Hon'ble Supreme Court held that despite passing of the laws and

repeated orders of the High Court and Supreme Court, the enforcement

and the implementation         of the orders are utterly lacking. Hon'ble

Supreme Court observed that those who own the properties that are

misused    have    also   implied    responsibility   towards the hardship,

inconvenience, suffering caused to the residents of the locality and injuries

to third parties. In the above case, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                     -48-</span>


not only the question of stopping the misuser but also making the owners

at default accountable for the injuries caused to others and similar would

also be the accountability of errant officers as well, since, prima facie,

such large scale misuser in violation of laws cannot take place without the

active connivance of the officers and it would be for the officers to show

what effective steps were taken to stop the misuser.

</p><p id="p_79">45.         However, in the case of Greater Kailash Part II Welfare

Associatiion &amp; Ors. (supra), Hon'ble Supreme Court held that owner of a

plot is entitled to use and utilize the same for any lawful purpose and to

erect any construction thereupon in accordance with the existing rules and

so long as such owner does not contravene any of the provisions which

restrict his use of the plot in any manner, he cannot be prevented from

utilizing the same in accordance with law. In Greater Kailash Part II

case, the respondent no.1 was the owner of the plot in question and

Hon'ble Supreme Court held that he cannot be denied the use of the plot

on account of the apprehension of the appellants, particularly when he has

already raised the structure in accordance with sanctioned plan. There

cannot be any dispute with the proposition laid down in Greater Kailash

Part II case. But in this case, the said case has no application to the facts

of the case because of the fact that the Court has found that the permission

which has been granted to the respondent no.6 allowing it to establish a

service garage with the facility of denting and painting is impermissible

use in the residential area under the bye-laws framed by the R.R.D.A.

15 SCC 705),. Hon'ble Supreme Court held that Supreme Court has taken

cognizance of buildings constructed in violation of municipal and other

laws and emphasized that no compromise should be made with the town

planning scheme etc. on the ground that he has spent substantial amount

on construction of the buildings. Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that

unfortunately despite repeated judgments by the Supreme Court and High

Courts, the builders and other affluent people engaged in the construction

activities, who have, over the years shown scant respect for regulatory

mechanism envisaged in the municipal and other similar laws as also the

master plans, zonal development plans, sanctioned plans etc., have

received encouragement and support from the State apparatus and as and

when have passed orders or the officers of local and other bodies have

taken action for ensuring rigorous compliance with laws relating to

planned development of the cities and urban areas and issued directions

for demolition of the illegal/unauthorized constructions, those in power

have come forward to protect the wrongdoers either by issuing

administrative orders or enacting laws for regularization of illegal and

unauthorized constructions in the name of compassion and hardship and

such actions have done irreparable harm to the concept of planned

development of the cities and urban areas and it is high time that the

executive and political apparatus of the State take serious view of the

menace of illegal and unauthorized constructions and stop their support to

the lobbies of affluent class of builders and others, else even the rural

areas of the country will soon witness similar chaotic condition.

</p><p id="p_81">47.          In the case of R.K.Mittal &amp; Ors. Vs. State of U.P &amp; Ors.

((2012) 2 SCC 232), while considering the ambit and scope of power of

New Okhla Industrial Development Authority to permit users other than

residential in the sectors specifically earmarked for residential use in the

Master Plan of the New Okhla Industrial Development Area, Hon'ble

Supreme Court held that it is not merely at the discretion of the

Development Authority concerned to designate user of a site and then alter

the same without following due process of law and even where such an

exercise is required to be undertaken by the Development Authroity, there

also it is expected of the Development Authority to act for the betterment

of the public and strictly in accordance with the plans and statutory

provisions and it cannot take recourse to its powers and use its discretion

contrary to such provisions and that too, to frustrate the very object of the

Act and exercise of power ought not to be destructive of the provisions of

the Act and plans having the force of law. Hon'ble Supreme Court also

held that where requisite prescribed procedure is followed, still the

discretion should be exercised sparingly for achieving the object of the

statute and not to completely vary or destruct the purpose for which the

sector has been earmarked. Hon'ble Supreme Court further held that

running of a Bank or a Commercial            business by a company in the

residential sector is certainly not permissible and it is in patent violation of

the Master Plan, Regulations and the provisions of the Act and no power

is vested in the Development Authority to permit such user and ignore the

misuse for such a long period. Hon'ble Supreme Court noticed that in any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                     -51-</span>


area earmarked for residential use, the Doctors, Lawyers and Architects

can use 30 per cent of the area on the ground floor in their premises in

residential sector for running their clinics/offices and for such use, the

Lawyers, Architects and Doctors shall be liable to pay such charges as

may be determined by the Development Authority in accordance with law

and after granting an opportunity of being heard.
</p>
<p id="p_82">48.          In sum and substance, in those judgments more emphasis is

on protecting the residential area from any sort of nuisance and it is

expected from the Officers of the Local Bodies that they will strictly

follow the laws so as to protect the earmarked area for its use according to

its earmarking.

<p id="p_83">49.          Judgments of Union of India Vs. Delhi Cloth &amp; General

Mills, MSCO (P) Ltd. Vs. Union of India, G.L.Hotels Ltd. Vs. T.C Sarin,

State of Maharashtra Vs. Mahalaxmi Stores, Qazi Noorul, H.H.H Petrol

Pump Vs. Deputy Director, Employees' State Insurance Corporation are

entirely on different subjects and can be relevant for the purpose of those

judgments being rendered and that may be relevant for the purpose of

finding the meaning of word, "manufacture", provision of <a href="/doc/305412/" id="a_67">section 2(12)</a>

of the Employees' <a href="/doc/88376/" id="a_68">State Insurance Act</a>, 1948 and to find out when

"manufacturing activity is required to be given a particular meaning or a

narrower      meaning and what comes              under the definition of

"manufacture". The above judgments have been cited by the learned

counsel for the respondent no.6 to show that the respondent no.6's unit not

a factory or industry. But in our opinion, that is not relevant in view of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                    -52-</span>


reasons given above.
</p>
<p id="p_84">50.          So far as challenge to the orders passed by the various

authorities, like NOC granted by the Pollution Control Board, vide Memo

No.N-84 dated 9th February, 2005 under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_69">section 25</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_70">26</a> of Water

(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_73">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, emission consent order issued by

the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board by Reference No.1294 dated

17th June, 2005 under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_74">section 21</a> of the same Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_75">Control of

Pollution) Act</a> and its subsequent renewals, discharge consent orders

issued under Reference No.1295 dated 17th June, 2005 are concerned, we

need not go into the legality of the above orders because of the reason that

even if those orders stand and are held to be valid, then also the

respondent no.6's permission to establish service garage in residential area

cannot be justified.
</p>
<p id="p_85">51.          Learned counsel for the respondent no.6 drew our attention to

the sketch map showing that on the same National Highway, there are

large number of service stations and the petitioner has picked up one only

and that is because of rivalry and because of oblique motive.

</p><p id="p_86">52.          We are of the considered opinion that detailed facts of above

service stations are not available and it is not clear whether all these

service stations have been established after obtaining requisite permission

from the R.R.D.A and whether they are having same magnitude of

working like servicing, denting and painting to the extent of engaging

about 100 persons as employees and those permission have been granted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                    -53-</span>


in residential area. At this place, it will be relevant to mention here that

similar showrooms of others like Hyundi            Motors, Ford Motors,

Chevrolet, Ambassador and Shushila Motors have already been shifted

to other places. Therefore, on the basis of those incomplete facts and

data, respondent no.6 cannot claim his right to establish a showroom-

cum-service garage in residential area. Thus, the plea of respondent

no.6 is rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_87">53.          In view of the above discussions, the writ petition of the

petitioner is partly allowed and it is held that construction permission

granted to respondent no.6 is contrary to the bye-laws framed by the

Ranchi Regional Development Authority in 2001. However, the building

has already been constructed. Therefore, the only relief granted to the

petitioner is that respondent no.6 is directed to close its service,

painting and denting activities in the disputed plot within a period of

one year from the date of this order so that the respondent no.6 may

make alternative arrangement of shifting his service, painting and

denting garage from the plot in dispute. In view of the above orders, all

interlocutory applications including I.A No.831/2011 are disposed of

without any order.
