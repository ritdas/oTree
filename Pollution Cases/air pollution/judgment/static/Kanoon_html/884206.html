ACT:
     Constitution of India, 1950:
     <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1">Article 32-</a>Environmental and air pollution-Control	 of-
Operation  of mechanical crushers-Stoppage  of-Allotment  of
sites in the newly set-up crushing zone-Directions issued.



HEADNOTE:
     Writ   Petitions	were  filed   before   this   Court,
challenging  the  action of the	 owners/proprietors  of	 the
stone-crushers	whereby stone-dust and smoke was allowed  to
pass into the air, and due to pollution, lives of the people
living	in some parts of South Delhi, especially rural,	 and
workers, their families living at the site as well as people
living in the villages bordering Haryana were suffering from
different  diseases  and  their lives were  in	danger,	 and
praying for issue of writ of mandamus and directions to	 the
respondents and authorities concerned to take steps to	stop
pollution,  and provide necessary medical facilities to	 the
affected persons.
     Giving  directions,  reasons for which to	be  followed
later, this Court,
     HELD  :  1. Environmental changes	are  the  inevitable
consequence  of industrial development in our country,	but,
at  the	 same  time the quality	 of  environment  cannot  be
permitted to be damaged by polluting the Air, Water and Land
to  such an extent that it becomes a health-hazard  for	 the
residents  of  the area.  The authorities concerned  in	 the
Union  Territories of Delhi have been wholly re-miss in	 the
performance  of	 their statutory duties and have  failed  to
protect	 the  environment and control air-pollution  in	 the
Union  Territory of Delhi.  Utter disregard  to	 environment
has  placed  Delhi  in	unenviable  position  of  being	 the
world's third grubbiest, most polluted and unhealthy city as
per  a	study conducted by the	World  Health  Organisation.
Needless to say that every citizen has a right to fresh	 air
and to live in pollution-free environment. [359 F-H, 360 A]
     2.	 It is, therefore, directed that (a) the  mechanical
stone crushers
						       358
established/operating  in Lal Kuan, Anand  Parbat,  Rajokri,
Tughlakabad  and  in any other area of	Union  territory  of
Delhi and also in Suraj Kund, Lakhanpur, Lakkarpur,  Kattan,
Gurukul,  Badkhal,  Pallinangla,  Saraikhaja,  Anangpur	 and
Ballabgarh     areas	 of	Haryana	    should	stop
operating/functioning  with effect from August 15, 1992	 and
no  stone crusher will operate in the above said areas	from
August 15, 1992 onward; (b) the stone crushers in the  Union
territory of Delhi/Faridabad-Ballabgarh Complex which do not
have  valid  licences from the Authorities under  the  Delhi
Municipal    Corporation   Act,	   1957/Faridabad    Complex
Administration	(Regulations and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_2">Development) Act</a>,  1971  or
from  any  other authority which the law requires,  and	 the
stone	 crushers,    in   respect   of	   which    closure-
orders/directions have been issued by the Central  Pollution
Control	 Board	under  <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_3">Section 31A</a> of  Air  (Prevention	 and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 or by the Central Government
under  <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_5">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection	 Act,  1956,
should stop functioning/operating with immediate effect; (c)
the authorities concerned should ensure compliance of  these
order;	and  (d) the authorities concerned of the  State  of
Haryana	 should	 demarcate,  and  allot	 the  sites  to	 the
aforesaid  stone  crushers in the newly	 approved  'crushing
zone'  at  village  Pali  -  set  up  with  the	 object	  of
rehabilitating	the  existing stone-crushers who  are  being
stopped	 from functioning as a result of the orders of	this
Court  - by draw of lots or by any other fair and  equitable
method, and also to provide additional land in or around the
"crushing zone" if there is not sufficient land in the	said
zone to accommodate all the stone crushers affected by	this
Court's	 orders	 within a period of six months.	 A  progress
report	in  this respect should be sent to the	Registry  of
this Court before July 31, 1992. [360 B-C, E-H, 361 A-G]
     3.	 Some  Writ  Petitions, which  were  filled  by	 the
owners/proprietors of stone-crushers in the Delhi High Court
and which have been directed to be transferred to this Court
are dismissed. [360 E]

     We	 reserved  judgment in these matters  on  April	 24,
1992.	 We  heard  learned  counsel  for  the	parties	  at
considerable  length  for several days. We have	 been  taken
through the provisions of Delhi Development Act 1957, Master

Planning  Board	 Act,  1985  and  various  other   documents
including  reports  of	the Experts  on	 Air  Pollution	 and
environments.	The parties have submitted detailed  written
arguments  which we have taken into consideration.  We	have
given  our thoughful consideration to the various  arguments
advanced by the learned counsel for the parties.
</p><p id="p_6">     We	 are  conscious that environmental changes  are	 the

Water  and Land to such an extent that it becomes a  health-

record	 that	Delhi	Development   Authority,   Municipal
Corporation  of Delhi, Central Pollution Control  Board	 and
Delhi  Pollution Control Committee have been wholly  re-miss
in the performance of their statutory duties and have failed
to protect the environments and control air-pollution in the
Union  Territory of Delhi.  Utter disregard  to	 environment
has  placed  Delhi in an unenviable position  of  being	 the
