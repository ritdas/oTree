                                        ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">                  (Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)

16   12-04-2018                  In this Public Interest Litigation filed, two issues

                   have been raised, one is with regard to the drainage problem in

                   the city of Darbhanga and the second is with regard to removal

                   of bio waste and other medical waste which is accumulated in

                   the city and contending that the same is not being looked into

                   according to the statutory provision i.e. the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Prevention of

                   Pollution Control Act</a>, the petition has been filed in public

                   interest.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                   As far as addressing the problem of drainage is

                   concerned, the Darbhanga Municipal Corporation, the Railway

                   administration and the State Government have filed their

                   separate affidavit and on going through the affidavits we find

                   that each is blaming the other for the delay in completing certain
 Patna High Court CWJC No.5409 of 2016(16) dt.12-04-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2/3</span>




         works pertaining to construction of bridge, allocation of land,

         alignment etc. and with regard to the bio medical waste removal

         also the Pollution Control Board points out that they have given

         the recommendation and pursuant thereto tenders have been

         issued for allotting the work of dealing with the bio waste to a

         particular company.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                         On going through the detailed counter affidavit

         filed by all the three wings of the State, namely, the Railway

         administration, the Municipal Corporation, Darbhanga and the

         State, we find that it is a case where the left hand does not know

         what is the right hand is doing.                 There is no coordination

         between the departments and each department is working on its

         own as a consequence thereof the projects which are to be

         implemented are being delayed and the ultimate sufferer is the

         citizens of the town.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                         Taking note of the manner in which the three

         departments are working, it is directed that the Chief Secretary

         of the State of Bihar shall constitute a committee consisting of

         all the three departments which shall monitor the execution of

         the work in question and submit a report to this Court. The

         Chief Secretary to constitute a committee and inform this Court

         with regard to the committee constituted for execution of the
            Patna High Court CWJC No.5409 of 2016(16) dt.12-04-2018

                    work in question.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                                 List the matter after two weeks to enable the Chief

                    Secretary to constitute a committee and submit his affidavit in

                    the matter. After the committed is constituted, we shall proceed

                    in the matter and monitor the execution of the work after

                    consultation with the Committee.
