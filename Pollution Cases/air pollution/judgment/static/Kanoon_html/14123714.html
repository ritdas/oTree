<pre id="pre_1">                  THE HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE A.V.SESHA SAI

                              W.P.No.14713 of 2018

ORDER:
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Petitioner is a society, consisting of the members belonging to

Scheduled Tribes and is engaged in the business of decasting, transporting,

dumping and reloading of the sand into the transport vehicles. The State

Government entrusted the work of decasting of sand in Godavari River at

Chenchupalli Village, Mangapet Mandal, Warangal District in favour of

Telangana State Mineral Development Corporation (for short 'TSMDC') under

the Telangana State Sand Mining Rules, 2014 notified vide G.O.Ms.No.3

Industries &amp; Commerce (Mines.I) Department dated 8.1.2015. In order to

carry out the said work, the TSMDC entered into an agreement dated

4.3.2016 with the petitioner. As per the said agreement, the quantity of sand

to be extracted being 1,79,452 cubic metres in an area of 24.15 Hectares

within the geo- coordinates indicated therein and the amount payable to the

petitioner being Rs.220/- per cubic metre. According to the petitioner, they

excavated 1,46,350.50 cubic metres.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">2.    On the complaint received from the Mines and Geology Department,

alleging extraction of sand from the area outside the identified area and

beyond the geo-coordinates, a joint inspection was conducted by the

Assistant Director of Mines and Geology and TSMDC on 22.4.2016 and they

submitted a report, stating that the extraction of sand took place beyond the

geo-coordinates fixed by the authorities and a quantity of 98,991.50 M3 of

sand was extracted from the area outside the specified sand bearing area

and transported to the stockyard.      The said report stated further that

extraction of sand outside the specified sand bearing area would attract
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                         2</span>




penalty clause under Rule 5(1)(k) of TSSMR, 2015 and suggested to the

TSMDC to obtain permission of the State Government to avoid penalty. The

last three paragraphs of the said report read as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "The extraction of sand outside the specified sand bearing area
     will attract penalty clause under Rule 5(1)(k) of TSSMR, 2015 as per
     G.O.Ms.No.3 dated 8.1.2015 and subsequent amendments thereon.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             Although the sand has been extracted outside the specified
     sand bearing area, and the sand so extracted stacked properly in the
     authorized stockyard only. No quantity of sand has been sold illegally in
     the open market. Out of the total quantity i.e. 98,991.50 CBM of sand
     extracted, the 28,997.50 CBM quantity of sand has been sold only
     through TSMDC online portal. The amount realized has been remitted to
     Government Treasury balance 70,000 CBM quantity of sand is available
     at the Stockyard. Therefore, there is no loss of revenue to Government.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             Hence, M/s Telangana State Mineral Development Corporation
     Ltd., is requested to kindly take the permission from the Government to
     avoid the penalty on the quantity extracted outside the specific sand
     bearing area and also requested to obtain permission for sale of sand
     available at the stockyard being a Corporation undertaking by the State
     Government of Telangana".
</blockquote>


<p id="p_4">3.    As a consequence of the above report, the Vice Chairman and

Managing     Director,    TSMDC       addressed     a    letter    bearing       Ref:

TSMDC/GM(M)/WGL/2016/431 dated 10.8.2016 to the State Government

requesting to allow TSMDC to sell available sand at Chenchupally stockyard

i.e., 70,000 cubic metre by forfeiting raising cost of an amount of Rs.220/-

per cubic metre to the petitioner society. Thereafter the State Government

vide Lr.No.6294/M.I(1)/2016-1 dated 29.8.2016 allowed the request of the

TSMDC to sell the available sand by forfeiting raising cost amount of Rs.220/-

per cubic metre to the petitioner. The same was questioned in W.P.No.40469
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            3</span>




of 2017 and this Court by way of an order dated 31.1.2018 disposed of the

said writ petition and paragraphs 6 to 8 of the said order read as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     "6.      Even taken into consideration of the criteria laid down in the
     expression which clearly says a writ petition even in contractual and
     money claims is maintainable by every person. A sheer contractual
     recovery of the amount is not maintainable to consider though there is
     no absolute bar if at all the court considers as an exceptional case in
     other respects where there are serious disputed questions of fact which
     are of only complex nature may not entertain writ petition. Here, it is not
     such even to consider the case on hand comes under any of the limbs. It
     is, more particularly, for the reason that it is not the case of the
     respondents that the extraction of sand is in the absence of the persons
     concerned that the respondents under their monitoring and supervision it
     is only on their showing the extract can be done by the society in
     utilization of their hard labour for the extraction of sand as the case may
     be. If at all there is an excess excavation that too in their presence once
     it is not illegal but for exceeding the contractual limitations if any, that
     too, when not prevented timely and even by the impugned proceedings
     respondent No.1 permitted respondent No.3 to sell the sand already
     excavated and liability in it official on search through their official portal
     they cannot denied the service charges of excavation by the petitioner-
     society more particularly under the principle of quasi contract covered by
     sections 67 to 70 of the Indian Contract Act of the excavation is beyond
     the permissible limits of the contractual relation by such an irregularity,
     but for, at best to impose compensation for the act done by them as
     contemplated by Section 73 out of the remuneration payable to withhold
     a portion as compensation/penalty as the case may be.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     7.       Having regard to the above, from the settled principle on the
     scope of <a href="/doc/1856144/" id="a_1">Sections 67</a> to <a href="/doc/1454268/" id="a_2">70</a> of the Indian Contract Act laid down by the
     expression of the Constitution Bench in the <a href="/doc/197048/" id="a_3">State of West Bengal v.
     B.K.Mondal</a> and sons (AIR 1962 SC 779) of entitled to the amount under
     quasi contract invoking <a href="/doc/1454268/" id="a_4">Section 70</a> of the Indian Contract Act, where the
     party has lawfully done some works not entertained to act gratuitously
     even if it is exceeding the same or outcome of irregularity and it is only,
     where the other party accepts the thing or enjoys the work done that
     liability under <a href="/doc/1454268/" id="a_5">Section 70</a> of the Act definitely arise as they accepting
     extra excavated sand and want to reap the benefits for sale, they are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         4</span>




     bound to pay for it subject to impose of any compensation out of the
     amount payable.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">     8.        With the above observations, the Writ Petition is disposed of
     directing the respondents to pay the remuneration, subject to deduction
     of reasonable amount out of it as compensation".
</blockquote>


<p id="p_5">4.       After the above said order, now the State Government passed an order

vide Letter No.371/M.1(1)/2018-2 dated 19.4.2018, ordering deduction of

fifty percent of amount i.e., Rs.77,00,000/- payable to the petitioner society

by the TSMDC as penalty and to release the balance of Rs.77,00,000/-.

This writ petition challenges the validity and legal sustainability of the said

order.    A counter affidavit is filed by the first respondent, denying the

averments and allegations in the writ affidavit and in the direction of

justifying the impugned action.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">5.       Heard Sri K.Durga Prasad, learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Government Pleader for Mines and Geology for Respondents.


</p><p id="p_8">6.       It is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the

questioned action which culminated in the order dated 19.4.2018 is highly

illegal, arbitrary, unreasonable, without jurisdiction and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_6">Article 14</a>

of the Constitution of India; that as the entire activity was undertaken by the

men of the petitioner society under the supervision and control of TSMDC,

the petitioner, whose members belong to downtrodden and weaker sections

of the society, cannot be penalised for no fault of them; that Rule 5 of the

Rules notified vide G.O.Ms.No.3 Industries and Commerce (Mines-I)

Department dated 8.1.2015 does not enable the State Government to impose

penalty on the petitioner which has no privity of contract with the

Government, as such, the impugned action is totally one without jurisdiction;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       5</span>




that when this Court directed the respondents in the earlier writ petition only

to consider about the compensation under <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_7">Section 73</a> of the Contract Act,

there is no justification on the part of the Government to impose penalty.


</p><p id="p_9">7.    Per contra, learned Advocates, appearing on behalf of State

Government and TSMDC maintain that there is no illegality nor there exists

any infirmity in the impugned action and in the absence of the same, the

questioned action is not amenable for any judicial review under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> of

the Constitution of India; that the impugned imposition of penalty is in

accordance with Rule 5(1)(k) and 5(2) of the Rules notified vide G.O.Ms.No.3

dated 8.1.2015; that condition No.3 (iii) and condition No.8 of the agreement

entered into between TSMDC and the petitioner enable the respondents to

impose penalty.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">8.    It is significant to note that though the petitioner in the writ affidavit

categorically stated that they undertook the entire activity under the

supervision and control of the officials of TSMDC, the same is not denied in

the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents. Therefore, the same

needs to be taken as correct.   In fact, in the order in W.P.No.40469 of 2017,

this Court at paragraph 6, this Court took note of the same and held that the

petitioner cannot be denied the service charges for the excavation

undertaken and also took note of the fact the permission granted by the

State Government to TSMDC to sell the sand already excavated.            In this

context, it would be appropriate to refer to Rule 5 of the Rules notified

vide G.O.Ms.No.3 dated 8.1.2015, which read as under:

<p id="p_36">

</p><p id="p_37">9.     The above said Rules obviously deals with the agreement between

Assistant Director, Mines and Geology and TSMDC and the consequences of

the breach of the conditions thereof and does not deal with the agreement

between TSMDC and the petitioner.              Therefore, it has to held that the

impugned order, purportedly in exercise of the said Rule, is without

jurisdiction. Another important aspect which needs mention is that in the

earlier W.P.No.49469 of 2017, this Court deprecated the action of the

Respondents in imposing penalty.          On this ground also, the action of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                       8</span>




State Government in imposing penalty cannot be sustained. Even the TSMDC

cannot sustain the action under <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_11">Section 73</a> of the Contract Act read with

conditions 3(iii) and 8 also in view of the joint report dated 25.4.2016 and

letter dated 10.8.2016 of TSMDC stating that the Government did not suffer

any revenue loss. In view of the above reasons, the impugned action cannot

be sustained in the eye of law.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">10.   For the foregoing reasons, the writ petition is allowed, setting aside

impugned Letter No.371/M.I(1)/2018-2 dated 19.4.2018 to the extent of

ordering deduction of 50% i.e., Rs.77,00,000/-and consequently Respondents

are directed to pay the entire amount to the petitioner without any

deductions.   As a sequel, the miscellaneous petitions, if any, shall stand

closed. There shall be no order as to costs.
