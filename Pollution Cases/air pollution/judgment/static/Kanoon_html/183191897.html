FILED BY THE PETITIONERS IN O.S.NO.291/2012, THEREBY
RESTRAINING THE RESPONDENT NO.1 FROM RUNNING THE
WOOD INDUSTRY AND ETC.,

     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:


                            ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Though the matter is listed for preliminary hearing,

by consent of learned advocates appearing for the

parties, it is taken up for final disposal.


</p><p id="p_2">2.    Heard Sri C.V.Angadi, learned counsel appearing

for   the   petitioners,   Sri    Arun   L.Neelopant,   learned

counsel appearing for caveator/respondent No.1, Sri

M.G.Naganuri, learned counsel appearing for respondent

No.2 and Sri Vinayak S.Kulkarni, learned High Court

Government Pleader appearing for respondent No.4.

Issuance of notice to respondent No.5 is dispensed with.

Parties are referred to as per the rank in the trial Court.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             :4:</span>




</p><p id="p_3">3.   Plaintiffs have filed a suit in O.S.No.291/2012

seeking for declaration that wood factory situated at

Michigan compound, Dhawad, is an illegal factory since

it is run without valid license and same is causing

nuisance by way of noise pollution.      When the matter

was set down for evidence i.e., after a period of one

year from the date of filing of the suit, an application for

temporary injunction came to be filed by the plaintiffs.

1st defendant resisted the said application by filing

detailed statement of objections.        Trial Court after

considering rival contentions by order dated 02.09.2013

dismissed the application on the ground that the

plaintiffs had kept quiet all along from the date of filing

of the suit and Pollution Control Board had issued

Environmental Clearance Certificate specifying that the

noise level should not exceed 75 decibels during day

time and 70 decibels at night time and also on the

ground that 1st defendant had already obtained an order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             :5:</span>




of perpetual injunction against the Hubli Dharwad

Municipal    Corporation     namely     the    Corporation

restraining them from running the industry.


</p><p id="p_4">4.   Being aggrieved by this order, plaintiffs filed an

appeal in Misc.Appeal No.32/2013 which came to be

allowed in part by setting aside the order of trial court

and remanding the matter back to trial court with a

direction to appoint a Court Commissioner on an

application filed by either side of the parties and after

seeking necessary report with regard to allegations

made by plaintiffs regarding noise and air pollution and

to dispose of the interlocutory application afresh in

accordance with law. I am of the considered view that

order of lower Appellate Court does not suffer from any

infirmity whatsoever. Impugned order does not indicate

as to who should be appointed as Court Commissioner

and if same is clarified it would meet the ends of justice.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            :6:</span>




</p><p id="p_5">5.   Undisputedly, for establishing an industry of this

nature, 1st defendant had applied with the Karnataka

State Pollution Control Board and obtained a Consent

Certificate on 25.08.2011 for the period 01.01.2011 to

31.12.2020, Consent Order had been granted fixing the

noise pollution level at 75 decibels during day time and

70 decibels during night time.     It is this consent order

issued by the Pollution Control Board which swayed in

the mind of the trial Court to dismiss application for

injunction.     However,     the     Corrigendum     dated

19.05.2012 issued by the Pollution Control Board has

not been noticed by the trial Court.     Though this was

available with the parties, for reasons best known,

neither of the parties produced this before the lower

appellate Court also.   De-hors non-production of said

Corrigendum issued by Pollution Control Board, lower

Appellate Court has observed that a Court Commissioner

can be appointed to record the noise pollution level of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             :7:</span>




the 1st defendant's industry and thereafter I.A. for

temporary injunction can be considered.            When a

statutory authority is empowered to grant Consent

Order under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1981, it is the said authority alone which would be

empowered to find out as to whether there is any

infraction of the consent order given by it or the

conditions stipulated for grant of such consent has been

violated by the Licensee.   In the light of the aforesaid

facts, I am of the considered view that it would suffice if

the order of the lower Appellate Court is clarified to the

effect   that   Court   Commissioner    proposed    to   be

appointed as ordered by the lower Appellate Court shall

be construed as appointing an Official of the Karnataka

State Pollution Control Board as Court Commissioner to

record the noise level generated from the 1st defendant-

Industry.   Either of the parties can file a necessary

memo to the said effect before the trial court and on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              :8:</span>




their failure to do so, trial Court itself would be at liberty

to suo-motto appoint an Official of the Karnataka State

Pollution Control Board to record the noise pollution

level and on receipt of the report, it shall consider IA-I

for temporary injunction on merits and in accordance

with law by affording opportunity to both the parties. All

contention of both parties are left open.

of. No costs.
