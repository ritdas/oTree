     This writ petition coming on for preliminary

                            4


                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">D.H.WAGHELA, CJ(Oral)

</p><p id="p_2">1.   The petitioners have approached this Court by

way of public interest litigation on account of alleged

nuisance caused by respondent No.7 by installing and

running heavy machinery for spinning silk thread even

after issuance     of order dated 02.08.2014      of the

Karnataka State Pollution Control Board.          It was

submitted   that    respondent   No.7   was   under   the

direction, by virtue of the order dated 02.08.2014, to

stop forthwith the operation of spinning and machines

for making roll of silk thread and the Managing Director

of BESCOM, Bangalore was simultaneously directed to

stop power supply to the industry of respondent No.7.

Similarly, Senior Health Officer of BBMP was directed to

cancel the licence issued to respondent No.7 and

Deputy Commissioner of Bangalore Urban was required

to seize the machinery of the industry.       None of the

authorities took any of the necessary actions according

to the petitioners and hence notices were issued to the

respondents herein.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 5</span><p id="p_3">



</p><p id="p_4">2.      Now, learned counsel for respondent No.7 has

stated on instructions that their industry and work-

shop have been temporarily closed.            It is stated on

behalf of the Managing Director of BESCOM that power

supply has at least now been stopped and learned

counsel for BBMP submitted that the licence of

respondent No.7 is now cancelled.             In view of the

provisions of Section 31-A, Section 37 and <a href="/doc/506633/" id="a_1">Section 40</a> of

The Air(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981

(for short, "the Act") prima-facie non-compliance of the

order dated 02.08.2014 of the State Pollution Control

Board amounted to violation of relevant provisions and

amounted      to     serious    offence     punishable   with

imprisonment for a term which may not be less than

one year and six months. The Pollution Control Board

also appears to have failed in either enforcing its own

order or filing criminal complaint. It is now stated by

learned counsel Mr.Gururaj Joshi appearing for the

State    Pollution    Control       Board   that   appropriate

complaint shall be filed in respect of violation of and/or

non-compliance of the order dated 02.08.2014 in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                           6</span>


Court of competent jurisdiction within a period of one

week and a copy of such complaint shall be filed in the

Registry of this Court to be placed on record of the

petition.

recorded, the petition is not pressed for any further

orders. Accordingly, it is disposed with no order as to

cost.
