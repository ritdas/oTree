<div class="doc_title">Mohammed Iqbal vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 February, 2011</div><pre id="pre_1">                                    1




                        Writ Petition No.1510/2011
           (Mohammed Iqbal Vs. The State of M.P. &amp; another)
03.02.2011
       Shri Ashok Agarwal, learned counsel for the petitioner.
       Shri Naman Nagrath, learned Additional Advocate General for the
respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">       Heard on the question of admission.
</p><p id="p_2">       In the instant petition filed as Public Interest Litigation, the
petitioner has challenged the excise policy/arrangement for the year
2011-12, whereby the State Government has modified the previous years
arrangement and has adopted a new eligibility criterion of taking into
consideration 80% production capacity mentioned in the D/1 distillery
licence or two crores proof liters, whichever is lower for considering the
tender for granting licence to supply spirit from bonded warehouses to
retail sale contractors.
</p><p id="p_3">       Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that under the new
excise policy the State Government by fixing 80% of the manufacturing
capacity of any distillery of the State within the maximum limit provided
therein is bound to violate the limit allowed by the M.P. Pollution Control
Board in NOC/permission and thus it would violate the provisions
contained in <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">section 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_2">26</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_4">section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p><p id="p_4">       On the other hand, learned Additional Advocate General
submitted that under rule 3(7)(iii) of the M.P. Distilleries Rules, 1995,
(for short 'the 1995 Rules') a distiller is required to submit NOC from the
M.P. Pollution Control Board which is renewed every year for setting up
of a distillery and only thereafter licence is issued as in form D-1 by the
State subject to due observations of the Act/Rules and the conditions of
licence. It is submitted that under rule 4(6) of the 1995 Rules, every
distiller has to obtain consent under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2</span>




Act, 1981, after making necessary arrangement for air and water effluents
treatment from the M.P. Pollution Control Board which regularly
inspects the distilleries and monitors the treatment of industrial wastes
and effluents.
</p><p id="p_5">       Learned Additional Advocate General for the State further
submitted that every manufacturer/distiller is required in law to limit his
production only upto the capacity permitted by the Pollution Control
Board and for which it has given its NOC irrespective of the actual
installed/production capacity mentioned in the D/1 licence of a
particular unit meaning thereby that even if a distiller may have a higher
production capacity but he shall be allowed production only upto the
limit which has been fixed or approved by the Pollution Control Board.
Therefore, it is submitted that the apprehension of the petitioner that the
impugned change in the policy shall permit the distilleries to violate
pollution norms and exceed the production beyond the limit mentioned
in the NOC given by the pollution authorities is ill founded as the policy
will not effect the environment or in any way violate the pollution norms.
</p><p id="p_6">       In paragraph 10 of the preliminary objection it has been
categorically stated that after filing of the writ petition the Excise
Commissioner vide his letter dated 25.1.2011 has clarified that the
production capacity as mentioned inD-1 licence issued by the Excise
Department is and shall be subject to the production allowed by the M.P.
Pollution Control Board in its NOC. A copy of the letter is also enclosed
as annexure R/1.
</p><p id="p_7">       Therefore, the apprehension of the petitioner that the new policy
has given a complete go-bye to the production limit approved by the M.P.
Pollution Control Board in the consent letter/NOC issued to the distillers
is misconceived and cannot be accepted in view of the categorical
statement made on behalf of the respondent State and also in view of the
letter of the Excise Commissioner dated 25.11.2011.
</p><p id="p_8">       It has further been alleged in the writ petition that for the first
time in the State of M.P. the country spirit shall be bottled in PET (Plastic
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>




Empty Bottle) of 750 ml., 350 ml. and 180 ml. capacity which would not
only be unhygienic but also would be hazardous to the environment. The
respondents in their preliminary objection regarding maintainability of
the petition has averred that though the petitioner has raised this
technical and scientific issue but no material whatsoever has been given
in support of the submissions. It has further been averred that the Excise
Commissioner vide its order dated 25.1.2011, a copy whereof is enclosed
as annexure R/3, has stated that the specification of bottles mentioned in
the aforesaid letter of the Excise Commissioner confirms to IS-14537
fixed by the Bureau of Indian Standards for Packaging of Alcoholic
Liquors for PET bottles and it is thus contended by the learned
Additional Advocate General that the specification of bottles being as per
BIS specification, the petitioner cannot question the same without there
being any basis or material in support thereof.
</p><p id="p_9">         The learned Additional Advocate General further submitted that
the petitioner not being engaged in the liquor business is neither a trader
nor a manufacturer of liquor and therefore cannot challenge the policy on
the ground that the same is violative of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_7">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the
Constitution and thus this Public Interest Litigation being a sponsored
petition at the behest of some-one deserves to be dismissed as none of his
fundamental rights are infringed or violated giving cause to approach this
Court.
</p><p id="p_10">         Learned counsel for the petitioner during the course of
submissions confined his submissions only in respect of the criteria
fixing the manufacturing capacity of distillers and in fact has not urged
other points, though raised in the writ petition, therefore, we need not to
address the same. He, however, further submitted that in view of the
statement of learned Additional Advocate General and the affidavit filed
on behalf of the State Government, this petition may be disposed of by
recording the same.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                               4</span>




<p id="p_11">                Besides that we are of the view that the scope of judicial review in
         the matter of policy decision being limited and permissible only to cases
         where it is found to be capricious, arbitrary or against the statutory
         provisions   or   suffers   from   the   vice   of   discrimination   or   is
         unconstitutional, which is not the case here, no interference is warranted
         in this petition filed as Public Interest Litigation. Reference is made to
         the apex court decision in Delhi Development Authority N.D. and
         another Vs. Joint Action Committee, Allottee of SFS Flats and
         others, AIR 2008 SC 1343.
</p><p id="p_12">                In view of the above discussion and also as agreed to by the
         learned counsel for the parties, this petition is disposed of in terms of the
         statements and affidavit given on behalf of the State Government.
