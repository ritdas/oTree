JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON)


          Miscellaneous Application No.708 of 2013 has been filed

by the M.P. State Mining Corporation Ltd., Government of Madhya

Pradesh, praying for intervention and for being heard in Misc.

Application No.685 of 2013 filed by the Department of Mineral

Resources, Government of Madhya Pradesh. This Corporation was

permitted to intervene and was heard by the Tribunal at length

during the course of hearing of MA No.685 of 2013. This application

stands allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_53">
</p><p id="p_54">2.        In M.A. No.685 of 2013, filed in the Registry of the

Tribunal on 13th August, 2013, the applicant-State of Madhya

Pradesh is praying for modification of the orders of the Tribunal

dated 5th August, 2013 and 6th August, 2013. The applicant-State of

Madhya Pradesh, had challenged these orders before the Supreme

Court in Civil Appeals No.6786 and 6787 of 2013, which were

disposed of by a Bench of the Supreme Court, vide its order dated

16th August, 2013, which reads as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">          "Appeals are admitted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     2.      By order dated 5th August 2013, the National
     Green     Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi, while
     issuing notice in O.A. No. 277 of 2013 (NGT Bar
     Association &amp; Other v. Ministry of Environment &amp;
     Forests and others), passed an interim order restraining
     the partner/Company/Authority to carry out any mining
     activity or remove sand from river beds anywhere in the
     country without obtaining the environmental clearance

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                  7</span>
      from the Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests/SEIAA and
     license from the competent authorities.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     3.     It has been brought to our notice by Mr. Tankha
     learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant-State
     of Madhya Pradesh that under the Madhya Pradesh
     Mines and Minerals Rules, 1956 as amended in
     exercise of powers under sub-Section (i) to <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_1">Section 15</a>
     of the Mines and <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_2">Minerals Development Act</a>, 1957 the
     District Level Environment Committee is an authority
     to give clearance and license for mining minerals
     including sand, for lands less than 5 hectares. He
     submitted that although      Interlocutory Application No.
     685 of 2013 has been moved before the National Green
     Tribunal for modification of the order dated 5th August,
     2013 so as to include the District Level Environmental
     Committee as an authority in addition to MOEF/SEIAA
     to give clearance/licence, no order has been passed in
     the said IA by the Tribunal and as a result the sand
     mining activity in the entire State of Madhya Pradesh
     has come to a standstill and consequently, a lot of
     connected business activities have been adversely

</p><p id="p_57">5.       The case of the applicant in the present application is

that the Supreme Court of India had passed various directions

in relation to mining of minerals and sand in the case of

<a href="/doc/45837297/" id="a_3">Deepak Kumar and Others v. State of Haryana</a> on 27th

February, 2013 [2012(4) SCC 629]. Vide communication dated

16th May, 2011, the State Governments were asked to comply

with the Model Guidelines, 2010 issued by the Ministry of

Environment and Forests (for short the "MoEF") as well as the

draft rules i.e. the     Minor Minerals (Conservation and

Development) Rules, 2010 (for short the "Minor Mineral

Rules"). The State of Madhya Pradesh filed an application for

extension of time for compliance with the directions, as

contained in the order of the Supreme Court, and the same

was permitted. Thereafter, the State of Madhya Pradesh in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                   9</span>
 May, 2013 submitted the compliance report. It is claimed by

the State of Madhya Pradesh that the States of Madhya

Pradesh and Rajasthan are primarily the only States to have

complied with the orders of Supreme Court and enacted the

amended rules. The State of Madhya Pradesh further submits

that it has strictly been monitoring compliance with these rules

and upon detection of any illegal mining activity, appropriate

action is taken against the wrong-doer and also if it is found

that any mining operation is carried out against the mandate

of law including non-compliance with the conditions of

environmental    clearances,      strict   action   is   being   taken

including closing down the operations of the unit and imposing

heavy penalties, as mandated under law. The State of Madhya

Pradesh had detected a total of 3147 cases of illegal extractions

during 2008-2013 and about 27732 illegal vehicles carrying

material extracted through illegal mining have been confiscated

during the said period. An amount of Rs.3867.67 lakhs has

been collected by the State Government as fine and penalty for

illegal sand mining activities.
</p>
<p id="p_58">6.       It was further contended by the applicant herein that

an application has been filed before the Tribunal with regard to

the State of Uttar Pradesh where large scale illegal mining

without prior environmental clearance was being carried out.

The Tribunal had passed the following orders on 5th August,

2013 and 6th August, 2013 and these read as under:

</p><p id="p_59">         5th August, 2013:
</p>
<p id="p_60">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                         10</span>
 "The contention raised before us is that large scale        illegal
and impermissible mining activity is going on, on the bank of
Yamuna, Ganga, Chambal, Gaumti and Revati amongst
others. This removal of minerals from the river beds is causing
serious threat to the flow of the river, forests upon river bank
and most seriously to the environment of these areas. All these
3 aspects are covered under Schedule - I of the National Green
Tribunal Act, 2010 (NGT Act, 2010). It is further contended
that in terms of the Orders of      the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India in the case of Deepak Kumar Vs. State of Haryana, even
the person carrying on mining activity in less than 5 hectares,
are expected to take EIA Clearance from MoEF/SEIAA.
Besides holding the above, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India
clearly stated that sand mining on either side of the rivers,
upstream and in-stream, is one of the causes for
environmental degradation and also a threat to the
biodiversity. The contention is also that majority of persons
carrying out the mining activity of removing mineral from the
river bed have no license to extract sand, they also have not
obtained clearance from MoEF/SEIAA at any stage in terms of
the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 (EP Act, 1986) as well
as Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and
Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) act, 1974. Besides
violations of law, the mining activity is being carried out on a
large scale, causing State revenue loss which may be running
into lakhs of crores of Rupees. For the reasons aforestated, we
find merits in this         Petition which raises substantial
environmental issues and questions arising directly from the
implementation of the EP Act, 1986 and other Acts under
Schedule - I of NGT Act, 2010. Thus, squarely this Petition
falls within the ambit of Section 14 of NGT Act, 2010.
Resultantly, we issue Notice to all the Respondents by
registered post/ acknowledgment due and Dasti as well and
email.     Notice returnable on 14th August, 2013. In the
meantime, we restrain any person, company, authority to
carry out any mining activity or removal of sand, from river
beds     anywhere     in   the     country   without   obtaining
Environmental Clearance from MoEF/SEIAA and               license
from the competent authorities The Deputy Commissioners,
Superintendent of Police and Mining Authorities of all the
States are directed to ensure compliance of these directions."

</p>
<p id="p_66">
</p><p id="p_67">7.        It is the case of the applicant-State that as a result of the

above orders, even legal mining activity which has all the necessary

approvals as per the applicable statutory provisions, is required to

be shut down if it does not have approval of MoEF or State

Environment Impact Assessment Authority (for short 'SEIAA'). The

Environment Clearance (EC) has to be given by the District Level

Environmental Committee as per the State law and because of the

directions of the Tribunal, the mining activity has been adversely

affected and is causing grave economic and developmental crisis.

The State of Madhya Pradesh has thus, filed an appeal in the

Supreme Court in terms of Section 22 of the NGT Act. In substance,

the case of the applicant-State of Madhya Pradesh is that the State

of Madhya Pradesh, in exercise of its powers conferred by sub-

section (1) of <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_6">Section 15</a> of the Mines and Mineral (Development &amp;

<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_7">Regulation)   Act</a>,   1957    (for   short    the   "Act   of   1957"),

amended/added/substituted Rules 42 to 49 and 68, inter alia, of

the Madhya Pradesh Minor Mineral Rules, 1996 vide Notification

dated 23rd March, 2013 and incorporated the report of the Group

dated March, 2010 constituted by MoEF titled "Environmental

Aspects of Quarrying of Minor Minerals - Evolving of Model

Guidelines" and the draft Minor Minerals Rules issued by the

MoEF. As per the amendment dated 23rd March, 2013, under Rule

18(2) of the Madhya Pradesh Minor Minerals Rules, 1996, the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                     12</span>
 applicant would be required to submit environmental permission in

terms of the Notification dated 14th September, 2006 of MoEF

within six months only for the grant of quarry lease by the

sanctioning authority for an area of more than five hectares. As per

notification dated 23rd March, 2013, under <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_8">Section 15(1)</a> of the Act

of 1957, under the amended Rule 49 of the Madhya Pradesh Minor

Mineral Rules, a District Level Environmental Committee has been

constituted which can grant or refuse environment management

plan of quarry lease and trade quarry under Rules 49 and 50 of the

amended Madhya Pradesh Minor Mineral Rules and mandatory

measures are required to be adopted for protection of environment.

Thus, it is    contended   that the    District Level Environment

Committee is competent to give environmental clearance for

carrying on of mining activity in areas less than five hectares and

therefore, the order should be modified to include the District Level

Environment Committee in addition to MoEF and SEIAA as

competent authorities to grant EC. This is precisely the prayer of

the applicant-State of Madhya Pradesh in this application. The

application has been opposed on behalf of MoEF as well as some

other parties. Having heard the learned counsel of the parties, we

are of the considered view that the following questions of law need

to be answered by the Tribunal:
</p>
<p id="p_68">
</p><p id="p_69">     Whether in face of the Notification of 2006 and the law of the

land, stated in the Deepak's Kumar's case (supra), the State

Government was competent in enacting a law in constituting and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                   13</span>
 empowering District Level Environmental Committee to grant EC for

carrying on mining of minerals and sand in less than 5 ha. of area?


</p><p id="p_70">8.          To answer this question, we must examine the legislative

scheme behind both the Environmental (Protection) Act 1986 (for

short the 'Act of 1986') and the Act of 1957.


</p><p id="p_71">9.          <a href="/doc/1814464/" id="a_9">The Act</a> of 1986 was enacted to provide for protection and

improvement of environment and for matters connected therewith.

The decisions that were taken at the United Nation's Conference on

the Human Environment held at Stockholm in June 1972, in which

India was a participant country, required the countries to take

appropriate steps for protection and improvement of Human

Environment. <a href="/doc/1814464/" id="a_10">The Act</a> of 1986 specifically states in its objects and

reasons that although there are existing laws dealing directly or

indirectly with several environmental matters, it is necessary to

have a general legislation for environmental protection.       Existing

laws generally focus on specific types of pollution or specific

categories of hazardous substances. However, some major areas of

environmental hazards are still not covered and there also exist

uncovered lacunae in the areas of major environmental hazards.

There are inadequate linkages in handling matters of industrial and

environmental safety. Control mechanisms to guard against slow

insidious   build-up   of   hazardous   substances,     especially   new

chemicals in the environment are weak.     Therefore,        due      to

multiplicity of regulatory agencies, there was a need for an

authority which could assume the lead role for studying, planning

and implementing long term requirements of environmental safety

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                      14</span>
 and give a direction to, and co-ordinate a system of speedy and

adequate    response   to   emergency    situations   threatening   the

environment.
</p>
<p id="p_72">
</p><p id="p_73">10.         Thus, in view of the above situation/scenario and the

urgency manifested in the same, enactment of a general legislation

on environmental protection was pertinent which inter alia, enabled

co-ordination of activities of the various regulatory agencies,

creation of an authority or authorities with adequate powers for

environmental protection, regulation of discharge of environmental

pollutants and handling of hazardous substances and provided for

deterrent    punishment     to   those   who    endangered     human

environment, safety and health. And consequently came into being

the Act of 1986. It is thus clear that this was the law enacted with

the intent and object of regulating the environment and all its fields

and was to be the paramount law in relation to the environment.

Such legislative intention is further demonstrated under the

provisions of <a href="/doc/49647/" id="a_11">Section 5</a> of the Act of 1986 which uses a non-

obstante clause and commands that the directions issued by the

Central Government would take prevalence over the law in force. In

exercise of powers conferred under <a href="/doc/365695/" id="a_12">Sections 6</a> and <a href="/doc/549158/" id="a_13">25</a> of the Act of

1986, the Central Government framed the rules namely, the

Environmental Protection Rules 1986 (for short the "Rules of

1986").     These rules were framed primarily to carry out the

purposes of the Act of 1986.     Further, in exercise of the powers

vested in terms of Rule 5 (3)(d) of the Rules of 1986 read with Sub-

section (1) and clause (v) of sub-Section 2 of Section 3 of the Act of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                     15</span>
 1986 and in supersession of its earlier Notifications, the Central

Government framed regulations being Environmental Clearance

Regulations, 2006 (for short the "Notification of 2006") dealing with

the various facets of controlling and preventing the environmental

pollution.    Inter-alia, one of the most significant features of the

Notification of 2006 was that the various industries listed in the

Schedule to the Notification had to seek prior environmental

clearance from the regulating authorities, which under Regulation 8

then were required to consider the recommendations of the EAC or

SEAC and convey its decision on the application of an applicant for

grant and/or refusal of environmental clearance for a project which

falls under any of the entries stated in the Schedule to the

Notification of 2006 and the regulations 2 and 7 of the Notification

of 2006.      Thus the central law provided as to the specific

requirement of an applicant to obtain environmental clearance for

carrying on an activity or project of the specified kind. Entry 1 (a)

of this Schedule of Regulations of 2006 deals with mining of minor

or major minerals. The said entry reads as under:</p><pre id="pre_2">

comply with the restrictions of environmental laws were adopting

unfair methods for carrying on the activities of extraction of minor

minerals, particularly sand. Such applicants used to carry out this

activity in various separate, yet adjacent blocks of less than 5

hectares thus eventually totalling upto a much larger area than 5

ha. This was being done to carry on mining activity on a large scale

but by getting licence/lease deeds executed for the areas less than

5 hectares. Thus, while they were complying with the provisions of

the Act of 1957, they were patently violating the provisions of the

Act of 1986 and the Notification of 2006.           This resulted in

intervention by the highest court of the land in the case of Deepak

Kumar (supra), wherein the Supreme Court, by a detailed judgment,

put a check on continuation of such unfair and unjust practices.

This practice was not only environmentally injurious but was even

causing financial loss to the States concerned or the Centre. The

circumventing of the law by unfair traders.            Now, any person

wanting to carry on the activities of mining in respect of non-coal

mines irrespective of the area of the mining lease was required to

was enacted to provide for regulation of mines and development of

minerals under the control of the Union.       <a href="/doc/276791/" id="a_17">Section 2</a> of this Act

declared that it was expedient in the public interest that the Union

should take control and provide for regulation of mines and

development of minerals to the extent it was stated in the Act.

Minerals included all minerals except mineral oil in terms of <a href="/doc/615740/" id="a_18">Section

3(a)</a> of the Act of 1957. Mining lease means a lease granted for the

purposes of undertaking mining operation and includes a sub lease

granted for such purpose. <a href="/doc/615740/" id="a_19">Section 3(d)</a> of the Act of 1957 defines

mining operation to be any operation undertaken for the purposes

of winning of minerals. Under the provisions of this Act of 1957, no

person shall undertake any prospecting of mining operations in any

area except in accordance with the terms and conditions of a

prospecting licence or a mining lease granted under this Act as well

as subject to the Rules framed thereunder, as the case may be. The

mining lease, terms &amp; conditions of its continuation and for

termination purposes for which such licence could be granted, the

royalty payable in that regard and the manner in which application

for grant of such licence lease is to be moved and processed.

Importantly, <a href="/doc/285376/" id="a_20">Section 13</a> empowers the Central Government to make

Rules in respect of minerals, which may relate to any of the

subjects stated in Sub-<a href="/doc/276791/" id="a_21">sections 2</a> (a) to 2 (r) of <a href="/doc/285376/" id="a_22">Section 13</a> of the Act

of 1957. The Rules so framed must relate to the subjects stated in

that Section. A cumulative reading of these provisions shows that

the Rules could primarily relate to the regulations of mines, grant or

termination of licence/lease, payment of fee and the period within

which such applications need to be dealt with. Under <a href="/doc/116114/" id="a_23">Section 17</a> of

and keeping in view the Constitutional provisions, specifically

provided for a window of subordinate legislation.        But for such

statutory delegation, the State might not have been able to frame

Rules in face of the restrictive Entry contained under Entry 23 of

List II. The power to frame Rules has to be regulated within the

statutorily prescribed limitations. The State Government would not

be able to frame Rules with the aid of <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_29">Section 15</a> of the Act of 1957

</p><p id="p_92">19.           Prior to 1972, there was no specific provision in the Act

of 1957 specifically dealing with environment. It was by amending

the Act of 1957, that <a href="/doc/1195854/" id="a_30">Section 4(A)</a> was introduced in it. As already

noticed, <a href="/doc/1195854/" id="a_31">Section 4</a> of the Act of 1957 had placed a restriction that

no such activity could be carried on without licence or lease of

mining and <a href="/doc/1195854/" id="a_32">Section 4(A)</a> of the Act of 1957 even provided for

premature termination of the licence or mining lease. The reason

for such premature termination, inter alia, could be for preservation

of natural environment control of floods, prevention of pollution or

to avoid danger to public health, etc. <a href="/doc/313583/" id="a_33">Section 18</a> of the Act of 1957

was also amended to take note that duty of the Central Government

for conservation and systematic development of minerals was also

coupled with the steps to be taken for protection of environment or

control of any pollution which may be caused by prospecting or

mining operations. For the first time, these provisions indicated the

legislative    concern   for   environment   making   preservation   of

environment and controlling pollution important considerations

 while granting mining lease or licence and terminating the same.

Despite these amendments, the provisions of <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_34">Section 15</a> of the Act

remained static and were not amended.            In furtherance to the

powers vested in State Government under <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_35">Section 15</a> of the 1957

Act, the State of Madhya Pradesh enacted the MP Minor Mineral

Rules 1996. These Rules provided for the matters specified under

<a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_36">Section 15</a> and the matters connected thereto.             These Rules, in

their original form, did not deal with the concept of environmental

clearance in relation to carrying on of mining activity under a

licence or lease.

enactments, it is clear that when the legislature enacted the Act of

1986, it was fully conscious and aware of the existing enactments,

i.e. the Act of 1957 and other prevalent laws. Despite existing laws,

the legislature in its wisdom, did not opt to amend the Act of 1957

or any other existing law in relation to mining of minor minerals,

and in fact, proceeded to enact the Act of 1986. The Rules of 1986

and the Notification of 2006 provided for specific environmental

concerns and aimed at controlling environmental pollution while

permitting the carrying on of mining activity and made it mandatory

for the person carrying on mining activity to obtain environmental

clearance from either of the authorities i.e. MoEF and SEIAA

depending upon the category the particular project fell in. It is a

settled cannon of statutory interpretation that legislature while

enacting new laws is presumed to be aware of all existing laws and

the legislative intent behind their enactment. Once the legislative

must give full implementation to the law. The clear intention of the

      account the macro effect of such wide-scale land and
      environmental degradation caused by absence of remedial
      measures (including rehabilitation plan). Time has now come,
      therefore, to suspend mining in the Aravalli hill range till

 case of Deepak Kumar (supra), wherein the Court specifically held

that lease in relation to mining of minor minerals even in regard to

areas less than 5 hectares, should be granted by the State only

after getting clearance from MoEF.         In paragraph 22 of this

judgment, the Supreme Court noticed the instructions issued by

MoEF in the form of recommendations for their incorporation in the

Rules framed under <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_38">Section 15</a> of the Act of 1957.            All these

instructions/ recommendations primarily related to the size of the

mining lease and the requirements for carrying the mining activity,

however, environmental issues were also touched upon in that

paragraph. These model Rules of 2010 were considered vital by the

Supreme Court from environmental, ecological and biological points

of view. All these recommendations were stated to be relevant for

the purposes of framing Rules under <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_39">Section 15</a> of the 1957 Act and

to achieve the objective of that Act. Despite all these directions, the

Supreme Court culled out a specific order in relation to obtaining

environmental clearance for such projects in paragraph 29 of the

judgment. It may be useful to notice here that the Model Rules of

2010 did not deal with the grant of environmental clearance.

However, it did contemplate preparation of a regional environmental

assessment and regional environmental management plan for the

purposes of environmental clearance. These Rules also specifically

provided for restoration, reclamation and rehabilitation in clusters.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                                     28</span>
 as the Act of 1986. In furtherance to the powers conferred by the

latter enactment, the Notification of 2006 came into existence. All

these are statutory documents and have to be given complete and

full effect to. The extraction of minor minerals, like that of major

minerals, can invite rigours of environmental law. The Supreme

Court in the case of Deepak Kumar (supra), while noticing that

quarrying of river sand is an important economic activity in the

country with river sand forming a crucial raw material for the

infrastructure development and for the construction industry;

excessive instream sand and gravel mining causes degradation of

rivers. It lowers the stream bottom of rivers which may lead to bank

erosion. Having noticed this aspect, the Court in para 20 of this

judgment observed, with regard to the report submitted before it,

that the report clearly indicated, that operation of mining of minor

minerals needed to be subjected to strict regulatory parameters as

that of mining of major minerals. The Court even suggested at

expanding the definition of 'minor minerals'. In the current times,

the minor mineral extraction activity has to be regulated to ensure

that no degradation of environment is caused. This squarely means

that the environmental laws are to be applied with all their rigours

by the authorities stated under the provisions of the Act of   1986.

The provisions of the Act of 1986, and the Notification of 2006 along

with the judgment of the Supreme Court, clearly mandate that all

activity of mining of minerals (sand) irrespective of the area would

require environmental clearance from MoEF / SEIAA prior to

operating the mining activity. <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_40">Section 15</a> of the Act of 1957, as


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                                                   29</span>
 already discussed at some length, gives limited power to the State

Government to frame rules for regulating grant of lease or licence

for quarrying of mines or minerals in respect of minor minerals. It

will be difficult to give a liberal or wider meaning to the language of

<a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_41">Section 15</a> of the Act of 1957 on the principle of plain

interpretation. It is particularly so in face of the specific legislations

on the subject of environment i.e. the Act of 1986, the Rules of

1986 and the Notification of 2006. The Union Parliament is

competent to legislate and has so enacted these laws. It is only by

virtue of delegated legislation under <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_42">Section 15</a> of the Act of 1957

that the State Government can frame rules, which thus, must be

construed strictly and subject to the provisions of the Section. The

competence of the State legislature to regulate mining activity in

terms of Entry 23 of List II is subject to the law enacted by the

Parliament under entry 54 of List I. Thus, in no way can the State

enact a law which would be in conflict with or would change the

very course of the law laid down by the Centre. This conflict

between the provisions of the amended rules of 2013 and the

Notification of 2006 may lead to the very fundamental attack as to

the legislative competence of the provisions.


</p><p id="p_100">24.        The   Supreme     Court's   direction   for   preparation    of

environmental plans has to be construed as a plan which would be

in consonance with the existing law. Such plan cannot run contra

to or be in conflict with the Central law. The contention of the State

that in view of Rules 42 to 49 and 68 of the Rules of 2013, the

environmental clearance would be granted by the District Level

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                                                        30</span>
 Committee is unsustainable. The environmental clearance under

the Central law can only be granted by the MoEF or SEIAA,

depending upon the category of the project that comes up for

consideration of these authorities. The State is vested with no power

to change the system with regard to the grant of environmental

clearance under law. The consideration and grant of environmental

clearance is statutorily regulated by the Notification of 2006. The

State Government would not be competent to alter or completely

give a go-by to the said statutory procedure and methodology and

assume    to   itself   any   authority   appointed    by      it    to   grant

environmental clearance. The environmental clearance has to be

granted by the authority specified under the Central law.


</p><p id="p_101">25.       We may also notice that Rules 42 to 49 and 68 are

intended to and have to be construed so as to make the authorities

responsible for granting lease or licence for mining, aware of the

environmental facets. An applicant is to make the mining plan with

complete information in regard to its impact on the environment as

required under these rules and the District Level Environment

Committee so constituted is subsequently to grant lease or licence

in accordance with these rules. These rules are incapable of any

other   interpretation.   By    amending     these    rules,        the   State

Government could not be permitted to entirely wipe out the impact,

effect and procedure prescribed under the Central law. The District

Level Environmental Committee has to perform its functions under

the Act of 1957 and the rules. Neither the Act of 1957 nor the rules

framed by the State vest any power in the State Government with

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                                             31</span>
 regard to environmental clearance. Thus, the appropriate way to

read and interpret these Sections would be that such powers are to

be exercised in relation to environment but primarily for the

purposes of granting or refusing mining leases or licences.


</p><p id="p_102">26.       Another contention raised on behalf of the State of

Madhya Pradesh is that grant of environmental clearance by MoEF

or SEIAA, as the case may be, is causing serious stagnation in the

way of granting of permission, lease or licence for carrying on the

activity of mining of minor minerals in the State. This is resulting in

financial loss. Firstly, it is affecting the economy of the State and

secondly, it is hampering the developmental projects.


</p><p id="p_103">27.       Before we dwell upon this issue, we must notice that the

observation of the Supreme Court requiring stringent regulation of

mining of minerals is fully justified even by the facts disclosed by

the State in its application. There have been a large number of

cases of illegal mining in the State and huge amounts have to be

recovered on account of penalty, charges etc. This itself shows that

by the grant of mining leases/licences under its regulations, there

has been huge illegal mining with great revenue loss to the State.

The argument advanced by the State is self-destructive. Stringent

regulation of mining of minerals is required. Due care, caution and

prevention should be taken to ensure that no degradation of

environment takes place. The objection that there being stagnation

as well as delay in grant of EC is a mere administrative issue.

Inconvenience is normally never a ground for changing the

interpretation of law or reading words into a statute. The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                                                     32</span>
 administrative difficulty can be resolved by MoEF in consultation

with the State by creating larger number of committees (SEIAA) at

the State level to ensure that applications for environmental

clearance for mining of minerals are dealt with expeditiously and no

stagnation on any front takes place as a result thereof.


</p><p id="p_104">28.       In   view   of   the   above   discussion,    particularly   the

judgment of the Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case (supra)

and the notification of 2013, we find no merits in this application.

The same is dismissed in the facts and circumstances of the case.

However, we leave the parties to bear their own costs.
