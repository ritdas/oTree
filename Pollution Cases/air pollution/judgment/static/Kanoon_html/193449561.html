</pre><p id="p_1">     1. The case in hand being O.A. No. 16/2014, was originally filed as a Public

         Interest Litigation/Writ Petition bearing No. 7988/2005 before the Hon'ble

         High Court of Rajasthan at Jaipur Bench by the four Applicants with the

         prayer that the record pertaining to allotment and grant of mining leases to

         Respondent Nos. 7 &amp; 8 in Khasra Nos. 155, 157 and 207/1 situated at village

         Hasampur, Tehsil Neem-Ka-Thana, District Sikar, Rajasthan be re-examined

         on the ground that the land in the aforesaid Khasra Nos. comprises pasture

         land and is a part of the Aravali Range and therefore the mining leases

         granted to them be revoked.

Original Application No. 16/2014
          submitted their reply more particularly the Respondent Nos. 2 to 5 and the

         Respondent No. 6/SPCB filed separate replies. The Respondent Nos. 7 &amp; 8

         also submitted their replies to the petition. While the petition was pending

         before the Hon'ble High Court, the Hon'ble High Court vide its order dated

         21st October, 2013 directed transfer of the petition to the NGT, Central Zone

         Bench, Bhopal. After receipt of the case file from the Hon'ble High Court,

         notices were issued to the parties vide order dated 7 th April, 2014. The

         parties put in their appearance before this Tribunal on 11th March, 2014.

         After hearing the parties, the Tribunal thought it proper to direct the

         Respondent No. 6 and the Respondent Nos. 2 to 5 to submit the present

         position as the replies had been filed much earlier before the Hon'ble High

         Court in the year 2006 and to indicate as to what is the present position with

         regard to the mines and the mining operations and compliance of the

         conditions of the 'Consent to Operate' etc.

</p><p id="p_3">    3. In pursuance of our order, learned counsel for the State Pollution Control

         Board submitted an affidavit on 31st March, 2014 and brought out the

         following facts with regard to the three mining leases i.e. ML Nos.

         200/2004, 201/2004 and 250/2004. It was submitted that the inspection of

         the aforesaid mines was carried out and after noting down the observations

         with regard to the compliance of the condition of the 'Consent to Operate'

         and the mining leases as well as the observance of the provisions of the Air

         (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, the officials of the State

         Pollution Control Board had issued show-cause notices to the lessee of ML

         No. 200/2004 with a copy of the inspection report dated 19th March, 2004.

         Likewise, in the case of ML No. 201/2004 the inspection was carried out and

         it was found that the 'Consent to Operate' was valid upto 31st March, 2014

         though the mining lease was valid upto 12th January, 2025.          Since the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                      3</span>
Original Application No. 16/2014
          conditions of the 'Consent to Operate' were not being observed, a show-

         cause notice has been issued to the lessee of ML 201/2004. Copies of the

         inspection report dated 19th March, 2014 as well as the show-cause notice

         were filed along with the said affidavit. In the case of ML No. 250/2004

         inspection was carried out on 19th March, 2014 and the 'Consent to Operate'

         was found to be valid upto 30th April, 2015 but several instances of non-

         compliance of the consent were found to be not being observed and

         accordingly a show-cause notice was issued on 25th March, 2014 for

         revocation of the 'Consent to Operate' under the provisions of <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_2">Section 31(A)</a>

         of the Air Act, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_4">    4. The matter was heard on 22nd April, 2014 after the notice period expired on

         10th April, 2014 and it was directed that in case the deficiencies as pointed

         out in the show cause notice have not been removed, the mining activities of

         all the three mining leases shall not be permitted.
</p>
<p id="p_5">    5. Today, during the course of hearing, learned counsel for the State Pollution

         Control Board Shri Sandeep Singh submitted that on account of non-

         compliance and non-fulfilment of the conditions of the 'Consent to Operate'

         so far as all the aforesaid three mines are concerned, the said mines have

         been ordered to be closed by the State Pollution Control Board authorities

         till such time the conditions of the 'Consent to Operate' are fully complied

         with fully as directed by this Court on 22nd April, 2014.

</p><p id="p_6">    6. We may point out here that the original lessee of ML No. 200/2004 and ML

         No. 201/2004 Subhash Pradhan Respondent No. 7 herein, has transferred his

         ML No. 200/2004 to one, Shri Bhoop Singh Gurjar and ML No. 201/2004 to

         one, Shri Rajesh Kumar. Shri Bhoop Singh is in possession of mining lease

         since 2004. Likewise, Respondent No.8/Anuradha Sharma has transferred

         the ML No. 250/2004 to one, Shri Balwan Singh. As far as mining lease

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                                     4</span>
Original Application No. 16/2014
          No. 201/2004, presently in possession of the transferee, Shri Rajesh Kumar,

         has since been revoked on account of non-observance of the conditions of

         the 'Consent to Operate' by the State Pollution Control Board as the

         conditions of the consent have not been fulfilled by both these lease-holders.

         Shri Bhoop Singh who is in possession on ML No. 200/2004 after its

         transfer, has sought fresh renewal of his consent though as per the learned

         counsel for the SPCB his 'Consent to Operate' also stands revoked as he

         failed to comply with the shortcomings as pointed out and the SPCB has

         already expressed its intention of denial to renew the 'Consent to Operate'

         on account of the aforesaid reasons. Thus, so far as all the three mining

         leases for which the complaint was raised in the present petition by the

         Applicant, the present status remains that all of them have been closed on

         account of non-observance of the conditions of the 'Consent to Operate'

         granted by the State Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_7">    7. In the petition the Applicant has firstly raised the issue that all the aforesaid

         three mines granted in Khasra Nos. 155, 157 and 207/1, village Hasampur,

         Tehsil Neem-Ka-Thana, District Sikar, Rajasthan, are located in Charagah

         land (Pasture land) and therefore the contention of the learned counsel for

         the Applicant is that without the consent of the Gram Sabha the same could

         not have been allotted for the aforesaid purpose. He has also relied upon the

         decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Jagpal Singh &amp; Ors

         Vs. State of Punjab &amp; Ors in Civil Writ Petition No. 1131/2011 dated 28th

         January, 2011 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Para No. '15' held as

         follows : -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  "In many states Government orders have been issued by the State
                  Government permitting allotment of Gram Sabha land to private
                  persons and commercial enterprises on payment of some money.
                  In our opinion all such Government orders are illegal, and should
                  ignored".
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                                       5</span>
<p id="p_8">Original Application No. 16/2014
</p><p id="p_9">     8. Learned counsel further submitted that as far as the allotment made to the

         lessees of the mines of Respondent Nos. 7 &amp; 8 is concerned, the same

         should be revoked as the Hon'ble Supreme Court has laid-down an absolute

         bar and embargo on the allotment of Gram Sabha land to the private

         enterprises for commercial purpose.      However, learned counsel for the

         Applicant conceded the fact that in accordance with the rules prevailing in

         the State of Rajasthan, more particularly the allotment rules of 1992 which

         were in force at the time when the allotment of the mining lease was made

         and the order for conversion of the Charagah land was passed by the

         District Collector in the year 2004, the procedure as provided under the rules

         had been observed in as much as the consent of the Gram Sabha had been

         obtained prior to the NOC granted by the District Collector on 9 th

         November, 2004 and the lease was granted accordingly by the Mining

         Department to the Respondent Nos. 7 and 8 on 11th November, 2004.

         However, learned counsel for the Applicant pointed out that the Gram Sabha

         which met on 21st February, 2005 took a decision to revoke the consent it

         had granted earlier in the year 2004 and therefore the mining leases granted

         to the Respondent Nos. 7 and 8 deserve to be quashed in the light of the

         judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_10">    9. As far as the aforesaid submission is concerned so far as the above factual

         position with regard to the mining leases allowed to be granted by the Gram

         Sabha and in pursuance thereof no objection given by the District Collector,

         the granting of mining leases on 11th November, 2004 i.e. prior to the

         revocation of the decision of the Gram Sabha in February, 2005 is not in

         dispute. In the light of these facts, we may observe that it is not the case of

         the Applicant that the procedure as provided under the law was not followed.

         Under the Rajasthan land revenue laws the competent authority for setting

Original Application No. 16/2014
          apart land for public utility is the District Collector and the District Collector

         is also empowered under the Rules of 1992 framed in this behalf for making

         the allotment subject to the allotment which are provided under the rules and

         that the mining area allotted is only one hectare each to the three lessees i.e.

         in ML Nos. 200/2004, 201/2004 and 250/2004.              As such the aforesaid

         condition has been fully complied with.
</p>
<p id="p_11">    10.The other provisions with regard to obtaining the consent of the Gram Sabha

         etc. has also been taken care of and it is only after the issuance of the NOC

         by the District Collector on 9th November, 2004 that the mining leases were

         granted on 11th November, 2004.            The question with regard to the

         subsequent revocation cannot be taken into account as it is not the case that

         the earlier Gram Sabha tainted with fraud or misrepresentation.

</p><p id="p_12">    11.Be that as it may. The mining lease holders having been granted the lease

         after following the procedure were under a valuable right accrued to them

         for proceeding with the mining operations in accordance with law.

         Therefore, so long as the operations are carried out in accordance with law

         by observing the terms &amp; conditions of the mining lease and terms &amp;

         conditions of the 'Consent to Operate' under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air Act</a>, 1981 they were

         entitled to operate the same.       So soon as the non-observance of the

         conditions were noticed and the SPCB having given show-cause notice

         under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_4">Section 31(A)</a>, of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a>, 1981, in our opinion the SPCB has

         rightly therefore enforced the closure of the mines against all the three lease

         holders. We therefore find no merit in the contention of the Applicant so far

         as it relates to the revocation of consent granted by the Gram Sabha in their

         resolution.

          flow of the rain water into the village pond. So far as this issue is concerned,

         the Respondent No. 2 in their reply have denied the aforesaid facts.

         Therefore, as per the affidavit filed by the State we are inclined to accept the

         reply submitted by the State that there is no obstruction to the flow of water

         into the pond as the mining leases have not been granted in the catchment

         area           of         the   village     pond      and        the      pond

         continues to get rain water and the cattle in the village continue to drink

         water in the pond. We therefore find no merit in the aforesaid contention of

         the Applicant and the same deserves to be quashed.

<p id="p_14">    13.Learned counsel for the Applicant also submitted that in the light of the

         decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 28th January, 2011 in the case of

         Jagpal Singh (supra) the State Government has also issued a Circular on 25th

         April, 2011 for taking note of the points raised in the aforesaid judgment

         with regard to the catchment area of the ponds and reservoirs and the pasture

         lands for being allotted.       He submitted that in the instant case general

         directions may be issued to the State Government for observance of the

         directions issued in its judgment if the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Jagpal

         Singh's case in Para No. 15 thereof and ensure that no part of the catchment

         area / pasture land should be allotted for other than the purpose for which

         they have been set apart without the consent of the Gram Sabha.

</p><p id="p_15">    14.So far as this contention is concerned, since the Government has also taken

         note of the aforesaid judgment and issued the Circular on 25th April, 2011,

         specific instances of any violation of the direction issued by the Hon'ble

         Supreme Court may be brought to the notice of this Tribunal or the

         concerned authority and we expect that the concerned authorities shall take

         note of the same and initiate action after following the procedure prescribed.
