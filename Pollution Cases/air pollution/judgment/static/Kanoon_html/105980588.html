                   Government, the provision applicable would be Section 58 of the Tamil

                   Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971 and the said provision

                   envisages that when any Department of any State Government or local

                   authority intends to carry out development of any land or building, the

                   officer in charge shall inform in writing, the Planning Authority

                   concerned, the intention to do so, giving full particulars thereof

                   accompanied by such plans and documents at least 30 days before

                   upon scrutinizing the proposed developments raised any objection, the

                   Government can make modifications in the proposal for development or

                   issues Planning Clearance and not a Planning Permission as envisaged

                   under <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_4">Section 49</a> of the Act. A plain reading of section 49 would make it

                   Authority to CMDA, the proposal has been examined with reference to the

                   CRZ-II norms which are found in Annexure X to the Development

                   be permitted only on the landward side of the existing roads of existing

                   authorized structures. The Executive Engineer, Public Works Department,

                   has certified that the service road from Marina Beach to Light House

                   situated in between Kamarajar Salai and Marina Beach, is in existence

                   prior to 1991 and it belongs to PWD, but under the maintenance of the

                   cannot be said to be an encroacher on government land itself. The word

                   Encroachment Act, 1905. (Encroachment has been only defined under

                   traffic, as well as pedestrians, and further arch has been erected on the

                   pavement on the highway and therefore, squarely falls within the

                   Paragraph No.2 of the said judgment would reflect that the Hon'ble

                   notification, under the Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001 for construction of

                   an arch. This contention was negatived by the judgment of the Hon'ble

                          up any permanent structure on the State Highway under the control of
                          Highways Department and the Highways Authority has power to grant

                          is 18.70 meters and the said width will be maintained even after the

                          the Confluence of Greek and Latin Architecture inspired by the design
                          cues and intricate patterns of the Fort St. George. When the Arch has
                          been structurally designed without any intermediate pillars in the middle
                          of the road and if the Arch would not affect free flow of traffic or
                          pedestrian movement, it cannot be said that the proposed Arch in Rajaji
                          Salai would be an obstruction or encroachment on a public street. By
                          passing a resolution according permission for construction of Arch, it
                          cannot be said that the Corporation of Chennai has exceeded its
                          jurisdiction. It is also pertinent to note that Writ Petitioner neither
                          impleaded the Corporation of Chennai nor challenged the resolution dated
                          29.10.2012 according permission for construction of Arch."

                   Minister, M.G.Ramachandran, is on the same road and on the same

                   direction. The contention of the petitioner that the provision of Chennai
