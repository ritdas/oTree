                   of the city of Amritsar was being dumped at the Jhabal Road since the

                   place, which also added to the pollution. The petitioner submitted a

                   authorization under the Rules, has been made to the Punjab Pollution

                   Control Board, which is under consideration. It is the stand of the

                   at Gate Bhagtanwala as the land fill. The site is said to be adjoining

                   23.10.2009 has reported that the Consultant of the project as well as

                   the functionaries of the Municipal Corporation have committed

                   serious and grave illegalities and irregularities and that the financial

                   parameters have been thrown to winds so as to extend undue favour

                   to the petitioner. It is pointed out that the bid of the petitioner was

                   and that too without any tenable justification against the sanctioned

                   project costs. It was pointed out that one of the bidders M/s A to Z

                   Infrastructure stated that the consultant of the project appointed by

                   the Municipal Corporation had obtained blank but signed tender

                   document from it by misrepresentation             and that tender form was

                   later on used to project that healthy bidding has taken place. The

                   rates approved in the detailed project report were exorbitant and that

                   the consultant of the project has throughout acted mala-fidely. Even

                   the Deputy Controller (Finance &amp; Accounts), Municipal Corporation,

                   Amritsar, has stated that his signatures on the technical evaluation

                   the exorbitant rates of land in gross violation of the detailed project

                   report. It is also pointed out that since the petitioner-Company, was

                   provided the land for the project at nominal lease rate of Re.1/- sqm.

                   Per year and also suitable financial assistance given, there was no

                   generated from the sale of site for display of advertisement besides the

                   negotiations were avoided and technical evaluation was only a farce.

                   for the petitioner. However, it is intriguing that how such affidavit

                   came to be placed on record when the consultant is not a party to the

                   writ petition nor the consultant has sought permission to become a

                   party or even to place on record the affidavit. In the said affidavit the

                   consultant has justified the grant of contract to the petitioner, which

                   prima-facie supports the stand of the State Government that the

                   consultant of the project as well as the functionaries of the Municipal

                   Corporation        has     committed      serious     and   grave     illegalities    and

                   contract is for the reason that the contract has been terminated

                   without granting any opportunity of hearing and thus, the action

                   violates the principles of natural justice. It is also alleged that the

                   stand of the Corporation that the petitioner requires clearance from

                   the Pollution Control Board in terms of the Rules is misconceived in

                   view of the judgment of this Court dated 17.3.2009 rendered in CWP

                   No.8504 of 2003 (Annexure P.2). In the said case, the disposal of the

                   Municipal solid waste of Rohtak Municipality on a land measuring 20

                   bighas and 19 biswas acquired in 1975 for dumping of the Municipal

                   waste was in question.
</p>
<p id="p_30">                   17.         The sole reliance of the petitioner on the question whether the

                   Municipal Corporation and/or the Contractor requires authorisation

                   in terms of Rule 4(2) of the Rules for its land fill facility at

                   Bhagtanwala is based upon an order dated 17.3.2009 passed in CWP

                   No. 8504 of 2003 by the Division Bench of this Court (of which one of

                   us Hemant Gupta J.), was a member. The marked distinction between

                   the two cases is that the acquisition of the land for dumping the

                   Municipal waste in the aforesaid case was completed in the year 1975

                   and at that time the site was outside the Municipal limits of Rohtak.

                   The site came to be within the Municipal limits only in the year 1990.

                   The writ petitioner had purchased 25 acres of land at a short distance

                   from the dumping site nearly after 20 years of the use of the dumping

                   site. It was a case of purchaser of land seeking shifting of dumping

                   site. Thus Clause 5 of Schedule-III was interpreted to mean that the

                   landfill sites existing as on the date of framing of the Rules, have only

                   to be improved in accordance with the specifications given in the

                   Schedules and that there is no prohibition for use of an existing

                   landfill site by the Municipal Authorities.

</p><p id="p_31">                   18.         In the present case, firstly, the date from which the site at

                   Bhagtanwala has been put to use, has not come on record. Whether

                   such site was in use for more than five years prior to the

                   promulgation of the Rules to be part of the exception is not made out.

                   Even otherwise, the stand of the Municipal Corporation, as per the

                   status report filed and also in the replies filed in the first writ petition

                   and the second writ petition, is that the authorization from the

                   Pollution Control Board is required. The petitioner was requested to

                   seek approval from the Pollution Control Board to comply with the

                   Rules. However, the petitioner has failed to seek authorization in

                   respect of the solid waste management site at Bhagtanwala. For its

                   inability to seek authorization, the possession of the leased land was

                   also not given. The said fact alone disentitles the petitioner to dispute

                   the cancellation of the contract awarded to it to manage the solid

                   waste of the Municipal Corporation. The Petitioner has failed to

                   comply with the first basic condition to set up the plant that is

                   authorization from the Pollution Control Board. Therefore,              the

                   reliance of the petitioner in the second writ petition       on the order

                   passed in respect of another Municipality, was misconceived and to

                   misdirect not only the Corporation, but also        the Pollution Control

                   Board. Still further, the petitioner as an agent of the Corporation was

                   bound to comply with the direction of the Municipal Corporation to

                   obtain permission from the Pollution Control Board, which in any

                   case, was in the interest of the general public.

                   providing any opportunity of hearing, it is contended that the State or

                   cancellation thereof. In respect of such argument, the learned counsel

                   passed by the High Court relegating the appellant to seek remedy by

                   way of arbitration. The issue raised and decided is not in the context

                   212, the Court observed that the impact of every State action is also

                   on public interest. This factor alone is sufficient to import at least the

                   minimal requirements of public law obligations and impress with this

                   character the contracts made by the State or its instrumentality. It is

                   a different matter that the scope of judicial review in respect of

                   disputes falling within the domain of contractual obligations may be

                   more limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be relegated to

                   adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies provided for

                   adjudication of purely contractual disputes. However, to the extent,

                   challenge is made on the ground of violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_43">Article 14</a> by alleging

                   that the impugned act is arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, the fact

                   that the dispute also falls within the domain of contractual obligations

                   would not relieve the State of its obligation to comply with the basic

                   requirements of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_44">Article 14.</a>            It was further held that an additional

                   and in exercise of such power, the Court can embark an inquiry into

                   the disputed questions of facts as well, but whether such powers

                   should be exercised or not is one of the discretion. The Power of

                   review in a concluded contract is limited and is not all pervasive as in

                   the matter of awarding of contract. The Writ Court in exercise                                 of

                   judicial review can intervene even in respect of concluded contracts if

                   28.5.2010 to set up municipal solid waste management plant. On the

                   same day, the Corporation also served a show cause notice for

                   cancellation of the lease of the land on which such plant was to set up

                   by the Petitioner in the second petition. The possession of the land

                   leased was never given to the Petitioner. The Lease stands cancelled

                   after passing a speaking order. There is no challenge to the said

                   cancellation of lease of the land on which the Solid Waste

                   Management Plant was to be erected. Therefore, the argument that

                   the contract has been terminated without serving any show cause

                   notice is only academic.

<p id="p_63">                   37.         The contract is to set up municipal solid waste management

                   plant, an obligation cast on the Municipal Corporation under a

                   Statute and also part of its functioning to provide clean and hygienic

                   living conditions to the residents within the limits of Municipal

                   Corporation. The first writ petition to seek shifting of dumping ground

                   is pending before this Court since the year 2006. The contract

                   awarded to the Petitioner in the second petition could not take off for

                   the reason that the Petitioner insisted on possession of land without

                   obtaining authorization under the Rules. We have already found that

                   such authorization is mandatory.
</p>
<p id="p_64">                   38.         The right to seek an opportunity of hearing before cancellation

                   of the contract, even when the possession of the land was not

                   delivered and in the absence of challenge to such cancellation,

                   disentitles the petitioner to any indulgence of this court in the matter

                   of alleged breach of contract. For the reasons recorded above, we do

                   not find any merit in the second writ petition (CWP No.12188 of

                   2010), which is hereby dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_65">                   39.         The larger public interest warrants that the Corporation should

                   be directed to award contract to a person who is ready to comply with

                   the terms of the Rules and set up plant without any further delay.
