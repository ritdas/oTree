GURCHARAN SINGH SARAN, PRESIDING JUDICIAL MEMBER

                                ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            Complainant has filed this complaint against the

opposite parties (hereinafter referred as Ops) under <a href="/doc/1749394/" id="a_2">Section 17</a> of

the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short the Act) on the

averments that Op No. 1 i.e. Sherwood Officers Society (Regd.) is

a registered body under <a href="/doc/1694789/" id="a_3">Section 2</a> of the Societies Registration Act,

1860 having its Head Office at Amritsar, which was formed for the

development scheme in the vicinity of the city of Chandigarh at

Sector 113, Mohali and they carried out a wide publicity and

general public was invited in the project for booking of the

residential plots. They were to develop the plots of various sizes

i.e. 200 yards, 250 yards, 300 yards, 400 yards and 500 yards. The

complainant believing the assurance extended by Op No. 1 as a

genuine one applied for membership of the Society by depositing a

sum of Rs. 21,000/- vide cheque No. 906677 dated 3.5.2011 for

the allotment of a plot of 200 sq. yards. On the basis of his

membership, he was allotted to 200 sq. yards plot vide allotment

letter dated 5.6.2011 @ Rs. 13,800/- per sq. yards for a total sale

consideration of Rs. 27,60,000/-. The complainant made the

payment to the tune of Rs. 19,00,000/-. Op No. 1 expressly

assured that the development activities at the site are to start very

soon and that the plots will be made available within the stipulated

period i.e. 1½ years from the date of booking. However, the

assurances given by the Ops were totally false and misleading.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Consumer Complaint No. 227 of 2016                                  3</span>



The factum of getting various approvals from the Government was

found false from the letter of Op no. 1 SOS/2294 dated 20.5.2013

wherein it was clearly stated by the Authorized Signatory that CLU

for the project has been approved by STP letter No. 308-STP (S)-

SS-11 GR dated 3.2.2012. In the year 2014, the complainant was

apprised that MOU dated 15.7.2014 has been signed between Op

No. 1 and M/s RKM Housing Limited (RKM Builder) for handing

over the entire project to Op No. 2, who shall now develop and

deliver the possession. That decision was taken by some founder

member and was imposed upon all the ordinary members leaving

no option except to ratify the said decision in the Annual General

Meeting held on 31.7.2014. Op No. 2 then sent letter requesting

the Members to sign the consent letter on the basis of which fresh

allotment letter shall be issued. The complainant also signed the

consent letter. On the basis of that Op No. 2 vide letter No.

RKM/0217 dated 30.10.2014 issued revised allotment letter and Op

No. 2 also assured to deliver the possession of the said plot within

a period of 20 months from the date of issuance of the letter,

however, both the parties played fraud with the Members as Ops

were not having CLU or layout plan of the project from the GMADA,

therefore, the scheme was launched in violation of the provisions of

PAPRA, 1995. No development has been started at the spot.

Alleging unfair trade practice and deficiency in services on the part

of Ops, complaint has been filed by the complainant against the

Ops for refund of Rs. 19 Lacs alongwith interest @ 24% p.a. from
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Consumer Complaint No. 227 of 2016                                    4</span>



the date of deposit, compensation of Rs. 5 Lacs and litigation

expenses of Rs. 50,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.          Upon notice, Ops filed their written reply. Op No. 1 in its

written reply took the preliminary objections that complaint is not

maintainable in the present form; complainant has not come to the

Commission with clean hands; the complainant has failed to make

the payment on due dates and that the complaint is not

maintainable before this Commission as the complainant has

alleged fraud for which the complaint should be referred to the Civil

Court. On merits, the averments stated in the preliminary

objections were reiterated. However, it is a matter of record that the

complainant applied for membership, which was allowed and he

was allotted plot of 200 square yards for a total cost of Rs.

27,60,000/-, out of which a sum of Rs. 6.90 lacs was to be paid on

the date of booking and amount of Rs. 10.35 Lacs was to be paid

on or before 24.9.2011 and another amount of Rs. 10.35 Lacs was

to be paid on or before 24.1.2012. However, the complainant paid

a sum of Rs. 10 Lacs on 3.5.2011, Rs. 8 Lacs on 6.9.2011. He paid

a sum of Rs. 1 Lac on 20.12.2012 and 3rd installment of Rs. 10

Lacs, which was to be paid on or before 24.1.2012 was not paid.

He also did not pay the EDC/IDC charges. It has been specifically

denied that Op No.1 expressly assured that the activities at the site

will start very soon and that the possession of the flat will be made

within stipulated period of 1½ years from the date of booking i.e.

3.5.2011. It was also denied that the offer given by Op No.1 was

false and mis-leading or that no development activity was carried
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Consumer Complaint No. 227 of 2016                                   5</span>



out at the site. As per Clause 9 of the allotment letter, it was

mentioned that all efforts will be made to hand over the possession

of the flat within a period of 1½ years from the date of booking. This

Op is just a Society and not Colonizer and the work is to be carried

out on the basis of payment made by its Members. Since the

Members failed to make the payment, therefore, CLU from the

GMADA could not be obtained. Society went in loss. Earlier CLU

amount was Rs. 1,29,00,000/- but lateron it was increased to Rs.

2,40,00,000/-. With the consent of Members vide MOU dated

15.7.2014, the project was handed over to Op No. 2 for

development. Therefore, the complaint of the complainant is not

maintainable against this Op. Complainant has also given a

consent to transfer the project to Op No. 2, therefore, no unfair

trade practice or deficiency in service on the part of this Op.

Complaint is without merit, it be dismissed with special costs

against this Op.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.          Op No. 2 in their written reply pleaded that Op No. 1 is

a Society registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_4">Societies Registration Act</a> and that

the complainant was enrolled as a Member with Op No. 1. It was

further stated that the Member, who is admitted/enrolled as

ordinary member was to get his membership renewed after a

period of 2 years. The complainant was admitted as a Member

w.e.f. 3.5.2011 and was bound to get his membership renewed on

or before 3.5.2013, therefore, he is not a Member of Op No.1. The

complainant was told about the MOU between Op No. 1 &amp; Op No.

2 by sending a letter and consequently, the complainant gave his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> Consumer Complaint No. 227 of 2016                                     6</span>



consent letter dated 30.10.2014. Op No. 2 wanted to take up the

matter and to develop the project for which he was to get CLU from

GMADA and other approvals from the concerned Departments for

which huge amount was required. Op No. 2 wrote letter dated

15.5.2016 and 30.6.2016 to the complaint to deposit the

development charges and remaining balance payment but the

complainant did not deposit it. Therefore, there is no unfair trade

practice or deficiency in service on the part of this Op. Complaint is

without merit, it be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.          The parties were allowed to lead their respective

evidence to prove their contentions. Complainant in his evidence

has tendered has tendered his affidavit Ex. C-1 and documents

Exs. C-2 to C-5. On the other hand Op No. 1 had tendered affidavit

of Varinder Singh, Accountant Ex. Op-1/A and documents Exs. Op-

1/2 to Op-1/4.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Miscellaneous Application No. 1749 of 2017

</p><p id="p_6">5.          During the pendency of the complaint opposite party

No.1 moved an application for dismissal of the present complaint

qua opposite party No.1 because opposite party No.1 is the

Society, according to <a href="/doc/1509263/" id="a_5">Section 13</a> of the Societies Registration Act

1860, provided as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "In the event of any dispute arising among the said governing

      body or the members of the society, the adjustment of its

      affairs shall be referred to the principal court of original civil

      jurisdiction of the district in which the chief building of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Consumer Complaint No. 227 of 2016                                      7</span>



         society is situate and the court shall make such order in the

         matter as it shall deem requisite."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">6.             Therefore, this Commission has no jurisdiction to

decide the matter between the society and members. To support

this proposition he has referred the judgment reported in 2009(5)

BCR 201 titled as General Manager, Telecom Vs. M.Krishnan &amp;

Anr., wherein it has been held that Consumer Forum does not

have the jurisdiction as there is a special remedy under <a href="/doc/1471289/" id="a_6">Section 7B</a>

of Telegraph Act regarding disputes in respect of telephone bills.

However, later on the Hon'ble National Commission had circulated

the instructions that under <a href="/doc/76226/" id="a_7">Section 3</a> of the Act an additional

remedy has been provided. Therefore, the Consumer Fora, have

the jurisdiction as held in II (2014) CPJ 38 titled as "GMTD, BSNL,

Shillong       Vs.   KUM.D.Phawa,      Mangpoh".          Moreover,   the

provisions under the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_8">Telegraph Act</a> are entirely different than the

provisions under the <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_9">Cooperative Societies Act</a>, therefore, this

judgment will not apply to the facts of the present case. He has

further referred to the judgment reported in 2013(4) C.P.J. 333

titled    as   Anjana     Abraham      Vs.     Managing    Director   of

Koothattukulam Farmers Service Co-operative Bank Ltd., in

which, there was a dispute between a member and Cooperative

society regarding the settlement of account. In that event, it was

observed that if there is alternative remedy under <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_10">Section 69</a> of the

Act, the complaint was rightly dismissed by the Consumer Fora.

He further referred to a judgment reported in 2015(2) C.P.J. 207,

titled as K.D.Kothiyal Vs. Phool Kaul &amp; Ors. In that case, there
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> Consumer Complaint No. 227 of 2016                                  8</span>



was a dispute between two members of the society. In that context,

it was held that consumer complaint is not maintainable. He has

also referred to a judgment reported in 2016(4) C.P.J. 711 titled as

Rajendra Singh Verma Vs. Committee of Management,

Indraprastha Sahakari Awas Samiti Limited &amp; Anr. It was a

dispute regarding the outstanding amount. The matter was settled

by the arbitrator. In that context, it was held by the Hon'ble Bench

that once the matter is settled by the Arbitrator then the complaint

before the National Commission is barred by principles of res

judicata. He has referred to another judgment reported in 2016(2)

C.P.J. 42 titled as "Hanuman Sahakari Pani Pruvatha Sanstha

Maryadit &amp; Ors. Vs. Ramchandra Bapuso Khade &amp; Ors.". In that

case, there was a dispute between the opposite party and society

regarding loss caused on account of non-supply of water for

irrigation of land.   In that context, it was held by the Hon'ble

National Commission that Consumer Fora has no jurisdiction to

entertain the complaint.        Whereas, learned counsel for the

complainant referred to the judgment of Hon'ble National

Commission reported in 2017(1) CLT        73 titled as "Raj Kumar

Goyal Vs. Malwinder Singh Battu &amp; Ors." In this case, opposite

purchased a land and assured to its members to allot flats but

failed to give possession. In that context, it was held that even if

the issue is to be handled by the Cooperative Department under

cooperative law, jurisdiction of Consumer Fora to deal with these

matters is not barred. In that case, personal liability of the office

bearers of Cooperative Society will also be there. In that case, a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> Consumer Complaint No. 227 of 2016                                       9</span>



Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in III (1996) CPJ 1

(SC) titled as "Fair Air Engineers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. N.K.Modi" was

also relied upon. In another judgment reported in IV(2015) C.P.J.,

Pg.16 titled as H.R. Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. Vandana Sanjay Pandya &amp;

Ors, it was observed that <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_11">Cooperative Societies Act</a> does not oust

the jurisdiction of <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_12">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986.            A specific

provision under <a href="/doc/1202608/" id="a_13">Section 3</a> of the Act has been provided. The same

is reproduced as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "3. Act not in derogation of any other law: The provisions
      of the Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the
      provisions of any other law for the time being in force."

</blockquote><p id="p_8">7.    This Section is in addition to and not in derogation of

provisions under any other Act. Where the Cooperative Society has

assured for the services after taking the amount from its members

then it falls within the ambit of services and where the society is in

default of services then the matter is covered under the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_14">Consumer

Protection Act</a>, 1986 and Consumer Fora have the jurisdiction to

entertain the complaints. Therefore, we do not agree with the plea

raised by the counsel for OP No. 1 that the complaint against Op

No.1 be dismissed. The application is without merit and it is hereby

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">Miscellaneous Application No. 1750 of 2017

</p><p id="p_10">8.           OP No. 1 also moved an application to place on record

the certificate issued by GMADA on 9.3.2012. However, counsel

for the complainant stated that it is clear from this certificate is valid

from 7.12.2010 to 6.12.2015 that period is already over and no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> Consumer Complaint No. 227 of 2016                                  10</span>



certificate has been placed on the record that it has been got

renewed. Therefore, it will not serve the purpose that the Op had

the certificate of Promoter but it expired in the year 2015 and it was

not further got renewed. Therefore, we do not see any merit in the

application and the same is hereby dismissed.

Main Complaint

</p><p id="p_11">9.          It is an admitted fact that Op No. 1 is a Society

registered under the <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_15">Cooperative Societies Act</a>, 1860. The

complainant was enrolled as a Member. Op No. 1 raised the

scheme under the name and style of Sherwood Estates Mohali,

Sector 113, Mohali. On the basis of advertisement given by the Op,

the complainant got membership on the basis of which he was

given allotment letter of 200 yards plot vide letter dated 5.6.2011.

Ex. C-1 is the main features of the scheme raised by the Op. Ex.

C- 3 is the Membership Registration form vide which a sum of Rs.

21,000/- was received by Op No. 1. Op No. 1 further received a

sum of Rs. 8 Lacs vide receipt dated 6.9.2011 and Rs. 1 Lac vide

receipt dated 20.12.2012 referred in the other receipt i.e. Ex. C-3

(colly). Further, Op No. 2 issued revised allotment letter Ex. C-4 in

which it was admitted receiving a sum of Rs. 19,00,000/-. Then as

per MOU with Op Nos. 1 &amp; 2, the project was transferred to Op No.

</p><p id="p_12">2. The copy of the MOU has been placed on the record as Ex. Op-

1/3. This MOU includes the following Clause:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "And whereas the First Party, in the overall interest of the

      Society and its Members/Allottees, has decided to involve a

      reputed Developer/Colonizer who shall take over the entire

      project of the First Party in Sector 113, Mohali along with all

      its   assets    and    liabilities   and   develop   it   for   the

      Members/Allottees."

<p id="p_13">Clause No. 6 further specify the period within which after

development plots will be delivered to the Members.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "6.   The second party shall obtain Change of Land Use

      hand over Plots after developing the same to the non-

      defaulting Members/Allottees within 20 months from the

      date of MOU."

<p id="p_14">Accordingly, the revised allotment letter was issued by Op No. 2 as

Ex. Op-1/4. It also certifies the receipt of earlier amount of Rs. 19

Lacs and out of the balance amount a sum of Rs. 3 Lacs was

demanded by Op No. 2. No doubt that consent was given by the

complainant for transferring the project by Op No. 1 to Op No. 2 but

when Op No. 1 was not developing the project under the compelled

circumstances, they had to give the consent.
</p>
<p id="p_15">10.         Now the question arises whether Op No. 1 was entitled

to raise such a scheme without any CLU and other certificates from

the concerned Departments. The CLU was accorded to Op No. 2

vide their letter dated 2.12.2016, which makes it clear that before

that neither Op No. 1 or Op No. 2 had the relevant certificates, it

has been so stated by Op No. 2 in their reply, even such

certificates were not there when the project was transferred to Op

No. 2. Here the reference to Section 4 of the PAPRA, 1995 is

relevant, which reads as under:-

<p id="p_16">
   "4. Issuing of Advertisement or Prospectus:-

      that the statement was immaterial or that he had reason to
      believe and did upto the time of issue of the advertisement
      or prospectus believe that the statement was true."

</p><p id="p_28">11.           The counsel for the Ops have failed to convince before

us how they had complied with the provisions of <a href="/doc/733045/" id="a_19">Section 4</a> of the

Act. Further the CLU now provided by Senior Town Planner vide

letter dated 2.12.2016 Ex. Op-2/D and Clause No. 9 of the letter

issued by Senior Town Planner is as under:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> Consumer Complaint No. 227 of 2016                                   14</span><p id="p_29">



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "(ix) Applicant shall obtain NOC from P.P.C.B. under the

      Water Prevention and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_20">Pollution Act</a>, 1970,

      Municipal Solid Waste Management and Handling Rules,

      2000 or any other relevant Act before undertaking any

      development at site."</blockquote><p id="p_30">

</p><p id="p_31">      However, opposite party No. 2 has also not placed on the

record the requisite Certificate obtained by them from the

concerned departments.
</p>
<p id="p_32">12.         Therefore, we have no hesitation to return the findings

in favour of the complainant and against the Ops that they have

indulged in unfair trade practice as well as deficiency in service

even after transferring the project to Op No. 2. Op No. 2 has not

been able to deliver the possession within a period of 20 months as

agreed. Complainant had submitted an application/complaint in

Sangat Darshan against the Ops, upon which the Estate Officer

(R), GAMADA told to its official to send the complaint under

Section 4 of the PAPRA Act to the competent authority for its

approval and necessary action and soon it was also written to the

Senior Superintendent of Police, S.A.S. Nagar for the registration

of case against the afore said persons.
</p>
<p id="p_33">13.         Counsel for Op No.2 contended that there is no direct

agreement between the complainant and Op No. 2. The reference

is given to MOU Ex. Op-1/4, which shows that Op No. 2 has come

in the footsteps of Op No. 1 and had taken all the assets and

liabilities and after that he also issued the fresh allotment letter Ex.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13"> Consumer Complaint No. 227 of 2016                                   15</span>



C-4, therefore, it cannot say that there is no privity of contract

between the complainant and Op No. 2.
</p>
<p id="p_34">14.         If this is the situation when the opposite parties failed to

obtain the necessary permissions from the concerned authorities

and to complete the project within the stipulated time, the

consumer cannot be allowed to suffer for an indefinite period and

he is entitled to refund of his amount. It has been so held in

2007(2) CLT 440 titled as 'Kamal Sood Vs. DLF Universal Ltd.'

and 2014(2) CLT 401 titled as 'Brigadier B.S.Taunque (Retd.) &amp;

Others Vs. M/s Sangeethashree Builders &amp; Developers

International Private Limited &amp; Others'. Similar orders have

been passed by this Commission in F.A. No.231 of 2016 decided

on 12.10.2016 titled as M/s R.K.M. Housing Ltd. Vs. Smt. Geeta

Bhatia &amp; Anr. and F.A. No.230 of 2016 decided on 12.10.2016

titled as M/s R.K.M. Housing Ltd. Vs. Smt. Rakhi &amp; Anr.

</p><p id="p_35">15.         Another contention was raised by the counsel for the

Op No.2 that rate of interest should not be given more than 8%,

which is the bank interest rate. However, there is provision under

Clause No. 3 of the allotment letter dated 5.6.2011, which is as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      "3.   As the plot has been offered on no-profit-no-loss basis,

      late payment will attract penal interest @ 12% p.a. and

      sustained default will lead to cancellation of allotment."

</blockquote><p id="p_36">If the Ops are charging interest @ 12% on late payment then they

are liable to pay the same interest to the complainant on account of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14"> Consumer Complaint No. 227 of 2016                                    16</span>



their deficiency in service. It has been so provided under Rule 17 of

the PAPRA Rules, 1995.
</p>
<p id="p_37">16.           No other point was raised.
</p>
<p id="p_38">17.           Sequel to the above, we accept the complaint and

ordered all the Ops as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      (i)     to refund the sum of Rs.19,00,000/- alongwith interest

              at the rate of 12% per annum from the various dates of

              payment till realization;

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      (ii)    to pay Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation on account of

              unfair trade practice on the part of the Ops by giving

              false assurances to develop the area within the

              stipulated period of 20 months, which causes mental

              tension and harassment to the complainant;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      (iii)   to pay Rs.21,000/- as litigation costs.</blockquote><p id="p_39">

</p><p id="p_40">              Both the Ops are jointly and severally liable to make the

payment to the complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_41">18.           The above directions be complied with within a period

of 45 days from the date of receipt of certified copy of the order.

</p><p id="p_42">19.           The complaint could not be decided within the statutory

period due to heavy pendency of court cases.
