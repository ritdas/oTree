                                     Judgment

        Factual Matrix:
</pre><p id="p_3">   1.          Vide this order, I shall dispose of the present complaint which
        has been filed against the accused no.1 &amp; 2 and for dishonor of the
        cheques bearing no. 125855, 205617 &amp; 145287 u/s 138 of the
        <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">Negotiable Instrument Act</a> 1881 (hereafter referred to as the <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_3">NI Act</a>)
        issued by the accused in favour of the complainant.
</p>

<p id="p_4">   2.          A brief mention of the lis is in order. Suffice it to state that the
        complainant herein invested money in M/s. Sukhdata Chits Pvt. Ltd.
        run by accused no.1 and 2. After the maturity period the complainant
        asked the accused persons to return the chit amount and therefore the
        accused issued the cheques in question drawn on the account of M/s.
        Sukhdata Chits Pvt. Ltd. but upon presentation they were dishonored
        for the reason account closed. This prompted the complainant to file
        the present complaint u/s 138 of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_4">NI Act</a> impleading Sh. Pradeep Arya
        and Sh. Prem Kumar (Directors of M/s. Sukhdata chits Pvt. Ltd.) as
        accused no.1 &amp; 2.
</p>

<p id="p_5">   3.          In support of his case the complainant placed on record the
        original cheques in question Ex.CW1/A to C, returning memos
        Ex.CW1/D1 to Ex.CW1/D3, Legal notice, postal receipt and internet
        track report Ex.CW1/E, Ex.CW1/F (Colly) and Ex.CW1/G (colly) and
        led evidence by way of affidavit Ex.CW1/A1.
</p>

<p id="p_6">   4.          Vide order dated 16.10.2014, both accused were summoned.
</p><p id="p_7">        Thereafter notice was also framed upon them under <a href="/doc/429078/" id="a_5">section 251</a> Cr.PC

CC No.3102/1              Om Parkash Arora vs Pradeep Arya etc             2/ 7
         vide order dated 09.02.2015. However on a subsequent date, the
        accused contended that the present complaint was not maintainable as
        M/s Sukhdata Chits Pvt. Ltd. had not been impleaded as an accused.
        Therefore the prosecution of only accused no. 1 &amp; 2 who are directors
        of M/s. Sukhdata Chits Pvt. Ltd. under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_6">section 138</a> read with <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_7">section
        141</a> was not proper as no liability could be imputed to the
        abovementioned accused in the absence of the M/s Sukhdata Chits
        Pvt. Ltd. Accordingly, an application was filed by the accused persons
        for dropping of proceedings. In support of the application, the Ld.
        counsel primarily relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in
        <a href="/doc/1322448/" id="a_8">Anita Hada vs God Father Travels and Tours Pvt. Ltd</a>., (2012) 5
        SCC 661 as well as <a href="/doc/126644011/" id="a_9">Anil Gupta vs Star India Pvt. Ltd</a>., AIR 2014 SC
        3078.    Additionally, an application was also filed by the accused
        persons u/s 145(2) of the <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_10">NI Act</a> seeking cross examination of the
        complainant.
</p>

<p id="p_8">   5.           <a href="/doc/1322448/" id="a_11">In Anita Hada vs God Father Tours and Travels Pvt. Ltd</a>.
</p><p id="p_9">        (Supra) the question before the court was whether any person who
        has been mentioned in <a href="/doc/1755330/" id="a_12">section 141(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/38262/" id="a_13">141(2)</a> of the NI Act can be
        prosecuted without the company being impleaded as an accused.
        <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_14">Section 141</a> deals with the vicarious liability of the directors and other
        persons, incharge of the affairs of the company where the cheque
        dishonored has been drawn by the company. In the context of this
        provision, in para 42 of the said judgment, it has been observed that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                "commission of offence by the company is an express condition
                precedent to attract the vicarious liability of others. Thus, the
                words "as well as the company appearing in the section make it


CC No.3102/1               Om Parkash Arora vs Pradeep Arya etc           3/ 7
                absolutely unmistakably clear that when the company can be
               prosecuted then only the persons mentioned in the other
               categories could be vicariously liable for the offence subject to
               the averments in the petition and prove thereof. One cannot be
               oblivious of the fact that the company is a juristic person and it
               has its own respectability. If a finding is recorded against him it
               could create a concavity in its reputation. There can be
               situations when the corporate reputation is affected when the
               director is indicted".
</blockquote>

<p id="p_10">   6.          Thus, in view of the observation in the aforementioned judgment,
        it is evident that the directors of the company cannot be prosecuted for
        the commission of offence of dishonor of cheque unless the company
        is also proceeded against and a complaint filed without observing the
        aforementioned requirement is not maintainable.
</p>

<p id="p_11">   7.          The Ld. counsel for the complainant though not exactly
        conceding the point, nevertheless filed an application for impleadment
        of M/s Sukhdata Chits Pvt. Ltd. as an accused. This application was
        strongly opposed by the Ld. counsel for the accused on the ground that
        there is no provision in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_15"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure which enables
        the amendment of a complaint. On the other hand, in support of his
        application, the complainant cited the decision of the Supreme Court in
        <a href="/doc/140489013/" id="a_16">S.R. Sukumar v. Sunaad Raghuram</a> (decision dated 2.7.2015 in Crl.
        Appeal no. 844 of 2015).
</p>

<p id="p_12">   8.          Vide detailed order dated 02.04.2016, this court has already


CC No.3102/1               Om Parkash Arora vs Pradeep Arya etc            4/ 7
        dismissed the application filed by the complainant seeking the leave of
       the court to implead M/s. Sukhdata Chits Pvt. Ltd. as an accused. The
       relevant portions of that order are being reproduced below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">               "The judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1322448/" id="a_17">Anita Hada vs God
               Father Travels and Tours Pvt. Ltd</a>., (2012) 5 SCC 661 is
               conclusive on the legal point at hand and forecloses any further
               discussion on whether it is imperative to implead a company
               when a complaint against the directors thereof is filed under
               <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_18">section 138</a> of the NI Act. However whether the complainant
               can be permitted to subsequently implead the company also as
               an accused under <a href="/doc/435819/" id="a_19">section 319</a> CrPC or otherwise is the next
               issue that requires consideration.</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">                     I find that there is no provision in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_20"> the Code</a> of Criminal
               Procedure which would permit amendment of a complaint so as
               to array an additional accused. I am also unable to derive any
               such authority from the judgment cited by the Ld. counsel for the
               complainant. In S.R. Sukumar's case (supra), the apex court
               upheld the order of the trial court permitting the amendment of
               the complaint in that case on account of the peculiar facts of that
               case namely cognizance of the offence had not been taken,
               process had yet not been issued against the accused, the
               amendment did not change the original nature of the complaint
               and the amendment prevented multiplicity of proceedings. The
               Court specifically relied upon another judgment of the Supreme
               Court in the case of U.P. Pollution Control Board v Modi
               Distillery &amp; Ors (1987) 3 SCC 684 wherein the Supreme Court
               had held that if the amendment sought to be made is of a simple


CC No.3102/1              Om Parkash Arora vs Pradeep Arya etc             5/ 7
                infirmity curable by means of a formal amendment then the
               court may permit such an amendment to be made. <a href="/doc/885425/" id="a_21">In U.P.
               Pollution Control Board v. Modi Distillery</a>, in a prosecution
               launched under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_22">section 44</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_23">Control
               of Pollution Act</a>) 1974, the amendment in the complaint was
               permitted as the company concerned had been made an
               accused but had been wrongly described as an industrial unit.
               However the amendment which is sought to be made in the
               present complaint is not of a formal nature as what is sought to
               be done is impleadment of one more entity as an accused.
</p><p id="p_14">                      Further, the non impleadment of M/s Sukhdata Chits Pvt.
               Ltd by the complainant is a defect which goes to the root of the
               complaint impinging its maintainability and this defect cannot be
               cured through <a href="/doc/435819/" id="a_24">section 319</a> CrPC. The counsel has relied upon
               the decision of the Madras High Court in <a href="/doc/1648401/" id="a_25">S. Viswanathan v.
               United Phosphorus</a>, 2000 (1) Crimes 113 where in a similar
               set of facts, it was held that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                      "is no doubt true that <a href="/doc/435819/" id="a_26">Section 319</a> of the Criminal
                      Procedure Code permits impleading another accused in
                      the course of enquiry or trial when it appears from the
                      evidence that another person also has committed the
                      offence. The court has held in Anandan v. Anvazhagan
                      that without impleading the company the complaint
                      against the petitioner is not sustainable and that when the
                      complaint has the initial defect, the defect cannot be
                      cured by amending the proceedings under <a href="/doc/435819/" id="a_27">Section 319</a> of
                      the Criminal Procedure Code."

<p id="p_15">CC No.3102/1               Om Parkash Arora vs Pradeep Arya etc           6/ 7
                          A similar view was taken by the Madras High Court in
               <a href="/doc/556594/" id="a_28">Anandan and Anr. v. Arivazhagan</a> 1999 96 CompCas 503

               in S. Visvanathan's case (supra).
</p><p id="p_16">                         I am in agreement with the decisions of the Madras High

               complainant for impleadment of M/s Sukhdata Chits Pvt. Ltd. as
               an accused stands disallowed".
</p><p id="p_17">   9.          The necessary concomitant of the foregoing discussion is that
        the present complaint is not maintainable and the complainant not
        been entitled to any succour by way of amendment of complaint, the
        accused no.1 and 2 are acquitted of the commission of offence u/s 138
