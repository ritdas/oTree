        Secretary, H.P. Pollution Control Board to forthwith
        have the site inspected and if necessary, issue orders





        for disconnection of electricity and water connection of
        these polluting units.

        states that with the orders being issued by the
        Pollution Control Board, electricity of the units shall be
        disconnected forthwith.       Mr. Anup Rattan, learned
        Additional Advocate General, states that water

</p><p id="p_63">        15.     It is not in dispute before us that within the
        territorial limits of Municipal Council, Parwanoo, there
        is neither a sewage treatment plant nor any


        mechanism for processing and dealing with municipal
        solid waste.
</p><p id="p_64">        16.     Mr. T.S. Chauhan, Advocate, invites our attention
        to the fact that since the year 2015, Pollution Control




        Board has been taking up the issue with the
        authorities, but the fact of the matter being that at the
        ground level, nothing has been done and things have





        remained as it is.
</p><p id="p_65">        17.     At this stage, Ms. Seema Guleria, Advocate, who
        is otherwise assisting the Court as an Amicus Curiae in
        other matters, states that new technology (Black Hole)





        is available to deal with solid waste, and that too, at
        low cost and in an efficient manner. And all this,
        without segregating the waste material. She states
        that the entrepreneur possessing such technology has
        approached the authorities, highlighting that certain
        States have already used the same. Well, at this stage,
        we do not want to comment about the feasibility
        thereof, but definitely it requires consideration of the
        authorities and as such, we leave it open for them to
        do so at the earliest.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                             14</span>

        had clarified that if the petitioners were to hand over
        possession before 31st December, 2017, they would be
        absolved from the liability of a payment of amounts
        towards rent/lease money/occupation charges, so
        claimed by various authorities. This for the reason that




                                                      .
</p><p id="p_91">        for decades no action was taken by the authorities and





        the possessors had agreed to handover land under
        their possession.
</p><p id="p_92">        3.     The said undertakings, in terms of the order, are
        on record.
</p>




<p id="p_93">        4.     We are informed that one such occupant,
        handed over possession, in terms of undertaking,
        recorded in order, dated 22nd September, 2017.
        However, the railway authorities did not cordon off the
        said area, so vacated by the applicant, with the result
        that it has now become a dumping ground. There is





        none to check the same, with the result that it has also
        become a source of health hazard. In fact, it is a
        nuisance.
</p><p id="p_94">        5.     In terms of the present applications, some of the
        applicants, who are still in possession of the area in
        his/their occupation and are bound in terms of our

        order, dated 22nd September, 2017, have offered to

        redevelop the vacated land at their own cost and
        expense, subject to the satisfaction and supervision of
        the railway authorities. Such development, according
        to the applicants, has to be strictly in accordance with
        the Municipal Laws.
</p><p id="p_95">        6.     As per the railways, such developmental activity


        can take place only by them and not by private
        person(s).
</p><p id="p_96">        7.     We cannot be oblivious of the fact that
        possession of the premises in question came to be




        handed over to railways          only pursuant to the
        directions issued by this Court in writ petitions,
        referred to supra. For decades, authorities did not take





        any action worth its name in this regard. Be that as it
        may, we are of the considered view that interest of
        justice would be best served if a direction is issued to
        the railway authorities to either develop the said land





        of its own or through the applicants or on the basis of
        build, operate and transfer basis. The land cannot be
        allowed to lie unused, for it would further become a
        source of nuisance to the residents of the area. In fact,
        development would not only generate revenue but also
        enhance the value of the property. It can be put to
        appropriate public use.
</p><p id="p_97">        8.     As such, we dispose of all these applications
        with the following directions to the railway authorities:-

        would mutually determine;
</p><p id="p_101">                (c)    How best the land is to be utilized is to be





        considered by the railway authorities, but then they cannot
        allow the land to be kept unused. As such, we direct the
        railway authorities to take decision positively within a
        period of two months from today.

<p id="p_102">        9.     Insofar as the averments made in the
        application being CMP No. 10847 qua alleged





        unauthorized encroachment by Gurmeet Singh and
        Harnam Kaur are concerned, if that be so, we direct
        the railway authorities to take appropriate action, in
        accordance with law within a period of two weeks. We
        clarify that it shall be open for the railway authorities

        to take action on lines similar to the one, which we had
        directed, against the present applicants. Also, if the

        railways find any difficulty, they can approach the
        District Authorities seeking assistance/implementation
        of the order, passed by this Court.
</p><p id="p_103">        10.    Learned Advocate General states that all
        assistance shall       be rendered by the District


        Administration, including the Superintendent of Police
        for removing such alleged encroachment(s), if any.
</p><p id="p_104">        11.    In view of the undertakings, so filed by each one
        of the applicants, we also modify our order, dated 22nd




        September, 2017 with regard to the payment of use
        and occupation charges. If the possession is handed
        over in terms of the undertaking(s) on or before 31st





        March, 2018, and not 31st December, 2017, none of
        the applicants shall be liable to pay any amount as use
        and occupation charges. Similarly, if any one of the
        encroachers/occupants has handed over possession of





        the property, which was under their possession, to the
        railway authorities, they shall not be liable to pay any
        amount towards use and occupation charges save and
        except the one which they were otherwise liable to pay
        in terms of the lease deed, if any executed between
        the parties.

        by Mr. Negi, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for
        the applicant in CMP No. 8731 of 2017 that the said
        applicant is liable to pay only a sum of Rs. 8,82,807/-
        as lease rent which the applicant through counsel
        undertakes to deposit on or before 31st March, 2018.
