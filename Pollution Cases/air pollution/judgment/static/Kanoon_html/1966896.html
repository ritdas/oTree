<p id="p_4">       3.   Respondent, Kerala State Pollution Control Board,

initiated prosecution against the revision petitioner and others

by filing complaint in the court of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate, Kolencherry for offences punishable under Sections

43, 44, 47 read with 49 of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short, "the Act") alleging that the

revision petitioner and others discharged effluents which did

not conform to the standards laid down by the respondent which

amounted to violation of <a href="/doc/35230679/" id="a_2">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_3">25</a> and <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_4">26</a> of the Act and

that the discharge of the polluted effluent by the revision

petitioner and others through unauthorised outlet violated

<a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_5">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_6">26</a> of the Act. Petitioner filed Crl.M.P. No.3405

of 2000 claiming that he is an employee of the Government of

India and therefore entitled to the protection of <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_7">Section 197</a> of

the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as 'the

CRL. R.P. NO.331 OF 2001
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     -: 2 :-</span>

Code').        Since the respondent has not obtained the sanction,

prosecution against him is not sustainable. Petitioner also contended

that since the occupier of the premises is made an accused, it is not

necessary to array its employees also as accused. He requested the

trial court to drop all further proceedings.       That     petition     was

opposed by the respondent contending that the first accused in the

case, M/s. F.A.C.T. Ltd., is only a Company in which the Government of

India holds more than 51% shares and that is is not a Government

Undertaking and hence           its employees are not entitled to the

protection under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_8">Section 197</a> of the Code. The further contention that

since the occupier has been made accused, its employees need not be

arrayed as accused is factually and legally incorrect.         The learned

Magistrate after hearing both sides rejected the contentions raised by

the petitioner an dismissed the petition (Crl.M.P No.3405 of 2000).

The legality, regularity and propriety of that order is under challenge.

</p><p id="p_5">       4.    First accused, M/s.FACT Ltd. is only a Company in which

Government of India holds more than 51% shares.                 It is not a

Government Undertaking.         It is true that the revision petitioner is an

employee of the Government of India but, the offence is said to have

been committed in relation to his employment in the first accused

(M/s. FACT Ltd.) He was concededly on deputation. At the relevant

time he was not in the service of the Government of India but was in

CRL. R.P. NO.331 OF 2001
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 -: 3 :-</span>

the service of the first accused and his salary was being paid by the

first accused. In such situation, sanction under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_9">Section 197</a> of the

Code is not required for prosecution. This is authoritatively held in

<a href="/doc/1419630/" id="a_10">Mohd. Hadi Raja v. State of Bihar</a> (1998 SCC (Cri.) 1265 and

<a href="/doc/712339/" id="a_11">Sharma v. Abhimanyu</a> (2005 (4) KLT 738 (SC). Therefore, the

objection  that   prosecution  without   obtaining    sanction    is  not

sustainable, lacks merit and substance.

</p><p id="p_6">      5.   There is no merit in the further contention that because

the occupier has been arrayed as accused, its employees need not be

arrayed as accused.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      6.   There is no merit in this revision petition. It is only to be

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">           Resultantly, this revision petition fails and it is accordingly

dismissed. Office is directed to send the records to the court below

forthwith. The court below shall expedite the trial and disposal of the

case.
