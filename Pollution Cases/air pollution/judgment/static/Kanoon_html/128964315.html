 B) It is argued on behalf of the complainant that the case of the prosecution has 

   been   proved   beyond   reasonable   doubt   in   view   of   the   testimony   of   the 

   witnesses. It is further submitted that in his cross examination, DW1/accused 

   has also admitted that he was not having mandatory consent from the DPCC 

   to   run   the   unit   till   29.04.2000   when   the   inspection   was   carried   out   in   his 

   aforesaid unit. Hence, accused may be convicted for the alleged offences. 



C) (i)           On   the   other   hand,   it   is   argued   on   behalf   of   the   accused   that 

   accused is innocent. He has been falsely implicated in this case just to harass 

   him.   It   is   vehemently   argued   that  present   complaint   is   not   maintainable 

   because being not filed by the competent person.
</p>
<p id="p_29">   (ii)             It would be necessary to discuss the issue of maintainability of 

   the complaint first as it is a legal issue raised by the accused and the decision 

   of   this   issue   will   affect   the   case   of   the   complainant.   It   is   argued   that   this 

   complaint   is   not   filed   by   the   duly   authorized   and   competent   person.   Only 

   Member   Secretary   of   DPCC   is   authorized   to   file   the   present   complaint. 

   However, present complaint is filed by area Junior Environmental Engineer.

</p><p id="p_30">   (iii)         In rebuttal, it is argued on behalf of the complainant that PW1 is duly 

   authorized to file the present complaint and reliance is placed upon documents 

   i.e copy of the Agenda for meeting to be held on 30.03.2000 Ex.PW1/3, copy 

   of  Minutes  of Meeting  held   on  30.03.2000  Ex.PW1/4.  Perusal  of  document 

   Ex.PW1/4  (MOM),  it is clear that  the  committee  (DPCC)  has  approved  the 

   proposal of launching the prosecution against the defaulting water polluting 


DPCC vs M/s N.R. Industries                         CC No.76/06                                       6 of 11
    units   and   also   approved   the   authorization   to   AEEs/JEEs   of   DPCC   to   file 

   complaint under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_18">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_19">Air Act</a>, 1981. Furthermore, similar issue raised 

   before the Hon'ble High Court in case titled as "DPCC vs A­one Automobile 

   &amp;   Ors"   in   Cr.   L.P.   687   of   2013,   has   already   been   decided   in   favour   of 

   complainant and in view of the order dated 23.09.2014 passed in that case by 

   Hon'ble High Court of Delhi, the plea of the accused is not sustainable at all.


D) (i)  It is further argued on behalf of the accused that the unit was not working 

   at the time of inspection nor he was present at the spot. ETP was already 

   installed in the unit and was functional. The complainant has not brought any 

   documentary evidence or photographs in record which could suggest that the 

   unit   was   operating   at   the   time   of   inspection   and   the   ETP   installed   in   the 

   premises was not functional. It is further argued that no sample was taken and 

   sent to lab for expert opinion to determine the existence of effluent. However, 

   this plea of the accused does not hold much water. PW1 Sh. Sunil Kumar and 

   PW2   Sh.   Ajay   Kumar   Gupta   who   inspected   the   unit   of   the   accused   on 

   29.04.2000, clearly deposed that though the ETP was installed in the premises 

   but it was found that effluent was being discharged directly in the drain without 

   any treatment as ETP was not functioning. PW1 and PW2 have also stated 

   that at the time of inspection accused was not present but one of his worker, 

   namely, Mr. Arvind was present at the site and after preparation of inspection 

   report  mark F,  signature  of said  Mr. Arvind was obtained.  Accused did not 

   dispute this fact. Accused has also not denied that said Arvind was his not 

   employee.   In   his   evidence   as   DW1,   accused   stated   that   only   he   and   his 

DPCC vs M/s N.R. Industries                       CC No.76/06                                    7 of 11
    employee   Mr.   Arvind   used   to   work   in   the   said   unit.   Accused   has   also   not 

   explained as to what was Mr. Arvind doing in the said premises, if the unit was 

   not working on the date of inspection. Thus, the plea of the accused that unit 

   was not working at the time of inspection is incorrect. 

</p><p id="p_31">   (ii)    Accused has taken one specific stand that immediately after publishing 

   of   public   notice   in   the   news   paper   regarding   putting   up   Effluent   Treatment 

   Plant (for short ETP) for treating effluent prior to discharging it, he purchased 

   ETP system and got it installed in his unit on 19.01.2000. He has also placed 

   reliance   upon   the   documents   Ex.DW1/3,   Ex.DW1/1,   Ex.DW1/2,   Ex.DW1/5, 

   Ex.DW1/9,   Ex.DW1/10,   Adequacy   Certificate   (AC/019/2000)   mark   A   and   B, 

   Ex.DW1/14, Ex.DW1/16, Ex.DW1/15 and Ex.DW1/17, to support his claim and 

   contentions.   However,   these   documents   are   not   helpful   to   the   accused. 

   Document Ex.DW1/1 dated 15.01.2000 pertains to purchase of ETP system, 

   document   Ex.   DW1   dated   18.01.2000   pertains   to   purchase   of   Water   Tank, 

   Ex.DW1/3 dated 19.01.2000 pertains to fitting of Tank and Ex.DW1/4 pertains 

   to deposit of Rs.1875 to Sulabh International Institute on account of sample 

   analysis.  Except  those  documents  Ex.DW1/4,  other  documents are  of May, 

   2000 onwards. Adequacy Report of ETP Ex.DW1/10 pertains to 24.07.2000, 

   much after the date of inspection. It is not in dispute that ETP was purchased 

   by  the   accused  as  same   was  also   found   in   the   premise   where   unit  of  the 

   accused was operating. But accused did not produce or prove on record any 

   such Adequacy Report/Certificate which could suggest that ETP was installed 

   in   the   premises   of   accused   and   was   functional   before   or   on   the   date   of 


DPCC vs M/s N.R. Industries                      CC No.76/06                                    8 of 11
    inspection. The document Ex.DW1/4 dated 23.02.2000 i.e receipt regarding 

   deposit of Rs.1875/­ on account of sample analysis and it does not suffice to 

   assume that ETP was functioning at the crucial time of inspection. Accused 

   has also not placed on record any document of any Company/Institute/Shop 

   which could suggest that ETP was actually installed and started functioning 

   immediately after its purchase by the accused nor any such witness has been 

   examined.
</p>
<p id="p_32">   (iii)   In   his   cross   examination,   DW1/accused   admitted   the   process   of 

   electroplating, number of machines and required man power of at least 8­10 

   persons   as   explained   in   the   document   Ex.DW1/10   at   mark   A   and   B,   for 

   executing the process mentioned on mark A in Ex.DW1/10. Thus, it is clear 

   that   for   operating/maintaining   ETP,   at   least   8­10   persons   as   well   as 

   considerable expenditure of money were/are required. In such circumstances, 

   the installation of ETP by the accused in the unit was just an eye wash and 

   due to consumption of huge men power and costly process, accused could not 

   keep/maintain the ETP functional.
</p>
<p id="p_33">   (iv)    From bare perusal of defence evidence, accused does not appear to be 

   firm on his stand. In his cross examination, DW1/accused tried to shift   the 

   liability   upon   his   son   stating   that   he   had   handed   over   all   the   machines 

   mentioned   in   mark   B   to   his   son   in   the   year   1998   and   since   then  he   was  

   carrying said activity in the same unit separately in the adjoining shed. The  

   machines   mentioned   in   mark   B   were   earlier   being   used   by   him   prior   to  

   handing over to the same to his son.  This plea of the accused appears to be 


DPCC vs M/s N.R. Industries                       CC No.76/06                                    9 of 11
    afterthought. Accused did not disclose the name of his son. He has also not 

   placed   or   proved   any   document   which   could   suggest   that   the   machines 

   mentioned in mark B, were handed over by him to his son in 1998 and since 

   then his son is using/maintaining the same. He even did not examine his son 

   in support of his case.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
E) Next contention raised is that no sample was taken, therefore, in absence of 

   any   expert   opinion,   it   can   not   be   said   that   the   unit   of   the   accused   was 

   discharging untreated effluent. However, perusal of <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_20">section 21</a> of the Water 

   (Prevention   &amp;   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_21">Control   Pollution)  Act</a>,   1974,  makes  it  clear  that   collection   of 

   sample is not  sine qua non. From the statement of witnesses and aforesaid 

   discussions, it is clear that though ETP was available in the unit but same was 

   not functional at the time of inspection and effluent generated from the process 

   was   being   discharged   directly   in   the   sewer   without   any   treatment.   Even 

   perusal of inspection report relied upon by the complainant makes it clear that 

   ETP was installed in the unit but same was not functional and entire untreated 

   effluent was being discharged without any kind of treatment into the public 

   sewer/drain. In his cross examination as DW1, accused also admitted that unit 

   was   operating   without   obtaining   requisite   consent   from   DPCC.   In   such 

   circumstances, it is not necessary to collect the sample and send the same to 

   lab for expert opinion.  
</p>
<p id="p_35">
F) Lastly, it was argued on behalf of the accused that no notice u/s 25 of the Act 

   was given. However, said provision makes it clear that any such industry etc. 


DPCC vs M/s N.R. Industries                       CC No.76/06                                    10 of 11
    which are in operation prior to the Act, will obtain consent within three months 

   from the date of commencement of Act. In this case there is nothing on record 

   to suggest that accused unit was in operation prior to the year 1988.  Even if 

   for the sake of arguments, it may be assumed that the unit was in existence 

   prior to the year 1988, the accused was required to obtain sanction/consent 

   within   three   months   and   not   notice   was   required.   Moreover,   in   his   cross 

   examination,   DW1/accused   himself   has   admitted   that   he   installed   unit   of 

   electroplating in January, 2000. Thus his arguments qua mandatory notice is 

   without any merit.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
G) In view of the aforesaid discussions, it is held that the prosecution has proved 

   its  case  beyond   reasonable   doubt  against  the   accused   that  the   unit  of  the 

   accused itself was for electroplating. Further, it was operating without requisite 

   consent from DPCC and untreated effluent  was being discharged directly in 

   the   public   sewer/drain.   Accordingly,   accused   Nathu   Ram   is  held   guilty   and 

   convicted for the offence u/s 24/25/26 of the Act, punishable u/s 43/44 of the 

   Act.
