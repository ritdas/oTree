              Raghunathpur, Purulia. In the background of this revision the fact in
              brief is as follows:-
</p>

<p id="p_2">                 The petitioners have been arraigned as accused in Raghunathpur
              Police Station Case No. 49 of 2002 dated 03.09.2002 for their alleged
              involvement in commission of offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1976294/" id="a_6">Sections
              413</a>/<a href="/doc/94452/" id="a_7">414</a>/<a href="/doc/1368265/" id="a_8">278</a> of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 15/16 of the
              Environmental Protection Act and <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_9">Section 39</a> of the Air Prevention
              and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution Act</a>. The said case has been registered suo
              moto on the basis of a complaint lodged by Sri Samar Banerjee, Sub
              Inspector, Raghunathpur Police Station.
</p>

<p id="p_3">                 The allegations levelled in the complaint are inter alia to the effect
              that the complainant upon receipt of a secret information that three
              soft coke coal factory owners of Kargali, Police Station -
              Raghunathpur were collecting steam coal from persons who went to
              Jharkhand State and collected stolen coal by fraudulent means. To
              work out the information, the complaint along with force went to
sn            Samrat Soft Coke Industries. Over there they found huge quantities
              of steam coal, soft coke coal and coal dust lying at the industry
              premises and some stag of steam coal were burning in open place
 inside the industry premises making the atmosphere noxious to
health. The complaint also found one truck bearing registration no.
WB-37/7257 loaded with stem coal. On query, it was found that the
petitioners who were preparing soft coke coal in the industry
premises, after purchasing stolen stem coal from a cyclist who
collected coal stealthily from Jharkhand state. It was further alleged
that the nature of business carried on by the petitioners were
clandestine and that their way of business was a major pollutant to
the air as huge quantities of steam coal were burnt in open places
inside the industry premises. The complainant seized steam coal and
soft coke coal of 96 M.T. and 320 Kgs and Coal dust 12 M.T., 420
Kgs., 5 cycles loaded with steam coal, 5 M.T., 200 Kgs. And 11
gunny bags, one truck bearing registration no. WB-37/7257, 15 M.T.
420 Kgs. Steam coal from Samrat Soft Coke Industry premises. The
seized coal and trucks were shifted to Para Police Station for safe
custody weighing the same at Weigh Bridge of Dubra.                   The
petitioners are completely innocent and in no way connected with the
commission of alleged offence.
</p>

<p id="p_4">   Being apprehensive of arrest the petitioners preferred an
application under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_11">Section 438</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure
before the Court of learned Sessions Judge, Purulia. The learned
Court allowed the prayer of the petitioners and subsequently the
petitioners   prayed   for   regular   bail   and   the   learned   SDJM,
Raghunathpur also allowed their prayer.
</p>

<p id="p_5">   After completion of investigation, police has submitted charge-
sheet under <a href="/doc/1976294/" id="a_12">Sections 413</a>/<a href="/doc/94452/" id="a_13">414</a>/<a href="/doc/1368265/" id="a_14">278</a> of the Indian Penal Code and
Sections 15/16 of the Environmental Protection Act and <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_15">Section 39</a> of
the Air Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">Control of Pollution Act</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_6">   The petitioner submitted that Samrat Soft Coke Industries are
registered as SSI/SSSBE Unit for the manufacture of soft coke. The
industry is registered with Government of West Bengal, Directorate of
Cottage and Small Scale Industries and bear registration no.
3211610315. They further submitted that they have all necessary
 pollution certificates issued by the West Bengal Pollution Control
Board as well as the 'No Objection Certificate' from the local
Panchayat. So, allegation levelled against the petitioners regarding
polluting the air by burning steam coal in open areas does not arise.
   Learned Counsel for the petitioners submitted that the very basis
of taking cognizance of the case itself is bad and the case is not at all
maintainable. The second submission is that after appearance before
the Court, the present petitioners floated a petitioner for return of the
seized articles.   Consequent upon a direction given by the Court
below, the I/O who lodged suo motu complaint, caused an enquiry
and submitted a report to the effect that the petitioner is the owner of
the seized quantum of goods. So, practically there is nothing left in
this case. He added that the spirit of the decisions reported in 1) CRA
113 of 2001 (Nilmadhab Majhi &amp; Ors.), 2) CRR 3752 of 2005 (Kamal
Kumar Das &amp; Ors.) 3) CRR 2143 of 2007 (Kamal Kumar Das), 4)
CRR 2774 of 2008 (Binod Kumar Agarwal &amp; Ors.) 5) CRR 425 of
2009 (Binoy @ Subhash Agarwal &amp; Ors. 6) CRR 3355 of 2009 (Sisir
Ghosh &amp; Ors.) and 7) CRR 1193 of 2001 (Sushil Kumar Jain) go to
suggest that the entire ownership is proved in a counter manner from
the side of the prosecution. The Case has no legs to stand out.
   Heard the learned Counsel of the State also.
</p><p id="p_7">   The fact remains the heard of a criminal case is the complaint
lodged by the complainant and taking of cognizance. He in this case I
find that the complainant is a police inspector who suo motu lodged
the complaint simply on the basis of his assumption tht the goods in
question are stolen property. In this regard, <a href="/doc/446787/" id="a_17">Sections 410</a> and <a href="/doc/94452/" id="a_18">414</a> of
the IPC are very much relevant. The very plinth of such offence is the
ownership except the accused persons none else not to speak of the
S/I of police who lodged the complaint is rushing to the Court to prove
that the seized goods belong to him or rather owned by him. To the
contrary the accused produced valid document in regard to
possession of said seized articles.      It goes without saying being
satisfied the I/O in obedience to the direction of the learned Court
below submitted a report for release of the goods in favour of the
petitioner but still then the learned Magistrate took cognizance and
charge-sheet remained in the record.
</p><p id="p_8">   In such a position, learned Counsel for the petitioners contended
that the cognizance is bad in law and in support of his contention he
placed before me a good number of judgments as cited above.
  I have carefully considered the submissions as well as the material
placed before me.
</p><p id="p_9">  Suspicion, however, strong it might be cannot take the place of
proof. The charge-sheet prima facie shows tht the I/O believed that
the seized articles were stolen. He did not name actually who is the
owner or producer of the seized articles.
</p><p id="p_10">  This being the position the case becomes lame at the very first
moment of its birth.
</p><p id="p_11">  Therefore, I hold that the presumption has no legs to stand upon.
Accordingly, the revision stands allowed and the proceedings IN
G.R. Case NO. 237 of 2002 arising out of Raghunathpur P.S. Case
NO. 49 of 2001 dated 03.09.2002 stands quashed.
