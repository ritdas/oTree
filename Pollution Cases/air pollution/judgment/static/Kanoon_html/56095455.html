<div class="doc_title">Jabalpur Pashupalak Avam Dugdha ... vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 4 May, 2017</div><pre id="pre_1">                  Writ Petition No.6832 / 2017
04.05.2017.
      Shri Rajendra Tiwari, learned Senior Advocate with Shri
Manoj Sharma, Sanjay Agrawal, Abhijeet Bhowmik, counsel
for the petitioners
      Shri Swapnil Ganguly, Government Advocate, for
respondent Nos.1 to 3/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Shri Anshuman Singh, counsel for respondent No.4.
      Shri Ashish Shroti, counsel for respondent No.5.
      Dr. P.G. Najpande - intervenor.
</p>



<p id="p_2">      The petitioners have sought a direction to the District
Administration to furnish all the material record pertaining to
demolition of five to six dairy farms carried out on 03.05.2017.
It is further prayed that District Administration should be
restrained from carrying out demolition of dairy farms.
</p><p id="p_3">      We have heard learned counsel for the parties and Dr.
P.G. Najpande. The matter regarding running of dairy farms
within the area of Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur was pending
for 14 years before this Court. It was on 15.02.2017, a Division
Bench of this Court passed an order. The relevant extracts read
as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "However, we are of the considered view that
      as the Collector has given a compliance report
      indicating a reasonable period of time which is
      required for complying with various requirements of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                 2</span>




     law, we see no reason to reject the prayer made in the
     appropriate application, merely, because the matter is
     pending for more than 14 years, we cannot accede to
     the objections raised by Shri P.G. Najpande.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            Shri Manoj Sharma and other counsel appearing
     for the Dairy owners submitted that they want to file
     detailed objections raised by the Collector but we
     cannot accept the aforesaid contention also. Operation
     of dairy farms within the municipal limits is governed
     by certain statutory provisions and as the Collector has
     only given a schedule for regularizing functioning of
     Dairy farms in accordance with the requirement of
     law, we grant time to the Dairy owners to submit an
     appropriate application in accordance with the
     requirement of law namely to the Pollution Control
     Board and the Municipal Corporation for their working
     within the limits of Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur
     within a period of 15 days from today and on the same
     being done, the Pollution Control Board, the
     Veterinary Department and the Municipal Corporation,
     Jabalpur shall proceed to process the application in
     accordance with law and ensure operation of Dairy
     farms within the limits of Municipal Corporation,
     Jabalpur. "</blockquote>


<p id="p_4">     Learned counsel appearing for the Municipal Corporation
states that no action be now taken against the dairy farm
owners, who have applied for license, as contemplated under
Section 264 of the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                     3</span>




1956, as the process for grant of license is under consideration.
On the other hand, learned counsel representing the Pollution
Control Board states that 12 applications were received for
grant of consent, out of which 6 applications have been
allowed, 2 are under consideration and 4 have been rejected.
But the petitioners have not applied for consent under the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter
referred to as 'Act of 1974') and the Air (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter referred to as 'Act
of 1981').
</p><p id="p_5">      We find that the petitioners themselves have to be
blamed for not applying for license from the Municipal
Corporation and for the consent from the Pollution Control
Board. Thus there cannot any direction for restraining the
District Administration from not carrying out demolition of
dairy farms. This Court has already given long rope to dairy
farm owners to comply with the statutory provisions, but if they
have not applied for consent or license, they alone have to be
blamed.
</p><p id="p_6">      But, failure to apply within 15 days does not mean that
petitioners have no right to seek license under the Municipal
Corporation Act or consent under the Act of 1974 and the Act
of 1981 even now.
</p><p id="p_7">      Consequently, we dispose of the present writ petition
with liberty to the petitioners to apply for license under the
Municipal Corporation Act or consent under the Act of 1974
and the Act of 1981 on or before 10th of May, 2017. If the dairy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                        4</span>




farm owners do not apply for the license or consent on or before
10.05.2017, the respondents would be at liberty to proceed
against the dairy farms in accordance with law, but till
10.05.2017 the respondents will not carry out any demolition
activities. This is to give another opportunity to the dairy farm
owners to apply for license and consent.
</p><p id="p_8">        It may be clarified that there will be no further relaxation
of time to apply for license or consent, as they have already
availed substantial time for obtaining the license or consent
under the Act of 1974 and the Act of 1981.
</p><p id="p_9">        With the said direction, the writ petition stands disposed
of.
</p><p id="p_10">        Certified copy as per rules.
