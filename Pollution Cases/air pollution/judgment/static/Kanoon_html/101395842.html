No.3-Sub-Collector, Rourkela and published on 25.02.2011 in the Odia

daily "The Sambad".
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.          The petitioner's case in a nutshell is that he is engaged in

manufacturing stone chips and metals since 1993 in the name and style of

"M/s. Jharabahal Stone Quarry", which comes within micro small scale

industry   and    has      been   allotted        entrepreneurs'     Memorandum

No.210311100289       on   28.06.2008       by   the   Project   Manager,   District

Industries Centre, Rourkela. Since 1993 the petitioner was operating the

stone quarry on lease basis from the Government of Orissa. Jharabahal

Stone Quarry No.1 was granted/renewed in favour of the petitioner in 2007

by the opposite party No.4-Tahasildar, Rourkela on 11.09.2007 for a period

of four years starting from the financial year 2007-2008 till 2010-2011 and

the said lease was to expire on 31.03.2011. Since the lease was to expire on

31.03.2011, the petitioner filed an application for renewal of Jharabahal

(RTU-47) Stone Quarry lease before Opposite Party No.4. The said

application has been duly received by the office of opposite party No.4 on

20.12.2010 along with all necessary documents like the solvency certificate,

clearance certificate obtained from the Asst. Commissioner of Sales Tax, a

treasury challan of Rs.1000/- etc. Opposite party No.4 by his order dated

14.01.2011 rejected the said renewal application on the ground that the

Government of Orissa as well as the Board of Revenue in their various

circulars and instructions have made it clear to settle the Miner Mineral
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          3</span>




through annual auction only and not through lease. Hence, the present

writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.           Mr. B.M. Pattnaik, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the

petitioner submitted that the OMMC Rules, 2004 which provides for

auctioning of the mineral sources every year will lead to closure of micro

level crusher units due to lack of raw materials. Micro level entrepreneurs

because of their size cannot afford to remain in manufacturing by sourcing

stones from the quarry owners in case of auction of the quarries. The duty

of the Government is not only to get revenue but it is equally the duty and

responsibility   of   the   Government       to   ensure   that   the   Micro   level

manufacturers also survive and have reasonable access to the sources of

new materials. Rules 35 and 36 of the OMMC Rules, 2004 put

unreasonable restriction on business of unemployed youths inasmuch as

the auction will be for a period of one year only. The cost for setting up of a

crusher unit is about Rs.20 to 25 lakhs. Besides arranging finance from

Banks, for getting licence under the <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_1">Explosive Act</a>, <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Pollution Control Act</a>,

Sales Tax/<a href="/doc/1939811/" id="a_3">Value Added Tax Act</a> etc. cumulatively it will take minimum 3 to

6 months' time. Rule 27 of the OMMC Rules, 2004 mandates that in case of

renewal, a person who has been operating an industry based on minor

mineral shall be given priority. The aim behind such a legislation is to see

that if a person, applying for renewal of his quarry, who has set up an

industry based on minor minerals is given priority as because the same
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      4</span>




individual must have expended a huge sum of money in setting up the said

industry and if the lease deed is not renewed, it may so happen that the

said person may not be able to pay back his debts and the industry may

come to a standstill position. The petitioner is running a manufacturing

unit based on the minerals quarried from the stone quarry, which is

evident from the certified copy issued by the DIC, Rourkela under

Annexure-1. The petitioner has taken all pains and has expended a large

sum of money to obtain necessary permissions from various statutory

authorities to operate the stone quarry and the manufacturing unit. The

petitioner has also received huge sum of money as loan from various

financial institutions to carry on its manufacturing unit. The petitioner is

providing bread and butter to a large number of local people. It is asserted

here that after signing of the lease deed the petitioner reasonably expected

that the lease over the stone quarry would be renewed after expiry of four

years if he could set up a manufacturing unit based on the said minor

mineral. Accordingly, loans and advances of huge amount and due

permissions for a longer term were obtained from the financial institutions

and the statutory authorities. The provisions enshrined under Rule 27 of

the OMMC Rules, 2004 have been laid down keeping in view the doctrine of

Legitimate Expectations. The petitioner while submitting his application for

renewal of Jharabahal (RTU-47) Stone Quarry in his favour had expressed

his willingness to pay the upset price fixed by him. It was submitted that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       5</span>




the provisions of Rules 35 and 36 of the OMMC Rules, 2004 have not been

made in consonance with <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_4">Section 15</a> of the Mines and Minerals

(Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_5">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 (for short, "<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_6">MMDR Act</a>, 1957").

</p><p id="p_6">4.          Mr. Pattnaik, learned senior advocate further submitted that in

the meantime opposite party no.4 on the direction of opposite party No.3

has issued and published a notice in the newspaper on 15.02.2011 being

auction notice No.485 to auction several sources of minor mineral including

Jharabahal (RTU-47) Stone Quarry No.1 on 15.03.2011 at 11 A.M. for the

year 2011-12 only. In case the minor mineral sources are put to public

auction and the petitioner fails to get the same, it will amount to closure of

the unit affecting the life and livelihood of not only the petitioner but all

other persons directly and/or indirectly depending on the said industry for

their livlihood. It is also submitted that various circulars and instructions

as have been issued by the Government and other authorities to put the

minor mineral sources specified in item No.(i) of Schedule-III to public

auction, so also Rules 35 and 36 clearly show that the intention of the

Government is only to get maximum revenue, which can also be achieved

by giving lease of sources to the existing manufacturing units by fixing

higher upset price and thereby both the objectives can reasonably co-exist

i.e. the stone crusher owners will be certain of their business being assured

of raw materials and the Govenrment will also get higher revenue.

</p><p id="p_7">5.          Placing reliance on the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

in the cases of <a href="/doc/1281050/" id="a_7">Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of

India</a>, AIR 1979 SC 1628; <a href="/doc/1992295/" id="a_8">D.K. Trivedi and Sons v. State of Gujarat</a>, AIR

others, AIR 1996 SC 911, State of A.P. and others, etc. v. McDowell and Co.

and others etc., AIR 1996 SC 1627, Mr. Pattnaik submitted that the

decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases relied upon by

opposite parties are not applicable to the case of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_8">6.          Per contra, Mr. R.K. Mohapatra, learned Government Advocate

appearing on behalf of opposite party nos.2,3 and 4 submitted that

different sairats owned by the Government are utilized for generation of

revenue.   Individual   hardship   cannot    be   a   ground   to    decide   the

constitutional validity of any provision. In several decisions, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has held that the auction is the best method to grant lease/

licence of State property. The petitioner is not debarred from participating

in the auction to be held as per public notice issued for settling the stone

quarry. It is stated that the Government in Revenue Department vide letter

No.ST-4/2005 36665/R BBSR dated 06.09.2005 have issued instruction

that the sairat sources shall only be settled in public auction as per the

provisions laid down in Chapter-VI under the OMMC Rules, 2004 and 53 of

the Manual of Tahasil accounts. In view of the Government instruction no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      7</span>




lease is permissible and the sources will be settled only by way of auction

and as such the averment of the petitioner is not acceptable.

</p><p id="p_9">7.          Placing reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

in the case of Ramana Dayaram Shetty (supra), Mr. Mohapatra submitted

that all the State largesse should be put to public auction. Further placing

reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/178226192/" id="a_10">Union

of India vs. International Trading Co</a>., AIR 2003 SC 3983, Mr. Mohapatra,

submitted that the State has right to dispose of its mineral recourses

through auction to generate more revenue and that does not violate Articles

14 and 21 of the Constitution. It was also submitted that Rules 35 and 36

of the OMMC Rules have been framed in accordance with <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_11">Section 15</a> of the

MMDR Act, 1957, which do not suffer from any lack of legislative

competency or excessive delegation. Further placing reliance on the

decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Bihar vs.

Bihar Distilleries, (1997) 2 SCC 453; Asst. <a href="/doc/959299/" id="a_12">Director of Inspection vs. A.B.

Santi</a>, (2002) 6 SCC 259, it was submitted that always the presumption is

that the Statute is constitutional and valid. Rule 35 of the OMMC Rules,

2004 starts with a non-obstante clause and therefore, the provisions of

Rule 35 will override the other provisions of the OMMC Rules, 2004. The

makers of this Rule in their wisdom limited the period of lease upto one

year. Different States having prescribed different periods, the provisions of

Rule 36 are not open to challenge. Chapter-VI of the OMMC Rules, 2004
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                        8</span>




contains the detailed procedure with regard to auction. The circular dated

06.09.2008 issued by the Board of Revenue is in accordance with the

provisions of OMMC Rules, 2004 and there is no infirmity, hence, the writ

petition is liable to be rejected. The petitioner has no right to claim negative

equality. Placing reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

the cases of <a href="/doc/447905/" id="a_13">OM Prakash and others vs. State of U.P. and others</a>, (2004) 3

SCC 402; <a href="/doc/616922/" id="a_14">Doiwala Sehkari Shram Samvida Samiti Ltd. vs. State of

Uttaranchal and others</a>, (2007) 11 SCC 641; <a href="/doc/178226192/" id="a_15">Union of India and another vs.

International Trading Co. and another</a> (supra), Mr. Mohapatra submitted

that the State has power to impose reasonable restrictions. Therefore,

<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_16">Article 19(1) (g)</a> of the Constitution is not violated. Further placing reliance

on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1233720/" id="a_17">State of Tamil

Nadu vs. M/s. Hind Stone and others</a>, AIR 1981 SC 711, it was submitted

that the petitioner has no vested right for grant of lease in his favour.

Placing reliance in the case of <a href="/doc/1076424/" id="a_18">Defence Enclave Residents Society vs. State of

U.P. and others</a>, (2004) 8 SCC 321, it was submitted that in contractual

matters, the writ petition is not maintainable.

</p><p id="p_12">9.         Question No.(i) is with regard to maintainability of the writ

petition. Raising the preliminary objection of maintainability of the writ

petition, Mr.R.K.Mohapatra, learned Government Advocate submitted that

the Writ Court should not entertain the present writ petition as the

transaction between the parties is purely a commercial one. It is further

submitted that pure contractual dispute between the parties cannot be

gone into by the Writ Court. In support of his contention, Mr.Mohapatra

placed reliance upon the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

cases of Central Bank of India Vs. Rooplal Bansal, reported in (1999) 9

SCC 254 and Defence Enclave Residents Society (supra). There is no

dispute over the position of law settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

the above two cases. But in the present case, the prayer of the petitioner

basically is of two fold; his first prayer is that Rules 35 and 36 of OMMC

Rules, 2004 are not valid being violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the

Constitution of India. His second prayer is that the opposite party-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                       10</span>




authorities are not justified in rejecting his application for renewal and

going for a fresh tender in respect of Jharabahal (RTU-47) Stone Quarry-1.

The decision making process of opposite party-authorities is arbitrary and

unreasonable. In view of the prayers made in the writ petition, the

contention taken by Mr.Mohapatra, learned Government advocate is not

sustainable and the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court relied upon by

him are of no help to him. Considering the nature of the prayer made in the

writ petition, we are of the view that the writ petition is maintainable.

</p><p id="p_13">10.         Question No.(ii) is whether provisions of Rules 35 and 36 of the

OMMC Rules, 2004 are violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution

</p><p id="p_14">            <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_20">Section 15</a> of Act, 1957 empowers the State Government to

make Rules in respect of all minor minerals. It provides that the State

Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, make rules for

regulating the grant of quarry lease, mining leases or other mineral

concessions in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected

therewith. In exercise of power conferred by sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_21">Section 15</a> of

the Act, 1957 the State Government made the Rules, 2004 for regulating

grant of mineral concession in respect of minor minerals. Chapter-VI of the

said Rules deals with auction of minor minerals. Rule 35 provides that

notwithstanding anything mentioned in the rules, sources of minor

minerals specified in Item I(i) of Schedule III shall be sold or disposed of by

public auction on such terms and conditions as may be specified in the

auction sale notice by the competent authority. Rule 36 provides that the

auction shall be valid for a maximum period of one year from the date of

execution of auction agreement. Rule 37 provides for fixation of upset price.

Rule 38 provides that when an area containing minor minerals is to be

disposed of through public auction the competent authority shall issue a

notice giving reasonable publicity so as to obtain best possible price.

Therefore, it cannot be said that Rules 35 and 36 of the OMMC Rules, 2004

suffer from any lack of legislative competence or excessive delegation.

constitutional and valid and the rule-making power conferred thereunder

upon the State Government does not amount to excessive delegation of

legislative power to the executive. Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1632341/" id="a_23">Section 13</a> which is

illustrative of the general power conferred by <a href="/doc/1574167/" id="a_24">Section 13(1)</a> contains

sufficient guidelines for the State Government to follow in framing the rules

under <a href="/doc/1661544/" id="a_25">Section 15(1)</a>, and the same way, the State Governments have before

               must adopt its that dynamic meaning which
               uphold the validity of any provision. This
               dynamism is the cause of saving many statutes of

               the 'Preamble,' Statement of Objects and Reasons

<p id="p_17">13.            Law is well settled that there is always presumption of

constitutional validity of the statute. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

in (1997) 2 SCC 453 held that an Act cannot be struck down merely by

saying that it as arbitrary. Court should try to sustain its validity to the

extent possible by ironing out defects, if any, in drafting. <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_30">An Act</a> should be

declared as void only when its unconstitutionality is clearly established. An

interpretation which renders the enactment an exercise in futility should be

avoided.
</p>
<p id="p_18">14.         Chapter-VI of the Rules, 2004 contains the detailed procedure

with regard to auction of Sairats. Moreover, considering the nature of the

Sairat, Rule 35 provides that minerals specified in Item 1(i) of Schedule-III

are to be disposed of by public auction. The minor minerals specified in

item 1(i) of Schedule-III are:- Ordinary clay, silt, rehmatti, ordinary sand

other than used for industrial and prescribed purposes, brick-earth,

ordinary earth, moorum, laterite slabs, ordinary boulders, road metals

including ballasts, chips, bajri and rock fines generated from stone

crushers, gravels of ordinary stones and river shingles and pebbles.

</p><p id="p_19">15.         Chapter-VI of the OMMC Rules, 2004 is framed to get the best

price from leasing out different sairats which are owned by the

Government. Generation of maximum revenue with a view to secure

maximum benefit to the community is in the larger public interest and

individual hardship cannot be a ground to decide the constitutional validity

of any provision, if such provision is otherwise validly enacted. The

petitioner cannot claim any right to enjoy State largesse in perpetuity,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                       14</span>




contrary to the specific provision of law. Law is well settled that the auction

is the best method to grant lease / licence of State property in order to

make the procedure fair, equitable and transparent and to generate

maximum revenue for the State. In such process, the petitioner is also

getting an opportunity to participate in the auction. Since Rules 35 and 36

of the OMMC Rules, 2004 have enacted for larger interest of the Society

and fair opportunity was given to everybody, it can not be said that the

provisions of Rules 35 and 36 of the OMMC Rules, 2004 are arbitrary and

discriminatory in nature and violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the

Constitution of India and therefore, invalid.
</p>
<p id="p_20">16.         Apart from the above, Rule 35 of the Rules, 2004 starts with a

non-obstante clause, i.e., notwithstanding anything mentioned in the

Rules. Therefore, the provisions of Rule 35 will override the other

provisions of the Rules, 2004. The makers of the said rule, in their wisdom,

thought it appropriate to limit the period of auction up to a maximum

period of one year, because it will encourage competition among the

interested persons and prevent monopoly of any particular person.

Therefore, the maximum period of auction prescribed in Rule 36 of the

Rules, 2004 is reasonable, fair, non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory and

for this reason also it cannot be said Rules 35 and 36 of the OMMC Rules,

2004 are violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.

public auction for the purpose of sale and disposal ?
</p>
<p id="p_22">18.         Law is well settled that no person has any right of renewal of

right to the grant or renewal of a lease and none can claim a vested right

to have an application for the grant or renewal of a lease dealt with in a

particular way, by applying particular provisions. In the absence of any

vested right in anyone, an application for lease has necessarily to be dealt

with according to the rules in force on the date of the disposal of the

application despite the fact that there is a long delay since the making of

the application.

public property, the executive must make an endeavour to dispose it of by

pubic auction or by inviting tenders, though that is the ordinary rule, may

not be an invariable rule. Where there are compelling circumstances

necessitating the departure therefrom then the reasons for the departure

Appearance of public justice is as important as doing justice. Therefore, in

case of dealing with public property, certain percepts and principles have to

be observed and public interest is the paramount consideration and when a

public property is disposed of, they should try to get the maximum price.

Reference was also made to the meeting held on 07.07.2009 by the said

Core Group which has discussed the impact that may be caused by

quarrying/mining of minor minerals on riverbeds and ground waters. It

was noticed that individual mines of minor minerals being small in size

may have insignificant impact; however, their collective impacts taking into

consideration various mines on a regional scale, is significantly adverse.

The report of Core Group, which is referred to in the order clearly indicates

that portion of mines of minor minerals needs to be subjected to strict

regulatory parameters as that of mines of major minerals. It was also felt

necessary to have a re-look to the definition of "minor" minerals per se. The

necessity of the preparation of "comprehensive mines plan" for contiguous

stretches of mineral deposits by the respective State Governments may also

be encouraged and the same be suitably incorporated in the Mineral

Concession Rules, 1960 by the Ministry of Mines.

<p id="p_36">28.           Further, in the Core Committee report, it is recommended that

States and Union Territories would see that mining of minor minerals is

subjected to simpler but strict regulatory regime and carried out only under

an approved framework of mining plan. It is further observed that a proper

framework has also to be evolved on cluster of mining of minor mineral for

which there must be a Regional Environmental Management Plan. There

are eight recommendations made in the report of the Mineral Concession

Rules for mining of minor minerals under <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_46">Section 15</a> of MMDR Act, which

reads thus:
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">      (1)     Minimum size of mine lease should be 5 ha.
      (2)     Minimum period of mine lease should be 5 years.
      (3)     A cluster approach to mines should be taken in case of
              smaller mines leases operating currently.
      (4)     Mine plans should be made mandatory for minor
              minerals as well.
      (5)     A separate corpus should be created for reclamation
              and rehabilitation of mined out areas.
      (6)     Hydro-geological    reports   should   be   prepared   for
              mining proposed below groundwater table.
      (7)     For river bed mining, leases should be granted stretch
</pre><p id="p_37">              wise, depth may be restricted to 3m/water level,
              whichever is less, and safety zones should be worked
              out.
</p><p id="p_38">      (8)     The present classification of minerals into major and
              minor categories should be reexamined by the Ministry
              of Mines in consultation with the States.

</p><p id="p_40">29.           The draft rules called The Minor Minerals Conservation and

Development Rules, 2010 were also put on the website. <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_47">Section 15(1A)(i)</a> of

the MMDR Act specifies the manner in which rehabilitation of flora and

other vegetation, such as trees, shrubs and the like destroyed by reasons of

any quarrying or mining operations shall be made in the same area or in

any other area once selected by the State Government, either by way of

reimbursement of the cost of rehabilitation or otherwise by the persons

holding the quarrying or mining lease. The State Government/Union

Territories   have   to   give   due   weightage   to   the   above   mentioned

recommendations of the MoEF which are made in consultation with all the

State Governments and Union Territories. The Model Rules of 2010 issued

by the Ministry of Mines are very vital from the environmental, ecological

and bio-diversity point of view.

<p id="p_41">30.           After referring to the above said report and recommendations,

the Hon'ble Supreme Court felt the necessity to have an effective framework

of mining plan and further made observation after taking note of those

technical, scientific and environmental matters, MoEF, Government of

India, issued various recommendations in March, 2010 followed by the

Model Rules, which is in the spirit of <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_48">Article 48A</a>, <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_49">Article 51A(g)</a> read with

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_50">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Having said so, the Hon'ble Supreme Court

at paragraph 17 of the judgment directed the States and Union Territories,

MoEF and the Ministry of Mines to give effect to the recommendations
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                        24</span>




made by MoEF in its report of March, 2010 and the model guidelines

framed by the Ministry of Mines, within a period of six months from the

date of that judgment and submit their compliance reports.

</p><p id="p_42">31.          In view of the above said direction, the State Government is

required to reframe the Minor Minerals Concession Rules in the light of the

model guidelines framed by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India

referred to supra keeping in view various aspects highlighted by the Core

Committee and issues raised by it and recommendations made by the

Government of India. Further, keeping in view the size of the leased area,

the definition of the minor mineral and environmental impact, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has said that lessee may be permitted to quarry the mineral

from the sairat source in question at least for a period of five years.

</p><p id="p_43">32.          Therefore, the application of the petitioner, who is already

lessee may be considered by putting the sairat source to public auction. It

is open for any category of applicant referred to in Rule 27 including the

petitioner to participate in public auction of minor mineral and in case the

petitioner is not found to be the highest bidder, but agrees to match with

the price at which the bid is knocked, preference shall be given to him even

though he is not the highest bidder. We make this observation keeping in

view the provision of Rules 27, 35 and 36 of the OMMC Rules, 2004 vis-à-

vis interest of the State which really means the larger interest of the people

of the State. If the sairat is settled in favour of the petitioner, then the same

        observation made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its order in the case of

        Deepak Kumar etc (supra) subject to payment of consideration money in

        each succeeding year which shall be fixed by increasing 15% of the

        consideration money of the immediate preceding year.
