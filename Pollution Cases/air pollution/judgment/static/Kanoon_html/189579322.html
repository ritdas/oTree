                    Writ Petition (PIL) No. 117 of 2019
                                   With
         Misc. Application with Counter Affidavit No.13868 of 2019

Mr. Vivek Shukla, petitioner, in-person.
Mr. Vikas Pande, Standing Counsel for the State.

       Hon'ble Alok Kumar Verma, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">              Misc. application is allowed and the counter-affidavit, filed on behalf
of the seventh respondent, is taken on record.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.           In the counter-affidavit by the Executive Engineer (Irrigation Division)
dated 12.10.2019 it is stated that the land (said to be in the possession of the first
respondent) belongs to the Revenue Department; further construction work of the
wall in question has been stopped by issuing notice dated 22.08.2019, to the
Manager of the first respondent, by the Irrigation Department; and since the land
belongs to the Revenue Department, all proceedings relating to demolition, if any,
is to be carried out by the Revenue Department.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.            Enclosed to the counter-affidavit is a notice dated 22.08.2019, calling
upon the Manager of the Parmarth Niketan Trust to remove the encroachment
within three days. The three day period, stipulated in the notice dated 22.08.2019,
expired on 25.08.2019 nearly three months ago. Further, this notice dated
22.08.2019 is enclosed along with the counter-affidavit dated 12.10.2019, which
was filed more than a month and a half after the three day notice period expired on
25.08.2019 and, yet, the counter-affidavit dated 12.10.2019 is silent as to what
action the Irrigation Department has taken to remove the encroachment. Since the
Executive Engineer (Irrigation) states that the land belongs to the Revenue
Department, and the demolition exercise has to be undertaken by them, we
consider it appropriate to suo-motu implead the Secretary, Revenue, Government
of Uttarakhand as the eighth respondent in the Writ Petition.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           2</span>



<p id="p_4">4.           The District Magistrate, who is the in-charge of the revenue
administration of Pauri Garhwal district, has been arrayed as the second respondent
in the Writ Petition; and, since government land would come under his control, he
is obligated to cause an inquiry and submit a report to this Court as to whether land,
belonging to the Revenue Department, has been encroached upon by the first
respondent; and if so, what action has been taken by the State Government/District
Administration to remove such encroachments. The seventh respondent-Executive
Engineer (Irrigation) shall also state, by way of an affidavit to be filed before the
next date of hearing, as to what action he has taken, pursuant to the notice issued
by him on 22.08.2019 to the Manager of the Parmarth Niketan Trust, though the
period stipulated therein expired on 25.08.2019 nearly three months ago.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.           In its counter-affidavit, the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and
Pollution Control Board states that the first respondent has not obtained consent to
establish and/or consent to operate from the Uttarakhand Environment Protection
and Pollution Control Board under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>. 1981, as amended,
as applicable.
</p>

<p id="p_6">6.           What is, however, not stated in the counter-affidavit is whether or not
the first respondent was required to obtain consent to establish and consent to
operate. Mr. Aditya Pratap Singh, learned Standing Counsel appearing for the
Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board, would submit
that every establishment, which has more than twenty rooms, can only operate the
establishment with the prior consent of the Uttarakhand Environment Protection
and Pollution Control Board; and, if the allegations of the petitioner are true, the
first respondent must then be held to be carrying on operations, though he could
not have done so without obtaining prior approval of the Board.
</p>

<p id="p_7">7.           Whether or not twenty rooms are being operated in the said
establishment is a question of fact which the Uttarakhand Environment Protection
and Pollution Control Board is required to ascertain. While Mr. Vivek Shukla,
petitioner in-person, states that there are more than hundred rooms, we do not wish
to proceed on the basis of these allegations alone and, instead, consider it
appropriate to direct the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           3</span>



Control Board to cause an inspection of the premises forthwith, and to submit a
report to this Court latest by 27.11.2019. In case, the first respondent is found to
have violated the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the
Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>. 1981, the report shall also state as to
what action the Board intends taking against the first respondent for such alleged
violations.
</p>

<p id="p_8">8.            The District Magistrate, Pauri Garhwal shall also cause an inspection
forthwith of the said premises, and submit a report to this Court latest by
29.11.2019 as to whether or not the first respondent has encroached upon revenue
land belonging to the State Government; and, if so, what action is proposed to be
taken by them in this regard.
</p>

<p id="p_9">9.            Post on 02.12.2019 in the daily list immediately after 'fresh admission
matters'. Both the reports of the District Magistrate, Pauri Garhwal and the
Member Secretary, Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control
Board shall be placed before us on that date.
</p>

<p id="p_10">10.           The Executive Engineer (Irrigation) shall also explain, by way of an
affidavit to be filed before 02.12.2019, as to what action he has taken pursuant to
the notice issued by him on 22.08.2019.
</p>

<p id="p_11">11.           Supplementary/rejoinder affidavit, if any, in the meanwhile.
</p>

<p id="p_12">12.           Let a certified copy of this order be furnished to the learned counsel
for the parties, today itself, on payment of the prescribed charges.
