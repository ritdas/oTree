HEADNOTE:



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">		      JUDGMENT
B.P.JEEVAN REDDY.J.
</p><p id="p_2">     Leave granted. Heard counsel for the parties.
     These appeals  arise from	a judgment  of the  Himachal
Pradesh	 High	Court  disposing  of  eight  writ  petitions
together.
</p><p id="p_3">     Katha is a necessary ingredient in pan and pan masalas.
Katha is derived from the khair tree. The central portion of
the tree  is used for this purpose. These trees are found in
considerable number  in the  State of Himachal Pradesh. They
are also found in other States but it appears that one after
the other,  various States  have banned the cutting of khair
trees, with  the result	 that those intending to manufacture
katha have  been flocking  to Himachal Pradesh over the last
few years.
</p><p id="p_4">     Till the year 1975, katha was being manufactured in the
State of  Himachal Pradesh  only by 'bhattiwalas'. Since the
manufacture of	katha requires extremely cold conditions, it
is stated,  the manufacture of katha was being undertaken in
bhatties only  during the  winter season.  In the year 1975,
however, a  mechanised unit  was established in the State by
Shankar Trading	 Company for  the manufacture  of katha. The
manufacture  of	 katha	can  go	 on  round  the	 year  in  a
mechanised unit.  The mechanised  unit consumes	 far  larger
quantities of khair wood than all the bhatties put together.
</p><p id="p_5">     Himachal Pradesh  is an  industrially  backward  State.
Like other  States, it	too has	 been evolving	schemes	 for
encouraging  the   industrialisation  of  the  State.  By  a
Notification dated  May 13,  1974, the	Governor of Himachal
Pradesh established  the Industrial  Projects  Approval	 and
Review Authority  (IPARA) comprising  Chief Secretary to the
Government, Secretaries	 to the	 Departments of Multipurpose
Projects and  Power, Public  Works, Industries	and  Finance
besides Chairman  of the  Himachal Pradesh State Electricity
Board, Chief  Conservator of Forests, Chief Engineer, P.W.D.
and the	 Director of  Industries. The terms of reference and
the activities	to be undertaken by the IPARA were specified
as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "(i) To  act  as  the  focal  point  for
     dissemination of  information  regarding
     programmes of  Government assistance and
     incentives to entrepreneurs.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     (ii) To  receive	all  application  for
     setting up	 of factories  in medium  and
     large scale sector.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     (iii)     To  process  the	 applications
     for establishment	of new industries and
     select projects for Government approval.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     (iv) To arrange all necessary assistance
     required	  for	   the	   successful
     implementation of approved projects from
     various Govt.  Departments and to act as
     the channel  of correspondence  and  the
     coordinating    agency    between	  the
     entrepreneurs  and	  various   concerned
     Govt. Departments.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     (v)  To review  the progress of approved
     projects.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     (vi) To recommend	necessary changes  in
     the    Government	  policy    regarding
     Industrial Development  in the  light of
     experience gained.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     (vii)  Such   other   matters   as	  the
     Government may  refer of delegate to the
     Authority from time to time."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">			     (Emphasis added)
     On	 November  29,	1990  IPARA  was  abolished  by	 the
Government. It	appears	 to  have  been	 revived  later.  By
Notification dated September 3, 1993, the President of India
(Himachal Pradesh  was	then  under  the  President's  rule)
reconstituted IPARA  with a  more expansive  membership. The
terms of  reference and	 the activities	 to be undertaken by
the IPARA,  however, remained  the same as were contained in
the Notification  dated May  13, 1977.	It  is	stated	that
during the  period IPARA  was not in existence, the Director
of Industries, Himachal Pradesh was looking after that work.
</blockquote><p id="p_6">Applications   received	   from	  entrepreneurs	   proposing
establishment of  industrial units  in Himachal Pradesh were
being processed	 in the first instance by IPARA - and during
the period  when IPARA was not in existence, by the Director
of Industries.
</p><p id="p_7">     Several units  applied to	IPARA/Director of Industries
during the  years  1992	 and  1993  proposing  to  establish
mechanised units  for manufacturing  katha. In	all, fifteen
units applied  but we  are concerned  only with	 eight	such
units in  these appeals.  We  shall,  therefore,  state	 the
particulars with respect to these eight units only:
</p><p id="p_8">     As indicated  in the  Table, the  applications made  by
these units  were considered  by the sub-committee of IPARA,
which granted  "approval" to  all the  applicants. Since the
said "approval"	 was supposed  to be  provisional in nature,
all the	 proposals were	 put  up  for  fuller  consideration
before the  full committee  of IPARA. The full committee met
on August  28,	1993  and  decided  to	recommend  units  at
S1.Nos.1 to  3 and  5 to  7 for	 government's  approval.  It
rejected the  proposals of  others including  the  units  at
S1.Nos.4 and  8 in  the Table on the ground that they failed
to take	 any steps  to set up the factories pursuant to sub-
committee's approval. The matter was then placed before H.E.
The Governor.
</p><p id="p_9">     Out of  the said  six units, only the first three units
have been  approved by the Governor. In the case of units at
S1.Nos.5 to  7, the  Governor has  declined to approve. This
decision was  taken by	the Governor  of Himachal Pradesh on
September 15,  1993. The proceedings of the meeting of IPARA
held on	 August 28,  1993 and the order of H.E. The Governor
have been  placed before us. (Himachal Pradesh was under the
President's rule then.)
     Just about	 the  time  the	 Governor  (government)	 was
taking his  decision, Writ  Petition No.1455 of 1993 came to
be filed  by Sri Yogendra Chandra, M.L.A. for issuance of an
appropriate writ  restraining the government from permitting
the establishment  of any  katha units	in the	State on the
ground that  such establishment would lead to indiscriminate
felling of  khair trees	 which would have a deep and adverse
effect upon  the environment  and ecology  of the  State. He
submitted that	the raw	 material  available  in  the  State
(khair trees)  for manufacturing  katha is not sufficient to
sustain the  proposed industries,  as  many  as	 fifteen  in
number, and  hence no  permission should  be granted for new
units.	Soon   afterwards,  Shankar   Trading  Company,	 the
existing mechanised  unit, filed  Writ Petition	 No.1475  of
1973 for  an appropriate  writ restraining the Government of
Himachal Pradesh  from granting permission for establishment
of any	new  unit  on  the  ground  that  the  raw  material
available in  the State	 is not	 adequate to sustain any new
units. According to this petitioner, the entire raw material
available is  hardly sufficient	 to meet its own requirement
and the	 requirement  of  bhattiwalas.	It  relied  upon  an
agreement entered  into	 with  the  Government	of  Himachal
Pradesh	 whereunder   fifty  percent  of  the  raw  material
extracted in a year has to be sold to it.
</p><p id="p_10">     Soon after	 the Governor's	 decision aforementioned was
communicated to	 the concerned parties, three writ petitions
came to	 be filed  by the  units at  S1.Nos.5 to  7  in	 the
aforementioned Table, viz., Writ Petition No.1576 of 1993 by
Dev Bhoomi  Industries, Writ  Petition No.  1590 of  1993 by
Ganesh Wood  Products and  Writ Petition  No.145 of  1994 by
Naman Wood  Products. Two  other Writ  Petitions, No.1479 of
1994 and  611 of 1994 were filed by Indian Wood Products and
Chander Katha  Products. There was yet another writ petition
(1489 of  1993) filed by one Ved Prakash espousing the cause
of Bhattiwalas.
</p><p id="p_11">     After hearing  the parties	 and perusing  the  relevant
records, the  High Court dismissed Writ Petition Nos.1455 of
1993 and  1475 of  1993 filed  by Sri  Yogendra Chandra	 and
Shankar	 Trading   Company  respectively.  It  allowed	Writ
Petition Nos.1576  of 1993, 1590 of 1993 and 145 of 1994 and
quashed the  orders of the Government refusing permission to
these three  persons to establish their units. So far as the
writ petitions	filed by  Indian Wood  Products and  Chander
Katha Industries (Writ Petition Nos. 1479 of 1993 and 611 of
1994) are  concerned, they  were allowed with a direction to
the authorities of the State to reconsider their case in the
light of  the observations  made in  the judgment. S.L.P.(C)
Nos.12754-58 of	 1995 are preferred by the State of Himachal
Pradesh, S.L.P.(C) No.11082 of 1995 is preferred by Yogendra
Chandra and  S.L.P.(C) Nos.11086-11089	of 1995	 by  Shankar
Trading Company against the judgment of the High Court.
</p><p id="p_12">     The learned  Additional  Solicitor	 General,  Sri	V.R.
Reddy,	submitted   that  the  provisional  registration  or
"approval", as	it is  called by  IPARA, did  not confer any
right upon  any of the units inasmuch as the said "approval"
was  subject  to  final	 approval  by  the  government.	 The
Governor has  taken into  consideration the  availability of
raw material in the State and arrived at the conclusion that
it can	sustain only  three units  viz., Doon  Katha, Orient
Herbs and  Sagar Katha	besides the  existing one.  Of these
three  units,	Doon  Katha   is  a  very  small  unit;	 its
consumption is	almost as much as that of a bhatti. Thus, in
truth, only  two units	have been permitted. It is true that
the IPARA recommended the case of six units, viz., the three
units  aforesaid   and	Ganesh	Wood  Products,	 Naman	Wood
Products and  Dev Bhoomi Industries but the Governor did not
agree with  the said  recommendation and  selected the first
three  units  applying	the  principle	'first	come,  first
served'. No  valid objection  can be  taken to the orders of
the government	since they  are conceived in public interest
keeping in  view the  availability of  the raw material. The
learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that the High
Court exceeded	the  well  recognised  constraints  of	writ
jurisdiction in	 taking upon itself the determination of the
availability of	 raw material and on that basis quashing the
orders of the government.
</p><p id="p_13">     Sri K.  Madhava Reddy, learned counsel for Sri Yogendra
Chandra submitted  that the  High Court was not justified in
holding	 that  the  appellant  Yogendra	 Chandra  cannot  be
"accepted as  a public	spirited  citizen  approaching	this
Court to protect the public interest", merely because he was
not able  to place before the Court reliable data in support
of his	allegation of  illicit felling of trees in the past.
Learned counsel	 contended that	 while rightly	holding that
there was  no evidence of collusion between Yogendra Chandra
and  Shankar   Trading	Company,  the  Court  erred  in	 not
entertaining his writ petition as a bonafide public interest
litigation.
</p><p id="p_14">     Sri P.P.  Rao, learned  counsel appearing	for  Shankar
Trading Company submitted that the raw material available in
the State  is not  sufficient to feed any new units and that
this fact  has been  repeatedly brought to the notice of the
government by  the Chief Conservator of Forests, who must be
deemed to  be the  person fully	 aware of the true situation
regarding the  availability of raw material. Learned counsel
submitted that	the permission	granted to  the	 respondent-
units is in violation of the provisions of several statutes,
both Central and State.
</p><p id="p_15">     Sri Dushyant Dave, learned counsel appearing for Ganesh
Wood Products  (one of	the respondents	 in  these  appeals)
submitted that	after the introduction of the New Industrial
Policy (Liberalisation	Policy) and the notifications issued
in that behalf by the Government of India, a citizen of this
country	 has  an  unquestioned	and  an	 absolute  right  to
establish a  small-scale industry  at any time, at any place
and of	whatever capacity  he may  choose. He submitted that
Katha industry	is not	governed by  <a href="/doc/800551/" id="a_1">Industries	 Development
(Regulation) Act</a>,  1951, (I.D.R.Act)  hence  no	 licence  or
permission is  necessary from the authorities under the said
Act for	 establishing a	 katha factory, more so in the small
scale sector.  The government's	 duty is  merely to register
the units  being set  up. It  is bound	to register  any and
every application  for establishing  a small-scale  industry
and it	has no	power to  cancel, revoke  or disapprove such
registration. Learned  counsel submitted further that on the
basis of  approval granted  by IPARA, the government granted
registration to	 Ganesh Wood  Products on  June 21, 1993 and
has communicated  the same  to it.  Indeed, by	a subsequent
communication  dated   18th  August,  1993,  the  government
restricted its	capacity  to  3600  metric  tons  (2400	 cu.
meters). Even the full IPARA meeting held on August 28, 1993
recommended the	 case of Ganesh Wood Products. The rejection
by the	Governor is  based on  no reasons and is, therefore,
liable to  be set  aside as  an arbitrary  decision. Learned
counsel relied	upon certain  material	in  support  of	 his
proposition that  the particulars  of raw material available
in the State is more than sufficient to sustain not only the
three units  permitted by  the Governor	 but also  the three
units recommended by the IPARA in its meeting held on August
28, 1993.  He  submitted  that	bonafides  of  Sri  Yogendra
Chandra are  suspect and  that he  has been put up really by
Shankar Trading	 Company. So  far as Shankar Trading Company
is concerned,  the learned  counsel  submitted	that  it  is
seeking to  merely ensure  that all  the raw material in the
State is  reserved for	itself by excluding all other units.
It is  submitted that  in the  interest of  growers of khair
trees and  in the  interest  of	 public	 and  the  State  of
Himachal Pradesh, new units must be allowed to come up.
</p><p id="p_16">     Sri Gopal	Subramaniam, learned  counsel for Dev Bhoomi
(another   respondent	in   these   appeals)	urged	four
contentions:
</p><p id="p_17">1.   that the  order of	 the Governor made without notice to
affected parties  is in	 violation of  principles of natural
justice since  no notice  was given  to them before refusing
approval;.
</p><p id="p_18">2.   that the  High Court  was justified  in going  into the
merits of  the case  and quashing the orders of the Governor
on merits  in the  particular facts and circumstances of the
case;
</p><p id="p_19">3.   that the  State Government	 is  not  without  power  to
regulate the  supplies of  raw material	 in case it think it
necessary  or	expedient.  There   are	 enough	  enactments
empowering it to do so;
</p><p id="p_20">4.   The recommendations  of IPARA  made in its meeting held
on August  28, 1993  were considered  decisions	 arrived  at
after taking  into consideration  all aspects of the matter.
It applied  a legitimate  criteria in  diseinguishing Ganesh
Wood Products, Naman Wood Products and Dev Bhoomi Industries
from others.  IPARA was	 of the	 opinion that  no new  units
should be  permitted but those units that have already acted
upon the approval granted by IPARA should be allowed to come
up and	function. The  Governor's action  is devoid  of	 any
reasons.  The  alleged	protests  of  Chief  Conservator  of
Forests contained  in his  letters are of no significance in
view of	 the fact  that though	he was a member of IPARA, he
never recorded	his protest  to any of the approvals granted
to several units.
</p><p id="p_21">     Learned counsel  further pointed  out that	 khair trees
were included in the Schedule to the Himachal Pradesh Forest
Produce (Regulation  of Trade)	Act,  1982  by	Notification
dated April  30, 1991  but that	 the  same  was	 deleted  by
another Notification  issued on	 November 18,  1991. In this
view of	 the matter,  the  learned  counsel  contended,	 the
Governor's action is unsustainable in law.
</p><p id="p_22">     Mrs.Roxana Swamy,	learned counsel	 appearing  for	 the
Naman  Wood  Products  (another	 respondent)  supported	 the
contentions of Sri Dave and Sri Gopal Subramaniam.
</p><p id="p_23">     Sri Arun  Jaitley, learned counsel appearing for Indian
Wood Products  and the	learned counsel	 for  Chandra  Katha
respectively (respondents) submitted that they too had acted
upon  the  approval  granted  by  IPARA	 and  have  invested
substantial amounts in acquiring the land and setting up the
units and  if only  they had been given an opportunity, they
would have  established their contention. They supported the
submissions of Sri Gopal Subramaniam and Sri Dave.
</p><p id="p_24">     Sri Dholakia  and Sri  M.S.Ganesh appearing  for  Sagar
Katha  (yet   another  respondent)   disputed  the   several
contentions raised by the learned counsel for the appellants
and  submitted	 that  the   Governor  has  rightly  granted
permission to  Sagar Katha  and that there are absolutely no
grounds to  interfere with  the	 same  at  the	instance  of
Yogendra   Chandra   or	  Shankar   Trading   Company.	 Sri
Balakrishnan, learned  counsel	for  Orient  Herbs  advanced
submissions on the same lines.
</p><p id="p_25">     LAW APPLICABLE:
</p><p id="p_26">     Katha industry is not in the schedule to the Industries
Development and	 <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_2">Regulation Act</a>.  The provisions  regulating
the establishment  of industries  contained in the said Act,
therefore, have no application to this industry. There is no
corresponding enactment made by the legislature of the State
of  Himachal   Pradesh	governing   the	  establishment	  of
industries similar  to I.D.R.  Act. At	the  same  time,  by
virtue of Entry 24 of List-II of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution,  "industries"-  subject,	of  course,  to	 the
provisions of  Entries 7  and 52  of List-I  - is  a  matter
within the  exclusive province of the States. In the absence
of an enactment, the executive power of the State extends to
the said subject matter [<a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_3">Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya Kapur And Ors.
v. State  of Punjab</a>  (1955  (2)	 S.C.R.225)].  The  Himachal
Pradesh Government  has not only evolved a forest policy but
has also  framed certain guidelines with a view to encourage
the industrialisation  of  the	State.	It  has	 constituted
IPARA, as  far back  as 1974,  with the	 same  purpose.	 The
functions  of	the  said   authority  have  been  the	same
throughout,  viz.,   to	 act   as  the	 focal	 point	 for
dissemination  of   information	 regarding   programmes	  of
government  assistance	 and  incentives   to  entrepreneurs
generally. In  particular, it  is empowered "(ii) to receive
all applications  for setting  up of factories in medium and
large scale sector and (iii) to process the applications for
establishment of  new industries  and  select  projects	 for
government approval".  Indubitably, clause  (iii)  takes  in
industries in  small scale  sector as well. The authority is
further required  "(iv) to  arrange all necessary assistance
required for  the successful  implementation of the approved
projects from  various government  departments and to act as
the channel of correspondence and as the coordinating agency
between the  entrepreneurs and	various concerned government
departments". In  short, this  authority is  to act  as	 the
nodal agency.  It is also expected to review the progress of
approved projects  and to  recommend  necessary	 changes  in
government policy  regarding industrial	 development in	 the
light of experience gained.
</p><p id="p_27">     We may  reiterate that  IPARA is  not established under
any statutory  provision and its acts and proceedings do not
have any  statutory sanction.  The idea	 is to encourage new
industries and	to provide necessary assistance to them. The
more relevant  function of  the authority  from the point of
view of the controversy herein is the power, or function, as
it  may	  be  called,	"to  process  the  applications	 for
establishment of  new industries  and  select  projects	 for
government approval".  This clause  makes it  clear that the
function of  the authority was not to grant approval for any
new industry  but only	to process their applications and to
select projects	 for government's  consideration; it was for
the government	to approve  them. It  is equally relevant to
note that  the Notifications  constituting or reconstituting
the IPARA  do not  say anywhere	 that  no  industry  can  be
established  unless  it	 applies  to  IPARA  or	 unless	 its
application is	processed by  IPARA, nor  do they  say	that
unless approved	 by  the  Government,  no  industry  can  be
established in	the State.  This means that if there are any
enactments  or	other  statutory  provisions  governing	 the
establishment of  industries, they  have to be complied with
by the	intending entrepreneurs. The IPARA or the Government
of Himachal  Pradesh propose neither add to those provisions
nor do they purport to detract therefrom.
</p><p id="p_28">     Evidently because it was in their interest, the fifteen
units proposing	 to establish  katha factories	in  Himachal
Pradesh (including  the units  concerned in  this  batch  of
appeals) applied  to IPARA - and during the period the IPARA
was not	 in existence,	to the	Director of Industries - for
approval of  their projects.  They knew	 full well  that  if
their applications are approved by the government, they will
have several  advantages in  the matter	 of acquiring  land,
obtaining power	 connection, obtaining water supplies and in
various other  matters relevant	 to successful establishment
and running  of the  industry. Now, it cannot be denied that
the power  to approve includes the power to decline approval
and the	 power to  disapprove. And  that  is  all  that	 has
happened now.  The Government of Himachal Pradesh has chosen
to approve  only three	units, viz., Doon Katha, Sagar Katha
and Orient  Herbs and  it has  refused to  approve the	rest
including Ganesh  Wood Products, Naman Wood Products and Dev
Bhoomi Industries  (Hari Krishan).  So far  as	Indian	Wood
Products and  Chander Katha  Products are  concerned,  their
cases were  not even  put up to the government because their
cases were rejected even by the IPARA. When this is done, it
is argued by learned counsel, Sri Dave, appearing for Ganesh
Wood Products  that the	 government has	 no power to decline
the approval  or  to  disapprove  the  provisional  approval
granted	 by   IPARA.  Learned  counsel	contended  that	 the
government can	only register  an unit	but  it	 cannot	 de-
register it  nor can  it refuse	 to register  it. We  cannot
agree. The notifications constituting IPARA, whether of 1974
or of  1993, do	 not speak  of	registering  any  unit.	 The
argument of  the learned  counsel, therefore, means that any
and every application for establishment of new industry must
necessarily be	approved by  the  government  and  that	 the
government has	no power  to refuse  to approve	 nor can  it
disapprove any	provisional approval granted earlier. We are
unable to  understand or  appreciate the  logic behind	this
argument,  more	  particularly,	 in   view  of	the  further
contention of  the learned counsel that since the I.D.R. Act
does not  govern the establishment of this industry and also
because of  the	 liberalisation	 policy	 introduced  by	 the
Central Government  in 1991,  no permission of any authority
whatsoever is  required for  establishing the katha industry
in small  scale sector.	 If the	 contention of	the  learned
counsel is that by virtue of the liberalisation policy or by
virtue of  the position	 of law	 obtaining as  on today - as
understood by  him -  a	 citizen  of  this  country  has  an
absolute and  unbridled freedom to establish any small scale
industry anywhere  in the  country, he is free to do so. The
impugned order	of the	government  does  not  say  that  he
cannot. It  does not  prohibit	him  from  establishing	 the
industry. All  that the	 government says, and means, is that
if any	one  wants  to	come  to  it  or  to  the  authority
established by	it, viz.,  IPARA, for  approval then he must
submit to  the regimen established by the government in that
behalf and to its policies. While approving the projects, it
is certainly  open to  the government  to  say	that  having
regard to  the availability of the raw material it shall not
approve	 more  than  a	particular  number  of	units  in  a
particular industry  or of  more than a particular capacity.
It is entitled to say that the available raw material in the
State should  be exploited  in an  even and  balanced manner
keeping in  mind the availability of the raw material in the
years to come. It is entitled to make an estimate of the raw
material available  from the government sources as also from
the private  sources  and  say	that  the  raw	material  so
available can feed only so many industries and no more.
</p><p id="p_29">     We may  make it  clear that we do not approve or accept
the contention	urged by  Sri Dave that as on today there is
no law	preventing any person from establishing any industry
anywhere so  long as  it is  not governed by the I.D.R. Act.
That question  does not	 arise in  these writ  petitions and
appeals. All that we have stated is that if that is what any
person thinks,	it is  for  him	 to  act  according  to	 his
conviction and take the consequences, if any, of his action.
</p><p id="p_30">     In short,	the position  is this: the impugned order of
the Government	of Himachal Pradesh (made by the Governor of
Himachal Pradesh)  on September	 3, 1993 is not traceable to
any statutory  provision or  statutory power.  It is made in
exercise  of  its  executive  power.  While  acting  in	 its
executive capacity,  the government  is entitled to lay down
policies and  preferences in  the  interest  of	 State,	 its
economy and  keeping in	 view the  National  Forest  Policy,
Himachal Pradesh  Forest Policy	 and the  Central and  State
enactments relevant  in that  behalf. The only obligation of
the State  in such  an event  would be	to extend a fair and
equitable treatment  to all persons coming before it. Having
approached the	IPARA and  the government  for approval, the
respondents (persons intending to set up katha units) cannot
</p><p id="p_31">- when the approval is refused - turn round and say that the
government has	no power  to refuse approval. They cannot be
heard to  say so.  It is  not as if - be it reiterated - the
government  has	  prohibited  the   said  respondents	from
establishing their  factories in the State. The approval and
non-approval  or  disapproval,	as  it	may  be	 called,  is
administrative in  nature. If anyone wishes to seek approval
from the  government, he  has to  abide by  the government's
policies  and  guidelines  evolved  or	enunciated  in	that
behalf.

<p id="p_43">     These provisions  establish and  emphasise the power of
the  Central   Government  to	regulate  the	location  of
industries which  also includes	 the power to prohibit their
establishment as  well.	 Having	 regard	 to  the  objectives
underlying the	Act and	 the alarming  diminution of  forest
cover  in   the	 country,  the	said  provisions  should  be
understood not	so much	 as conferring powers on the Central
Government but as creating an obligation upon it to exercise
those powers  for achieving  the objectives  underlying	 the
Act. It	 is absolutely essential that the Central Government
issues orders  under and  as contemplated  by Rule 5, if not
already issued.
</p><p id="p_44">     The Himachal  Pradesh  Forest  Produce  (Regulation  of
Trade) Act,  1982 contains  elaborate provisions  regulating
sale,  purchase,   transfer  and  trade	 of  forest  produce
including the  forest produce  from private lands. It is, of
course, true  that khair  trees were  first included  in the
Schedule to  the Act  in April	1991 and deleted in November
1991, but  it can  always be included in the schedule again,
if the	government thinks  it necessary,  as contemplated by
<a href="/doc/192670971/" id="a_20">Section 18</a>  of the  Act. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_21">The Act</a> permits government monopoly
in the matter of sale of forest produce covered by the Act.
</p><p id="p_45">     The  Himachal   Pradesh  Land  Preservation  Act,	1978
confers extensive  powers to  regulate,	 restrict,  prohibit
cutting of  trees and  their removal from notified areas. So
does the  Himachal Pradesh Private Forests Act, 1955 contain
elaborate provisions  empowering  the  State  Government  to
prohibit the  cutting and felling the trees in the specified
private forests. The provisions of these Acts have a crucial
bearing on  the establishment  and running  of forest  based
industries.
</p><p id="p_46">	  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOREST WEALTH AND
	  ITS IMPACT ON ENVIRONMENT AND ECOLOGY:
</p><p id="p_47">     It is  well  to  remember	that  manufacture  of  katha
requires cutting of khair trees. Only the central portion of
the trunk  of the  tree is used for the manufacture of katha
and the	 rest is  of no	 use except perhaps as firewood. The
more the  number of industries, the more pressure there will
be for	cutting these  trees. Himachal	Pradesh	 is  a	hill
State. The  considerations of  environment and	ecology	 and
preservation  of   forest  wealth  are	absolutely  relevant
considerations which  the government must keep in mind while
devising its policies and programmes. A brief examination of
the importance	and the	 fundamental significance of forests
in the	matter of  environment and ecology would be in order
at this juncture.
</p><p id="p_48">     The report	 of the "World Commission on Environment and
Development" constituted  by the  United Nations and chaired
by the	then Prime Minister of Norway, Gro Harlem Brundtland
contains certain  facts and  warnings which  are relevant to
the present context. We may refer to a few of them:
*-----------------------------------------------------------
The excerpts  are drawn	 from the  book "Our  Common Future:
World Commission  on Environment  and Development" published
by Oxford University Press in 1987. India was represented on
this Commission	 by its	 representative Sri  Nagendra Singh.
The Report was sutmitted in the year, 1987.
</p><p id="p_49">     "There has	 been  a  growing  realisation	in  national
governments  and   multilateral	 institutions	that  it  is
impossible to  separate	 economic  development	issues	from
environment issues;  many forms	 of  development  erode	 the
environmental resources	 upon which  they must be based, and
environmental	 degradation	can    undermine    economic
development. Poverty  is a  major cause and effect of global
environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to
deal  with   environmental  problems   without	 a   broader
perspective that  encompasses the  factors underlying  world
poverty and international inequality..........
....many present development trends leave increasing numbers
of people  poor and  vulnerable,  while	 at  the  same	time
degrading the  environment. How	 can such  development serve
next century's	world of twice as many people relying on the
same environment?
</p><p id="p_50">....More than  90 per  cent of	the increase (in population)
will occur in the poorest countries.....
</p><p id="p_51">     Meanwhile,	 the  industries  most	heavily	 reliant  on
environmental  resources  and  most  heavily  polluting	 are
growing most repidly in the developing world, where there is
both more  urgency for	growth and less capacity to minimize
damaging side effects.......Ecology and economy are becoming
ever more  interwoven - locally, regionally, nationally, and
globally - into a seamless net of causes and effects.......
</p><p id="p_52">     The other	great  institutional  flaw  in	coping	with
environment/development challenges  is governments'  failure
to  make   the	bodies	whose  policy  actions	degrade	 the
environment responsible	 for ensuring  that  their  policies
prevent that degradation."
</p><p id="p_53">     In	 Chapter   -12	entitled   "Towards  Common  Action:
Proposals  for	 Institutional	and   Legal   Change",	 the
Commission states, inter alia, that:
</p><p id="p_54">"developing    countries     face    the    challenges	  of
desertification, deforestation,	 and pollution,	 and  endure
most  of   the	 poverty   associated	with   environmental
degradation......The next  few decades	are crucial  for the
future	of   humanity.	Pressures  on  the  planet  are	 now
unprecedented and  are accelerating  at rates and scales new
to human  experience: a	 doubling of  global population in a
few decades,  with most	 of the	 growth in cities; a five to
ten fold  increase in  economic activity in less than half a
century; and  the resulting pressures for growth and changes
in   agricultural,    energy,	and    industrial   systems.
Opportunities for  more	 sustainable  forms  of	 growth	 and
development  are   also	 growing.   New	  technologies	 and
potentially unlimited  access  to  information	offer  great
promise.......Environmental   protection   and	 sustainable
development must  be an integral part of the mandates of all
agencies of governments, of international organizations, and
of major  private-sector institutions.	These must  be	made
responsible  and   accountable	for   ensuring	that   their
policies, programmes,  and  budgets  encourage	and  support
activities   that    are   economically	  and	ecologically
sustainable both in the short and longer terms."
</p><p id="p_55">     Similar views  were expressed  at	the  United  Nations
Conference on  the Human  Environment held at Stockholm from
June 5th  to 16th,  1972. We do not, however, wish to burden
this judgment with them. Suffice to refer to <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_22">Article 51-A</a> of
our Constitution  which makes  it a duty of every citizen to

felling	 of   forests  needs  no  emphasis  at	the  present
juncture, we  cannot but  quote the  following passages from
the book  "Topsoil and	Civilization" by Tom Dale and Vernon
Gill Carter, both highly experienced ecologists:*
     "Man, whether civilised or savage, is a child of nature
</p><p id="p_57">     - he  is not  the master of nature. He must conform his
     actions to	 certain natural  laws if  he is to maintain
     his dominance  over his  environment. When	 he tries to
     circumvent the  laws of nature, he usually destroys the
     natural environment  that sustains	 him. And  when	 his
     environment  deteriorates	 rapidly,  his	civilisation
     declines.......
</p><p id="p_58">     The writers of history have seldom noted the importance
     of land  use. They seem not to have recognised that the
     destinies of  most of  man's empires  and civilisations
     were determined  largely by  the way the land was used.
     While  recognising	 the  influence	 of  environment  on
     history, they  fail to note that man usually changed or
     despoiled his environment.
</p><p id="p_59">     How  did	civilised  man	 despoil   this	  favourable
     environment?  He	did  it	  mainly  by   depleting  or

     the   usable    timber   from   forested
     hillsides and  valleys.  He  over-grazed
     and denuded  the grasslands that fed his
     livestock.	 He   killed  most   of	  the
     wildlife and  much of the fish and other
     water life.  He permitted erosion to rob
     his farm land of its productive topsoil.
     He	 allowed  eroded  soil	to  clog  the
     streams   and   fill   his	  reservoirs,
     irrigation	 canals,  and  harbours	 with
     silt. In  many cases, he used and wasted
     most of the easily mined metals or other
     needed minerals.  Then his	 civilisation
     declined amidst  the despoilation of his

</p><p id="p_68">     It appears	 that when IPARA approved as many as fifteen
proposals for establishing katha factories in the State, the
Forest	Department   of	 the   State  and  the	Ministry  of

alarmed. On  September 23,  1992, the  Government of  India,
Ministry of Environment and Forest addressed a letter to the
Principal  Chief   Conservator	of  Forests,  Government  of
Himachal Pradesh requesting him to furnish basic information
relevant to  the State	of Himachal Pradesh in the proformas
enclosed to  the said  letter which was necessary "to review
the production and sale of khair wood/teak wood/resin in the

<p id="p_69">     Evidently, this  letter was  written by  Government  of
India before  it was  apprised of  the action  taken by	 the
Government  of	Himachal  Pradesh  impugned  herein.  It  is
legitimate to presume that similar views must also have been
expressed earlier.
</p><p id="p_70">     Apart from	 the concern  expressed by the Government of
India, Ministry of Environment and Forest, there was a spate
of criticism  in the  media and other public fora (including
protest by  Chairman of four block samities) with respect to
grant of approval to establish as many as fifteen mechanised
units for manufacture of katha in Himachal Pradesh. All this
made the  Government of Himachal Pradesh and IPARA to sit up
and take  notice of  the consequences  of the  action of the
sub-committee of  IPARA in  approving fifteen  units. A full
meeting	 of   IPARA  was   convened  for  August  28,  1993.
Meanwhile,  the	  capacity  of	 each  of  these  units	 was
restricted to  3600 metric  tonnes or  2400 cubic metres per
annum and  the "approvals"  granted to some other units, who
had  not   taken  any	steps  pursuant	 to  sub-committee's
"approval" were cancelled. The full committee meeting of the
IPARA held  on August  28, 1993	 took note  of	the  concern
expressed in  the media	 and other public fora regarding the
paril to  the forest  wealth of	 the  State  on	 account  of
indiscriminate approval	 of katha  factories  and  tried  to
restrict the  number as	 much as  possible. But	 then it was
faced with  the problem	 that pursuant	to  the	 "approvals"
granted by  the sub-committee  of IPARA,  certain units	 had
already taken  steps for setting up of the factories. It was
noted that  of the  fifteen units  to which  approval was so
accorded, Doon	Katha industries  was promoted	by  a  woman
entrepreneur and  was a	 very small  industry analogous to a
bhatti and  further that  installation of  its	factory	 was
almost complete.  It was,  therefore, decided not to disturb
the approval  granted to  it. It  was also  found that	five
other units,  viz., Orient  Herbs, Sagar  Katha, Dev  Bhoomi
Industries, Naman Wood Products and Ganesh Wood Products are
in the	process of  establishing their	units. It noted that
the capacity of these industries has already been restricted
to 3600 metric tonnes. The IPARA was of the opinion that the
approximate availability  of khair  wood  in  the  State  is
30,000 cubic  metres and that it would be sufficient to feed
the existing  bhatties, existing mechanised factory (Shankar
Trading Company)  and the aforesaid six new units with their
restricted capacity.  It decided  that the  approvals of the
other units  should be	cancelled because they had not taken
any concrete  steps to	implement the projects approved. The
IPARA also  took note  of the requirement of Shankar Trading
Company (Mahesh	 Udyog) and  the agreement  it had  with the
Government of  Himachal Pradesh	 and felt  that its capacity
and its	 requirement of	 raw material should be assessed and
verified   in	a   proper   manner.   The   proposals	 and
recommendations of  the IPARA  aforesaid were  placed before
H.E. the  Governor for approval. On September 15, 1993, H.E.
the Governor made the following order:

     Himachal Pradesh:	There is  no  ban  on
     export of	khair wood  from the State in
     respect  of  khair	 wood  obtained	 from
     private land.  However, the  export from
     the State	of khair  wood obtained	 from
     private land  is regulated	 in terms  of
     the  Government's	 order	contained  in
     Annexure R-19.  The khair wood extracted
     from Government  Forest  by  H.P.	State
     Forest  Corporation  Ltd.	and  disposed
     through open  auction is  required to be
     utilised within  the State	 of  Himachal
     Pradesh only.
</p><p id="p_88">	  There	 is  no	 restriction  on  the
     import of	khair wood  from outside  the
     State."
</p><p id="p_89">     It is  clear from	the above  affidavit that  there has
been no systematic or a proper survey of the availability of
khair wood  in the  State. The availability of khair wood is
determined on  the basis  of quantity  extracted during	 the
years 1990-91  to 1992-93  in the case of government forests
and 1990-91  and 1991-92  in the case of private forests. It
is obvious, and an indisputable proposition, that extraction
in a  given year  or in	 certain given	years is no index of
availability. The  estimate of	availability on the basis of
extraction in a given two or three years' period is bound to
be faulty.  Extraction in  a given year or years may be more
or less than the average annual availability.
</p><p id="p_90">     THE MYOPIC APPROACH OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE IPARA
     IN APPROVING THE PROPOSALS FOR KATHA FACTORIES:
     During the	 years 1992  and 1993,	the sub-committee of
IPARA seems  to have  been proceeding on the assumption that
so long	 as there  is no  commitment  on  the  part  of	 the
Government to  supply khair  wood to the proposed factories,
there is  no harm  in approving	 any and every proposal that
comes before  it. This	cannot but  be termed  as a  totally
faulty and  a myopic  approach. It  is also violative of the
National Forest	 Policy and  the State Forest Policy evolved
by  the	  Government  of  India	 and  the  Himachal  Pradesh
Government respectively	 -  besides  the  fact	that  it  is
contrary to  public interest  involved in  preserving forest
wealth,	 maintenance   of  environment	 and   ecology	 and
considerations of  sustainable growth and inter-generational
equity. Afterall,  the present	generation has	no right  to
deplete all  the existing  forests and leave nothing for the
next  and   future  generations.   Not	keeping	  the  above
considerations in  mind, it  is obvious,  has  vitiated	 the
approvals granted by the sub-committee of IPARA - apart from
the fact  that it  was	not  empowered	to  grant  any	such
approval. The obligation of sustainable development requires
that a proper assessment should be made of the forest wealth
and the	 establishment of industries based on forest produce
should not  only be restricted accordingly but their working
should also be monitored closely to ensure that the required
balance is  not disturbed.  In this  view of  the matter, we
must  say   that  insofar  as  forest-based  industries	 are
concerned, there  is no	 absolute or  unrestricted right  to
establish   industries	 notwithstanding   the	 policy	  of
liberalisation announced  by the  Government of	 India.	 The
policy of  liberalisation has  to be understood in the light
of the	National Forest	 Policy devised by the Government of
India itself  and in  the light	 of the	 several  enactments
applicable in  that behalf, some of which have been referred
to hereinbefore.  It is meaningless to prescribe merely that
the government need not supply the raw material and that the
units will  have to  get their khair trees/raw material from
private lands/forests.	No distinction	can be	made between
government forests  and private	 forests in  the  matter  of
forest wealth of the nation and in the matter of environment
and ecology.  It is  just not  possible or  permissible. The
National Forest	 Policy	 and  the  Himachal  Pradesh  Forest
Policy do  not make  any such  distinction.  The  perils  of
ignoring the  above policies  and considerations  cannot  be
over-emphasised.
</p><p id="p_91">     We	 must	say  that   in	the   light  of	  the  above
considerations, the  High Court	 was not  right in observing
that Sri  Yogendra Chandra  cannot be  accepted as  a public
spirited citizen  approaching the  court to  protect  public
interest -  more so,  when it  has recorded  a	simultaneous
finding that  there is	no evidence of collusion between him
and Shankar  Trading Company (Mahesh Udyog). The credentials
of Sri	Yogendra Chandra  appear to be impeccable. He is not
only a	member of  the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly
but also  the Convenor	of the Indian National Trust for Art
and Cultural  Heritage. He  is also  the  President  of	 the
Himalayan Wild	Life and  Environment Preservation  Society.
The said  organisations may  be big  or small,	may be well-
established  ones   or	recently  started  ones	 -  that  is
immaterial. Once  it is	 found that he was not acting at the
instance of  or at  the behest	of  or	for  protecting	 the
interests of Shankar Trading Company, there was no reason to
hold that  he was  not acting  bonafide in  approaching	 the
court to  preserve the	forest wealth  of the  State in	 the
interest  of  environment  and	ecology.  His  inability  to
produce material  in support  of his  allegation of  illicit
felling in the State does not tell upon his bonafides.
</p><p id="p_92">     We may also mention, even at this stage, that so far as
Shankar Trading Company is concerned, there is absolutely no
doubt in  our mind  that it  is not entitled to question the
approvals granted to new units since there was no indication
at any stage that the supplies which it was receiving in the
previous years pursuant to the agreement with the government
were going  to be  affected. Its  attempt to  stop  the	 new
industries from	 coming up  in the  State, while enjoying an
almost monopoly status in the matter of khair wood supplies,
is  certainly	a  strong   factor  militating	against	 its
bonafides in approaching the court.
</p><p id="p_93">THE DOCTRINE OF PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST:
</p><p id="p_94">     The doctrine  of promissory  estoppel is  by  now	well
recognised in  this country.  Even so  it should  be noticed
that it	 is an	evolving doctrine, the contours of which are
not  yet   fully  and	finally	 demarcated.   It  would  be
instructive to	bear in	 mind what Viscount Hailsham said in
Woodhouse Ltd. v. Nigerian Produce Ltd. (1972 A.C. 741):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_56">     "I desire	to add that the time may soon
     come when	the whole  sequence of	cases
     based upon promissory estoppel since the
     war,  beginning   with  Central   London
     Property Trust  Ltd. v. High Trees House
     Ltd. (1947	 (1) K.B. 130) may need to be
     reviewed and  reduced to a coherent body
     of doctrine by the courts. I do not mean
     to say that they are to be regarded with
     suspicion. But  as	 is  common  with  an
     expanding	doctrine,   they   do	raise
     problems of  coherent  exposition	which
     have    never     been    systematically
     explored."</blockquote>
<p id="p_95">     Though the	 above view  was expressed  as far  back  as
1972, it  is no less valid tody. The dissonance in the views
expressed by  this Court  in some  of its  decisions on	 the
subject emphasises  such a need. The views expounded in <a href="/doc/871220/" id="a_24">M/s.
Motilal Padampat  Sugar Mills  Company Limited	v. State  of
Uttar Pradesh</a>  (1979 (2)  S.C.C.409) was  departed  from  in
certain respects  in <a href="/doc/1936933/" id="a_25">Jit  Ram Shiv Kumar v. State of Haryana</a>
(1981 (1)  S.C.C.11), which  was in turn criticised in <a href="/doc/53080/" id="a_26">Union
of  India   v.	Godfrey	 Philips  India	 Limited</a>  (1985	 (4)
S.C.C.369). The	 divergence in approach adopted in <a href="/doc/62711/" id="a_27">Sri Bakul
Oil Industries	v. State  of Gujarat</a> (1981 (1) S.C.C.31) and
<a href="/doc/1877956/" id="a_28">Pournami Oil Mills v. State of Kerala</a> (1986 Suppl.S.C.C.728)
is another  instance. The  fact that  the recent decision in
Kasinka Trading	 and Ann. v. Union of India &amp; Ors. (1995 (1)
S.C.C.274) is  being reconsidered  by larger  Bench  is	 yet
another affirmation  of the  need stressed  by Lord Hailsham
for enunciating "a coherent body of doctrine by the Courts".
An aspect  needing a  clear exposition	- and  which  is  of
immediate relevance  herein - is what is the precise meaning
of the	words "the promisee.....alters his position", in the
statement of  the doctrine. The doctrine has been formulated
in the	following words in M/s. Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills
Co. Ltd.:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">     "The law may, therefore, now be taken to
     be settled as a result of this decision,
     that  where   the	Government   makes  a
     promise knowing  or  intending  that  it
     would be  acted on	 by the promisee and,
     in	 fact,	 the  promisee,	  acting   in
     reliance on it, alters his position, the
     Govt. would be held bound by the promise
     and the  promise  would  be  enforceable
     against the Govt. at the instance of the
     promisee, notwithstanding	that there is
     no consideration for the promise and the
     promise is not recorded in the form of a
     formal contract  as required  by <a href="/doc/1084525/" id="a_29">Art.299</a>
     of the Constitution."
</blockquote><p id="p_96">What does  altering the	 position mean?	 Does it mean such a
change in  the position	 of the	 promisee (as  a  result  of
acting on the faith of representation of the promissor) that
compensating him in money would not be just and equitable to
him, i.e.,  a  situation  where	 the  ends  of	justice	 and
requirements of	 equity demand that the promissor should not
be allowed to go back on his representation and must be held
to it  or does altering his position mean doing of some act,
big or small, which the promisee does acting on the faith of
the representation  which he would not have done but for the
representation? In  other  words,  is  it  enough  that	 the
promisee has  spent some money or has taken some step acting
on the	basis of representation, which can be recompensed in
money or  otherwise? Is	 it not ultimately a matter of doing
equity and  justice between  the parties - a case of holding
the scales  even between the parties and deciding whether in
the interests  of justice  and equity  the promissor  can be
allowed to  resile  from  his  promise	and  compensate	 the
promisee appropriately	or the promissor ought to be held to
his promise  and not  allowed to go back since such a course
is necessary  in view of the change in position of promisee?
Our view  of the  matter is probably evident from the way we
have  posed  the  above	 questions.  To	 wit,  the  rule  of
promissory estoppel  being an  equitable doctrine, has to be
moulded to  suit the  particular situation. It is not a hard
and fast  rule but an elastic one, the objective of which is
to do justice between the parties and to extend an equitable
treatment to them. If it is more just from the point of view
of  both   promissor  and   promisee  that   the  latter  is
compensated appropriately and allow the promissor to go back
on his	promise, that should be done; but if the Court is of
the opinion  that the interests of justice and equity demand
that the  promissor should not be allowed to resile from his
representation in  the facts and circumstances of that case,
it will	 do so.	 This, in  our respectful  opinion,  is	 the
proper way of understanding the words "promisee altering his
position". Altering his position should mean such alteration
in the position of the promisee as it makes it appear to the
Court that  holding the	 promissor to  his representation is
necessary to  do justice  between the  parties. The doctrine
should not be reduced to a rule of thumb. Being an equitable
doctrine it  should be	kept elastic  enough in the hands of
the Court  to do  complete justice between the parties. Now,
can the	 doctrine of  promissory estoppel be put on a higher
pedestal than the written contract between the parties? Take
a case	where  there  is  a  contract  between	the  parties
containing  the	  very	same  terms  as	 are  found  in	 the
"approval" granted  by IPARA  (sub-committee) and  then	 the
government resiles  from the  contract	and  terminates	 the
contract. The  promisee will  then have	 to file  a suit for
specific performance of the contract in which case the court
will decide, having regard to the facts and circumstances of
the case  and the  provisions of  the <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_30">Specific	Relief	Act</a>,
whether the plaintiff should be granted specific performance
of the	contract or  only a decree for damages for breach of
contract.  It  must  be	 remembered  that  the	doctrine  of
promissory estoppel  was evolved  to protect  a promisee who
acts on	 the  faith  of	 a  promise/representation  made  by
promissor and  alters his  position even  though there is no
consideration for the promise and even though the promise is
not recorded  in the  form of  a formal	 contract. Surely, a
representation	made   or  undertaking	given  in  a  formal
contract  is  as  good	as,  if	 not  better  than,  a	mere
representation. All  that  we  wish  to	 emphasise  is	that
anything and everything done by the promisee on the faith of
the representation  does not  necessarily amount to altering
his position  so as  to preclude the promissor from resiling
from his  representation. If  the equity  demands  that	 the
promissor  is	allowed	 to   resile  and  the	promisee  is
compensated  appropriately,  that  ought  to  be  done.	 If,
however, equity	 demands, in the light of the things done by
the promisee  on the  faith of	the representation, that the
promissor should  be precluded	from resiling  and  that  he
should be  held fast  to his  representation, that should be
done. To  repeat, it  is a matter of holding the scales even
between the  parties -	to do  justice between them. This is
the equity implicit in the doctrine.
</p><p id="p_97">     The matters before us have to be approached and decided
keeping the above principles in mind. The Court should first
ascertain what	precisely has each the said five respondents
(Ganesh Wood  Products,	 Naman	Wood  Products,	 Dev  Bhoomi
Industries,  Indian   Wood  Products   and   Chander   Katha
Industries) have  done on  the basis  of and on the faith of
the "approval" granted by the IPARA (sub-committee of IPARA)
by the	date of	 the communication  of the  decision of	 the
government -  and IPARA	 in the	 case of  two last mentioned
units. [The expression "communication" in this behalf should
be understood  as explained  in <a href="/doc/769980/" id="a_31">State of Punjab v. Khemi Ram</a>
(A.I.R. 1970  S.C.214). After  ascertaining  the  same,	 the
Court shall have to decide whether it is a case - separately
in case	 of  each  of  the  said  respondents  -  where	 the
government should or should not be allowed to go back on the
said "approval"	 granted by the IPARA (sub-committee). It is
obvious that  this decision  has to be taken after giving an
opportunity to	both  the  parties  to	adduce	material  in
support of  their respective  stands. Inasmuch	as the	High
Court has  not approached  and examined	 the case  from	 the
above standpoint,  the matter has to go back. While deciding
the appropriate	 course, it  is evident that the Court shall
also have  to keep in mind the plea of government that IPARA
or its	sub-committee was  not competent  to accord approval
and that the power lay only with the government, as also the
plea of	 the respondents  that	in  the	 circumstances	they
believed and  acted in	good faith that IPARA is but another
name for,  or a mouthpiece of, the government. It is equally
evident that  while deciding  where the interests of justice
and equity  lie, the  Court will also take into account, and
balance, public interest and the interest of the respondents
aforesaid. The	Court shall also take into consideration the
estimate of  raw material  (khair trees)  and  its  expected
availability -	at present  and in the years to come - to be
made by	 the Himachal  Pradesh government  pursuant  to	 the
directions contained  herein  with  the	 aid  of  an  expert
committee. The	High Court  may give six months' time to the
government to  arrive at  such an  estimate and	 to place it
before the Court.
</p><p id="p_98">     It may perhaps be appropriate to point out that what we
have said above is consistent with the doctrine as stated in
Motilal Padampat  Sugar Mills  and the subsequent decisions.
In Motilal  Padampat Sugar  Mills, it  has been held firstly
that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_58">     "But it  is necessary  to point out that
     since   the   doctrine   of   promissory
     estoppel is  an equitable	doctrine,  it
     must yield	 when the equity so requires.
     If it  can be  shown by  the  Government
     that having  regard to the facts as they
     have subsequently	transpired, it	would
     be inequitable to hold the Government to
     the promise  made by it, the Court would
     not raise	an equity  in favour  of  the
     promisee and enforce the promise against
     the   Government.	  The	doctrine   of
     promissory estoppel  would be  displaced
     in such  a case  because, on  the facts,
     equity  would   not  require   that  the
     Government should	be held	 bound by the
     promise made  by it. When the Government
     is able  to show  that in	view  of  the
     facts which  have transpired  since  the
     making of	the promise,  public interest
     would be  prejudiced if  the  government
     were required  to carry out the promise,
     the Court	would  have  to	 balance  the
     public  interest	in   the   Government
     carrying out a promise made to a citizen
     which has	induced the  citizen  to  act
     upon it  and alter	 his position and the
     public interest  likely to suffer it the
     promise were  required to be carried out
     by the  Government and  determine	which
     way the equity lies."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_59">     and then it is observed:
</blockquote><p id="p_99">	"But  even  where  ther	 is  no	 such
     overriding public interest, it may still
     be competent to the Government to resile
     from the  promise 'on  giving reasonable
     notice,  which  need  not	be  a  formal
     notice, giving the promises a reasonable
     opportunity of  resuming  his  position'
     provided of  course it  is possible  for
     the promisee  to restore the statuts quo
     ante. If,	however, the  promises	could
     become final and irrevocable. Vide Ajayi
     v. Briscoe (1964) 3 All ER 556."
</p><p id="p_100">It is this aspect which has been elaborated by us keeping in
mind the facts and circumstances of this case.
</p><p id="p_101">     It is true that in case of the three units (Ganesh Wood
Products, Naman	 Wood Products	and Dev	 Bhoomi Industries),
the full  meeting of  IPARA (held on August 28, 1993) opined
that "it  would not  be appropriate  to rescind the approval
keeping in view the progress made in implementation of their
projects.....", yet  it is  not clear  what exactly had they
done by	 the date  of rejection	 of their  proposal  by	 the
Government (23rd  September, 1993).  Even the High Court has
not recorded  any clear	 finding on this aspect. All that it
said is	 : "It	is apparent  that the  Units recommended  by
IPARA were earlier registered with the industries Department
and have  thereafter purchased	lands,	constructed  factory
buildings,  and/either	 purchased  or	 placed	 orders	 for
machinery. In  some cases  even the  raw-material  has	been
purchased." There is no reference to any material in support
of the	said  opinion  nor  is	the  case  of  each  of	 the
petitioners separately	examined. Probably,  the High  Court
was influenced by the opinion expressed by the IPARA (at the
meeting held  on August	 28, 1993) referred to above. But it
would be seen that it too is quite general and vague. Hence,
the necessity for the remand to High Court.
</p><p id="p_102">     OBLIGATION OF THE STATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH TO MAKE A
     PROPER ESTIMATE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF THE RAW-
     MATERIAL/KHAIR WOOD IN THE STATE:
</p><p id="p_103">     The facts	stated above  do  establish  the  imperative
necessity of  a proper	estimate of  the availability of raw
material, namely,  khair wood in the State. We are told that
any and	 every	khair  tree  is	 not  fit  for	cutting	 for
obtaining katha. Only a tree with a particular girth (20 cm.
at breast  height) yields  the optimum quantity of requisite
material and  is allowed  to be cut. Trees with lesser girth
are not	 allowed to be cut as per the Technical Order No.670
dated 13th  August, 1993  issued under	the Himachal Pradesh
Land Preservation  Act, 1978  and the Rules made thereunder.
This Order,  it may  be	 noted,	 is  applicable	 to  private
lands/forests. The  State Government  should obtain a proper
estimate of  the khair wood in the State and also to make an
estimate of  its availability  in each	of the	coming years
with the  assistance of	 an expert  body to  be appointed in
consultation with the Ministry of Environment, Government of
India. Such an estimate should cover both the Government and
private lands/forests and must be arrived at keeping in view
the National  and State	 forest policies  and  the  relevant
statutory provisions.  It is  only then one can say, what is
the quantity of khair wood available and how many industries
it can	feed - and upto what capacity. Further, it is on the
basis of  such estimate	 that  the  capacity  of  the  katha
factories, at  any given  point of  time,  may	have  to  be
restricted, if	need be.  Some of  them may  even have to be
closed if warranted by public interest.
</p><p id="p_104">     We must  say that	the estimate  of availability of raw
material arrived  at by	 the High  Court is  based upon	 the
quantity extracted  over a  period of two or three years. As
pointed out  hereinabove, the  quantity extracted in a given
year or	 given years  can  never  be  treated  as  a  proper
estimate of the availability of the raw material. Hence, the
need for  a proper and credible survey by an expert body. In
this view  of the  matter, it  is not necessary to deal with
the criticism mounted by the learned counsel for respondents
to the	varying estimates of raw material put forward by the
government at various stages of this litigation and to other
alleged contradictions in its case from stage to stage.
************
     The appeals  are accordingly  allowed, the	 judgment of
