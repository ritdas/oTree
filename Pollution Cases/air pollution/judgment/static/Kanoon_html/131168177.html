                  unlawful mining without environment clearance or without both would attract

                           48.According to the respondents, the petitioner had been granted quarry

                  lease on 18.02.2008. The Government had extended the time limit for furnishing

                  Environment Clearance Certificate as required under Rules 41 and 42 of the

                  Tamilnadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959. The petitioner had submitted

                  report stating that the approval for the 2nd scheme of mining was pending before

                  the 2nd respondent. A direction was issued by this Court to pass orders on the said

                  application. However, it is claimed that the application was not in order. The

                  requisite documents had not furnished. Therefore, order granting approval was

                  directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and also by the notification

                  issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate

                  Change, It had been stated that the petitioner had continued mining the minerals

                  without obtaining Environment Clearance and therefore, in accordance with the

                  directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the petitioner had been served with the

                  notice, calling upon them to pay 100% cost of the mined and quarried.



                           58.With respect to the claim of the petitioner that there must be a deemed

                  license without submission of the Environment Clearance Certificate as directed

                  by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It was therefore stated that the writ petitions

                  should be dismissed.

                  been contended that the petitioner, Ramco Cements Limited, had submitted an

                  application on 18.10.2012 for renewal of mining lease for mining limestone over

                  an extent of 4.68.0 Hectares in Varagupadi Village, Kunnam Taluk, Perambalur

                  District and carried out mining operations under deemed extension in accordance

                  with Rule 24A (6) of Mineral Concession Rules, 1960.



                           60.The petitioner had contended that they had been issued with terms of

                  reference by letter dated 14.06.2018 and amended terms of reference by letter

                  dated 30.07.2018.      The petitioner had, however, not obtained Environment

                  Clearance in respect of the lease hold lands and the respondents therefore

                  contended that mining operations carried out by the petitioner from 15.01.2016 in

                  the lease hold area was an illegal mining operation as clarified by the letter of the

                  Ministry of Environment and Forest, dated 03.04.2017. The petitioner was

                  therefore issued with the impugned notice for recovery of cost of minerals mined

                  and transported for the period from 15.01.2016 to July 2016 alone.



                           61.The claim of the petitioner that the demand was made from 15.01.2016

                  to 10.01.2017 was not correct was denied by the respondents. The petitioner had

                  actually carried on mining operations over an extent of 18.11.5 Hectares in

                  Varagupadi Village, Kunnam Taluk, Perambalur District from 24.10.1993 without

                  obtaining Environment Clearance. The respondents therefore justified the

                  issuance of the demand notice, impugned in the writ petition, towards cost of

                  minerals and the quantum of limestone mined and transported without



                  Environment Clearance for the period from 2000-2001 based on the base year

                  production of 1993-94 as directed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the

                  matter of Common Cause Vs. Union of India and others.



                           62.The respondents also denied all other contentions raised by the

                  petitioner and stated that obtaining Environment Clearance is mandatory and that

                  the petitioner cannot seek exemption of the same and also seek renewal of

                  license. It was stated that mining operations conducted by the petitioner from

                  January 2016 to July 2016 were illegal and therefore, the impugned notice had

                  been issued to the petitioner. It was stated that the writ petition should be

                           63.The learned Standing Counsels on behalf of the State Level

                  Environmental Impact Assessment Authority had filed a detailed chart with

                  Assessment Authority had been impleaded as a respondent.



                           64.With respect to W.P.No.27735 of 2019, it had been stated that the

                  petitioner had not submitted any application seeking Environment Clearance.

                  With respect to W.P.No.27741 of 2019, it had been stated that there was a

                  violation in the project and the petitioner had not submitted all the relevant details

                  in the application form and the file had been recorded.



                           65.With respect to W.P.Nos.27182 &amp; 27183 of 2019, it had been stated that

                  the petitioner had applied for 2nd scheme of mining. However, the application

                  was not in proper format. It is a fact that the petitioner was granted Environment

                  Clearance, but subsequently, the petitioner had submitted a 2nd scheme for mining

                  under Rule 41 of the Tamilnadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959 and had

                  not obtained Environment Clearance, but had continued with the mining. It was

                  therefore stated that the demand made by the District Collector was justified.

                  With respect to W.P.Nos.889 &amp; 894 of 2020, it was stated that the petitioner had

                  not obtained Environment Clearance and the petitioner was carried on mining

                  operations under the deemed extension provision.         However, such deemed

                  extension cannot be presumed by the petitioner, in view of the fact that there was

                  no prior Environment Clearance from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and

                  Climate Change, New Delhi.        It was stated that the writ petition should be

                  required in respect of mining leases of minor minerals of less than 5.00.0

                  Hectares. However, Environment Clearance was made mandatory by the Hon'ble

                  Supreme Court of India in the judgment reported in 2012 (4) SCC 629 (Deepak

                  Kumar and others Vs. State of Haryana and others), even for minor minerals of

                  less than 5.00.0 Hectares.



                           69.The writ petitions related to stone quarry leases granted with respect to

                  both Government land and patta land. For Government land, the leases were

                  granted under Rule 8 of the Tamilnadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959 by

                  following Tender cum Auction system. For patta land, leases were granted on

                  application filed under Rule 19 of the said Rules.



                           70.The learned counsel pointed out that pursuant to the judgment in

                  stated above, Rule 41 dealt with submission of approval of mining plan and Rule

                  42 dealt with submission of Environment Clearance. Originally, 180 days was

                  granted for submission of Environment Clearance under Rule 42 (iii).



                           71.The learned counsel pointed out that the State of Tamilnadu did not

                  constitute the authority for grant of Environment Clearance and did not also

                  appoint the Chairman of the State Level Environmental Impact Assessment

                  Authority. Therefore, the petitioners could not obtain the Environment Clearance

                  within the stipulated period of 180 days. Thereafter, being aware of the situation,

                  the State Government extended the time periodically and finally fixed 630 days

                  and amended Rule 42 (iii) on 14.07.2016. The period of 630 days came to an end



                  on 10.01.2017. Subsequently, all the District Collectors stopped quarrying

                  operations in all the quarries throughout Tamilnadu on and from 11.01.2017.



                           72.The learned counsel pointed out that most of the writ petitioners had

                  actually submitted the application forms seeking Environment Clearance.

                  However, the respondents had not issued Environment Clearance. The learned

                  counsel stated that the blame cannot be shifted on the petitioners for continuing

                  quarry operations without Environment Clearance. The petitioners can only apply

                  for Environment Clearance. They have done so. The onus then shifts to the

                  respondents to either grant the Environment Clearance or to reject the application

                  and calling upon the petitioners, if the application is not in proper format, to

                  rectify the mistakes. However, the respondents did not take any step and they

                  have kept the applications pending. They extended the time for submission of

                  Environment Clearance and finally, granted time up to 630 days. Even on the

                  expiry of 630 days, the applications were kept pending. It was stated that all the

                  quarry works stopped on 11.01.2017.



                           73.It was pointed out by the learned counsel that the respondents / the

                  District Collectors have not applied their mind to examine whether the lease

                  period in most of the cases had actually expired even before 11.01.2017. As an

                  instance, the learned counsel pointed out that the case of the petitioner,

                  M.Duraisamy, in W.P.No.27735 of 20019. The lease period of the petitioner had

                  expired on 04.05.2016 and he stopped the quarrying operations on 04.05.2016.

                  However, the demand notice had claimed amounts up to 10.01.2017. The learned

                  counsel pointed out that this showed total non application of mind on the part of

                  the District Collector, Salem. Similarly, in other writ petitions also, the respective

                  District Collectors, had not even considered the fact that whether the petitioner

                  had applied for Environment Clearance and whether the Environment Clearance

                  applications were pending before the concerned authorities, but had issued

                  impugned notices in printed form by filling the blanks namely, name of the

                  company, name of the lessee and the quantity of mines quarried and the amount

                  demanded.



                           74.The learned counsel also pointed out that the impugned notices suffer,

                  because prior notice was not issued to any of the petitioners. Pointing out this

                  fact, the learned counsel stated that if only the District Collectors had issued

                  notices, then, the writ petitioners would have had an opportunity to explain the

                  correct position and then, the District Collectors might even have taken a

                  conscious decision to drop further proceedings.          The learned counsel very

                  seriously questioned the lack of opportunity granted and stated that the principles

                  of natural justice have been violated by the respondents herein.



                           75.The learned counsel also stated that the petitioners were also permitted

                  to continue the quarrying operations until 10.01.2017. The District Collector also

                  issued transport permits for transport of quarried minerals on payment of

                  necessary seigniorage till 10.01.2017. The learned counsel therefore stated that

                  the impugned notices suffer from total non application of mind and also on

                  violation of principles of natural justice.



                           76.The learned counsel pointed out that under the notices, 100% penalty

                  has been levied and the petitioners have been put to very serious hardship owing

                  to the said notices. The learned counsel again reiterated that stereo type notices

                  have been issued demanding huge amounts alleging that the quarrying operations

                  were carried on from 15.01.2016 to 10.01.2017 even in the case of lessees, whose

                  lease period had expired earlier to 10.01.2017.

                           77.The learned counsel stated that even in the notice, it had been mentioned

                  that the petitioner have paid royalty fee and other statutory dues to the

                  Government. They have paid the seigniorage charges and royalty fee and the

                  District Collector had issued the transport permits. In spite of the same, the

                  printed forms have been issued demanding 100% cost of the mineral lifted from

                  the entire period from 15.01.2016 to 10.01.2017.



                           78.The learned counsel also referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble

                  Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case (referred supra) and pointed out that the

                  Hon'ble Supreme Court was considering extraction of minor minerals in the

                  District of Panchkula and Haryana for quarrying in the riverbeds of Yamuna,

                  Tangri, Markanda, Ghaggar, Krishnavati River basin, Dohan River basin, etc.,

                  There were also complaints of illegal mining in the State of Rajasthan and Uttar

                           79.The learned counsel stated that after examining the rival contentions, the

                  have an effective framework of mining plan, which will take care of all

                  environmental issues and also evolve a long term rational and sustainable use of

                  natural resource base and also the bio-assessment protocol.



                           80.The Hon'ble Supreme Court also directed that all the States, Union

                  Territories, the Ministry of Environment and Forest and the Ministry of Mines

                  must give effect to the recommendations made by the Ministry of Environment

                  and Forest in the report of March 2010 and the Modal Guidelines framed by the

                  Ministry of Mines, within a period of six months from the date of judgment.

                  Finally, in paragraph No.29, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had stated that the leases

                  of minor minerals including their renewal even for an area of less than 5 Hectares

                  can be granted by the States / Union Territories, only after getting Environment

                  Clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forest.



                           81.In view of the fact that there were two directions namely, to submit a

                  mining plan and to obtain Environment Clearance, the Tamilnadu Government

                  inserted Rules 41 and 42 in the Tamilnadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules,

                  1959, by G.O.Ms.No.79, Industries (MMC-1) Department, dated 06.04.2015.



                           82.The said Government Order specifically referred to the Hon'ble Supreme

                  Court in Deepak Kumar's case (referred supra) and inserted Rule 41 namely

                  submission for approval of mining plan for minor minerals other than Granite and

                  Rule 42 namely, submission of Environment Clearance for the grant of quarry

                  lease for minor minerals including Granite. It was stated that the holders of lease

                  including Granite shall submit Environment Clearance within a period of 180

                  days from the date of commencement of the Rules. Thereafter, by periodical

                  amendments, the time was finally extended to 630 days.



                           83.The learned counsel pointed out that the Government of Tamilnadu had

                  filed M.A.No.260 of 2017 in O.A.No.123 of 2014 before the National Green

                  environment ecology.



                           84.The learned counsel referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme

                  Court of India in W.P. (C) No.114 of 2014 in the matter of Common Cause Vs.

                  Union of India dated 02.08.2017 and drew reference to paragraph Nos.90 and 91

                  and stated that though paragraph No.90 had been referred in the impugned

                  notices, in the said paragraph, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had stated that the

                  Environment Clearance will be required only if the existing mining project does

                  not have No Objection Certificate from the State Pollution Control Board.



                           85.The learned counsel stated that the impugned notices issued by the

                  respective District Collectors, have been issued without any application of mind

                  in printed forms, completely violating the principles of natural justice and

                  therefore, the learned counsel stated that the writ petitions should be allowed. In

                  this connection, the learned counsel relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble

                  through legal heirs and others Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others) and drew

                  specific reference to paragraph 40, which is as follows:-

                                40.Before adverting to the precedents in which <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_18">Section 5A</a> has been
                          interpreted by this Court, it will be useful to notice development of the law
                          relating to the rule of hearing. In the celebrated case of Cooper v. Wandsworth
                          Board of Works, (1863) 143 ER 414, the principle was stated thus:
                                      "Even God did not pass a sentence upon Adam, before he
                               was called upon to make his defence. "Adam" says God, "where
                               art thou? hast thou not eaten of the tree whereof I commanded
                               thee that thou shouldest not eat".

                                Therein the District Board had brought down the house of the plaintiff's
                          (Cooper), because he had failed to comply with The Metropolis Local
                          Management Act. <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_19">The Act</a> required the plaintiff to notify the board seven days
                          before starting to build the house. Cooper argued that even though the board
                          had the legal authority to tear his house down, no person should be deprived of
                          their property without notice. In spite of no express words in the statute the
                          court recognized the right of hearing before the plaintiff's house built without
                          permission was demolished in the exercise of statutory powers. Byles J stated:

                                       “....Although there are not positive words in a statute
                                requiring that the party shall be heard, yet the justice of the
                                common law shall supply the omission of the legislature”.


                            86.The learned counsel therefore stated that the notices issued violating the

                  principles of natural justice should be struck down by this Court. The learned

                  counsel also relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in (2014) 16

                  Supreme Court Cases 392 (Nisha Devi Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh and

                  others) and drew specific reference to paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, which are as

                  follows:-

                                “3.The narration of the complicated and convoluted sequence of events is
                          not essential for deciding the present Appeals for the simple reason that the
                          impugned Judgments accept the Report of the Tehsildar, Kullu, which was itself
                          predicated only on the revenue records and was arrived at without hearing the
                          Appellant. In the said Report the Income Certificate issued to the Appellant, to
                          the effect that her income was less than Rupees twelve thousand per annum,
                          thereby making her eligible for appointment as a Anganwadi Worker, was
                          cancelled on the predication that she was the owner of 1-19 Bighas of land
                          which was in addition to her father’s ownership of 6 Bighas of land.
                                4. In the course of arguments addressed before us, the fervent submission
                          of counsel of the Appellant that she was not afforded any opportunity of being
                          heard has not been controverted, inasmuch as it has been contended that the


                  54/179

                                                                                    W.P.Nos.26808 of 2019 and batch

                          Report of the Tehsildar was based on revenue records, which, therefore, was
                          presumed to be correct. The High Court has acted upon this one sided or
                          unilateral Report of the Tehsildar in arriving at the conclusion that the
                          Appellant indeed had an income in excess of Rupees twelve thousand per
                          annum and, accordingly, was ineligible for appointment as an Anganwadi
                          Worker.

                                5.Trite though it is, we may yet again reiterate that the principle of audi
                          alteram partem admits of no exception, and demands to be adhered to in all
                          circumstances. In other words, before arriving at any decision which has
                          serious implications and consequences to any person, such person must be
                          heard in his defence. We find that the High Court did not notice the violation
                          and infraction of this salutary principle of law. Accordingly, on this short
                          ground, the impugned Judgments and Orders require to be set aside, and are so
                          done. The matter is remanded back to the Divisional Commissioner for taking a
                          fresh decision after giving due notice to the Appellant and affording her an
                          opportunity of being heard. The Divisional Magistrate, Kullu, shall complete
                          the proceedings expeditiously, and not later than six months from the date on
                          which a copy of this Order is served on him.”




                            87.The learned counsel again reiterated that the Hon'ble Supreme Court had

                  consistently upheld the view that any order passed violating the principles of

                  natural justice and denying the opportunity of personal hearing, must be struck

                           88.The learned counsel also relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme

                  Court of India in (1990) 3 Supreme Court Cases 223 (Shri Sitaram Sugar

                  Company Limited and another Vs. Union of India and others) and drew specific

                  reference to paragraph No.46, which is as follows:-

                  to be interfered with by this Court, since the notices were arbitrary in nature and

                           90.Mr.V.Sanjeevi, learned counsel argued elaborately, questioning the

                  notices issued by the respective District Collectors claiming 100% compensation

                  for the quantity of the minerals quarried and lifted and transported during the

                           91.The learned counsel pointed out that the date ie., 15.01.2016 had been

                  fixed based on the date of notification of the Ministry of Environment and Forest

                  and there was also a reference in the impugned notice to the judgment of the

                           93.However, in the Official Memorandum dated 18.05.2012 issued by the

                  Ministry of Environment and Forest, it had been stated that even for leases for

                  less than 5 hectares, existing leases would not come under the purview of the

                  regulations. Under the notification dated 15.01.2016, it had been stated that the

                  District level and State level Authorities should be constituted. However, this

                  notification came to be interpreted by the National Green Tribunal and in its order

                  dated 11.12.2018, it has been very specifically stated that the notification dated

                  15.01.2016 was not consistent with the decision in Deepak Kumar's case

                  (referred supra). It was very specifically stated that the notification should not be

                  acted upon.



                           94.The learned counsel therefore pointed out that the date ie., 15.01.2016,

                  mentioned in the impugned notice itself is a misconception and on this ground

                  alone, the notice will have to be struck down. The learned counsel also stated

                  that the end date namely, 10.01.2017 had also been arbitrarily fixed as no such

                  date been mentioned in any one of the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

                  Thereafter, the State Government had introduced Rules 41 and 42 to the

                  Tamilnadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959. Rule 41 relates to production

                  of mining plan and Rule 42 (iii) relates to obtaining Environment Clearance. The

                  learned counsel stated that the petitioners had applied seeking Environment

                  Clearance, but the State Government had not provided the Environment

                  Clearance. The onus was on the State Government to provide Environment

                  Clearance. If the applications were not in order, then, the Appropriate Authority

                  should have informed the respective applicants regarding the defects in the

                  applications, so that, rectifications can be made. However, after receiving the

                  applications, the Authority had kept silent and the learned counsel urged that the

                  date ie., 10.01.2017 had been arbitrarily fixed.



                           95.The learned counsel pointed out that till that date, the District Collectors

                  had not come forward to cancel the lease or the license granted in favour of the

                  petitioners. Even the Government had not taken such step. The learned counsel

                  pointed out that the Government had not directed the District Collectors to issue

                  the impugned notices. The learned counsel pointed out that the State Government

                  had not filed counter affidavit in the writ petitions. The learned counsel argued

                  that the District Collectors have no authority to take a stand on behalf of the State

                  Government. The learned counsel also pointed out that the Director of Mining

                  also had no authority. However, he directed the Collector to issue the impugned

                  notices. The learned counsel stated that there was no application of mind by the

                  Collector, before issuing on notice. The learned counsel pointed out that under

                  Rule 36 A provides for penalty and Rule 36 C of the Tamilnadu Minor Mineral

                  Concession Rules, 1959, provides for appeal to the District Collector.               The

                  learned counsel also pointed out the fact that the State Level Environmental

                  Impact Assessment Authority had not been formed and hence obtaining

                  Environment clearance was an impossibility and that the petitioners cannot be

                  faulted for not submitting them. The learned counsel stated that the writ petitions

                  should be allowed.

                  learned counsel also adopted the arguments of Mr.K.Ramakrishna Reddy and

                  Mr.V.Sanjeevi. The learned counsel pointed out that Rule 42 (4) provides for

                  termination of the lease, but for reasons best known to the respondents, they have

                  not resorted to that option. They should have issued prior notice before issuing

                  the impugned notices. However, the demand has been raised claiming that it is

                  based on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. The learned

                  counsel stated that there had been inordinate a delay on the part of the State Level

                  Environmental Impact Assessment Authority in granting Environment Clearance

                  and therefore, stated that the petitioners could not be faulted.

                           97.The learned counsel pointed out that the respective District Collectors

                  had actually granted transport permits and therefore, there can be no illegality in

                  the quarrying of the mines or in transporting them even during the period from

                  15.01.2016 to 10.01.2017. The learned counsel also urged that the writ petitions

                  should be allowed.

                  Clearance. Thereafter, they have submitted a 2nd mining plan. That was kept

                  pending by the respondents. The learned counsel stated that the petitioner had

                  filed a writ petition seeking a mandamus to issue Environment Clearance and to

                  issue transport permit. A direction was issued. However, the respondents have

                  not granted Environment Clearance. The learned counsel stated that the writ

                  petitions should be allowed and had also faulted the impugned notices on the

                  grand of non application of mind.



                           99.Mr.T.Poornam, learned counsel for the writ petitioner in W.P.Nos.889

                  and 894 of 2020 stated that there is no reference to the judgment of Deepak

                  Kumar case (referred supra), in the impugned notices. The learned counsel

                  stated that the judgment in Common Cause (referred supra) has no connection

                  with the judgment of Deepak Kumar case (referred supra). The learned counsel

                  also stated that the judgment in Common Cause (referred supra) was lessee

                  specific and product specific. It was also territory specific. The said judgment

                  related to a specific lessee, who had mined Iron and Manganize in Odisha. The

                  learned counsel stated that Iron and Manganize were major minerals. The learned

                  counsel therefore stated that the said judgment cannot give cause to the respective

                  District Collectors to issue the impugned notices.



                           100.The learned counsel relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme

                  Court in AIR 1978 SC 851 (Mohinder Singh Gill and others Vs. The Chief

                  Election Commissioner, New Delhi and others), wherein, a Constitution Bench

                  while examining the issue of ordering fresh poll with respect to Ferozepore

                  Parliamentary Constitution for the elections held on 16.03.1977 also had an

                  occasion to examine an administrative order and in paragraph No.8 of the said

                  judgment, had stated that “public orders, publicly made in exercise of a statutory

                  authority cannot be construed in the light of explanations subsequently given by



                  the officer making the order of what he meant, or what was in his mind, or what

                  he intended to do.” The Constitution Bench had for the purpose of that

                  proposition placed reliance on the observations in AIR 1952 SC 16 (The

                  Commissioner of Police, Bombay Vs. Gordhandas Bhanji).

                  another Vs. Mahadev Appa Rao and others with K.Surekha Vs. Mahadev Appa

                  authority exercising administrative / executive or statutory powers must be

                  judged by the reasons stated in the order or in any record or file

                  contemporaneously maintained”. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in this case had

                  also relied on the judgment in AIR 1952 SC 16 (The Commissioner of Police,

                  Bombay Vs. Gordhandas Bhanji) and also on the judgment of the Constitution

                  Bench in AIR 1978 SC 851 (Mohinder Singh Gill and another Vs. Chief

                  Election Commissioner, New Delhi and others).



                           102.The learned counsel also placed reliance on the judgment of the

                  Petroleum Corporation Limited Vs. Darius Shapur Chennai and others),

                           103.The learned counsel pointed out the judgment of the Jharkhand High

                  Court in W.P.(C) No.7286 of 2017 (M/s.Hindalco Industries Limited Vs. The

                  State of Jharkhand and others), wherein, a similar issue had been raised with

                  respect to Bauxite and Copper and wherein, interim orders had been granted and

                  the matter had been posted for final hearing. The learned counsel stated that the

                  petitioner was deemed to have been granted extension of license. He also stated

                  that prior show cause notice was not issued. The learned counsel pointed out the

                  writ petition in W.P.No.29275 of 2016 filed by the petitioner, wherein, interim

                  orders were granted and thereafter, W.A.No.72 of 2017 had been filed. Further

                  another writ petition in W.P.No.25518 of 2006 had also been filed. A contempt



                  petition had also been filed. The learned counsel pointed out that Magnesite and

                  Dunite are minerals, which are co-terminus and found in same rock. The learned

                  deemed extension of the lease period in view of the fact that the respondents have

                  kept the applications pending without answering it. The learned counsel stated

                  that the writ petitions should be allowed.



                           104.Mr.Rahul Balaji, learned counsel for the writ petitioner in W.P.No.2031

                  of 2020 during the course of his arguments referred to the written submission

                  submitted and stated that the judgment in Deepak Kumar (referred supra) held

                  that Environment Clearance was required for leases of minor minerals including

                  renewals for an area less than 5 hectares and that the Ministry of Environment

                  and Forest had issued an Office Memorandum on 04.01.2013, pursuant to a

                  clarification sought by the State Level Environmental Impact Assessment

                  Authority, Karnataka stating that there was no requirement for Environment

                  Clearance for major minerals in mining area of less than 5 hectares.

                  Taluk, Perambalur District.       The learned counsel also relied on another

                  clarificatory letter dated 08.01.2016 issued by the Ministry of Environment and

                  Forest, wherein, it had been stated that after 07.10.2014, all new mining

                  operations required prior Environment Clearance and for existing mines,

                  Environment Clearance must be obtained at the time of renewal of mining leases.

                  It had been also clarified that mines of major minerals with lease area of less than

                  5 hectares, which have been operating before 07.10.2014, may continue with

                  mining operations with the consented capacity and that there shall be no

                  enhancement of the production capacity without prior Environment Clearance.



                           106.The learned counsel also pointed out the notification dated 15.01.2016

                  of the Ministry of Environment and Forest, which referred only to minor

                  minerals.     The learned counsel contended that the said notification was not

                  applicable for mining leases for major minerals.



                           107.The learned counsel relied on the order dated 19.02.2016 passed by the

                  and others, in O.A.No.495 of 2015. The learned counsel claimed that there was

                  no notification issued even as on 19.02.2016 for mandatory Environment

                  Clearance for mining major minerals in lease area of less than 5 hectares. The

                  learned counsel stated that in January 2017, the District Authorities had directed

                  the petitioner to stop mining operations and refused to issue transport permits.

                  The petitioner had, then, applied for Environment Clearance with the State Level

                  Environmental Impact Assessment Authority. The learned counsel stated that

                  inconsistent positions were taken by the Ministry of Environment and Forest on

                  the applicability of the    Environment Impact Assessment Notification dated

                  15.01.2016 to major minerals with less than 5 hectares.



                           108.The learned counsel pointed out that in the communication dated

                  Secretary, Industries Department, Tamilnadu, stating that the notification of the

                  year 2006 would be applicable to mining leases for major minerals with mining

                  area of less than 5 hectares. The learned counsel also drew the notice of this Court

                  to the notification dated 15.01.2016, in which, both major and minor minerals

                  were mentioned. However, by the clarification issued to the Tamilnadu Small

                  Mine Owners Federation, the Ministry of Environment and Forest had addressed

                  a response on 17.08.2017 stating that the notification dated 15.01.2016 was

                  applicable to minor minerals and with respect to major minerals, the procedure

                  was as per schedule 'A' of Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006.

                  However, by the communication dated 04.10.2017, which was in response to the

                  communication issued by the petitioner, the respondents have stated that all

                  mining leases both major and minor minerals were required to obtain

                  Environment Clearance. The learned counsel lamented at the inconsistent stands

                  taken by the officials.



                           109.The learned counsel further pointed out that the State of Tamilnadu had

                  approached the National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench, seeking extension of

                  time. That was rejected. In the said application, the State of Tamilnadu had

                  submitted that the delay in implementation was owing to the fact that the

                  Chairman of State Level Environmental Impact Assessment Authority, Tamilnadu

                  were pending. The learned counsel also pointed out the order of National Green

                  Tribunal, Principal Bench in Satendra Pandey Vs. Ministry of Environment and

                  Forest and others (O.A.No.186 of 2018), dated 13.09.2018, wherein, it was

                  stated that the notification dated 15.01.2016 was not in consonance with the

                  judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar case (referred supra).

                  By a subsequent order dated 11.12.2018, in Vikrant Tongad Vs. Union of India,

                  the National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench, in E.A.No.55 of 2018 in

                  O.A.No.520 of 2016, has also suspended the operation of the notification dated

                  15.01.2016 and consequently, the learned counsel stated that no penalties can be

                  levied on the basis of the notification dated 15.01.2016.



                           110.The learned counsel stated that there is still ambiguity on the

                  applicability of the notification dated 15.01.2016 to major minerals in mining

                  lease area of less than 5 hectares. The learned counsel also stated that the order

                  levying penalty had been passed without any determination / adjudication of

                  liability and without any fact finding exercise and without any finding of

                  violation. The learned counsel questioned the reliance placed on the judgment of

                  Common Cause (referred supra) in the impugned notice stating that the said

                  judgment was not applicable to mining major minerals in lease area of less than 5

                  hectares. The learned counsel also pointed out that the penalty levied based on

                  the Common Cause (referred supra), had been challenged before the Hon'ble

                  High Court of Jharkhand in W.P.(C) No.7286 of 2017 by Hindalco Industries and

                  interim orders had been granted by the said High Court.



                           111.The learned counsel stated that the petitioner was granted an approval

                  by the Indian Bureau of Mining, by letter dated 08.11.2017. The learned counsel

                  stated that the impugned order has to be struck down on all the above grounds

                  and also particularly because it violated the principles of natural justice. The

                  learned counsel therefore urged that the writ petition should be allowed.

                  show cause notice and without providing an opportunity of hearing, that the

                  impugned notices issued by the respective District Collectors were based on the



                  judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India dated 02.08.2017 in the matter

                  of Common Cause (referred supra) and based on the instructions issued by the

                  Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in the Office Memorandum

                  dated 30.05.2018.



                           113.The learned Additional Advocate General stated that prior notice is not

                  required in the matter of recovery of cost of mineral under <a href="/doc/36867/" id="a_37">Section 21</a> (5) of the

                  Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_38">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957.                The learned

                  Additional Advocate General also stated that the issuance of a prior show cause

                  notice and providing an opportunity of hearing would be a futile exercise, since

                  the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is binding on all and the petitioners

                  cannot claim any special privilege on that issue. The learned Additional Advocate

                  General also stated that a show cause notice and a reasonable opportunity of

                  being heard has to be provided only when there is termination of the mining lease

                           114.The learned Additional Advocate General further stated that if the

                  lessee does not permit the entry of inspection by the authorities, then, under Rule

                  27-4 of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, a notice is required to be issued,

                  questioning why the lease should not be determined. More over, if the lessee

                  makes any default in the payment of royalty or payment of dead rent or commits

                  breach of any of the conditions specified under Rule 27 (1), 27 (2) and 27 (3) of

                  the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, then, notice is required and the Government

                  may determine the lease and forfeit the whole or part of the security deposit as

                  provided under Rule 27 (5) of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960. It was also

                  pointed out that the District Collectors may cancel a lease after granting

                  opportunity of hearing under Rule 36 (5) (h) of the Tamilnadu Minor Mineral

                  Concession Rules, 1959. The learned Additional Advocate General reiterated that

                  Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_43">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957, which does not contemplate

                  issuance of prior notice and therefore, urged that show cause notice or an

                  opportunity of hearing is not required.



                           115.With respect to the contention raised by the learned counsels for the

                  petitioners that the mining operations carried on till the end of 630 days, which

                  was stipulated under Rule 42 (iii) of the Tamilnadu Minor Mineral Concession

                  Rules, 1959, cannot be treated as illegal, the learned Additional Advocate General

                  stated that the Hon'ble Supreme Court had very categorically stated in the matter

                  of Deepak Kumar (referred supra) that every mining operation carried on

                  without obtaining Environment Clearance is to be declared as illegal.



                           116.The learned Additional Advocate General stated that a long period of

                  630 days was granted for obtaining Environment Clearance and if the petitioners

                  have chosen not to obtain the same or to submit only partially filled applications,

                  then their activity of mining is certainly to be categorized as illegal. The learned

                  Additional Advocate General also relied on the order of the National Green

                  Tribunal dated 18.04.2017 in M.A.No.260 of 2017 in O.A.No.123 of 2014 and

                  reiterated that grant of prior Environmental Clearance is mandatory by the

                  judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, by the orders of the National

                  Green Tribunal and under the Tamilnadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959.

                  The learned Additional Advocate General also pointed out that the Ministry of

                  Environment, Forest and Climate Change, by letter dated 03.04.2017, had

                  informed that all mining leases both major as well as minor minerals have to

                  obtain Environmental Clearance after 15.01.2016 and that no mining leases are

                  to operate without prior Environmental Clearance.



                           117.The learned Additional Advocate General very specifically stated that

                  while calculating the cost of the minerals, mined and transported the period of

                  180 days stipulated in Rule 42 (3) in G.O.Ms.No.79, Industries (MMC-1)

                  Department, dated 06.04.2015, was not taken under the account. The learned

                  Additional Advocate General also stated that as directed by the Ministry of

                  Environment, Forest and Climate Change, by letter dated 03.04.2017, the mining

                  carried out without Environment Clearance from 15.01.2016 to 10.01.2017 was

                  considered as a violation and the quantum of minerals mined and transported

                  from 15.01.2016 to 10.01.2017 was taken into account for the purpose of

                  recovery of the cost of minerals under <a href="/doc/36867/" id="a_44">Section 21</a> (5) of the Mines and Minerals

                  (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_45">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957.          The learned Additional Advocate

                  General therefore justified the demand issued by the respective District

                  Collectors.



                           118.With respect to the submission that no penalty can be levied against the

                  lessees, who had actually obtained the Environmental Clearance before

                  10.01.2017, the learned Additional Advocate General stated that the

                  Environmental Clearance will have only prospective effect and will not have

                  retrospective effect and therefore, for the period till the Environmental Clearance

                  was not obtained, the penalty had been issued. The learned Additional Advocate

                  General stated that the period, for which mining was carried on without

                  Environment Clearance alone, had been taken into account for the purpose of

                  recovery of the cost of the minerals. The learned Additional Advocate General

                  therefore justified the demands made by the respective District Collectors.

                           119.With respect to the submission that the leases could have been

                  terminated under Rule 42 (4) of the Tamilnadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules,

                  1959 and levy of penalty was not proper, the learned Additional Advocate

                  General stated that Rule 42 (4) stipulates that when the existing lease holders fail

                  to submit Environment Clearance within a stipulated period, the lease can be

                  cancelled after giving opportunity of hearing. However, the present demands

                  have been made consequent to the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

                  Common Cause (referred supra), wherein, a direction was issued that 100% cost

                  of the minerals must be collected from the defaulting lessees.



                           120.With respect to the submission made by the learned counsels for the

                  petitioners that the judgment in the matter of Common Cause (referred supra)

                  was not applicable to the writ petitioners because the said judgment related to

                  Iron and Manganize in Odisha and therefore, it is mine specific and State specific,

                  the learned Additional Advocate General stated that interpretations given by the

                  Hon'ble Supreme Court for illegal mining will be applicable to all the minerals

                  both major as well as minor minerals. She further stated that under <a href="/doc/273323/" id="a_46">Section 14</a> of

                  to <a href="/doc/46343/" id="a_49">13</a> will not be applicable to the minor minerals. She further stated that demand

                  notices are perfectly valid and the levying cost of the minerals for a quantum of

                  minor minerals mined and transported.



                           121.With respect to the contentions of the learned counsel in

                  W.P.Nos.27182 and 27183 of 2013, the learned Additional Advocate General

                  pointed out



                  that the petitioner therein had applied for a 2nd mining scheme, but the relevant

                  documents were not furnished and had continued to mine even without obtaining

                  Environment Clearance. The learned Additional Advocate General therefore

                  justified the impugned notices and stated that the writ petitions should be

                  dismissed.

                  raised in W.P.Nos.889 and 894 of 2020, the learned Additional Advocate General

                  stated that the leases can be extended till 31.03.2030 only subject to the

                  compliance of all terms and conditions of the lease. There cannot be any deemed

                  renewal of the lease under <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_50">Section 8A</a> (5) of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_51">Amendment Act</a>, 2015. The

                  learned Additional Advocate General pointed out that the petitioners had applied

                  for Environment Clearance on 09.02.2006 and had submitted a revised

                  application on 12.10.2011. Thus, it is seen that they had mined the minerals

                  without obtaining Environment Clearance. It was stated that for that the demand

                  notices have been issued for the quantum of Magnesite mined and transported for

                  the period 2000-2001, based on the base year of 1993-1994 as ordered by the

                  Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of Common Cause (referred

                  supra). The learned Additional Advocate General therefore justified the demand

                  made.

                  the State Level Environmental Impact Assessment Authority.            The petitioner

                  herein did not have Environment Clearance for carrying out mining operations

                  from 15.01.2016.     It was stated that the petitioner had carried out mining

                  operations over an extent of 18.11.5 Hectares in S.F.No.169/1, 169/2, 169/3, etc.,

                  in Varagupadi Village, Kunnam Taluk, Perambalur District from 24.10.1993

                  onwards without obtaining Environment Clearance and therefore, the mining

                  operations will have to be declared as illegal and the learned Additional Advocate

                  General justified the demand notices on the said petitioners. The learned

                  Additional Advocate General finally stated that the demand notices are

                  sustainable and urged that the writ petitions should be dismissed.



                           124.The learned counsels on behalf of the State Level Environmental

                  Impact Assessment Authority pointed out that whenever the applications have

                  been properly filled and submitted, the Environment Clearance has always been

                  filled applications. The learned counsels therefore stated that the Authority could

                  not issue Environment Clearance on the basis of such applications filed by the

                  petitioners in the said manner. The learned counsels therefore justified the

                  demand notices and urged that the writ petitions should be dismissed.



                           125.Mr.K.Ramakrishna Reddy and Mr.V.Sanjeevi, learned counsels for the

                  petitioners advanced arguments in reply to the submissions of the learned

                  Additional Advocate General.



                           126.The learned counsels stated that there was no appeal provision

                  available to the petitioners. They again urged that show cause notices should have

                  been issued. They stated that the respondents should have granted an opportunity



                  to the petitioners to explain the actual facts of each and every case. On the other

                  hand, the respective District Collectors have issued a printed demand notice and

                  have filled in the name of the petitioners.      With respect to the amount as

                  calculated, it was pointed out that no separate calculation sheet had been annexed

                  to show as to how the amounts had been arrived at. The learned counsels also

                  pointed out that the Environment Clearance could not be obtained since the

                  Authority was not functioning effectively and therefore they urged that the writ

                  petitions should be allowed.



                           127.I have carefully considered the arguments advanced on either side.



                           128.The writ petition in W.P.No.26808 of 2019 had been filed in the nature

                  of certiorari questioning the notice issued by the District Collector,

                  Tiruvannamalai, dated 31.07.2019 in Na.Ka.No.438/Minerals/2019-29 to the

                  petitioner calling upon him to pay a sum of Rs.24,99,525/- towards the cost of

                  minerals quarried between 15.01.2016 and 22.11.2016.




                           129.The petitioner had been permitted to quarry minor minerals in the land

                  measuring 2 hectares in S.No.1 of Kolamanjanur village, Thandarmapattu Taluk

                  by      the   proceedings    of   the   District   Collector,   Tiruvannamalai          in

                  R.C.No.230/Minerals-2/2009 dated 31.03.2009 for a period of 10 years from

                  31.03.2009 to 30.03.2019. The petitioner had continued quarry till 11.12.2016.

                  The petitioner had not obtained Environment Clearance till the date he stopped

                  quarrying.      In these circumstances, the impugned notice was issued to the

                  petitioner.



                           130.Similar notices had been issued by the District Collectors of the

                  respective Districts against the petitioners in all the writ petitions. Common

                  arguments were advanced questioning the impugned notices on various grounds

                  particularly on the ground of violation of principles of natural justice and also that

                  obtaining Environment Clearance was an impossibility in view of the fact that a

                  structured State Level Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) was

                  not established by the Government.



                           131.In several writ petitions, it had been stated that though applications had

                  been made seeking Environment Clearance, the applications have not been

                  processed and the fault lay with SEIAA in not issuing the Environment Clearance.

                           132.The impugned notices were issued primarily based on the observations

                  of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the judgment reported in 2017 (9) SCC

                  499 (Common Cause Vs. Union of India) dated 02.08.2017. The petitioners

                  have also questioned the locus of the District Collectors to issue the impugned

                  notices.



                           133.The petitioners in W.P.Nos.889 and 894 of 2020 had also questioned

                  the reliance placed by the District Collector on the judgment of the Hon'ble

                  Supreme Court of India in Common Cause (referred supra) by putting forth an

                  argument that the said judgment was State centric, mineral centric and territory

                  area centric and therefore, the principles enunciated therein would not be

                  applicable to the writ petitioners.



                           134.The petitioner in W.P.No.2031 of 2020 had raised an issue that the

                  petitioner therein was quarrying limestone, which was a major mineral and

                  therefore, doubted the sanctity of the proceedings initiated against the petitioner

                  herein.



                           135.Before addressing the issues raised, which require very deep

                  consideration, I am under an obligation to place on record a few facts.



                           136.The oral arguments in this batch of writ petitions concluded late in the

                  evening on 28.02.2020. Thereafter, from 03.03.2020, I had been directed to

                  preside in the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court. In Madurai, I was

                  informed that a batch of writ petitions on the same issue was also pending and

                  since I was holding a similar portfolio, that batch was listed on 13.03.2020. I

                  enquired the learned counsels whether I can proceed to deliver judgment in the

                  already heard batch of cases or whether they would argue the issues raised in

                  those batch of cases.



                           137.It was generally stated in the Bar that arguments would be advanced so

                  that a common order can be passed in both batches, since the issues involved

                  were the same. However, even before the next hearing date on 30.03.2020, when

                  the matter was listed for arguments, a complete lockdown of the Courts were

                  announced owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thereafter, it was possible to list

                  the batch again only on 04.06.2020. The learned Senior Counsel, who had been

                  engaged, stated that final arguments would be advanced on 18.06.2020 and this

                  date was also consented by the Additional Advocate General, who appeared for

                  the respondents.



                           138.Unfortunately, a further restriction of the Court hearing was announced

                  and the hearings in Madurai Bench were restricted to one Division Bench and

                  three single Judges to hear urgent cases through 'Video Conferencing' on rotation

                  basis every week. My turn would end on 14.06.2020. On and from 15.06.2020,

                  the portfolio regarding writ jurisdiction would be taken over by my brothers and

                  sisters Judges as indicated by the Hon'ble Administrative Judge. Consequently,

                  hearing arguments in the batch matters pending in Madurai Bench on 18.06.2020

                  has now become an impossibility. Therefore, left with no other alternative, I have

                  taken up a conscious decision to deliver a common as hereunder in the batch of

                  writ petitions in which arguments have been heard in full.

                           139.Before proceeding to address the issues raised, it would be worthwhile

                  to examine the provision of the Mines and Minerals (Development and

                  <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_52">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957, (67 of 1957).

                  the cost of the individual sufferers as well as the cost of reversing the damaged

                  ecology. Therefore, expanding the principle to provide compensation to the

                  sufferers, the Hon'ble Supreme Court evolved further obligation namely, to

                  potable water. The Hon'ble Supreme Court directed the closure of the tannery

<p id="p_78">                          184.The learned counsels for the writ petitioners put forth a very strange

                  argument. They claimed that under G.O.Ms.No.79, Industries (MMC-1)

                  Department, dated 06.04.2015, in Rule 42 (iii), a total period of 180 days was

                  extended by the State Government to ultimately 630 days. Therefore, they stated

                  that till the expiry of 630 days, all the mining operations are perfectly legal. They

                  also stated that till the expiry of 630 days, there was no obligation to produce

                  Environment Clearance.
</p>


<p id="p_79">                          185.These arguments are rejected by me. They do not withstand legal

                  scrutiny. The minute Rules 41 and 42 were introduced by G.O.Ms.No.79,

                  (referred supra), on 06.05.2015 and published in the Tamilnadu Government

                  Gazette on 22.04.2015, the time had begun to run to provide a mining plan for

                  approval to obtain Environment Clearance. Merely because the Government had

                  given them 180 days and extended the period to 630 days, the petitioners herein

                  cannot put forth on argument that they would wait for 629 days and 23 hours and

                  59 minutes without submitting the mining plan and without obtaining

                  Environment Clearance and that only on the 630th day, can their operations be

                  termed as illegal. The petitioners have advanced arguments before a Court of law

                  and not before a public platform. The rules were incorporated by the State of

                  Tamilnadu in the Tamilnadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959. The Rules

                  affidavit, stated that he had not even filed an application seeking Environment

                  Clearance. Such a petitioner does not deserve any leverage from this Court.

                  for the Authorities to grant Environment Clearance. In this connection, the details

<p id="p_191">                          190.The Hon'ble Supreme Court very categorically stated that illegal

                  mining does not mean mining outside the area leased, but also mining inside the

                  area leased without a mining plan. It had been stated that the purpose of the

                  <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_101">MMDR Act</a>, 1957, is to ensure scientific mining, balanced utilisation of natural

                  resources and protection and preservation of environment by adhering to statutory

                  provisions. This judgment was referred to in all the impugned notices by the

                  respective District Collectors.

                  particularly to the writ petitioner in W.P.Nos.889 and 894 of 2020, because the

                  judgment, according to him, was lessee specific, product specific, territory

                  specific and related only to major minerals. Therefore, the learned counsel stated

                  that the judgment should not have been referred by the District Collectors, since it

                  is not applicable to the State of Tamilnadu or rather it cannot give a cause of

                  action to initiate the proceedings by the District Collectors through the impugned

                  notices in the State of Tamilnadu.

                  territory of India. It is unfortunate that this aspect has to be reminded to the

                  learned counsels for the petitioners. Further, when the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in

<p id="p_198">                           199.In Common Cause (referred supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

                  examined the report of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC). It referred to

                  lessees in the Districts of Keonjhar, Sundergarh and Mayurbhanj in Odisha,

                  wherein, mining of Iron ore and Manganese ore destroyed the forests and caused

                  untold misery to the tribals in the area.

                                 “130. It is not, as suggested by learned counsel, that illegal mining is
                          confined only to mining operations outside a leased area. Such an activity is
                          obviously illegal or unlawful mining. Illegal mining takes within its fold excess
                          extraction of a mineral over the permissible limit even within the mining lease
                          area which is held under lawful authority, if that excess extraction is contrary to
                          the mining scheme, the mining plan, the mining lease or a statutory requirement.
                          Even otherwise, it is not possible for us to accept the narrow interpretation
                          sought to be canvassed by learned counsel for the mining lease holders
                          particularly since we are dealing with a natural resource which is intended for
                          the benefit of everyone and not only for the benefit of the mining lease holders.”

                          when any person raises, without any lawful authority, any mineral from any

                          makes an order, is the order an order of the officer or of the Government? We
                          think it must be the order of the Government. The order is made under a
                          statutory power. It is the statute which creates that power. The power can,
                          therefore, be exercised only in terms of the statute and not otherwise. In this
                          case the power is created by <a href="/doc/53181972/" id="a_126">Section 21</a> (4). That section gives the power to
                          the Government. it would follow that an order made in exercise of that power
                          will be the order of the Government for no one else has the right under the
                          statute to exercise the power. No doubt the Act enables the Government to
                          delegate its power but such a power when delegated remain,; the power of
                          the Government, for the Government can only delegate the power given to it
                          by the statute and cannot create an independent power in the officer. When
                          the delegate exercises the power, he does so for the Government. It is of
                          interest to observe here that Wills, J., said in Huth v. Clarke (1) that "'the
                          word delegate means little more than an agent". An agent of course exercises
                          no powers of his own but only the powers of his principal. Therefore, an
                          order passed by an officer on delegation to him under <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_127">Section 41</a> (1) of the
                          power of the Government under <a href="/doc/53181972/" id="a_128">Section 21</a> (4), is for the purposes of the Act
                          an order of the Government. If it were not so and it were to be held that the
                          order had been made by the officer himself and was not an order of the
                          Government-and of course it had to be one or the other-then we would have
                          an order made by a person on whom the Act did not confer any power to
                          make it. That would be an impossible situation. There can be no order except
                          as authorised by the Act. What is true of <a href="/doc/53181972/" id="a_129">Section 21</a> (4) would be true of all
                          other provisions in the Act conferring powers on the Government which can
                          be delegated to an officer under <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_130">Section 41</a> (1). If we are wrong in the view

                          that we have taken, then in the case of an order made by an officer as

                          appeal entertained to and decided by one who had no power himself under
                          the Act to do either. Plainly, none of these things could be done.”

                  argument in one voice that the impugned notice suffers from violation of

                  principles of natural justice. I hold that the principles of natural justice cannot be

                  extended for complying with the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of

                  India. Articles 141 and 142 of the Constitution of India have been extracted

                  above. It is clear that any order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court is binding

                  on every person.         The date, when the Hon'ble Supreme Court directed that

                  Environment Clearance is a pre-requisite for grant of extension of lease even for

                  mining of lands of less than 5 hectares is the date when the petitioners were

                  bound to get Environment Clearance. They do not require any further notice.
</p>
<p id="p_223">                  The date, on which, Common Cause (referred supra), was pronounced and the

                  Hon'ble Supreme Court had held that if mining activities are continued without

                  obtaining Environment Clearance, then 100% compensation is leviable, then from

                  that date onwards, the liability of the petitioners had arisen and they need not be

                  put on any further notice. The law declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court is

                  binding on all Courts of the country. Further, issuing a show cause notice would

                  only be an empty formality. The petitioners if at all they want to reply to any

                  show cause notice, can only question the rationals of the Supreme Court

                  Judgment. They cannot do so. They are bound by the judgment.

                  the proposition that the demand notices had been issued without prior show cause

                  notice, I would state that the impugned notices in these writ petitions had been

                  issued based on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Common Cause

                  (referred supra) and as pointed out under <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_132">Article 141</a> of the Constitution of India,

                  any order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is binding on all Courts. Issuing of a

                  prior notice would only be an empty formality and therefore, I hold that the

                  petitioners cannot complaint about non issuance of prior notice. Obligations had

                  arisen the date the Hon'ble Supreme Court pronounced its judgment and the

                  District Collectors were only following the mandate of the Hon'ble Supreme

                  participated. They did not do. The notices had been issued pursuant to the

                  directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. If the notices said to be

                  arbitrary, then as a corollary it must be held that the judgment of the Hon'ble

                  effect of “ useless formality” - a theory, which is an exemption to the principles

                  of natural justice.
</p>
<p id="p_235">                                 “21.As pointed recently in M.C. Mehta Vs. Union of India (1999
                          (6) SCC 237), there can be certain situations in which an order passed in
                          violation of natural justice need not be set aside under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_134">Article 226</a> of the
                          Constitution of India. For example where no prejudice is caused to the
                          person concerned, interference under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_135">Article 226</a> is not necessary.
                          Similarly, if the quashing of the order which is in breach of natural justice
                          is likely to result in revival of another order which is in itself illegal as in
                          <a href="/doc/1125589/" id="a_136">Gadde Venkateswara Rao vs. Government of Andhra Pradesh</a> [1966 (2)
                          SCR 172 = AIR 1966 SC 828], it is not necessary to quash the order
                          merely because of violation of principles of natural justice.
</p><p id="p_236">                                 22.In M.C.Mehta {1999} 6 SCC 237 it was pointed out that at one
                          time, it was held in Ridge vs. Baldwin ( 1964 AC 40) that breach of
                          principles of natural justice was in itself treated as prejudice and that no
                          other 'defacto' prejudice needed to be proved. But, since then the rigour of
                          the rule has been relaxed not only in England but also in our country. In
                          S.L. Kapoor Vs. Jagmohan ( 1980 (4) SCC 379), Chinnappa Reddy, J.
                          followed Ridge vs. Baldwin and set aside the order of supercession of the

                          no prejudice though notice was not given. The proceedings were quashed
                          on the ground of violation of principles of natural justice. But even in that
                          case certain exceptions were laid down to which we shall presently refer.
</p>
<p id="p_237">                                23.Chinnappa Reddy, J. in S.L.Kapoor's case [(1980) 4 SCC 379],
                          laid two exceptions (at p.395) namely, " if upon admitted or indisputable
                          facts only one conclusion was possible", then in such a case, the principle
                          that breach of natural justice was in itself prejudice, would not apply. In
                          other words if no other conclusion was possible on admitted or
                          indisputable facts, it is not necessary to quash the order which was passed
                          in violation of natural justice. Of course, this being an exception, great
                          care must be taken in applying this exception.
</p>
<p id="p_238">                                24.The principle that in addition to breach of natural justice,
                          prejudice must also be proved has been developed in several cases. In K.L.
                          Tripathi Vs. State Bank of India ( 1984(1) SCC 43), Sabyasachi
                          Mukherji, J. ( as he then was) also laid down the principle that not mere
                          violation of natural justice but de facto prejudice (other than non-issue of
                          notice) had to be proved. It was observed: quoting Wade Administrative
                          Law, (5th Ed.PP.472-475) as follows: ( para 31)

                                "....it is not possible to lay down rigid rules as to when principles of
                          natural justice are to apply, nor as their scope and extent ....There must
                          have been some real prejudice to the complainant; there is no such thing as
                          a merely technical infringement of natural justice. The requirements of
                          natural justice must depend on the facts and circumstances of the case, the

</p>
<p id="p_239">                                 Since then, this Court has consistently applied the principle of
                          prejudice in several cases. The above ruling and various other rulings
                          taking the same view have been exhaustively referred to in State Bank of
                          Patiala Vs. S.K. Sharma ( 1996(3) SCC 364). In that case, the principle of
                          'prejudice' has been further elaborated. The same principle has been
                          reiterated again in Rajendra Singh Vs. State of M.P. ( 1996(5) SCC 460).
</p>
<p id="p_240">                                 25.The 'useless formality' theory, it must be noted, is an exception.
                          Apart from the class of cases of "admitted or indisputable facts leading
                          only to one conclusion" referred to above,- there has been considerable
                          debate of the application of that theory in other cases. The divergent views
                          expressed in regard to this theory have been elaborately considered by this
                          Court in M.C. Mehta referred to above. This Court surveyed the views
                          expressed in various judgments in England by Lord Reid, Lord
                          Wilberforce, Lord Woolf, Lord Bingham, Megarry, J. and Straughton
                          L.J. etc. in various cases and also views expressed by leading writers like
                          Profs. Garner, Craig, De. Smith, Wade, D.H. Clark etc. Some of them have
                          said that orders passed in violation must always be quashed for otherwise
                          the Court will be prejudging the issue. Some others have said, that there is
                          no such absolute rule and prejudice must be shown. Yet, some others have
                          applied via-media rules. We do not think it necessary, in this case to go
                          deeper into these issues. In the ultimate analysis, it may depend on the
                          facts of a particular case.”

                          them cannot be accepted. The principles of natural justice were also not
                          required to be complied with as the same would have been an empty
                          formality. The court will not insist on compliance of the principles of

                          application would be limited to a situation where the factual position or
                          legal implication arising thereunder is disputed and not where it is not in
                          dispute or cannot be disputed. If only one conclusion is possible, a writ

                          for the appellant, it is seen that they revolve around violation of the
                          principles of natural justice. Even at the outset, we are not impressed
                          with the said argument, since in our opinion, “Principles of natural
                          justice is for thoroughbred horses and not wild horses.” Wild horses
                          understand only the language of the whip and hence there is no use
                          trying to tame them with persuasion. The principles of natural justice
                          themselves have traversed a long way from the stage at which they were
                          treated as a “tharaka manthra” or panacea for all diseases, to the

                          referred to hereinabove. On 19.11.1993, by an interim order, the Court

                          price of the mineral cannot be said to be levy of penalty or a penal
                          action. The marginal note of the Section __ 'Penalties', creates a wrong
                          impression. A reading of <a href="/doc/53181972/" id="a_141">Section 21</a> shows that it deals with a variety of
                          situations. Sub-Sections (1), (2), (4), (4A) and (6) are in the realm of
                          criminal law. Sub-Section (3) empowers the State Government or any
                          authority authorized in this behalf to summarily evict a trespasser. Sub-
                          Section (5) empowers the State Government to recover rent, royalty or
                          tax from the person who has raised the mineral from any land without
                          any lawful authority and also empowers the State Government to recover
                          the price thereof where such mineral has already been disposed of
                          inasmuch as the same would not be available for seizure and
                          confiscation. The provision as to recovery of price is in the nature of
                          recovering the compensation and not penalty so also the power of the
                          State Government to recover rent, royalty or tax in respect of any
                          mineral raised without any lawful authority can also not be called a
                          penal action. The underlying principle of sub-Section (5) is that a person
                          acting without any lawful authority must not find himself placed in a
                          position more advantageous than a person raising minerals with lawful
                          authority.

</p><p id="p_254">                                13.A penal statute or penal law is a law that defines an offence
                          and prescribes its corresponding fine, penalty or punishment. (Blacks
                          Law Dictionary, Seventh Edition, p.1421). Penalty is a liability
                          composed as a punishment on the party committing the breach. The very
                          use of the term 'penal' is suggestive of punishment and may also include
                          any extraordinary liability to which the law subjects a wrong-doer in
                          favour of the person wronged, not limited to the damages suffered. (See,

                          counsel for the appellants has relied on the marginal note of Section 21
                          According to Justice G.P. Singh on Principles of Statutory Interpretation
                          (Eighth Edition, 2001, at page147) though the opinion is not uniform but
                          the weight of authority is in favour of the view that the marginal note
                          appended to a Section cannot be used for construing the Section. There
                          is no justification for restricting the Section by the marginal note nor
                          does the marginal note control the meaning of the body of the Section if
                          the language employed therein is clear and spells out its own meaning.

<p id="p_256">                                 15.We are clearly of the opinion that the marginal note 'penalties'
                          cannot be pressed into service for giving such colour to the meaning of
                          sub-Section (5) as it cannot have in law. The recovery of price of the
                          mineral is intended to compensate the State for the loss of the mineral
                          owned by it and caused by a person who has been held to be not entitled
                          in law to raise the same. There is no element of penalty involved and the
                          recovery of price is not a penal action. It is just compensatory.”

                  collected a sum of Rs.1,55,98,04,576/- and there was a balance of Rs.8,63,346/-,
