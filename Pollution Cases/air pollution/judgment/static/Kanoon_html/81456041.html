<p id="p_3">                                        Dated: 17th August, 2018

Rajiv Sharma, ACJ (Oral)

             In sequel to the directions issued by this Court
on 16.08.2018, the Member Secretary, Uttarakhand
Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board is
present in Court with Mr. (Dr.) Ankur Kansal, Regional
Officer of the said Board.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.           The Court had specifically directed respondent
no. 2 to place on record a copy of one of the notices,
which has been issued to the private respondents to
ascertain,       whether     the    provisions    of   <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment
Protection Act</a>, 1986 and Rules framed thereunder were

              
              
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>




mentioned or not.       Today, a copy thereof was placed
before us.      On specific query put to Mr. Aman Rab,
learned     counsel     appearing   for    the    Uttarakhand
Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board, he
has drawn attention of the Court to Page 3 of the notice.
This talks only of Hazardous &amp; Other Wastes Rules,
2016.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.          It is evident from a combined reading of one of
the notices dated 20th April, 2018 that the focus is only
on The Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981
and The Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1974.     There is no whisper about the provisions of the
Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.          <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_4">Section 6</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act,
1986 lays down that the Central Government may, by
notification in the Official Gazette, make rules in respect
of all or any of the matters referred to in <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_5">Section 3</a>.
<a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_6">Section 25</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 lays
down that the Central Government may, by notification
in the Official Gazette, make rules for carrying out the
purposes of the Act.        The Central Government has
framed the Rules under <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_7">Section 6</a> read in conjunction
with <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_8">Section 25</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
called Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 (hereinafter
referred to as the Rules). Rule 3 provides that for the
purposes of protecting and improving the quality of the
environment and preventing and abating environmental
pollution, the standards for emission or discharge of
environmental pollutants from the industries, operations
or processes shall be as specified in Schedule I to IV.
Sub-rule (2) of Rule 3 starts with non-obstante clause. It
says that notwithstanding anything contained in sub-
rule (1), the Central Board or a State board may specify
more    stringent     standards   from    those   provided   in
             
               
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        3</span>




Schedule I to IV in respect of any specific industry,
operation or process depending upon the quality of the
recipient system and after recording reasons, therefor, in
writing.         Sub-rule   (3A)   of   Rule     3    provides   that
notwithstanding anything contained in sub-rules (1) and
(2), on and from the 1st day of January, 1994, emission
or discharge of environmental pollutants from the
industries, operations or processes other than those
industries, operations or processes for which standards
have been specified in Schedule I shall not exceed the
relevant parameters specified in Schedule VI, provided
that   the       State   Board   may    specify      more   stringent
standards for the relevant parameters with respect to
specific industry or locations after recording reasons
thereof in writing. It is also stipulated under Rule 3 that
the State Board shall while enforcing the standards
specified in Schedule VI follow the guidelines specified in
Annexures I and II of the Schedule.               Rule 5 prohibits
and restricts the location of the industries and the
carrying on processes and operations in different areas.
Rule 6 provides for procedure for taking samples. Service
of notice is stipulated in Rule 7.              The procedure for
submission of samples for analysis, and the form of
laboratory report thereof is provided in Rule 8.                 The
functions of environmental laboratories are stipulated
separately in Rule 9.        The qualification of Government
Analyst is provided in Rule 10.             The manner of giving
notice is provided in Rule 11.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.           We have gone through the Schedules framed
under Rule 3. These Schedules lay down very stringent
parameters to check air pollution and water pollution.
The Schedule is Industry specific.             It is clear from the
plain phraseology of Rule 3 that the State Government

              
                 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           4</span>




can prescribe more stringent provisions than provided by
the Central Government.              The guidelines are to be
followed by the State Pollution Control Board. It is not
evident from the record that the State Pollution Control
Board has ever inspected any industry to see, whether
the parameters laid down in the Schedules of the
Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 discussed above
are being complied with in letter and spirit. Dr. Ankur
Kansal, Regional Officer has submitted that since they
lack the necessary facilities, it was not possible for them
to   collect       the   samples   for    analysis.        We    fail    to
understand, how a statutory body created under the Act
can be oblivious of the provisions of the law, under which
it is created.           The State of Uttarakhand is a fast
developing         State.    There       has   to     be   sustainable
development. Sustainable development presupposes that
the development shall not be at the cost of environment.
We have seen the pictures.               They depict sorry state of
affairs. The reason for ever rising pollution in the State
of Uttarakhand is non-compliance of the provisions of the
law. If the enforcing agency itself is ignorant of the law,
how on the earth, it can be expected to enforce the same.
Since respondent no. 2 has miserably failed to enforce
the provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as well as the Hazardous Wastes
(Management          and    Handling)      Rules,     1989      and     the
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_11">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and the Rules framed
thereunder, we are constrained to implead Central
Pollution Control Board through its Member Secretary to
be respondent no. 33 in this writ petition. The Registry is
directed to carry out corrections in the memo of parties.
Mr. Mohit Maulekhi, Advocate, generally appears on
behalf of the Central Pollution Control Board and we

                
            
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  5</span>




have impressed upon him to take the notice on behalf of
the Central Pollution Control Board in view of the
urgency of the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.        Accordingly,    we   direct   the   newly   added
respondent to inspect each and every industry in the
State of Uttarakhand to see, whether the norms laid
down under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, the Hazardous Wastes (Management
and Handling) Rules, 1989 and more specifically the
Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 (Schedule I to VII)
are being complied with, within a period of six weeks
from today. The report shall be submitted to this Court
in a sealed cover. Thereafter, depending on the report,
this Court will pass further orders.
