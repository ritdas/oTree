          12]   The perusal of the judgment and order in the earlier Petition

          shows that in the first paragraph, the Division Bench has noted the





          said prayers. In paragraph 4, a submission made by the learned

          counsel appearing for the Petitioner is recorded that the provisions





          of Section 18 of the MRTP Act would be applicable. We have

          already noted that the Section 18 of the MRTP Act empowers only

          the Collector to grant development permission, when a property

          covered by a regional plan is not situated in Municipal limits. In

          paragraph 6, the Division Bench held that there was nothing illegal

          in the impugned notice under Section 53(1) of the MRTP Act. In

          paragraph 7, the Division Bench observed that considering the

          jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. In fact, this

          belongings from the structure. Thus,the prayer specifically made in




                                           
          the said petition for a direction to the first Respondent to grant

<p id="p_24">          13]   Whether construction carried out by the Petitioner is to the

          extent of 5200 Sq. Meters or of an area less than that, the fact
            


          remains that the entire construction is completely illegal as a
         



          permission in accordance with Section 18 of the MRTP Act was not

          obtained. Apart from this, we must note here that as indicated





          above, the prayer made in the earlier Writ Petition for a direction to

          are dealing with a Petitioner whose conduct is already deprecated

          by this Court in the earlier Petition. Even going by the case made




                                          
          out by the Petitioner, a very large illegal construction to the extent of
                           
          2924.51 Sq. Meters has been brazenly made by the Petitioner.

               complete     breakdown       of    governance      in    the
               enforcement of urban planning legislation within the

               within the meaning of the Maharashtra Regional Town
               Planning Act, 1966 and is duty bound to enforce those
               provisions. As many as 66,324 structures are found to

               demolition, the PCMC has taken action only against
               225 structures. The illegalities are compounded by a
               proposal for regularization en masse. This is a virtual
               negation of the rule of law. Learned counsel for PCMC





               states that PCMC lacks adequate infrastructure and is
               dependent on the Police authorities to support its
               enforcement measures. What is disturbing is the complete

               cognizance of the serious dimensions of the unauthorized
               structures within the limits of PCMC. PCMC has
               compounded the illegalities by now proposing to

          recommendations. We must note here that the order in PIL relates

          to the same Municipal Corporation and the Committee appointed by




                                                     
          the State Government which is stated to be headed by a Hon'ble

          Minister has made such recommendations. Taking a conservative




                                          
          estimate of the illegal structures in existence in the city as 66,000,
                           
          no debate is required to observe that such large scale unauthorized

          constructions have completely disturbed the concept of planned
                          
          development of the city for which Municipal Corporation has been

          constituted. Such large number of unauthorized structures will place
            


          unbearable burden on the basic amenities. The citizens who are
         



          residing in the lawfully constructed buildings and structures will be

          thus deprived of their legitimate right to effectively enjoy the





          beneficial amenities as 66,000 illegal constructions will place

          unbearable burden on the public amenities provided in the city for

          the benefit of law abiding citizens. Fortunately, it is pointed out that





          as of today, the State Government has not taken any final decision

          on the recommendations of the Committee. While taking final

          decision, the State Government cannot overlook the law laid down

          several other cases. While considering the said proposal, the State

          Government will be under an obligation to consider the findings

          2010. We have already noted the observations made by the

          Division Bench projecting the effect of protecting such large number




                                                    
          of illegal structures. From what we gather from paragraph '9' of the

          order of the Division Bench is that this Court was conscious of the




                                         
          fact that once a cut-off date is fixed for tolerating illegal
                           
          constructions, in future, there will be certainly extensions granted to

          the said cut off date. The Division Bench observed that such policy
                          
          encourages the      violators of law and gives confidence to the

          violators of law that illegal structures would be tolerated even in
            


          future. This Court has emphatically disapproved the proposal
         



          submitted by the Municipal Corporation. The disapproval expressed

          by this Court is on the proposal of the Municipal Corporation to





          regularize all unauthorized constructions. The laws regarding town

          planning cannot be defeated by tolerating such large number of

          unauthorized structures. Such toleration of structures is nothing but





          encouraging the wrongdoers who treat the law with contempt. The

          State cannot encourage illegalities. The State cannot discourage

          those who abide by law by obtaining permissions before making

          construction. The State Government is a party Respondent to this
