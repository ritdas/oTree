                   ----------------------------------------

                      Crl.M.C.No.16 of 2011

                   ---------------------------------------

               Dated this 21ST day of January, 2011

                                 ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Petitioner is aggrieved by the condition imposed by the

learned Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Thamarassery while

releasing vehicle involved vide order on C.M.P.No.4165 of 2010

in Crime No.510 of 2010 of Mukkom Police Station. Vehicle

belonging to the petitioner was seized allegedly for draining

sewage into the river and thereby committing offence punishable

under Secs.24 of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control) of Pollution

Act</a>, 1974. Learned Magistrate while ordering release of the

vehicle, among other conditions directed that petitioner, not to

repeat such offence using the said vehicle shall deposit `.50,000/-

in cash as security. Petitioner is aggrieved by that condition. It is

submitted by learned counsel that the said condition is harsh and

petitioner is not able to deposit the said amount. Learned counsel

states that other appropriate conditions are already imposed by

the learned Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.    I have heard learned Public Prosecutor also.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.    It is seen from the order under challenge that learned

Magistrate while ordering release of the vehicle has imposed

Crl.M.C.No.16 of 2011

appropriate conditions. There is also a direction that vehicle shall

not be used for (commission of) any offence during the period of

(its) interim custody. In view of this condition I am inclined to

think that it was not necessary to direct deposit of cash as

security. Hence the condition imposed by the learned Magistrate

vide the impugned order to deposit cash security is liable to be

set aside. But it is directed that violation of any of the other

condition would result in forfeiture of the bond and, petitioner

would be liable to produce vehicle before the court concerned.

</p><p id="p_4">       Resultantly this criminal miscellaneous case is allowed and

condition imposed by the learned Magistrate vide order dated

December 22, 2010 on C.M.P.No.4165 of 2010 in Crime No.510

of 2010 of Mukkom Police Station directing deposit of `.50,000/-

in cash as security is deleted making it clear that violation of any

of the other condition would result in forfeiture of the bond.
