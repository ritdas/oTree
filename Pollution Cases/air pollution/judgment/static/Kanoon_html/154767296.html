</pre><p id="p_2">In this way, they have made a sum of Rs. 60,19,535/-. As per

Clause 21.2 of the plot buyer's agreement, the Ops were to

develop such project by laying roads, water lines, sewer lines,

electrical lines etc. and as per Clause 11.1, Ops were liable to hand

over the physical possession of the plot within a period of 24

months with a grace period of 6 months i.e. latest by 8.1.2014. As

per Clause 11.2 of the agreement, if the Ops failed to offer the

possession of the plot by the end of the grace period then Ops

shall be liable to pay to the allottee a compensation to be

calculated @ Rs. 50/- per sq. yard for every month of delay. As per

Clause 11.3, if the Ops failed to give the possession beyond the

period of 12 months from the end of grace period i.e. upto 7.1.2015

then complainants are entitled to terminate the agreement and

sought the refund of the amount already paid and option for

termination may be extended by the allottee only upto dispatch of

the notice of possession and such a refund shall be made by the

Company within 90 days of the receipt of intimation to this effect
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Consumer Complaint No. 710 of 2017                                   5</span>



from the allottee. On 12.5.2015, Ops issued notice of possession to

the complainants. The complainants on 23.5.2015 visited the site

and shockingly came to know that the development was not

complete and Ops without completing the project issued the offer of

possession letter. The complainant wrote a letter dated 22.6.2015

to the Ops, however, no reply was sent to the said letter. In fact the

basic amenities like roads and sewerage were not completed /

developed at the site as promised by them and M/s Beam Facilities

Management Pvt. Ltd. was appointed temporarily to undertake the

maintenance and upkeep of the project and services, therefore,

notice of possession is mere camouflage and just a paper

possession. When the complainant inquired about the non-

completion / incomplete development of the project and how they

can issue the notice of possession without completion of the

project, therefore, the notice of possession issued by the Ops is

bad in law and complainants are entitled to refund under Clause

11.3 and Clause 20.1 of the buyers agreement but Ops lingered on

the matter on one pretext or the other by mis-representing to the

complainant that now the project is complete. Alleging deficiency in

services on the part of Ops, this complaint has been filed by the

complainants seeking following directions against the Ops:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      A) That the opposite parties No. 1 and 2 may kindly be

         ordered to refund to the complainants a sum of Rs.

         60,19,535/- received from the complainants from time to

         time towards the said plot alongwith interest @ 12% from

         the date of actual payment till the date of actual

         realization.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      B) To pay compensation to the tune of Rs. 3,00,000/- to

         complainants towards mental torture and harassment

         caused to the complainants because of the act and

         conduct of the Op's No. 1 and 2.

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      C) To pay a sum of Rs. 1 Lac towards Counsel Fee.

      D) To pay a sum of Rs. 75,000/- towards litigation

         charges/cost.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      E) That the complainants be granted such other relief / reliefs

         to which they are found entitled to under law and equity.

</blockquote><p id="p_3">2.          Upon notice, Ops appeared and filed their written reply

through their authorized signatory Mr. Rajiv Bhatia s/o Sh. J.L.

Bhatia by taking preliminary objections that are of jurisdictional

nature, therefore, these be decided before deciding the complaint

on merits; the complaint is not maintainable as according to plot

buyer's agreement dated 8.7.2011, the Ops have already issued a

letter of possession dated 12.5.2015 and complainants are under

obligation to get the possession, therefore, no relief can be granted

to the complainants; the complaint is not maintainable in view of

the existence of the Arbitration Clause No. 33 that in case of any

dispute between the parties, the matter is required to be referred to

the Arbitrator to be appointed by the Ops and once there is clear

ouster of the jurisdiction of the Commission then application under

Section 3 of the CP Act is not maintainable; the complainants are

not covered under the definition of the consumer as they have not

bought the goods or availed/hired the services of the Ops and

buyer's agreement was contingent contract and in case there is

any violation of contingent contract then the Civil Suit could be filed

by the complainants; the complainants had not booked the plot for

their personal use and booked it for investment/commercial

purpose; there is no deficiency in service on the part of Ops and

direction under the CP Act can be given only as per conditions

specified in the contract, therefore, no cause of action for the

complainants to file this complaint and that the claim of the

complainants is too exorbitant. On merits, it has been stated that

Op Nos. 2 &amp; 3 are not personally liable as they are not involved in

the project in their personal capacity. It was denied that the

complainants were in need of residential house exclusively for

themselves or for their family members and they joined together

only to earn the profit. Other facts with regard to booking of the flat

by Bhavneet Mavi and purchasing the rights of the plot by the

complainants from her is admitted. With regard to the various

payments as referred in the complaint, it has been stated that it is a

matter of record. However, the payments were not made in time.

These payments were made with delay after issuance of various

reminders. The allegations of the complainants are misleading and

they are mis-construed the terms of the agreement. In case

possession of the plot for any reason has not been delivered to the

complainants they have a right           to get compensation        as

incorporated in the agreement itself. Moreover, now the project is

totally complete. There is no deficiency in service on the part of

Ops. Complaint is without merit, it be dismissed.

evidence in support of their complaint. Complainant in his evidence

<p id="p_10">Recently, the larger Bench of the Hon'ble National Commission in

Consumer Case No. 701 of 2015 "Aftab Singh versus EMAAR

MGF Land Limited &amp; Anr." and in other similarly situated cases,

decided on 13.07.2017, after discussing various judgments of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court and the amendment made by the

Parliament in <a href="/doc/1788612/" id="a_12">Section 8(1)</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_13">Conciliation Act</a>,

1996 observed that the amendment does not affect in any manner

the powers of the Consumer Fora to entertain the complaints under

<a href="/doc/686376/" id="a_14">Section 3</a> of the Act. It was held that even if there is provision of

Arbitration Clause in the agreement, it does not debar the

Consumer Fora to take cognizance of the complaint despite

provision of Arbitration Clause in the agreement. The counsel for

the Ops was unable to rebut this legal preposition and the

judgment pronounced by the Hon'ble National Commission,

therefore, we do not agree with the plea raised by the counsel for

the Ops that the State Commission does not have the power to

entertain the complaint in view of the Arbitration Clause in the

agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_11">7.           It has been argued by the counsel for the Ops that the

complainants are not consumer as they have not bought the goods

developing the project on its own land. The agreement is in the

nature of an agreement to sell and does not create any right and

interest in the property in favour of the buyer. In this regard, it is

pertinent to refer the definition of the consumer as defined under

<p id="p_12">No doubt that the complainants have not purchased the goods but

their case is covered as they have availed the services from the

Ops and that too for consideration because under the agreement

Ex. C-2 dated 8.7.2011 executed between the Ops and Bhavneet

Mavi and lateron vide letter dated 30.8.2011, the rights were

assigned in favour of the complainants in Plot No. 106 in terms of

Clause 14 of the Buyer's Agreement and after that various

payments were received by the Ops and as per the statement of

account issued by the Ops, a sum of Rs. 60,19,535/- has been

received by the Ops and balance has been shown to be Rs.

2,88,178.66p. Under agreement Ex. C-2, Ops have agreed to

deliver the possession of Plot No. 106 after developing it within a

period of 24 months with grace period of 6 months. The definition

of the services has been defined under <a href="/doc/1561485/" id="a_15">Section 2(1)(o)</a> of the Act,

which reads as under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">It includes the housing construction services, therefore, in case the

Ops have agreed to develop a plot in his property for the

complainants for consideration, it comes under the definition of

housing construction duly covered under the definition of the

service and in case a service has been obtained for consideration

as defined under Clause 2(1)(d) of the Act then the complainants

come under the definition of the consumer. We do not agree with

the plea raised by the counsel for the Ops that it is just an

agreement to sell creating contractual liability. It is just not an

agreement to sell because in that event, the plot would have been

sold as it is but it is mega project under which all the development

works are to be carried out by the Ops enabling its allottees to raise

the construction. Therefore, it is more than agreement to sell and it

is duly covered under the definition of services as referred above.

</blockquote><p id="p_13">8.          It has been further contended by the counsel for the

Ops that the plot was booked for speculative purposes and that the

complainants are not the consumer, therefore, they are not covered

under the definition of consumer according to definition attached to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13"> Consumer Complaint No. 710 of 2017                                  15</span>



<a href="/doc/318471/" id="a_16">Section 2(1)(d)</a> of the Act. In case we go through the contents of

the complaint, the complainants had booked/purchased only one

plot and in para No. 8 of the complaint, it has been stated that the

complainants had gone to the site but they were surprised to see

that it is not feasible to construct a house or reside in their colony

as a lot of development work was to be done there, which makes it

clear that the intention of the complainants is to raise the

construction and to reside there. The Ops have not been able to

place on the record that the complainants are trading in the real

estate. They have not referred that they have any other property in

the vicinity of Mohali or that they were earlier used to sell or

purchase the plots/flats. In case the Ops have not been able to

prove these things on the record then it cannot be said that the

complainants had purchased the property for speculative purposes.

We are fortified by the judgment of 2017(3) CLT 459 (NC) "Pranab

Basak versus Suhas Chatterjee". In that case, two flats were

booked by the complainant and a plea was taken that the

complainant had booked these flats for investment purposes. It was

observed by the Hon'ble National Commission that unless it is

established that the complainant is dealing in sale and purchase or

his real intention in booking the flat was to sell the same on profit,

on appreciation of the value of the real estate. Therefore, we do not

agree with the plea raised by the counsel for the Ops that the

complainant is not a consumer as she had booked the plot for

commercial purposes.

</p><p id="p_15">9.          It has been further alleged that the allegations in the

complaint are contractual in nature and as such only triable in a

Civil Court. No doubt that there is a contract between the parties

and under that contract the Ops have agreed to develop the colony

in which Plot No. 106 has been allotted and the possession has

been agreed to be given after development work at the site. We

have dealt in detail this point in para No. 10 that complainants are a

consumer as defined under the CP Act and under <a href="/doc/686376/" id="a_17">Section 3</a> of the

Act, the Consumer Foras have a right to entertain the complaint,

therefore, in consumer disputes this Commission has a right to

entertain the consumer complaint and the plea raised by the

counsel for the Ops that it is triable only before the Civil Court is not

a correct preposition.
</p>
<p id="p_16">10.         An objection has been taken by the Ops that Op Nos. 2

&amp; 3 are not involved personally, therefore, wrongly impleaded as a

party to the compliant. No doubt they may not be involved

personally but as an Director/Chairman, they are responsible for

completion of the project. Therefore, they have been rightly made a

party to the complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_17">11.         Now we will take the complaint on merits to see

whether there is deficiency in service, amount of compensation in

reference to Section 14(1)(d) of the CP Act, extent of the claim and

concealment of material fact, if any, is there on the part of the

complainants. As per averments in the complaint, plot No. 106

measuring 250.59 sq. yards situated at IREO Hamlet, Sector 98,

SAS Nagar, Mohali was allotted by the Ops in favour of Mrs.

of Rs. 18,40,277/-. The complainants were in need of the

residential house and they purchased the said plot from the said

allottee and accordingly, provisional allotment letter, receipts of the

plot and plot buyer's agreement was endorsed by the Ops in favour

of the complainants. In this regard a letter dated 30.8.2011 Ex. C-3

was issued by the Ops in favour of the complainants vide which

complainants were informed that the onwards rights/obligations

with respect of plot No. 106 are hereby assigned to him as

nominee of Bhavneet Mavi and the documents i.e. allotment letter,

buyer's agreement and receipts were endorsed in favour of the

complainants. According to the letter dated 26.9.2011 Ex. C-4

instead of time linked plan, it was changed to development linked

<p id="p_20">The Ops wrote a letter dated 29.6.2015 to Mr. Upjeet Singh Sahota

in which it was referred that they are in process of completing the

blacktopping    work,    which       shows   that   till   29.6.2015,   the

development work was not complete, therefore, they could not

issue the letter dated 12.5.2015 that the work is complete and

direction was given to the complainants to take the possession of

the plot. No doubt that some sale deeds have been executed by

the Ops in favour of some of the allottees but this does not prove

that the development work at the site is complete. There is report of

the Local Commissioner dated 24.10.2015 Ex. OP-10 wherein it

was mentioned that there does not exist any boundary wall except

the adjoining of the entrance gate. Counsel for the Ops has also

referred to the notification dated 14.8.2016 Ex. Op-16 vide which

the exemption under <a href="/doc/1211237/" id="a_18">Section 44</a> has been issued to the Ops but

the development work was ordered to be carried out in accordance

of Punjab, Department of Housing and Urban Development

(Housing II Branch) under which it has been stated that Mega

Housing Project has been approved under PAPRA, 1995, however,

the present frame work does not provide the clear procedure to

issue completion or partial completion to such projects, which

causes hardships to promoters and residents of such projects for

the maintenance and upkeep of public utilities and services. To

stream line the issue of completion/ partial completion certificate of

PAPRA project, falling outside Municipal Limits, its procedure and

time frame has been worked out. Therefore, the completion/partial

completion certificate is required to be obtained by the Ops under

the scheme issued by the Government of Punjab vide its letter

dated 2.9.2014 and under that letter, all the Companies were asked

to get the completion certificate and that is why the completion

certificate has been obtained by the Ops, however, the partial

completion certificate was obtained in favour of the Ops by GMADA

on 30.6.2017 Ex. Op-4. Without getting the partial completion

certificate, Ops were not competent to issue any notice/offer of

possession letter, therefore, the certificate was just a formality to

save from the penal clauses. As per the agreement, the relevant

clauses for the possession and holding charges are under Clause

<p id="p_21">According to these clauses, the possession was to be delivered

within a period of 24 months with a grace period of 6 months from

the date of agreement whereas the date of agreement is 8.7.2011

and after adding the grace period, it will come to an end on

1.1.2014. According to Clause 11.3, in case the possession is

delayed by the Company beyond the period of 12 months from the

end of the grace period then the allottee shall become entitled to

opt for termination of the allotment/agreement and refund of the

actual paid up installments after adjusting the interest / penalty on

delayed payments. In that way, the possession was to be given at

the most by January, 2015 but as per the letter issued by the Ops

when the development work was not complete, than issued

possession letter in May, 2015, therefore, even on that day, the

complainants had become entitled to invoke Clause No. 11.3 of the

agreement. When the complainants visited the site after receiving

the offer of possession letter, he pointed out the discrepancies at

the site referred above in his letter dated 22.6.2015 Ex. C-8. Even

the Ops in their letter dated 29.6.2015 Ex. C-9 had referred that the

development work is still going on. Even approvals from the

GMADA were also asked for.

<p id="p_22">13.         What is the value of the notice of possession letter? As

per averments in the complaint, it has been stated that number of

development works have not been completed specifically with

regard to the electricity, sewerage treatment plant, proper access
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22"> Consumer Complaint No. 710 of 2017                                   24</span>



road etc. and no completion certificate has been obtained by the

complainants from the Competent Authority. With regard to

completion certificate, the counsel for the Ops has referred that

they have initiated to make the project under the Punjab State

Industrial Policy, 2003 in furtherance of that LOI dated 30.9.2005

was issued. Vide its notification dated 14.8.2008 State had

exempted the project of Ops from the provisions of the PAPRA

except <a href="/doc/826945/" id="a_19">Section 32</a> of the Act, which deals with Constitution of

Punjab Urban Development Fund. However, there is letter No.

4966-CTP(Pb)/SP-458 dated 2.9.2014(Ex.Op-30) issued by Govt.

of Punjab, Department of Housing and Urban Development

(Housing II Branch) under which it has been stated that Mega

Housing Project has been approved under PAPRA, 1995, however,

the present frame work does not provide the clear procedure to

issue completion or partial completion to such projects, which

causes hardships to promoters and residents of such projects for

the maintenance and upkeep of public utilities and services. To

stream line the issue of completion / partial completion certificate of

PAPRA project, falling outside Municipal Limits, its procedure and

time frame has been worked out. Therefore, the completion/partial

completion certificate is required to be obtained by the Ops under

the scheme issued by the Government of Punjab vide its letter

dated 2.9.2014 and under that letter, the Ops have applied for the

partial completion certificate and the same was issued to them by

GMADA in their memo/ letter No. GMADA/STP/2017/2026 dated

30.6.2017 Ex. Op-4. The Hon'ble National Commission in the

judgment 2017(1) CPR 292 "Harinder Singh versus Unitech",

was held that in the absence of completion certificate, complainant

cannot be compelled to take possession of the plot. In another

judgment reported in 2017(1) CPR 168 (NC) "Sanjay Kumar

versus Sahara Prime City Limited &amp; others" it was held that

allottee is entitled to withdraw from the scheme in the event of

delay in completion of the project. These judgments have not been

rebutted by the counsel for the Ops. Therefore, even if there is a

notice of possession letter issued by Ops that too before

completion as referred in Clause 11.3 of the agreement, there is a

completion certificate, which was issued in the year 2017 much

after issuance of possession letter. Therefore, without completion

certificate, the complainant cannot be compelled to take the

possession.
</p>
<p id="p_23">14.         Whether the possession letter is in real sense or only to

avoid the penalty because the development work at the site is not

complete and that is the reason that competent authority

demanded various documents from the Ops vide its letter No. 3800

dated 7.10.2016 but those documents have not been submitted by

the Ops, perhaps the work at the site is not complete, therefore,

completion certificate has not been granted. In fact the Ops want to

deliver the half baked things to the complainants without

completion of the development work at the site and in the absence

of fulfillment of conditions, it will be very difficult for the complainant

to make the construction and reside there.

after that no fresh application for obtaining environment clearance

vide letter dated 29.6.2015 Ex. Op-22 certain conditions were laid

down by PPCB to give the final certificate but no final certificate

has been issued by PPCB. Perhaps the conditions contained in the

issue the bank guarantee, which was not given and it was

deposited only on 22.3.2016, therefore, on the date of issuance of

the notice/offer of possession letter dated 12.5.2015, even LD

system by the PSPCL was not approved.
</p>
<p id="p_26">16.         With regard to the amenities at the site, Ops

themselves have referred to the report of one Local Commissioner

appointed by the U.T. State Commission in CC No. 170 of 2015

"Abha Arora Vs. Puma Realtors Private Limited and another" and

its report dated 24.10.2015 is on the record as Ex. Op-10. It is

referred in the report that main gate of the project is situated in

front of Sector 97 and in front of the main gate, there is no metalled

road. The sewerage pipe lines have been laid and connected to

Sewerage Treatment Plant but have not been connected with the

main service lines of the GMADA. Storm water pipelines inside the

project have been laid and connected with rain water harvesting

wells but have not been connected with the main service lines of

GMADA. There is no boundary wall to the project, therefore, even

on the basis of report of the Local Commission, the amenities at

the site are not complete. Even if the letter of possession was not

referred in the complaint, it does not have any bearing upon the

case of the complainant because it was not accompanied with

completion certificate and as discussed above, the amenities at the

site are not complete. Therefore, in case we take the totality of the

circumstances, the amenities were not complete on the date of

issuance of notice/offer of possession letter dated 12.5.2015. As

per Clause No. 11.3 of the agreement, in case the project was not

completed by January, 2015 as agreed in the plot buyer's

agreement then the complainants have the authority to withdraw

from the scheme.
</p>
<p id="p_27">17.         It has been argued by the counsel for the Ops that

according to Clause 11.2 of the agreement, in case there is some

delay then the compensation can be calculated @ Rs. 50/- per sq.

yards but it has been stated by the counsel for the complainants

that the agreement is one sided because in case of delayed

payment the complainants are required to pay interest @ 15% p.a.

from the date of due till the date of payment. However, it was

further observed by the Hon'ble National Commission in the

judgment 2017(3) CLT 520 (NC) "Ankur Goswami versus

Supertech and another" that this clause in the allotment letter

would be applied to the case where allottee is seeking possession

of the flat and where allottee is not seeking refund of the amount.

However, in the present case, the allottee is seeking the refund,

therefore, the penalty @ Rs. 50/- per sq. yards will not be

applicable. Further under Rule 17 i.e. Rate of Interest on refund of

advance money upon cancellation of agreement under Punjab

Apartment and Property Regulation Rules, 1995, it has been

provided as under:-

<p id="p_28">

      rate of twelve per cent per annum payable from the date of

      receipt of amount so collected till the date of re-payment."


</blockquote><p id="p_29">In the above rule it has been observed to refund the amount

alongwith interest @ 12% p.a. Therefore, to be just and

reasonable, the complainants will be entitled to interest @ 12% on

the deposited amount.
</p>
<p id="p_30">18.         With regard to applicability of Section 14 of the CP Act,

it is a services agreed by the Ops to be provided to the

complainants under the agreement and the Ops have defaulted to

provide the services as agreed in the agreement and in view of the

detailed discussion referred above, the complainants have a right

to withdraw from the scheme and to seek for the refund and further

under Clause 14(d) the Fora has a right to award such amount as

compensation to the complainants for any loss or the injury

suffered by the complainants due to the negligence of the Ops for

which provision is there under the PAPRA under which Housing

Project of Ops was sanctioned under which there is a provision that

in case of refund, the amount be refunded alongwith interest @

12% p.a. and further some compensation can also be allowed with

regard to mental and physical harassment to the complainants for

awaiting a long period and to visit the site to check the

development at the site.

Ops? In the complaint, the complainants have referred a sum of

Rs. 60,19,535/- whereas in their statement of account of Ops

referred in the record by the complainants as Ex. C-6 proves the

deposit of this amount, therefore, there is no dispute with regard to

the deposit of the above mentioned amount.

deficiency in service on the part of Ops, accordingly, we allow the

complaint and direct Ops as under:-
