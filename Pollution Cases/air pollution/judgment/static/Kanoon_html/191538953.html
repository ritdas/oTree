                P.R. RAMACHANDRA MENON, J.
              ========================
                   W.P.(C). No. 18471 of 2013
              --------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 19th day of November, 2013

                            JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner has approached this Court contending that

the 3rd respondent is running a piggery without obtaining

statutory licence/clearance from the 1st respondent. Accordingly,

direction is sought to be given to the first respondent, to take

further action pursuant to Ext.P2, invoking <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">Sections 31A</a> and <a href="/doc/96367367/" id="a_2">33</a>

of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. When

the matter came up before this Court on 25.07.2013, the writ

petition was admitted and thereafter, an interim order was

granted as prayed for on 28.10.2013, virtually to the effect that,

the 3rd respondent was prevented from operating the 'piggery'

any further, without obtaining a valid licence.

</p><p id="p_2">      2. Pursuant to the notice served to the 3rd respondent, he

entered appearance and pointed out that, in the earlier round of

litigation, the matter was considered by this Court in W.P.(C).

No.29346 of 2012 filed by the 3rd respondent for directing the 1st

respondent therein to permit the petitioner to have licence for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.C. No.18471 of 2013         -2-</span>

conducting the pig farm.    When the matter was considered by

this Court, it was brought to the notice of this Court that, the

petitioner had already preferred Ext.P2 application therein for

getting necessary licence. Challenging the closure notice issued,

an appeal was stated as preferred under Section 276 of the

Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994, which was considered and

disposed of, rejecting the application for licence, as per order

dated 31.7.2013. Taking note of the submission made by the 3rd

respondent (who was the petitioner therein) that the order was

served to him only on 3.8.2013 and as to the turn of events, this

Court observed that, the relief sought for by the petitioner in the

writ petition could not be granted and accordingly, the writ

petition was dismissed, relegating the petitioner therein to pursue

the revisional remedy before the Tribunal for Local Self

Government Institutions, Thiruvananthapuram, simultaneously

directing implementation of the concerned order to be kept in

abeyance till the statutory period for filing Revision Petition was

over.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. Mr. Rajan Joseph, the learned Senior Counsel for the 3rd

respondent submits that I.A No. 1612/2013 in R.P. No. No.

128/2013 filed before the Tribunal was considered and Ext.R3(b)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.C. No.18471 of 2013         -3-</span>

order was passed on 3.9.2013, staying the steps for closing down

the piggery. The learned counsel for the petitioner points out that

the factual position, as conceded from the part of the 3rd

respondent, reveals that the 3rd respondent does not have the

requisite licence issued by the competent authority to run the

piggery as on date. It is also pointed out that, nobody is entitled

to run any unit without licence and that when the matter was

pending consideration as to whether the licence was to be given

or not, it was never open for the Tribunal to have passed Ext.R3

</p><p id="p_4">(b) interim order. In any view of the matter, a specific order was

passed by this Court subsequently on 28.10.2013 to the effect

that, the 3rd respondent shall not conduct any piggery without

obtaining proper licence.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     4. The learned Standing Counsel for the Pollution Control

Board submits that the version of the petitioner as to the

pollution being caused by the 3rd respondent was found as correct

and it was in the said circumstance that, Exts. R1(6) and R1(7)

proceedings were issued to cause the piggery to be closed down.

</p><p id="p_6">     5. After hearing both the sides, this Court is of the firm

view that, the 3rd respondent is not entitled to run the piggery

without obtaining a proper and valid licence from the competent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.C. No.18471 of 2013          -4-</span>

authority. In the said circumstance, the interim order is made

absolute and the concerned respondents are directed to take

necessary steps to cause the same to be closed down as ordered

by the Pollution Control Board as per Exts. R1(6) and R1(7). It is

also made clear that, this will not bar the way of the 3rd

respondent in pursuing the matter before the Tribunal where the

Revision Petition bearing No. 128/2013 is pending and to have

the same considered in accordance with the relevant provisions of

law. Ultimately if the 3rd respondent obtains necessary licence, it

will be open for the 3rd respondent to run the piggery thereafter,

subject to satisfaction of the conditions to be imposed, both by

the local authority and also by the Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_7">      6.  Considering the persuasive submission made by the

learned counsel for the 3rd respondent, the 3rd respondent is

granted 'three weeks' time to make appropriate arrangements to

close down the piggery, failing which it will be for the concerned

respondent to implement the closure as ordered hereinbefore.

</p><p id="p_8">      The writ petition is allowed.
