  Order No. 09       ------             Dated 10th July, 2012

       The State Pollution Control Board has submitted its

  supplementary counter affidavit stating therein that there

  are altogether 105 Bee-Hive Hard Coke plants in

  Dhanbad, out of which 92 plants have installed Air

  Pollution Control Devices and 88 units have been issued

  Consent to Operate order by     State    Pollution   Control

  Board after verification of Air Pollution Control Devices

  and as per     report   submitted   by   Regional    Officer,

  Dhanbad. Four units are fully closed since long time and

  remaining nine units have not installed any Air Pollution

  Control Devices. Three, out of this nine units have been

  issued issued directions under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33A</a> and <a href="/doc/1868067/" id="a_2">31</a> A of

  Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and

  Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981

  respectively for closure by Jharkhand State Pollution

  Control Board. It is submitted that in pursuance of

  directions, notices have been given to the units named in

  paragraph 7 of the supplementary affidavit.

</p><p id="p_26">               Learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently

  submitted that thought it is submitted that out of 105
             units 92 units have installed Air Pollution Control

            Devices. But according to him in fact even after such

            submission of Pollution Control Board, the emission level

            which was to the limit of 150 mg/Nm3 which has been

            reduced    to   100   mg/Nm3   is   not   being   maintained.

            Therefore, direction may be given to the Pollution Control

            Board for surprise inspection and to submit a report with

            respect to emissions by these units, including for 92

            units, for which, it is stated that they have already

            installed Air Pollution Control Devices and also for 88

            units, for which, it has been stated that permission was

            granted after verification by the Air Pollution Control

            Board and as per report submitted by Regional Officer,

            Dhanbad.
</p>
<p id="p_27">                       The prayer made by learned counsel for the

            petitioner is just and proper, therefore, the Pollution

            Control Board is directed to submit a report after

            surprise inspection of units with respect to the emission

            made by these units and to show specifically the level of

            emission; whether it is below 100 mg/Nm3 or below 150

            mg/Nm3 or above 150 mg/Nm3 . The report will be

            submitted by or before 29th August, 2012.

       Heard learned counsel for the parties.

       We do not find any merit in this review petition

  particularly in view of the fact that even in the order

  passed by the learned Single Judge dated 13.01.2011____

  has been taken note of wherein learned counsel for the

  respondents submitted that petitioner was required to

  deposit the entire amount of 60 MT of T.N. Shellac by 30th

  June, 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_39">       Be that as it may be, the L.P.A against the order

  wherein specifically relief has been ___________ the L.P.A

  has been dismissed by this Court.

</p><p id="p_40">       Not only on the ground that appellant was required

  to deposit the entire amount but the Division Bench also

  observed that the appellant is advised to approach the

  Civil Court since the remedy lies before the Civil Court.

</p><p id="p_41">       Therefore, we do not any merit in this petition,

  which is accordingly, dismissed.
