<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2</span>
            Delivered by the Hon'ble Shri Justice M.Chockalingam, JM

</p><p id="p_7">1.    In pursuance of an order made by the Principal Bench, National Green

Tribunal (NGT), New Delhi, this application was taken on file as Application

No. 11/2013 (CZ) by this Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_8">2.    The applicants, claiming as persons interested in the protection of

environment and ecology and also the persons personally being affected have

filed this application under the provisions of the NGT Act, 2010 whereby they

have challenged the validity of the environment approval made in

communication     No.    12/6/81/-ENV-5/IA      dated   21.04.1986     and   the

communication J-12011/23/2002-IA-I dated 30.11.2005alongwith a direction

that they are invalid and also a declaration that the commencement of the

Pench diversion project without prior environmental clearance under the EIA

notification, 2006, was totally illegal and also for a direction to the MoEF that

no construction or other activity related to the said project should be done

without prior environmental clearance, to restore the ecology and for awarding

proper damage compensation to all the affected persons.

</p><p id="p_9">3.    The case of the applicants, as could be seen from the averments made by

the application can be stated thus.         The proposed project envisaged

construction of earthen dam on river Pench, a tributary of river Kanha in

Godavari basin in village Machagora in Chourai Tehsil of Chhindwara District,

Madhya Pradesh. It was intended to provide irrigation in net CCA 70,918

hectares with annual irrigation of 96,519 hectares which would increase the

level of ground water and hence, it is a major irrigation project listed in

Schedule of both EIA notification 1994 and 2006.          Thus, requiring prior

environmental clearance from the Central Government. In April 1986 i.e. prior

to the enactment of Environmental Protection Act, the then project proposed by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       3</span>
 the Central Water Commission was accorded environmental approval by the

Environment Appraisal Committee, Department of Environment &amp; Forest and

Wild Life Impact Division, Government of India. But the construction of the

project was not commenced. The estimated cost of project was 184 crores in

1987 increased to 543.20 crores in 2003. Since the construction work was

started only in November 2012, the cost of the project had gone up further.

From the year 1988 to 2005, approximately 12.56 crores were spent on

development of approach road, residential quarters, office, rest house building

and hutment at site survey work of dam, drilling of dam site and establishment

and miscellaneous work.      About 5607.28 hectare private land and 895.40

hectare government land would go into submergence by which 31 villages

would be affected. An area of 10.58 hectares land was acquired for approach

road to dam site and payment thereof was made on 31.03.1988. An area of

16.98 hectares was acquired for RBC upto 3 Kms in March and May, 1993.

The land acquisition for dam site RBC and HBC and rehabilitation sites are yet

to be completed since they were undertaken only in the year 2005.            No

environment management plan was prepared. The project was monitored last

in the month of August 1997 and no progress was made since at the time the

site inspection was done by the Additional Director, Regional Office, MoEF on

26th-27th.08.1997. In the meanwhile, EIA notification 2006 came into effect

where 29 projects were asked to take environmental clearance which also

included the project in question. By a clarification that the environmental

clearance for the project which was cleared by the MoEF before EIA

notification 1994 and where no construction/other operations were commenced

till 01.08.1998 will be invalid. In all such cases, fresh environmental clearance

was to be obtained if those projects came into 29 categories listed within the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        4</span>
 EIA notification 1994. It is pertinent to point out that the environmental

clearance granted to the proposed project was revoked by a communication

dated 22.10.2001 by a communication addressed by the Regional Office,

MoEF to the Central Water Commission. In the meanwhile, the project was

transferred to Water Resource Department, Madhya Pradesh. Surprisingly, on

a letter written by the Chief Engineer, Wiaganga Basin Water Resource

Development MP the MoEF directed the Regional Office, MoEF, Bhopal to

conduct a site inspection which was carried on by the Additional Director,

Bhopal in the presence of the five officers of the project proponent. The site

inspection report revealed that the salient features of the project had changed

and estimated cost had also increased and the plant needed revision and also

the plants for catchment area, treatment and command area development which

were vital for the project were still to be prepared.       No environmental

management plan prepared and there was no major progress at the dam site and

thus, in short, the environmental conditions were not complied. Apart from

that there were other illegalities and violations. From the said report, it was

quite evident that the environmental clearance granted in 1986 was revoked,

even otherwise, the project required fresh clearance in view of the

communication dated 23.07.1998 issued by MoEF. But for the reasons best

known to MoEF, vide a letter dated 30.11.2005 it was informed to the Chief

Engineer, Wiaganga Basin Water Resource Development, MP that in view of

the inspection report, a project do not require fresh environmental clearance.

Pursuant to the same, in April 2006, the Water Resource Division of the Water

Commission accorded investment clearance for the project at the cost of Rs.

583.50 crores and the project was included in the accelerated irrigation

programme in the year 2007-08. Various notices were issued for the supply of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       5</span>
 materials for construction by the project proponent and other related activities

had been undertaken only in November, 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">4.    It is also the pleaded case of the applicants that the approval granted in

1986 was granted by <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986 which came into force

when there was no procedure or parameter as existed under the present scheme

for grant of environmental clearance. With the issuance of the EIA notification

1994, the procedure for grant of environmental clearance was already done by

the MoEF and the same was replaced by EIA notification 2006. A perusal of

both the notifications would clearly indicate that the major irrigation projects

such as the project in question required environmental clearance from the

Central Government / MoEF under both the notifications.              On 4th-5th

November, 2012, the second applicant joined the agitation for forceful and

legal rehabilitation for the purpose of taking over their lands for the proposed

project. At that time, a letter was handed over by the Collector, Chhindwara

informing her that the construction work of the proposed project started on

04.11.2012 and all the requisite permission was obtained from the Water

Resource Department, MP. True copies of certain documents related to the

proposed projects were handed over to her wherefrom she came to know all

the above facts about the proposed project, the environmental approval granted

by the Environment Appraisal Committee in the year 1986, subsequent

revocation in the year 2001 and also the further communication that fresh

approval was not necessary.     It is also specifically pleaded that since the

environmental approval in the present project was granted in the year 1986, it

cannot be said to be valid for more than the prescribed period either under the

EIA notification 1994 or under the EIA notification 2006. It is pertinent to

point out that the original environmental approval granted was also revoked.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                       6</span>
 Thereafter, no question of any inspection of the said project would arise.

Equally the opinion given by the Additional Director, MoEF dated 30.11.2005

was also bereft of any support from law and was bad for more reasons. At no

stretch of imagination and no reasons, the MoEF can come forward that no new

environmental approval is necessary for proposed project and thus, the

construction and related activities started by the project proponent from

04.11.2012 were thoroughly illegal. The proposed project has not been granted

approval under the Water or the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Air Pollution Control Act</a>.       The proposed

project is closely situated to Pench National Park which is situated in Seoni

District of Madhya Pradesh. The Pench National Park has been included in the

umbrella of Project Tiger and the 19th Project Tiger Reserve in the year 1992.

The original environmental approval was granted in the year 1986 and the

question whether such a project in the vicinity of Tiger Project could be given

do not arise but the proposed project required the environmental clearance

under the EIA Notification 2006 and thus, it would be quite clear that the

project undertaken by the project proponent is in violation under the

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986 and also other acts enumerated under

Schedule-I of the NGT Act, 2010. Apart from that, the environmental approval

granted on 21.04.1986 do not contemplate and cater to all conditions and

parameters under which the river Pench project need to be evaluated in view of

the sustainable development and hence, in view of the changed circumstances

also, the project required environmental clearance under EIA notification 2006.

The project proponent has illegally commenced the construction on 04.11.2012

without valid prior environmental clearance thus, is continuously violating the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986 and other Acts enumerated

under the Schedule-I of the NGT Act, 2010. Since, the construction and other



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       7</span>
 related activities are going on and thus, the cause of action is continuing cause

of action and is applicant is well within limitation. Since, in view of the

averments above, the applicants have sought for reliefs as shown above.


</p><p id="p_12">5.    On service of notice, the respondents appeared through their Counsels

and filed their replies putting forth their defence to the main application.


</p><p id="p_13">6.    The respondent no. 3 and 4 made application No. 447/2013 seeking

dismissal of the main application on the ground of delay alleging that the

application has not been preferred within the period prescribed by the

provisions of NGT Act. The respondent therein, who are the applicants in the

main petition filed their reply.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">7.    Hence, the preliminary objection raised by the respondents on the

question of limitation was first taken up for consideration.


</p><p id="p_16">8.    Advancing arguments on behalf of the respondent no.3 and 4, the

Learned Counsel would submit that the main application filed under Section 14

and 15 of the NGT Act was hopelessly barred by limitation. The Department

of Environment, Forest and Wild Life, Government of India granted

environmental approval to the Pench Diversion Project on 21.04.1986 subject

to certain safeguards to be implemented during the execution of the project.

The MoEF in order to ascertain as to whether the project related work was

commenced prior to 1994, made an inspection by the dam site. The report

dated 30.09.2005 pursuant to the inspection made it clear that the project

related activities such as preconstruction infrastructure work pertaining to

development of approach road, residential quarter, office, rest house building at

the site, drilling dam site were already initiated in the year 1987-88 and six

bridges alongwith approach roads were constructed upto 1992-93. On the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                         8</span>
 strength of the inspection report, MoEF conveyed to the Water Resources

Department, Govt. of MP vide letter dated 30.11.2005 that the project do not

require fresh environmental clearance and the conditions stipulated in the

environmental clearance dated 21.04.1986 should be strictly complied with.

While, the matter stood thus, the applicants have brought forth this application

inter alia initially seeking a direction that the communication of the

environmental clearance dated 21.04.1986 and a subsequent communication

dated 30.11.2005 whereby it was ordered that the project did not require fresh

environmental clearance and the stipulated condition in the environmental

clearance dated 21.04.1986 should be strictly complied with, were invalid. The

other reliefs are in the nature of consequential reliefs which may or may not

flow, if the declaration asked for above was not granted. Thus, for all legal and

practical purposes, the need for declaration on the environmental approval of

the year 1986 and subsequent communication of the reiteration in 2005 are the

main reliefs and subject matter of adjudication. The grounds as set out by the

applicant would clearly indicate that they have tried to impugn the subsequent

communication dated 30.11.2005 on the ground that the environmental

approval of 1986 had lapses and the project required fresh clearance. This

issue, in so far as the records stand today and as far as the respondents are

concerned seeking a common ground is concluded by the stand that no fresh

clearance is required and subsequently, the activity of execution and

development of project is not illegal. In order to adjudicate upon the first and

foremost area of adjudication would centre around the validity of the

environmental approval of 1986 and it is reiteration in 2005. Thus, for the

purpose of the substantial relief, the existence of these two letters would

substituted the cause of action in as much as the question would be as to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                       9</span>
 whether the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to adjudicate upon the validity of the

above two documents, by virtue of the statute of limitation was barred or not.


</p><p id="p_17">9.    Pointing to Section 14(3) and 15(3) of the NGT Act, 2010, the Learned

Counsel would submit that an analysis of the statute providing the period of

limitation, it would be quite clear that the application filed by the applicant was

barred by time. The close reading of the above provisions would make it

abundantly clear that there is a bar, if it is not within limitation and the special

period of limitation for application falling under <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_5">Section 14(1)</a> is a period of six

months which is further extendable for a period not exceeding 60 days and also

the starting point for the period of limitation is on the date of which such cause

of action first arose. It is well known that the expression 'cause of action'

means all such bundles of facts which a suitor is required to prove in court of

law in order to succeed in getting a particular relief. In that view of the matter,

so long as the applicants do not prove that environmental approval dated

21.04.1986 and the subsequent communication dated 30.11.2005 are not valid,

they cannot maintain the application. Therefore, the cause of action is strictly

relatable to the existence of these two letters. The use of the words 'first arose'

in the said provisions are of immense significance. These words, not only are

the indicators of the unambiguous legislative intent and scheme expressed in

plain words, but statutorily fix the starting point of the period of limitation.

These words, no doubt, relate to the earliest point of time of inception of the

cause of action. The plain and unambiguous words of statute scheme and

intention should be given effect to. This is further re-enforced by the use of the

words "from the date" which again would imply that there is a definite

occurrence of the cause of action. It is pertinent to point that similar language

is used for the <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_6">Section 15(3)</a> of the Act also. The contention put forth by the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                        10</span>
 applicant side that there is a continuing cause of action is thoroughly misplaced

and untenable in law. The applicants are well aware that the application in the

present form is not within the period of limitation. In respect of the aspect of

limitation, the applicants have tried to explain the same by averring that the

project proponent had illegally commenced the construction on 04.11.2012

without valid prior environmental clearance and thus, was continuously

violating the provisions of the Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986 and other

Acts enumerated under Schedule-I of the NGT Act and since, the construction

and other related activities were going on, the cause of action was continuing

and the application is well within limitation. For the purpose of reckoning the

limitation of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_7">Section 1493</a>) and 15(3) of the Act, the averments made by the

applicant as above were wholly irrelevant and of no consequence since the

concept of continuing cause of action is foreign to the expressed provisions of

the statute of limitation engrafted under <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_8">Section 14(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_9">15(3)</a> of the Act.

The NGT Act is a special enactment and hence, there is statutory prescription

of the special period of limitation under <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_10">Section 14(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_11">15(3)</a> of the Act

which will certainly exclude the general law of limitation. The assumption that

the project proponent has illegally commenced the construction on 04.11.2012

was factually incorrect and misleading. The plain and simple language of

<a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_12">Section 14(3)</a> i.e. unless it is made within the period of six months from the

date on which the cause of action / dispute first arose negates the principles of

continuing cause of action. If the plea of continuing cause of action is accepted

within the limitation, the statute would be eschewed of the important and vital

words namely "first arose". On the facts of the present case, <a href="/doc/371879/" id="a_13">Section 22</a> of the

Limitation Act will have no effect. Though, the same being a part of the

general law of limitation since it would stand excluded by the special provision



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                       11</span>
 of limitation. In the special law, under <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_14">Section 14(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_15">15(3)</a> of the Act. The

NGT Act is a special law enacted for the effective and expeditious disposal of

cases related of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_16">Environment (Protection) Act</a> and conservation of forest and

other natural resource. Hence, the law provides the period of limitation which

would be have overriding effect over the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_17">Limitation Act</a> which is general law.

If the plea of the applicants of principles of continuing cause of action for the

purpose of brining a dispute under <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_18">Section 14(1)</a> within the limitation or reliefs

under <a href="/doc/51829346/" id="a_19">Section 15(1)</a> within the limitations of 15(3) is to be accepted, then it

would lead to the serious, anomalous and undesirable consequences. Apart

from that it would be contrary to the express prescription of the statutory

limitation under the NGT Act. If the theory of continuing cause of action is to

be accepted, any action or application or proceeding may be instituted at any

point of time on an occurrence of a small fact which may be construed as part

of cause of action.    This would mean even if the project which nearing

completion with investment of huge public expenses can be called into

question. But this is not the intent of the NGT Act. Thus, it can be well stated

that the limitation stand concluded by any circumstance at the earliest in point

of time would have to be considered as relevant dated for computation of

limitation. The averment made in the application that the construction has

commenced on 04.11.2012 was contrary to the pleadings made by the

application and the documents relied on by them.           The applicants have

specifically averred about environmental approval for the project in April 1986

and that the construction of the project was estimated at the cost of 184.04

crores in 1987 which increased to 543.20 crores in 2003, etc., the

environmental clearance granted to the project was revoked by a

communication dated 22.10.2001 by the Regional Office, MoEF, Bhopal to the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                       12</span>
 Central Water Commission. From the averments of those facts pleaded by the

applicants, it is highly apparent that the construction commenced in 1988 and

the inspection report made by the committee clearly shows that the

commencement of the project in the 1987-1988 what was started in on

04.11.2012 was only spillway work. It is also clearly averred in the reply

affidavit and thus, this date 04.11.2012 cannot said to be date of

commencement of work and thus viewed from any angle, the delay was

enormous and application is liable to be rejected. The applicants, for the

reasons well known to them, preferred not to challenge the environmental

clearance dated 21.04.1986 though their lands were being acquired in the year

1992 for the construction neither of the project nor even after 30.11.2005 when

the environmental clearance granted in the year 1986 was reaffirmed by the

Government of India. Under the circumstances they should not be allowed to

challenge the environmental clearance granted at this belated stage and thus,

the application made by the applicants is barred by limitation. In support of his

contention, the Learned Counsel relied on the following decisions:

</p>
<p id="p_26">10.   Answering to the above contentions and also in support of the case of the

applicants that the application is well within time, the Learned Senior

Advocate, Shri Sanjay Parish would submit that the application by the

respondents seeking rejection of the main application as barred by limitation is

misconceived in law. The applicants, inter alia in Para 9 of the application has

averred that the project proponent has illegally commenced construction on

04.11.2012, without valid prior environmental clearance, thus is continuously

violating the provisions of Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986 and other

Acts enumerated in the Schedule-I of the NGT Act. Since the construction and

other related activities were going on, the violation continued. Thus, the cause

of action was continuing cause of action and the application was well within

limitation. Thus, it would be quite clear that the applicants have contended that

there was a continuing wrong and the project proponent, without

environmental clearance had commenced and were continuing with the

construction activity on the impugned project. The applicants came to know

about the commenced of the civil work for construction of the project in

question only from the letter dated 05.11.2012 given by the Collector,

Chhattisgarh, to the applicant no. 2 alongwith the letter true copies of certain

documents relating to the project were also provided.         Those documents

consists of the letter dated 21.04.1986, from MoEF letter dated 22.11.1990 and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                       14</span>
 a letter 30.11.2005, from the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and MoEF's letter

dated 30.11.2005. Only thereafter, the applicants filed the RTI application on

05.12.2012 seeking other documents. A reply was received on 22.12.2012

stating that as per the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_21">RTI Act</a>, 2005 under sub Section (1) of <a href="/doc/30610064/" id="a_22">Section 8</a> would

cease to be exempted, if 20 years have lapsed, the incident to which

information relates and the file records were not available. However, a copy of

environmental clearance dated 21.04.1986 was enclosed free of cost.

Subsequently, the Regional Office, MoEF, Bhopal by its reply dated

14.01.2013 sent a copy of site inspection report dated 30.09.2005. Only from

the same applications, came to know about the revocation of the environmental

clearance dated 21.04.1986. The said application under RTI and replies are

filed by the applicants. The applicants thus, came to know about the civil work

having started at the project site from the letter dated 05.11.2012 by the

Collector and the documents given alongwith the said letter. The applicants

gathered knowledge of the revocation of the environmental clearance about the

site inspection report from the letter dated 30.09.2005 received in reply dated

13.01.2012 in the RTI application dated 05.12.2012 and it was on that basis

the instant application was filed on 15.02.2013. It is pertinent to point out that

at the outset, the applicants got necessary knowledge by which their right to

file the present application accrued before this Tribunal only on 05.11.2012

and subsequently on 14.01.2013.             The Tribunal passed orders dated

12.03.2013, 10.04.2013, 01.05.2013 and 29.05.2013 for production of

documents related to revocation of environmental clearance. Thereafter, the

Tribunal directed the Director to appear on the next hearing date.            The

documents were not produced.
</p>
<p id="p_27">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                       15</span>
</p><p id="p_28"> 11.   On 10.06.2013 and 13.06.2013, the said documents were submitted by

MoEF without supporting affidavit.         The MoEF submitted only three

documents, letter dated 30.03.2001, 22.10.2001 and 06.09.2001.             The

documents dated 19.06.2001 which mentioned that the environmental

clearance had lapsed was not produced. When the attention of the Tribunal

was drawn to this fact, the direction was issued for production of said

documents on the next hearing on 30.07.2013. The respondents had not only

concealed the fact of lapsing of environmental clearance dated 21.06.1986 but

also the respondent no. 3 and 4 filed contrary in the affidavit. The applicant

side mentioned specifically about the revocation of the environmental

clearance dated 21.04.1986. The respondent MoEF in its reply filed in May

2013 had stated that it is a matter of record and not disputed. The respondent

no. 2 also handed over the reply to the applicants dated 30.07.2013 in which it

has been stated that it was again a matter of record related to respondent no.1

and replying respondent had not required any comments. Apart from that, the

respondent no. 3 and 4 in their affidavit dated 21.04.2013 has specifically

stated that the environmental clearance dated 21.04.1986 was never revoked

and the State Government of Madhya Pradesh had never received any letter or

order or communication from the MoEF revoking the environmental clearance

and the applicants have made the bald statement. Thus, from the said reply, it

would be clear that the respondent no. 3 and 4, categorically made a statement

that they did not receive any letter from the MoEF revoking the environmental

clearance dated 21.04.1986. On the contrary, the said letter dated 22.10.2001

produced subsequently in June, 2013 clearly showed that on 21.03.2013, the

status report was submitted by Water Resource Department of Madhya Pradesh

to MoEF and the letter dated 19.06.2001 regarding lapse of environmental



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                      16</span>
 clearance was subsequently addressed to the Secretary, Water Resource

Department.     All the above clearly show that respondent no.1 initially

concealed the relevant documents while respondent no. 3 and 4 made

misleading and false statement on oath before the Tribunal. The concealment

of relevant documents from the Tribunal and making false statement amounts

to playing fraud on the Tribunal. This is so deliberately done to avoid correct

and proper adjudication of the Tribunal regarding environmental clearance on

the question of limitation. Thus, the applicants submits that the cause of action

in the instant case was continuing wrong and which further arose when MoEF

filed its affidavit in May 2013 and also in June, 2013 when documents were

filed and on 30.07.2013 when document dated 19.06.2001 was given to the

Tribunal containing the fact that the environmental clearance had lapsed.

Thus, the application filed by respondent no. 3 and 4 that the present

application is barred by limitation is devoid of merits.


</p><p id="p_29">12.   The Learned Counsel would further contend that in our country, the rural

and other area where projects were implemented, the people are largely

unaware of the legal complications. They become aware of the problem when

the activities start at the site. Even in that situation they had no means to know

whether it is legal or otherwise. It is pertinent to point out that damage to

environment is a continuing wrong and constitute public injury. Hence, it

should not be forgotten that broadly, the Tribunal has to act within the

parameters of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_23">Article 21</a> of the Constitution as well as the precautionary

principle, polluter pay principle and doctrine of sustainable development as

provided under Section 20 of the NGT Act.

Counsel would submit that a wrongful act is of such a character that the injury

a cause of action arises and the acts complained of continuously repeated, the

cause of action continues and goes on de die in diem. In support of the

contentions, the Learned Counsel relied on the judgments :

<p id="p_32">14.   The Learned Counsel would further submit that the applicants are

aggrieved persons and concept of aggrieved persons has been enlarged in the

NGT Act, 2010. Now the injury which is being caused and brought to the

notice of the Tribunal in the application is a public injury as it could be

distinguished from private injury. The right to environment under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_24">Article 21</a> of

the Constitution and any damage to environment constituted violation of

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_25">Article 21</a> of Constitution. It is well settled that the fundamental right cannot

be waived or given up. Any damage to the environment is violation of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_26">Article

21</a> of the constitution construed as only public injury. So long as damage to

the environment continues, the public injury also continues alongwith cause of

action. Locus of public in general (as against individuals) also continues. If

there is continues injury affecting the fundamental right continuously, it cannot

be said that cause of action would seize as it would amount to waiver or giving

up of the fundamental right under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_27">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The relief for

enforcement of fundamental right cannot be refused solely on the ground of

latches, delay or the alike. The Supreme Court of India, in Lala Balmukund

1975 (1) SCC 725 has held that only such construction of limitation should be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                       19</span>
 preferred which preserves the remedy than the one which bars or defeats the

remedy. It is true that the letter dated 19.06.2001 and 22.10.2001 have used

the term 'lapsed' which means 'come to an end' of the environmental clearance

dated 21.04.1986.      The project proponent was also required to take

environmental clearance under EIA Notification 1994 by way of direction in

the said letter.   The letter dated 30.11.2005 has no validity sanctity after

environmental clearance dated 21.04.1986 lapsed and both in the notifications

dated 23.07.1998 as well as in the MoEF letter dated 19.06.2001 and

22.10.2001 it was directed that the project proponent should take a fresh

environmental clearance under the EIA notification 1994 and its amendment.

Therefore, the letter dated 30.11.2005 was void ab initio and thus, the

application made by the applicants seeking the reliefs was well within time.

for construction of earthen dam across the river Pench near village Machagora

in Chourai Tehsil of Chhindwara District, Madhya Pradesh at a cost of Rs.

1788.72 Crores was granted by the Department of Environment Forest and

Wild Life on 21.04.1986 subject to certain conditions in respect of safeguards

fresh environmental clearance.        Pursuant to the said communication, the

Regional Office of MoEF, Bhopal by a communication dated 22.10.2001

informed that the environmental clearance granted in the year 1986 for the

project remained lapsed. Following the letter by the Chief Engineer, Wiaganga

Basin, Water Resource Department, MP to the MoEF, a site inspection was

conducted by the Regional Office and the report dated 30.09.2005 was

submitted. After receipt of the report, the Additional Director, MoEF sent a

communication dated 30.11.2005 that the proposed project did not require

fresh environmental clearance. The Planning Commission, Water Resource

construction infrastructure and survey and investigation work pertaining to the

work such as development of approach road, residential quarters, office, rest

house building at the site, drilling at the dam site were already initiated and

moreover number of bridges and asphalted approach road was also constructed

also that no fresh environmental clearance was required from the letter dated

also declaration that the activities without a prior environmental clearance

under EIA notification 2006 is invalid alongwith other consequential reliefs

and hence, the applicant must be able to show that the reliefs sought for were

within the prescribed period of limitation as envisaged by the NGT Act a

special enactment. The concept of continuing cause of action put forth by the

applicant side was foreign to the plain and expressed provisions on limitation

engrafted under Section 14(3) and 15(3) of the NGT Act, 2010.

controversy between the parties centres around the expression 'cause of

Section 14 of the NGT Act, 2010 reads as follows:

environment including enforcement of any legal right related to environment is

involved and also the said substantial question should also arise out of the

implementation and is included in one of the seven enactments specified under

the Schedule - I. Even, if the applicant is able to satisfy the above requisites,

the Tribunal can adjudicate the disputes only if it is made within a period of six

filed within a period of five years from the date of which the cause of action for

such compensation or reliefs first arose. Also, if sufficient cause was shown,

the Tribunal is empowered to condone the delay for a period not exceeding 60

from the date on which the first event constituting the dispute arose, is explicit.

This is not only an indication but also the caution that the later dates on which

<p id="p_56">27.      It would be apt and appropriate to reproduce the following observation

made by the Principal Bench,NGT presided over by the Hon'ble Justice Shri

Swatanter Kumar, Chairperson, NGT, New Delhi in Appeal No.01 of 2013 Ms.

Medha Patkar &amp; Others Vs. Ministry of Environment &amp; Forest, Union of India

<p id="p_57">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">         "The Tribunal must adopt a pragmatic and practical approach

         that would also be in consonance with the provisions of the Act

         providing limitation. Firstly, the limitation would never begin to

         run and no act would determine when such limitation would stop

         running as any one of the stakeholders may not satisfy or comply

         with all its obligations prescribed under the Act. To conclude that

         it is only when all the stakeholders had completed in entirety

         their respective obligations under the respective provisions, read

         with the notification of 2006, then alone the period of limitation

         shall begin to run, would be an interpretation which will frustrate

         the very object of the Act and would also cause serious prejudice

         to all concerned. Firstly, the completely frustrates the purpose of

         prescription of limitation. Secondly, a project proponent who has

         obtained environmental clearance and thereafter spent crores of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                           26</span>
 rupees on establishment and operation of the project, would be

exposed to uncertainty, dander of unnecessary litigation and even

the possibility of jeopardizing the interest of his project after

years have lapsed. This cannot be the intent of law. The framers

of law have enacted the provisions of limitation with a clear

intention of specifying the period within which an aggrieved

person can invoke the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. It is a settled

rule of law that once the law provides for limitation, then it must

operate meaningfully and with its rigour. Equally true is that

once the period of limitation starts running, then it does not stop.

</blockquote><p id="p_58">An applicant may be entitled to condonation or exclusion of

period of limitation. Discharge of one set of obligations in its

entirety by any stakeholder would trigger the period of limitation

which then would not stop running and equally cannot be

frustrated by mere non-compliance of its obligation to

communicate or place the order in public domain by another

stakeholder. The purpose of providing a limitation is not only to

fix the time within which a party must approach the Tribunal but

is also intended to bring finality to the orders passed on one hand

and preventing endless litigation on the other. Thus both these

purposes can be achieved by a proper interpretation of these

provisions. A communication will be complete once the order

granting environmental clearance is place in public domain by

all the modes referred to by all or any of the stakeholders. The

legislature in its wisdom has, under the provisions of the Act or in

the notification of 2006, not provided any other indicator or



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                 27</span>
       language that could be the precept for the Tribunal to take any

      other view."

</p><p id="p_60">28.   The contentions put forth by the applicants that the construction

activities of the project commenced on 04.11.2012 has to be rejected since

subsequent to the grant of environmental approval by the Department of

Environment Forest and Wild Life by the Government of India in the 1986. As

could be seen from the inspection report of the year 2005, as referred to the

above, that the project a related activities such as pre construction

infrastructure and survey and investigation work pertaining to the work such as

development of approach road, residential quarter, official rest house building

at dam site, drilling work at dam site and also six bridges alongwith asphalted

approach road was constructed. Even both the letters written by the Chief

Engineer to MoEF dated 25.07.2001 and 30.04.2001 would make it evident

that the project work commenced in the year 1986-87. The communication of

the Executive Engineer dated 01.09.2001 would also indicate that the project

work commenced in 1987 and was continuing. Needless to say again, the

above activities were part and parcel of the Pench Diversion Project in

question. Under such circumstances, the contention put forth by the appellant

side that the construction work did not commence earlier but only on

04.11.2012 has to be got rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">29.   Trait law it is that the special law of limitation, in any given enactment,

will always exclude the general law of limitation. The NGT Act, 2010, a

special enactment specifically provides period of limitation under <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_30">Section

14(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_31">15(3)</a>, as stated supra. The Principal Bench, NGT has already held

in Jesurethinam &amp; Ors Vs. Ministry of Environment, Union of India &amp; Ors,

reported in 2012 (2) FLT 811 NGT that, when a specific provision for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                       28</span>
 limitation is provided under the special statute, the general provisions of the

<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_32">Limitation Act</a>, 1963 are inapplicable. Hence, the Tribunal is afraid whether

the theory of continuing cause of action can be made applicable to the present

factual position of the case for which the specific period of limitation is

available under the NGT Act, 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_63">
</p><p id="p_64">30.    Equally so is the contention put forth by the applicants that the cause of

action arose only on 04.11.2012, the date on which the applicants came to

know about their right. Even assuming to be so, it cannot be countenanced in

law. The application proceeds on the footing as if the applicants came to know

about the project activities on 04.11.2012 when the applicant no. 2 was served

with a letter on 05.11.2012. The above plea has to be negatived for more than

one reason. The said letter dated 05.11.2012by the Collector, Chhindwara to

the applicant no. 2 marked as Exhibit A-1 reads as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">       "Yesterday on 4th November, 2012, the Civil Work for the construction of

       the Dam in Bahnwada area of Chaurai Division. I received your letter

       dated 4th November, 2012 at the construction site. On points mentioned

       in the letter, I request that the construction of the dam in the

       Chhindwara District is being done by the State Administration for the

       benefit of the farmers. Water Resource Department has taken all the

       requisite permission for the implementation of the ambitious project.

       For your easy reference and perusal the copies of the letters received

       from       the      department        is   being   made   available   with   this

       letter............................"</blockquote><p id="p_65">


</p><p id="p_66">      Nowhere it is stated in the letter that construction work commenced on

4th-5th November, 2012. From the reading of the letter, it would be quite clear



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                  29</span>
 that it was a reply to a letter given by the applicant no. 2 to the Collector,

Chhindwara at the dam site. On query as to the non production of the letter of

applicant no. 2, a copy of the letter was produced at the time of arguments.

The letter of applicant no. 2 would clearly indicate that the agitation in respect

of the dam project was going on for a period of more than seven years.

Admittedly, out of 5 applicants, a few are the residents of that area where the

project was undertaken and the lands of a few of the applicants were also

acquired by the State for the said purpose and proceedings in respect of the

acquisition was pending from the time of acquisition in 1990. Under such

circumstances, it would be futile on the part of the applicants to say that they

came to know about the project and all necessary particulars thereon only from

05.11.2012, the date of reply by the Collector, Chhindwara.


</p><p id="p_67">31.     In his sincere attempt of supporting his case, the Learned Counsel for the

applicants would urge that though, the environmental clearance for the project

in question was granted on 21.04.1986, the MoEF Regional Office, Bhopal

revoked the environmental clearance on 22.10.2001 though the word 'lapsed'

at one state on the revocation at the other stage was employed by the MoEF by

two different communications. The effect of the same was to put an end to

environmental clearance originally granted in the year 1986. If so, the same

could not be revoked by any action or letter as done in the present case on

30.11.2005 and hence, the only way known to law by which the construction of

the project in question would have commenced under the EIA Notification

2006.    Hence, the applicants asked for a declaration that the said Pench

Diversion Project should not commence without the prior environmental

clearance under the EIA Notification 2006 and the commencement of the

project was totally illegal. Thus, the reliefs asked for was within the prescribed



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                        30</span>
 period of limitation since the illegal activities which were injurious to the

environmental and ecology was continuing. The applicants have also sought

for awarding appropriate damage compensation to all persons who have

suffered physically, mentally and financially due to the illegal construction

undertaken by the project proponent.        Much reliance was placed by the

Learned Counsel on the judgment of Goa Foundation Vs. Union of India MA

No. 49/2013 in Application No. 26/2013 rendered by the Principal Bench,

NGT, New Delhi. The Learned Counsel also took this Bench to different parts

of the judgment. There cannot be any quarrel on proposition of law settled in

that judgement. To examine what is cause of action, the Tribunal must read the

entire petition as a whole and the material facts are thus pleaded and provided

for the purpose of obtaining the reliefs and if the applicants disclose even a

small cause of action that the claim cannot be rejected. The said judgement of

the Principal Bench cannot be applied with the present facts of the case for two

reasons. The question that arose before the Hon'ble Principal was on the

maintainability of the application and not on the question of limitation.

Secondly, the application therein sought reliefs that the respondent authorities

should discharge their duties by way of exercise of power given under

enactments stated in the Schedule-I of the NGT Act, 2010 for preservation and

protection, etc. In the instant case, the applicants have asked for declaration in

respect of environmental clearance dated 21.04.1986, communication dated

30.11.2005 and also a declaration on the strength that there was no

environmental clearance and declaration that the activities of Pench Diversion

Project could not commence without prior environmental clearance under EIA

Notification 2006 and all other reliefs were only consequential. Thus, without

going into the legality or otherwise, by environmental approval dated



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                       31</span>
 21.04.1986, communication dated 30.11.2005, the question in respect of their

declaration referred to above cannot be investigated or considered or a decision

arrived at. Thus, the cause of action, as could be seen from the averments in

the applications was directly relatable to the existence of the letters dated

21.04.1986, environmental clearance and letter dated 30.11.2005.              In the

considered opinion of the Tribunal, the concept of continuing cause of action

cannot be made applicable to the present factual position that too when there is

a specific bar against the entertaining the application, if it is not within a period

of limitation prescribed under Section 14(1) and 15(3) of NGT Act. At no

stretch of imagination, neither the environmental approval dated 21.04.1986

nor the subsequent communicated dated 30.11.2005 can be assailed after long

lapse of years. The words "first arose" in <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_33">Section 14(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_34">15(3)</a> which are

indicators of the unambiguous legislative intent.            While the expressed

provisions of the statute of provision under Section 14(1) and 15(3) of the NGT

Act is so clear, the concept of continuing cause of action as put forth by the

applicants has not application. The statutory prescription of the special period

of limitation under the said provisions would not only stand indicative but also

exclude the said concept of continuing cause of action.           If the theory of

continuing cause of action is to be accepted, the words "first arose" in the

above provisions will lose its import and significance. Having sought for a

declaration that environmental approval dated 21.04.1986 and also the

communication dated 30.11.2005 were invalid, now the applicants cannot be

permitted to say that the environmental clearance dated 21.04.1986 was put an

end by the subsequent communication in the year 2001 and thus, there was no

environmental approval existed, cannot be countenanced.            So long as the

applicants have sought for a declaration as stated above, no doubt, the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                         32</span>
 application is barred by time. As stated above, the applicants who are living

nearby and whose lands have also been taken for the purpose of the project in

question cannot now be permitted to say, after long lapse of a decade, that they

came to know, that too the existence of their right only in November, 2012. A

person who wishes to invoke the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or Court has to be

vigilant and conscious of his rights and should not let the time to go by not

taking appropriate steps. It is true that the provisions of law of limitation has to

be construed liberally but the same cannot be applied to the present facts of the

case for the reasons stated above. It is true that the Tribunal must adopt a

practical approach which is in consonance with the provisions of the Act

providing limitation. In the instant case, the period of limitation has begun to

run long back. The period of limitation once commences operating, it does not

stop but continues to operate with its rigour. An interpretation accepting the

continuing cause of action would frustrate the very object of the Act and the

purpose of prescription of limitation. In the instant case, it is contended by the

respondent project proponent that nearly 600 crores have been spent and more

than 50% of the work is over, hence, the project proponent who obtained the

environmental clearance in the year 1986 and has completed not less than 50%

of the work by spending hundreds crores of rupees would be thrown to

jeopardising his project at the long lapse of years. Needless to say, if it is

allowed, it would be against the very intent of the law. Even it may be true that

the applicants are aggrieved persons and it may even be true that there was

violations of provisions of law but action should have been initiated within the

prescribed period of limitation. In view of all the above, it can be well stated

that the contentions put forth by the Learned Counsel for the applicants that the

application was within time have to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_68">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                        33</span>
</p><p id="p_69"> 32.    True it is that the application in the present form has to be rejected for

the above reasons as one not within the period of limitation. It is not that the

applicants are helpless or remediless. Apart from questioning the very grant of

environmental approval in the year 1986, the communication dated 30.11.2005

whereby it was stated that no fresh environmental clearance was required, the

applicants, in extenso, have averred that the construction and also the related

activities by the project proponent was violative of not only the provisions of

the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_35">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and other Acts enumerated in

Schedule-I of NGT Act, 2010. Specific allegations have been made by them

stating that they are aggrieved individually and collectively, directly and

indirectly by the loss of ecology and by environmental degradation and that

injury, harm and damage were caused to them and all whom they represent in

view of the violations of all environmental law and for which they are also

entitled for damages and compensations.           Hence, there cannot be any

impediment for the applicants to bring to the notice of the legal forum the

activities which are violative of the provision of the said enactments apart from

seeking direction in respect of the discharge of the obligations and duties by

exercise of powers vested on the authorities under the said enactments. They

can seek the enforcement of all the rights relating to environment.           The

Tribunal is vested with the original and appellate jurisdiction which is wide.

Speaking on the wide jurisdiction of the Tribunal, both original and appellate,

Hon'ble Justice Shri Swatanter Kumar, Chairperson, (Principal Bench), NGT,

New Delhi had an occasion to consider the power and jurisdiction of the

Tribunal in Application No. 26/2012 referred to above, has held as follows:


</p><p id="p_70">      "22.   The contents of the application and the prayer thus should

      firstly satisfy the ingredients of it being in the nature of a civil case



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                        34</span>
 and secondly, it must relate to a substantial question of environment.

It could even be an anticipated action substantially relating to

environment.      Such cases would squarely fall within the ambit of

<a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_36">Section 14(1)</a>. Next, in the light of the language of <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_37">Section 14(1)</a>, now

we have to examine what is the substantial question relating to

'environment'. Section 2(1)(c) of the NGT Act explains the word

'environment' as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_71">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">        "'environment' includes water, air and land and the

      interrelationship, which exists among and between water, air and

      land and human being, other living creatures, plants, micro-

      organism and property."</blockquote><p id="p_72">


</p><p id="p_73">        <a href="/doc/89100821/" id="a_38">Section 2(m)</a> defines the term 'substantial question' relating to

 environment as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_74">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">        "It shall include an instance where -
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">        (i) there is a direct violation of a specific statutory

           environmental obligation by a person by which, -


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_38">               (A) the community at large other than an individual or
                   group of individuals is affected or likely to be affected
                   by the environmental consequences; or
               (B) the gravity of damage to the environment or property
                   is substantial
               (C) the damage to public health is broadly measurable;
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_39">        (ii)    the environmental consequences relate to a specific

           activity or a point source of pollution."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">
</blockquote><p id="p_75">23.     the legislature, in its wisdom, has defined the word

'environment' in very wide terms. It is inclusive of water, air, land,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                    35</span>
 plants, micro-organisms and the inter-relationship between them, living

and non-living creatures and property. Similarly, 'substantial question

relating to environment' also in an inclusive definition and besides what

it means, it also includes what has been specified under Section 2(m) of

the NGT Act. Inclusive definitions are not exhaustive. One has to,

therefore, give them a very wide meaning to make them as

comprehensive as the statute permits on the principle of liberal

interpretation.    This is the very basis of an inclusive definition.

Substantial, in terms of the Oxford Dictionary of English, is of

considerable importance, strongly built or made large, real and tangile,

rather than imaginary. Substantial is actual or real as opposed to

trivial, not serious, unimportant, imaginary or something. Substantial

is not the same as unsubstantial i.e. just enough to avoid the deminimis

principle. In Inre Net Books Agreement (1962) I WLR 1347, it was

explained that, the term 'substantial' is not a term that demands a

strictly quantitative or proportional assessment. Substantial can also

mean more than reasonable. To put it aptly, a substantial question

relating to environment must, therefore, be a question which is

debatable, not previously settled and must have a material bearing on

the cause and its issues relating to environment.

NGT Act, is to attain the object of prevention and protection of

environmental pollution and to provide administration of environmental

justice and make it easily accessible within the framework of the statute.

an integral part of the object, reason and purposes of enacting the NGT
