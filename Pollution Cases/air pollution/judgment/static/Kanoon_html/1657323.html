JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">1.  Occupational  accidents  and diseases  remain  the	most
appalling  human  tragedy of modem industry and one  of	 its
most  serious forms of economic waste.	Occupational  health
hazards	 and  diseases to the workmen employed	in  asbestos
industries are of our concern in this writ
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">640</span>
petition  filed under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1">Article 32</a> of the Constitution by	 way
of   public  interest  litigation  at  the  behest  of	 the
petitioner, an accredited Organisation.	 At the inception of
filing	the  writ  petition  in the  year  1986,  though  it
highlighted   the  lacuna  in  diverse	provisions  of	 law
applicable  to the asbestos industry, due to orders  of-this
Court  passed from time to time, though wide gaps have	been
bridged by subordinate legislation, yet lot more need to  be
done.  So the petitioner seeks to fill in the yearning	gaps
and  remedial measures for the protection of the  health  of
the  workers engaged in mines and asbestos  industries	with
adequate  mechanism  for and diagnosis and  control  of	 the
silent killer disease " asbestosis", with amended prayers as

Andhra	Pradesh	 and Rajasthan, there  exists  about  thirty
mines  and  the workmen employed therein are  about  106  1.
There  are  about  74 asbestos industries  in  nine  States,
namely,	  Haryana,   Delhi,   Andhra   Pradesh,	  Karnataka,
Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat and Madhya  Pradesh.
It would also appear that as on August 1986 there are  about
11,000	workmen	 employed in those  industries.	  Basing  on
Biswas	Committee  report,  the petitioner  filed  the	writ
petition.   The	 Central Govt. accepting  the  said  report,
framed	modal  Rule 123<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_6">A of Factories Act</a> and on  its  model
relevant  laws	and Rules were amended and are	now  brought
into  force.   We  are not referring  to  the  findings	 and
recommendations	 of Biswas Committee as the  "Asbestos	Con-
vention, 1986" covered the whole ground.

<p id="p_4">tional	Labour Conference (ILC) held in June, 1986,  it	 had
adopted on 24th June, 1986 the Convention called "the Asbes-
tos  Convention, 1986".	 India is one of the signatories  to
the  Convention and it played a commendable role  suggesting
suitable amendments in the preparatory conferences.  It	 has
come  into force from June 16, 1989, after its	ratification
by  the Member-States.	<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_7">Article 2(a)</a> defines  "asbestos"  to
mean  the  fibrous form of mineral  silicates  belonging  to
rock-forming   minerals	 of  the  serpentine   group,	i.e.
chrysotile  (white  asbestos), and of the  amphibole  group,
i.e. actinolite, amosite (brown	   asbestos,  cummingtonite-
grunerite),anthophyllite, crocidolite (blue asbestos), tremolite,
or  any mixture containing one or more of these."  "Asbestos
dust"  is  defined  as "airborne particles  of	asbestos  or
settled particles of asbestos" which may become airborne  in
the  working  environment  "Respirable	asbestos  fibre"  is
defined	 as a particle of asbestos with a diameter  of	less
than sum and of which the length is at least three times the
diameter;  "Workers" coverall employed persons;	 "Workplace"
covers all places where workers need to be or need to go  by
reason	of  their  work and which are under  the  direct  or
indirect control of the employer;
</p><p id="p_5">4.   <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_8">Article   5(2)</a>   provides	that   "National   laws	  or
regulations  shall  provide  for  the  necessary   measures,
including   appropriate	 penalties,  to	  ensure   effective
enforcement  of	 and compliance with the provisions  of	 the
Convention.". <a href="/doc/691208/" id="a_9">Article 8</a> provides that "employers and workers
or  their  representatives shall co-operate  as	 closely  as
possible at all levels in the undertaking in the application
of  the	 measures prescribed pursuant to  this	Convention".
<a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_10">Article	 9</a> in Part III prescribes Protective and  Preventive
Measures,  regulating that the national laws or	 regulations
shall  provide that exposure to asbestos shall be  prevented
or controlled by one or more of the following measures	 (a)
making work in which exposure to asbestos may occur  subject
to regulations prescribing adequate engineering controls and
work practices, including workplace hygiene; (b) prescribing
special	 rules and procedures including	 authorisation,	 for
the  use  of  asbestos or of certain types  of	asbestos  or
products containing asbestos or for certain work  processes.
"  <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_11">Article 15</a> postulates that (1) "the	competent  authority
shall  prescribe limits for the exposure of workers  to	 as-
bestos	or other exposure criteria for the evaluation of  me
working	 environment  (2)  the	exposure  limits  or   other
exposure  criteria shall be fixed and periodically  reviewed
and  updated  in  the light of	technological  progress	 and
advances in technological and scientific knowledge,  (empha-
sis  supplied),	 (3)  in all workplaces	 where	workers	 are
exposed to asbestos, the employer shall take all appropriate
measures to prevent or control the release of asbestos	dust
into  the air, to ensure that the exposure limits  or  other
exposure  criteria are complied with and also to reduce	 ex-
posure	to  as low a level as  is  reasonably  practicable."
Clause	(4)  provides that on its failure to carry  out	 the
above direction to the industry to maintain and replace,  as
necessary,  at no cost to the workers, adequate	 respiratory
protective  equipment  and special  protective	clothing  as
appropriate.  Respiratory protective equipment should comply
with  standards set by the competent authority and  be	used
only as a supplementary, temporary, emergency or exceptional
measure and not as an alternative to technical control.

<p id="p_6">5.<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_12">Article  16</a> mandates, that  'each employer shall  be	made
responsible  for  the establishment  and  implementation  of

exposure of the workers he employs to asbestos and for their
protection  against the hazards due to asbestos "  (emphasis

handling  and cleaning thereof etc. etc.  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_15">Article  19</a>  deals
with the disposal of the waste containing asbestos.  Part IV
consisting of Articles 20 and 21, deals with surveillance of
the working environment and workers' health.  <a href="/doc/1501707/" id="a_16">Article 20 (1)</a>
provides  that "where it is necessary for the protection  of
the  health  of	 workers, the  employer	 shall	measure	 the
concentrations of airborne asbestos dust in workplaces,	 and
shall  monitor	the  exposure  of  workers  to	asbestos  at
intervals  and	using  methods specified  by  the  competent

maintenance of the records:- "the records of the  monitoring
of the working environment and of the exposure of workers to
asbestos  shall	 be  kept for a	 period	 prescribed  by	 the
competent authority " (emphasis supplied).  Clause (3)	"the
workers concerned, their representatives and the  inspection
services  shall	 have access to these records."	 Clause	 (4)
"the  workers or their representatives shall have the  right
to request the monitoring of the working environment and  to
appeal to the competent authority concerning the results  of
the  monitoring.  ". <a href="/doc/106144/" id="a_19">Article 21(1)</a> envisages  That  "workers
who are or have been exposed to asbestos shall be  provided,
in  accordance	with national law and  practice,  with	such
medical	 examinations  as are necessary to  supervise  their
health	in  relation  to the  occupational  hazard,  and  to
diagnose   occupational	 diseases  caused  by  exposure	  to
asbestos ". Clause (2) adumbrates that such monitoring shall
be free of the charge of the workers and shall take place as
far  as	 possible  during the  working	hours.	 Clause	 (3)
accords to the workers of the right to information, in	that
behalf,	  of  the  results  of	their  medical	 examination
(emphasis  supplied) "shall be informed in an  adequate	 and
appropriate  manner  of	 the results of	 their	medical	 ex-
aminations  and receive individual advice  concerning  their
health	in  relation  to  their work.	Clause	(4)  is	 not
material  for  the  purpose of	this  case,  hence  omitted.
Clause	(5)  postulates that the competent  authority  shall
develop	 a system of notification of  occupational  diseases
caused by asbestos.
</p><p id="p_7">6.<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_20">Article  22</a>,	in  Part  V,  relating	to  information	 and
education  is  not relevant for the purpose  of	 this  case,

relevant for the purpose of this case and Clause (1) thereof
states	that  "this Convention shall be	 binding  only	upon

can  be	 the development of diffuse pleural  thickening	 and
circumscribed  pleural plaques which may  become  calcified.
These  are regarded as no more than evidence of exposure  to
asbestos   dust.   Other  types	 of  cancer  (e.g.  of	 the

</p><p id="p_19">15.  In	 the  "Encyclopaedia  of  Occupational	Health	 and
Safety",  Vol-1, published by International  Labour  Office,
Geneva, the latest 4th Edition, 1991, provides definition of
asbestos as has been found hereinbefore and therefore, it is
not  necessary to its reiteration.  Its Pathology  has	been
stated at page 188 in Vol-1, which is as follows:-
"The retained fibres in the alveolar region are 3 um or less
in  diameter but may be up to 200 um long.   Animal  experi-
ments strongly point to the longer fibres, 5 um and over, as
being  much more fibrogenic than shorter fibres.  A  propor-
tion  of  the longer fibres, especially	 amphiboles,  become
coated with an iron Protein complex producing the  drumstick
appearance of asbestos bodies.	All types of asbestos  cause
similar	 fibrosis.  The fibrosis starts in  the	 respiratory
bronchioles  with  collections	of  macrophages	  containing
fibres,	 and  others lying free.  These	 deposits  organise,
collagen  replacing  the initial reticulin  web.   Initially
only  a	 few respiratory bronchioles are affected,  but	 the
fibrosis  spreads centrally to the terminal bronchioles	 and
peripherally to the acinus.  The areas increase in size	 and
coalesce   causing   diffuse  interstitial   fibrosis	with
shrinkage.   The  process  starts  in  the  bases  spreading
upwards	 as the disease progresses; in advanced disease	 the
whole  lung  structure is distorted and	 replaced  by  dense
fibrosis, cysts, and some areas of emphysema.
The  pleura,  both  visceral  and  parietal  surfaces,	 are
affected  by  the  fibrosis and to a degree  which  is	much
greater than in other types of pneumoconiosis.	The visceral
surface may be sclerosed up to 1 cm thick.  In the  parietal
pleura	thickening  starts  as	a  basket-weave	 pattern  of
fibroblasts, the sheets of fibrosis lying along the line  of
the  ribs  especially in the lower thorax  and	posteriorly.
The edges become rolled and crenated and, after many  years,
calcified.
</p><p id="p_20">The  parietal  thickening may be extensive  and	 thick	with
little or no parenchymal fibrosis.  The reasons for this are
not  fully understood but indicate the need to separate,  if
possible, parietal and visceral pleural thickening in life.

<p id="p_21">Table  1 lists the types of fibrosis in the lung  caused  by

Recent	epidemiological research indicates  that  asbestosis
and  pleural plaque may have differing actiologies,  natural
histories,  and	 significance  in  terms  of  morbidity	 and
mortality.

</p><p id="p_25">16.  The Asbestosis has been signified at page 188 which  is
as follows:
</p><p id="p_26">Asbestosis  The signs and symptoms of asbestosis are similar
to  those caused by other diffuse interstitial	fibroses  of
the  lung.  Increased breathlessness on exertion is  usually
the  first  symptom,  sometimes associated  with  aching  or
transient sharp pains ;in the chest.  A cough is not usually
present except in the late stages when distressing paroxysms
occur.	 Increased  sputum is not. present unless  there  is
bronchitis,  the result of smoking.  The onset	of  symptoms
(except	 following very heavy exposure) is usually slow	 and
the  subject  may  have forgotten having  any  contact	with
asbestos.   Persistent	dull  chest  pain  and	 haemoptysis
indicate  the need to investigate further the  diagnosis  of
bronchial or mesothelial cancer.
</p><p id="p_27">The  most important physical sign is the presence  of  high-
pitched fine crepitations (crackles) at full inspiration and
persisting  after  coughing.  They occur  initially  in	 the
lower  axillae	and  extend more  widely  later.   Agreement
between skilled observers on detecting this sign is good but
it  may	 vary from day to day in the early stages.   It	 may
also  be  present as an isolated sign in 2-3%  of  otherwise
normal	individuals.  There are now means of recording	this
sign on tape.  Other sounds  wheezes and rhonchi  are of  no
help  in  diagnosis,  but  indicate  associated	 bronchitis.
Clubbing of the fingers and toes was formerly regarded as an
important physical sign.  There is an impression that it  is
now less frequently seen.  Its seventy does not relate	well
to other aspects of the diagnosis.  There is poor  agreement
between	  observers  except  when  the	clubbing   is	very
pronounced.  It is possible that its presence relates to the
rapidity of progression of the disease.
</p><p id="p_28">The chest radiograph remains the most important single piece
of  evidence,  even though the appearances  are	 similar  to
other types of interstitial fibrosis.  When the	 radiography
is classified by three or more skilled readers using the ILO
1971  scheme independently, it is found that  virtually	 all
cases  of  asbestosis are picked up by one or  more  of	 the
readers	  as  Category	1/0  or	 above.	  The	radiographic
appearances  are  well illustrated in the  set	of  standard
films  of  the ILO 1980 Classification of  the	radiographic
appearances  of	 the  pneumoconioses  (see   PHEUMOCONIOSES,
INTERNATIONAL	CLASSIFICATION	OF).	The   classification
provides  a means of recording the continuum from  normality
to the most advanced stages on a 12-point scale of  severity
(profusion)  and of extent (zones) affected.   The  earliest
changes	 usually occur at the bases with the  appearance  of
small  irregular  (linear)  opacities  superimposed  on	 the
normal	branching architecture of the lung.  As the  disease
advances the extent increases and the profusion of irregular
opacities  progressively  obscures  the	 normal	 structures.
Shrinkage  of  the  lung  occurs,  with	 elevation  of	 the
diaphragm. in advanced cases
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">647</span>
distortion  of	the  lung with cysts  (honeycomb  lung)	 and
bullae	occur.	 The  hilar  glands  are  not  enlarged	  or
calcified unless exposure has been to mixtures of  silicious
dusts.	 This  may occur, for example,	in  making  asbestos
roofing	 shingles  or pressure pipes, and  in  mining.	 The
small opacities may then be rounded rather than irregular.
The  pattern of lung function provides the  important  third
component  in  diagnosis.  The functional  changes  are	 the
result	of  a  shrunken and  non-homogeneous  lung,  without
obstruction  of the larger airways  (restrictive  syndrome).
The  total lung volume is reduced and especially the  forced
vital capacity (FVC), but the ventilatory capacity  (FEV1.0)
is  only reduced in proportion to the FVC, so the ratio	 FEV
1.0/ FVC is normal or even raised.  The transfer factor	 for
carbon monoxide is reduced in later stages, but in the early
stage an increase of ventilation on a standard exercise test
may  be	 the only alteration indicating	 impairment  of	 gas
exchange.   Although  the restrictive syndrome is  the	com-
monest	pattern	 (about 40%) in about 10%  of  cases  airway
obstruction is the main feature and in the remainder a mixed
pattern	 is seen.  This is though to be largely due  to	 the
confounding effects of cigarette smoking.
Visceral  pleurisy:  chronic and acute This  occurs  in	 two
forms  chronic and acute.  The former is the commoner and is
a  usual  accompaniment	 of  parenchymal  disease,  but	 its
severity does not run parallel with the parenchymal disease.
The diagnosis is radiographic.	In some cases one or both of
the costophrenic angles are filled in but the more  specific
feature	 is  the appearance of well defined  shadow  running
parallel to the line of the lateral chest wall and separated
from  it by a narrow (1-2 nun) clear zone.  This is  due  to
the  thickened pleura seen "edge on".  It is illustrated  in
the ILO 1980 standard set of films.  The thickening is	best
seen  in  the middle and lower third of	 the  lateral  chest
wall, the apices are usually spared.  It is common in  those
only lightly exposed to find this pleural thickening as	 the
only  radiographic  feature.   It  is  readily	missed	when
present	 only  over a short length of the wall	and  if	 the
radiographic technique does not give a clear picture of	 the
periphery of the lung.	When the visceral pleura is  greatly
thickened  it  causes veiling of the lung  field,  obscuring
both  the  normal structure and parenchymal  changes.	This
probably  the  basis of the "shaggy heart" and	the  "ground
glass"	appearance  described  in  the	carly  accounts	  of
asbestosis.   The  wide	 recognition  that  small  areas  of
pleural thickening may be the only sign of past exposure  to
asbestos  is  recent, and it seems to be a  feature  of	 the
effects of low exposure to the dust.  It is likely to remain
an important observation for monitoring exposure to improved
conditions in the future.
</p><p id="p_29">Acute pleurisy affecting the bases, and costophrenic angles,
with effusions, sometimes blood-stained, is now a recognised
sequel	to  asbestos dust exposure.  It is  associated	with
pain,  fever, leucocytosis and a raised blood  sedimentation
rate.  It settles in a few weeks but leaves the costophrenic
angles obscured.  No precipitating factors have been identi-
fied.  Its recognition is important.  Firstly, the cause may
be missed unless and adequate occupational history is taken;
secondly  not all effusions in asbestos workers signify	 the
onset  of  an  asbestos-related	 cancer.   A  few  weeks  of
observation may be necessary to confirm the aetiology.
Summary of diagnosis  The diagnosis of asbestosis  therefore
depends upon
</p><p id="p_30">(a)a history of significant exposure to asbestos dust rarely
starting less than 10 years before examination:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">648</span>
<p id="p_31">(b)  radiological  features consistent with  basel  fibrosis
(Category 1/0 and over, ILO 1980);
</p><p id="p_32">(c)  characteristic bilateral crepitations;
</p><p id="p_33">(d)  lung  function  changes consistent with at	 least	some
features of the restrictive syndrome.
</p><p id="p_34">Not all the criteria need to be met in all cases but (a)  is
essential,  (b) should be given greater weight than  (c)  or
</p><p id="p_35">(d);  however,	occasionally  (c) may be  sole	sign,  Other
investigations are not of much help.  Asbestos bodies in the
sputum	indicate past exposure to asbestos but are  not	 di-
agnostic  of asbestosis.  Their absence when there  is	much
sputum	and marked radiological changes of fibrosis  suggest
an alternative cause for the fibrosis.
</p><p id="p_36">Immunological  tests  may  be positive but do  not  help  in
consistent  separation	of asbestosis from  other  types  of
fibrosis.   Lung  function  results  must  be  assessed	  in
relation  to appropriate standards allowing for ethnic,	 sex
and age differences and for cigarette smoking.
Asbestos  corns	 on  the fingers  area	of  thickening	skin
surrounding  implanted fibres  are now much less common	 be-
cause much of the asbestos fibre is packed mechanically	 and
gloves	are  worn.   Corns do not lead to  skin	 tumors	 and
disappear on removal of the fibres.
</p><p id="p_37">17.Pleural plaques and sources of exposure to asbestos	have
been stated at page 189-191, thus :-
</p><p id="p_38">Pleural plaques	 Parietal pleural plaques alone rarely cause
symptoms.   They  may occur alone or with  asbestosis.	 The
diagnosis  in  life is radiological and the  appearance	 are
more specific than in the case of parenchymal fibrosis.	  PA
films	will  detect  most  cases,  but	 because  they	 are
frequently  thickest posteriorly their full extent  is	best
seen  using oblique views.  The ILO 1980 standard film	show
their  appearance  and the scheme provides,  for  the  first
time, a separation of parietal (circumscribed) and  visceral
(diffuse)  pleural  thickening.	 The plaques lie  along	 the
line of the ribs, and when thick cast a well defined  shadow
over  the  lung field extending in from	 the  lateral  chest
wall, where they may also be seen "edge on".
</p><p id="p_39">Separation  from  visceral thickening depends largely  on  a
defined edge to the shadow.  Both types may occur  together.
Dependent mostly on the length of time since first exposure,
and  age,  patchy Calcification occurs in the  edges.	This
produces  a  bizarre  pattern of dense	shadows	 likened  to
"gluttering  candle  wax" or a "holly leaf".  The  onset  of
calcification  reveals	many small  plaques  not  previously
visible.   When	 calcification	occurs	in  a  crater-shaped
plaque	on  the dome of the diaphragm a	 diagnosis  of	past
exposure  to asbestos or related minerals can be  made	with
confidence.
</p><p id="p_40">Sources of exposure to asbestos	 Formerly it was though easy
to establish past exposure to asbestos by inquiry about work
in manufacturing plants, or the application of the fibre for
insulation.  Now it is realised that only the most  detailed
history	 of  all  jobs, residences and	occupations  of	 the
family	will  reveal possible exposures	 to  asbestos.	 The
reasons for this change are
</p><p id="p_41">(a)  the much wider use of asbestos in thousands of products
especially since the Second World War (see ASBESTOS):
</p><p id="p_42">(b)  the  recognition that significant exposure to  asbestos
occurred around mines and manufacturing plants in the past;
</p><p id="p_43">(c)  the  discovery of family exposure to the  dust  brought
home on clothing, and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">649</span>
also  that  those  working in an area where  lagging  is  in
progress  may be affected, even though they are	 engaged  in
lagging;
</p><p id="p_44">(d)  the    finding   that   calcified	 pleural    plaques,
indistinguishable  from those occupationally  exposed,	also
occur  in  the	general population  in	localised  areas  in
several countries (Finland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Turkey
and others).
</p><p id="p_45">With the discovery of such diversity of sources of  possible
exposure,  but virtually no quantitative  information  about
its  severity, and few long term follow up studies of  those
exposed, it is not surprised that there is controversy about
the health hazards.  However, some conclusions emerge  which
must be subject to revision in the future.
</p><p id="p_46">(1)Asbestosis  is  primarily  occupational  in	origin,	 the
result of mining , milling,   manufacturing,	   applying,
removing  or transporting asbestos fibre.  Exposure is	much
less when the fibre is bound in the product (asbestos cement
and  asbestos plastic and paper product).  Also exposure  in
the  past was much greater than it is today with the use  of
the best working practices.
</p><p id="p_47">(2)Asbestosis  may  have been caused by home  exposure	from
dusty  clothing at a time when there was no dust or  hygiene
control in the factories.
</p><p id="p_48">(3)Asbestosis does not result from the very limited exposure
to  which  the general public is or has been  subject,	even
though asbestos fibers are detectable in the lungs of a high
proportion  of adults in industrialized areas.	 The  median
numbers	 of fibres so detectable are two to three  order  of
magnitude  less than that found in those occupationally	 ex-
posed.
</p><p id="p_49">(4)  There  are and have been important differences  between
countries  in the use of asbestos,so that exposure  for	 the
same  occupation  varies  widely.   For	 example,  dry	wall
fillers	 (sparkling) contain asbestos in the  United  States
but  not the United Kingdom; thus sanding of internal  walls
during construction and maintenance is a source of  exposure
in  the	 former	 but  not  in  the  latter.   On  the  other
hand,spraying of crocidolite was much more widespread in the
1940s in the United Kingdom that elsewhere.
(5)  Pleural  plaques  can  arise  at  levels  of   exposure
probably much lower that required to produce asbestosis.  In
addition  it  is  probable that	 other	minerals  can  cause
plaques.   For example, among chryosotile miners  in  Quebec
calcified  plaques are limited to those who have  worked  in
two out of the eight mines.The minerals causing the  plaques
in  general  population	 have not  been	 fully	established.
Tremolite,  an	amphibole  often  present  in  deposits	  of
asbestos, may be important.
</p><p id="p_50">(6)  Whether   chrysotile  and	the  amphiboles	 differ	  in
fibrogenicity  in  man	is  uncertain,	but  some   evidence
indicates  that the amphiboles may be more  fibrogenic.	  In
animals there is little difference but the amphiboles remain
in the lung much longer than the chrysotile.
The  relation of asbestosis to dose of dust  In only  a	 few
instances are there records of past dust sampling to  relate
to  the	 prevalence  or incidence of  asbestosis.   But	 the
information  has been exhaustively analysed for	 miners	 and
millers in Quebec, a group of asbestos cement workers in the
United	States	and asbestos textile workers in	 the  United
Kingdom,  because of its relevance to setting hygiene  stan-
dards.	 In North America the dust was measured in  millions
of  particles/ft3, in the United Kingdom in fibres/cm3	 the
measurement now international used.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">650</span>
<p id="p_51">All the data show a clear relation between estimated dose of
dust (concentration x time of exposure) and the incidence or
severity  of  disease,	but are	 insufficiently	 precise  to
determine  whether  there is a threshold level	below  which
asbestosis  will not occur.  A cautious conclusion from	 the
North  American	 studies  is  that  at	about  100   million
particles/ft3/yr there might be a threshold or that the risk
of developing asbestosis would be as low as 1% of men  after
40 years' exposure could be as WWI as 1.1 fibres/cm3 or	 may
have  to  be  as  low  as  0.3	fibres/cm3".   More  precise
information  will  only	 become	 available  when  the	dust
sampling introduced widely after the mid-1960s is related to
the incidence of disease in the future.
</p><p id="p_52">The  relation of asbestosis to lung cancer -  The  important
questions  here	 are: firstly, is there an  excess  risk  of
bronchial cancer only in those who also have some degree  of
asbestosis?  Secondly, if the dust exposures are low  enough
to  eliminate asbestosis, will the excess lung	cancer	risk
also  be  reduced  to  an  acceptably  low  level?   Neither
question can be answered at present, and so disagreement  is
likely.	  It  is  known that there is  a  close	 association
between asbestosis and lung cancer, about 50% of those dying
from  or with asbestosis have a lung cancer at post  mortem.
Among those knowledgeable about details of the dose-response
data  there would probably be agreement that dust  exposures
low enough to eliminate asbestosis will also reduce the	 ex-
cess  bronchial cancer risk to a very low value.  This	does
not extend to the risk to a very low value.  This nearly  so
closely	  related  to  that  of	 asbestosis  (see   ASBESTOS
(MESOTHELIMO AND LUNG CANCER).
</p><p id="p_53">PREVENTION -
</p><p id="p_54">This  depends  on successful control of	 dust  exposure	 and
medical surveillance to protect the individual, as far as is
possible,  and	for  the detection of health  trends  in  be
group.
</p><p id="p_55">Engineering  control  -	 Replacement of	 asbestos  by  other
material believed to be safer has been widespread since	 the
mid1970s.   Man-made  mineral fibres  and  other  insulating
materials   are	  rapidly  replacing   asbestos	  for	heat
insulation.   But for other uses, for example, asbestos	 ce-
ment,	friction  material  and	 some  felts  and   gaskets,
substitution is not at present practicable.
Dust  control  has  been gradually improved  by	 partial  or
complete  enclosure of plants and the wide use of  well	 de-
signed local exhaust ventilation.  In the textile section  a
completely new wet process of forming the thread has greatly
reduced dust level, previously difficult to control.  During
maintenance work on old insulation much stricter control  of
exposures is possible by isolation of the working areas, and
by  training in the use of good working practices to  reduce
the  dust,  for	 example damping of  the  insulation  before
removal and the use of vacuum cleaning in place of sweeping.
But  removal of old insulation is likely to remain for	many
years  a major potential source of high exposure  (see	also
DUST CONTROL INDUSTRIAL.
</p><p id="p_56">Medical surveillance  The insidious onset of asbestosis	 and
the  lack of highly specific features indicate the need	 for
well   recorded	 and  systematic,  initial,   and   periodic
examinations  of  asbestos workers.  This ensures  the	best
chance	 of   detecting	 the   earliest	  signs.    Physical
examination of the chest, full-sized, high technical quality
chest radiographs and test of FVC and FEV1-0 are the minimum
required.   The interval will vary from annually up to	four
times  yearly,	with  more frequent visits  when  there	 are
clinical  reasons.   There is increasing evidence  that	 the
radiological

features   of  asbestosis  are	in  part   cigarette-smoking
dependent which requires the recording of smoking histories.
This  and  the multiplicative effects of asbestos  dust	 and
cigarette  smoking on the risk of bronchial  cancer  provide
the strongest possible grounds for stopping cigarette  smok-
ing  in	 those potentially exposed  to	asbestos.   Personal
advice	on  the	 special dangers  of  smoking  and  limiting
opportunities  for  smoking at work are essential  steps  in
prevention.   Full  personal protective	 equipment  will  be
required where dust levels cannot be lowered to the  hygiene
standard.    The  system  of  periodic	 examinations	also
provides, if properly analysed, essential information  about
the  effectiveness or failure of the engineering control  of
the dust.  Tabulation, by age and years of exposure, of	 the
results	 of  classifying  the chest films on  the  ILO	1980
scheme	preferably  by	independent  readers   gives   early
evidence  of trends in the prevalence of  asbestosis.	This
valuable  information will be missed if the  group  findings
are not examined in detail.
</p><p id="p_57">Treatment:-
</p><p id="p_58">There  is no specific treatment for asbestosis.	  Where	 the
rate of progression appears unusually rapid further  special
investigations,	 including lung biopsy, may be justified  if
it  is likely to assist in the differential  diagnosis,	 and
influence  treatment  for example the use of  steroids,	 but
these  are  not	 of  proved value.   The  severity  of	past
exposure  is the only factor known to influence	 progression
rate.	Thus,  those with some evidence	 of  asbestosis,  if
young	or  middle-aged	 should	 be  removed  from   further
exposure.   In cases where exposure has not been  heavy	 and
asbestosis  is only detected late in life,, progression	 may
be very slow and the grounds for removal from work with	 as-
bestos,	 under	good  conditions,  are	less  compelling.The
widespread  and	 often	misleading publicity  given  to	 the

those  with  asbestosis, both for their own health  and	 for

of   good  treatment.	The  special  risks  of	  continuing

<p id="p_60">ASBESTOS (mesothelioma and lung cancer)
While  pulmonary  fibrosis  due	 to  exposure  to   asbestos
(asbestosis)  has been known for decades, the first  reports
of  individual cases of asbestosis combined  with  pulmonary
cancer which appeared from time to time in various countries
were accepted more as a curiosity.  They Id not attract much
attention  untill  in  1947 a  British	Chief  Inspector  of
Factories, E.R.A. Merewether, reported that lung cancer	 was
found to be the cause of death in 13.2% of persons known  to
have asbestosis who had died and been autopsied between 1923
and  1946.   A similar high proportion of cancer  deaths  in
asbestosis   was  found	 by  other  pathologists   and	 the
probability   of   a   role   of   asbestos   in   pulmonary
carcinogenesis	  was	definitely   established    by	  an
epidemiological	 study	by Doll in 1955,  and  confirmed  by
further studies.
</p><p id="p_61">Soon afterwards a new surprising discovery was made in South
Africa.	 An accumulation of cases of an otherwise very	rare
tumour	 of  the  pleura  and  peritoneum,   the   malignant
mesothelioma, was reported by Wagner in 1959 and related  to
exposure to the locally mined type of asbestos, crocidolite.
Soon  afterwards cases were identified in  non-mining  occu-
pational  exposures  to asbestos in England, in	 the  United
States and elsewhere. In  contrast with asbestosis, and in
contrast    with    asbestos-related	pulmonary    cancer,
mesothelioma  was found	 also in persons whose exposure	 was
not necessarily occupational.
</p><p id="p_62">Bronchogenic carcinoma related to asbestos: -
Bronchogenic  carcinoma of the lung.There is a disease	very
in  the	 general population.  While in	many  countries	 the
total mortality from cancer slowely declines, the  incidence
and  mortality from lung cancer increases and stands as	 the
most  frequent cause of death from cancer,  particularly  in
cigarette  smokers.   It begins with transformation  of	 the
mucous membrane lining the inside of the bronchus at various
level  and such foci of transformation may remain  at  their
initial	 spot  for some time shedding at times	atypical  or
metaplastic  cells  into the sputum  without  causing  other
symptoms.   This  is the period in which  we  sometimes	 may
succeed in discovering these pre-cancerous, or the  earliest
cancerous,  changes by sputum cytology sooner than by  other
diagnostic methods.  Some of such early alterations of cells
is  reversible	and may spontaneously heal  when  the  cause
disappears,  e.g. when the person stops smoking.   When	 the
original  focus	 develops definite cancer cells,  the  focus
begins	to grow, to bleed and slowly to obstruct the way,  a
growing	 malignant tumour becomes visible on  the  radiogram
and  unless  it	 can  be  surgically  removed  as  soon	  as
confirmed,  it	tends to spread through growth	and  through
dissemination  by blood and by lymph and to lead  eventually
to   death.   Supporting  treatment  by	  chemotherapy	 and
radiation successfully prolongs life and radical surgery can
provide complete healing.
</p><p id="p_63">The  various components of the bronchial lining may  undergo

examination.	Some  scientists  believe   that   so-called
"asbestos lung cancer" can only develop on a  pathologically
changed	 terrain of asbestotic fibrosis.  There is  evidence
of  such a possibility in human pathology:  the	 scar-carci-
noma.	Others	believe that exposure  to.  asbestos  alone,
particularly  in  a  smoker, may  provoke  cancerous  growth
without	 also causing asbestosis.  The decision between	 the
two  opinions  is difficult to reach because  in  individual
clinical  cases	 of bronchogenic carcinoma  we	cannot	dis-
tinguish  what is an "asbestos cancer", a "ciprette  cancer"
or lung cancer from yet another cause.	Thus, in most  coun-
tries  bronchogenic carcinoma is considered an	occupational
disease	 due to asbestos, e.g. for  workmen's  compensation,
only in the presence of coexisting asbestosis.	If pulmonary
fibrosis  were a prerequisite for development  of  asbestos-
linked lung cancer, it would follow that lowering  exposures
to  asbestos to levels which effectively prevent  asbestosis
would automatically eliminate "asbestos lung cancer".
Epidemiological data
In man the link of lung cancer with asbestos has been mainly
epidemiological.  while asbestosis cannot occur without	 ex-
posure to asbestos mad consequenty every case of asbbestoses
must  be linked with such exposure, with  pulmonary   cancer
the  situation	is quite different.  It is a  rather  common
disease	 in the general population.  The link with  exposure
to asbestos is based on finding whether in those exposed  to
asbestos  is  based on finding whether in those	 exposed  to
asbestos  bang cancer occurs more frequently than  in  those
unexposed, i.e. whether in those exposed there is an  excess
incidence of lung cancers.
</p><p id="p_66">Since Doll's study a number of other epidemilogical studies,
of various levels of excellence, have been carried out which
confirm	 that  indeed  there is an  excess  of	bronchogenic
carcinoma  in  persons exposed to  asbestos,  under  certain
circumstances, and thus that asbestos must be considered one
of a number of carcinogenic substance.
</p><p id="p_67">What  are the circumstances of a manifest risk of cancer  in
asbestos  exposure?   It has been established  that  smoking
cigarettes  greatly increases this risk.  In fact the  large
majority  of  lung cancers attributed to  asbestos  exposure
have  occurred	in smokers.  A lung cancer in  an  asbestos-
exposed	 non-smoker  has been a rarity.	 Table 1  shows	 the
effect	of  both exposures together while each	of  the	 two
exposures  also	 carries  a risk by  itself.   A  particular
exposure  to  asbestos	in the	reported  group	 of  workers
increased the basis risk of pulmonary cancer in	 nonsmokers.
However,  since the risk in nonsmokers was very	 small,	 its
further increase still meant only very few cases, if any  at
all.  On the other hand, when the basic risk of exposure  to
asbestos  was combined with the 11. 8 time higher risk of  a
smoker, this combination necessarily produced a serious risk
leading to an excess of incidence of pulmonary cancer.	This
experience  has	 an important  practical  implication:	most
"asbestos  cancers of the lungs" could be prevented  if	 the
workers	 did not smoke.	 In fact it was found that the	risk
for  the asbestos workers who had stopped  smoking  declined
after 10 years to the low level existing for non-smokers.
The bronchogenic carcinoma has a long latent period, usually
20 years or more.  Consequently, what excesses of  incidence
of pulmonary carcinoma linked with asbestos have been  found
to  date  must	be linked with exposures 20  years  or	more
development  of the tumour.  It is known that  exposures  in
those days
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">654</span>
were  generally very high.  But we usually do not  have	 any
precise measurements.  Thus in most existing epidemiological
studies	 it has not been easy, and in some not possible,  to
establish  a relation between the incidence of cancer and  a
certain quantitative level of exposure, other than that	 the
exposure had been high.

Castleman at p. 10 had stated that Dr. Merewether  following
the  diagnosis by Homburter in his co-incidence	 of  Primary
Carcinoma  at  EC Lungs and Pulmonary Asbestos	1943  stated
that  fibrosis	of  the lungs as it  occurs  among  asbestos
workers	 as the slow growth of fibrous tissue (scar  tissue)
between the air cells of the lungs wherever the inhaled dust
comes to rest.	While new fibrous tissue is being laid	down
like  a	 spider's  web,	 that  deposited  earlier  gradually
contracts.   This  fibrous tissue is not only useless  as  a
substitute for the air cells, but with continued  inhalation
of the causative dust, by its invasion of new territory	 and
consolidation  of  that already occupied it  gradually,	 and
literally strangles the essential tissues of the lungs.	  In
Malignant  Mesothelioma in Norway by Gunnar Mowe, 1986	Ed.,
he stated at p.8 on Aetiology of malignant mesothelioma that
in  1943, Dr. Wedler reviewed malignancies in 30  asbestosis
cases  in  Germany,  and suggested  a	 casual	 association
between	  asbestosis  and  both	 bronchial   and   malignant

all  the  main	types of asbestos  fibres  were	 capable  of
producing  mesotheliomas  in  rats  after  intrapleural	  or
intraperitoneal installation.  In the same page in para 2.2,
he  stated  that the importance of asbestos  fibre  size  in
explaining  the	 biological effects of	asbestos  was  first
emphasized  by	Timbrell  in 1965.  At p. 14  in  para	3.2,
caption	  lung	fibre  burden, he  stated  that	 lung  fibre
burden,	 which	is defined as the total content	 of  mineral
fibres in the lungs, depends on external asbestos  exposure.
At  pA 5 in Table 5, Biological effects of  natural  mineral
fibres	(asbestos  related diseases), he  stated  that	long
latency time from first exposure until onset of disease is a
typical feature of all the asbestos related diseases.  At p.
16  in	para  3.4, he stated that among	 948  patients	with
malignant mesothelioma, 65% were pleural, 24% peritoneal and
11%  pericardial.   At p.21, lung fibre analysis  under	 the

lung  tissue samples- for fibre analysis were obtained	from
twelve,	 pathology departments the analysis samples from  85
men  and 13 women disclosed the malignant mesothelioma.	  At
p.25, summary of his results in Paper V, he stated that	 the
median	latency time from the first year of  exposure  until
death was 35 years (range-18-53), and the median time inter-
val  from  last year of exposure until death  was  14  years
(range:	 upto  40  years).   At p.32,  he  stated  that	 the
estimated  proportion of-men with at least possible  occupa-
tional asbestos exposure were 82%.  At p.40, he stated	that
strict	regulations and effective control of such  work	 are
vital  in order to prevent asbestos related cancers  in	 the
future.	  At p. 41 in para 4, he stated that high  amphibole
concentration in lung tissue increases the risk of malignant
mesothelioma considerably.  Asbestos exposure  corresponding
to  only one million fibres per g. of dried lung  tissue  is
also  associated with increased risk.  In Blannie S.  Wilson

cannot	be  ascertained	 by absolute  standard	which  keeps
changing  depending upon the time, place  and  circumstance.
The  constitutional concern of social justice as an  elastic
continuous  process is to accord justice to all sections  of
the  society  by providing facilities and  opportunities  to
remove	handicaps and disabilities with which the poor	etc.
are  languishing  to secure dignity of	their  person.	 The
Constitution,  therefore,  Mandates  the  State	 to   accord
justice to all members of the society in all facets of human
activity.  The concept of social justice embeds equality  to
flavour	 and  enliven practical content of  'life'.   Social
justice and equality are complementary to each other so that
both   should  maintain	 their	vitality.   Rule   of	law,
therefore, is a potent instrument of social justice to bring
about equality in results.

depriving a person of his right to life would be to  deprive
him  of his means of livelihood to the point of	 abrogation.

existence  but also robust health and vigour  without  which
worker	would lead life of misery.  Lack of  health  denudes
his livelihood.	 Compelling economic necessity to work in an
industry  exposed  to  health hazards due  to  indigence  to
bread-winning  to himself and his dependents, should not  be
at  the	 cost  of  the health and  vigour  of  the  workman.
Facilities  and	 opportunities, as enjoined in	<a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_48">Article	 38</a>,
should	be  provided to protect the health of  the  workman.

health of the worker for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">660</span>
higher	 production   or   efficient   service.	   Continued
treatment, while in service or after retirement is a  moral,
legal  and constitutional concomitant duty of  the  employer
and the State.	Therefore, it must be held that the right to
health and medical care is a fundamental right under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_49">Article

of  the	 health	 and strength of the  worker  is  a  minimum
requirement  to enable a person to live with human  dignity.
The  State, be it Union or State government or an  industry,
public or private, is enjoined to take all such action which
will  promote  health, strength and vigour  of	the  workman
during the period of employment and leisure and health	even
after  retirement as basic essentials to live the life	with
health and happiness.  The health and strength of the worker
is  an	integral  facet of right to  life.   Denial  thereof

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_50">Art.21.</a>	  The  right  to  human	 dignity,   development	  of

recognised.   The socio-economic objectives set out in	Part

company	 as a living vital and dynamic social organism	with
firm  and  deep	 rooted affiliations with the  rest  of	 the
community in which it functions.  It would be wrong to	look
upon it as something belonging to the shareholders." It	 was
further held that "it is not only the shareholders who	have
supplied capital who are interested in the enterprise  which
is being run by a company but the workers who supply  labour
are  also equally, if not, more interested because  what  is
produced  by the enterprise is the result of labour as	well
as  capital.   In  fact, the owners  of	 capital  bear	only
limited	 financial risk and otherwise contribute nothing  to
production  while  labour contributes a major share  of	 the
product.   While  the  former invest only a  part  of  their
moneys,	 the  latter invest their sweat and  toil,  in	fact
their  life itself.  The workers, therefore, have a  special
place in a socialist pattern of society.  They are not	mere
vendors	 of toil, they are not a marketable commodity to  be
purchased  by the owners of capital.  They are producers  of
wealth as much as capital  nay very much more.	They  supply
labour without which capital would be impotent and they,  at
the  least, equal partners with capital in  the	 enterprise.
Our constitution has shown profound concern for the  workers
and  given  them a pride of place in the  new  socioeconomic
order envisaged in the Preamble and the Directive Principles
of  State  Policy.   The  Preamble  contains  the   profound
declaration  pregnant with meaning and hope for millions  of
peasants  and workers that India shall be a socialist  demo-
cratic	republic  where	 social and  economic  justice	will
inform all the institutions of national life and there	will
be  equality  of status and opportunity for  all  and  every
endeavour  shall be made to promote fraternity ensuring	 the
dignity of the individual.  " In that case, the question was
whether the labour is entitled to be heard before a  company
is closed and liquidator is appointed.	In considering	that
question  vis-a-vis <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_57">Article 43-A</a> of the	 constitution,	this
Court, per majority, held that they are entitled to be heard
before	appointing a liquidator in a winding up	 proceedings
of the company.

the  right to life meaningful; to prevent pollution of	work
place;	protection  of the environment;	 protection  of	 the
health	of  the workman or to preserve free  and  unpolluted

compensation  in  proceedings under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_65">Article 32</a> or 226  is  a
remedy	available in public law.  <a href="/doc/810491/" id="a_66">In Rudul Sah v.  State  of

available  to  enforce the right and money  claim  could  be

available  under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_69">Article 32</a> or 226 for the  enforcement	 and
protection of fundamental and human rights.  The defence  of

AIC  have  been	 following  the	 same.	 In  view  of	that
admission,  they are bound by the directions issued  by	 the
ILO referred to in the body of the judgment.  In that  view,
it is not necessary to issue any direction to Union or State
Governments  to	 constitute a committee to convert  the	 dry
process of manufacturing into wet process but they are bound
by the rules not only specifically referred to in the  judg-
