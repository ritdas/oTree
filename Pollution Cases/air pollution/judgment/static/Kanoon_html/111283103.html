(Hon'ble Justice Shri M. Chockalingam, Judicial Member)



    These appeals have been filed by the appellants herein challenging the order passed
by the respondent, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board ( for short ' Board' ) in each
of the proceedings in the appeals referred to above dated 29.07.2013, whereby closure
directions were issued to the appellants' units which are engaged in the granite cutting
and polishing activities in Byndahalli, and Kadabagare villages in Bangalore North under
<a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_1">section 33</a> (A) of Water (Prevention and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and rule 34 of
Karnataka State Board for the Prevention and Control of Pollution (Procedure for
Transaction Business) Rules and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules,
1976.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">    2. The case of the appellants in these appeals in brief is as follows:</blockquote>


<p id="p_2">    3. The appellants are running granite industries situated in Byndahalli and
Kadabagare villages, in Bangalore North Taluk in the State of Karnataka and are
engaged in granite cutting and polishing activities and the said process involves cutting
of large blocks of stone into thin slabs. The thin slabs are then polished. The appellants
have employed one machine for cutting of the blocks into slabs and another machine to
polish the slabs. The appellants have obtained necessary permission and general
license from Dasanapuram Gram Panchayat and also obtained Value Added Tax
Certificate from the Department of Commercial Tax. The Bangalore Electric Supply
Company Ltd., (for short 'BESCOM') has provided the electric power supply connection
to the units of the appellants to operate the unit. The said process does not involve any
air pollution and water pollution. The said unit is located at a distance of over 1 km from
the Arkavathi river bank. The respondent had granted consent for operation under the
Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">Water Act</a>') as per the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                         6</span>
 order dated 23.03.2013. The consent for discharge of effluents under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Water Act</a> was
granted on 23.03.2103 valid till 30.09.2013 subject to conditions in respect of appellants
in Appeal Nos. 98-101 of 2013 (SZ)


</p><p id="p_3">   4. The appellants have further averred that the units run by the appellants have set
up water recycling unit wherein the water used for the industrial process is completely
recycled. At the end of the recycling process, the granite sludge/effluent is stored in a
septic tank which is later transported to the common disposal site as specified by the
respondent at Sy.No. 2 Karigiripura, Tavarekere Hobli, Bangalore South Taluk,
Bangalore. The appellants have not violated any conditions imposed by the Board and
there were no allegations made by the public and no inspection is caused by the Board
alleging pollution being caused by the appellants.
</p>

<p id="p_4">   5. When the matter stood thus, the Board, based on the Government Notification
No. FEE 215 ENV 2000 dated 18.11.2003 and the Government order dated 12.01.2004
issued under <a href="/doc/728591/" id="a_6">Section 18(1)(b)</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 of the Government of
Karnataka (for short 'Government') chose to issue closure directions to the appellants'
industries on the ground that the appellants' industries are located within 1 km from
Arkavathi river bank, i.e., Zone-3 as per the Government Notification dated 18.11.2003,
where no industrial activity is permitted. The appellants' industries do not fall within
Zone-3 as per the Government Notification dated 18.11.2003. It can be seen that the
respondent having examined the same had granted the appellants necessary permission
to operate the industries as per the consent order dated 23.03.2013 which implies that
the appellants' industries do not all within Zone-3, where industrial activity is prohibited.
The appellants have further stated that opportunity of being heard was not granted to
them and no enquiry was conducted by the respondent/Board alleging pollution caused
by the appellant's units. No enquiry/inspection was caused by the respondent to hold
that the appellants' industries are located within in 1 km from the Arkavathi river bank.
According to the appellants, Zone-3 is the area covered within 1 km distance from the
river banks of Arkavathy only up to Hesaraghatta tank from Tippagondahalli Reservoir

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                                           7</span>
 (for short 'TGR' ) and Kumudavathi river and whereas, the appellants' industries are
situate at a distance of over 1 km from the river banks of Arkavathy and Kumudavathi
rivers. Hence, the appellants hold that their industries are not situate within Zone-3.
When the facts stood thus, the respondent/Board acting on the above Government order
has passed the impugned orders dated 29.07.2013 directing the appellants to close their
industries. Hence, the necessity arose to prefer these appeals before the Tribunal.
</p>

<p id="p_5">    6. The respondent/Board, per contra, in the reply has stated as follows:
</p>

<p id="p_6">   7. The impugned orders were passed on 29.07.2013 and on 2 nd September 2013,
the BESCOM officials have disconnected the power supply to the appellants' industries
pursuant to the directions issued by the Board. By suppressing this material fact, the
appellants have preferred the appeals herein. The closure directions were issued in the
wake of the Notification dated 18.11.2003 issued by the Government of Karnataka.
There was a statutory direction issued by the Government to the respondent/Board not
to issue consent in Zone-3. However, the officer-in-charge of the area had issued the
consents to the Applicants in Appeal Nos. 98-101/2013 (SZ), which were illegal and
would not confer any right to carry on industrial operation in violation of the said
directions. Further, the industries have not obtained consent for establishment while
establishing the industries. Even in the case of the said three appellants whose industries
have been granted consent by the Board, the period of validity came to an end on
30.09.2013.

<p id="p_7">   8. It is further stated in the reply of the respondent/Board that the lands in
Byandahalli and Kadabagare villages, in Bangalore North Taluk, where the appellants
have established the industries fall in Zone-3 as per the Notification dated 18.11.2003.
Therefore, the contention of the appellants that their industries are located beyond 1 km
away is absolutely incorrect and false. Under such circumstances, particularly when the
activity itself is prohibited, the appellants cannot run the same in violation of law. Further,
while seeking interim order, the appellants have suppressed the material fact that their

 industries are as if situated beyond 1 km and also suppressed/misled the fact of
disconnection of power supply on 2nd September, 2013 itself.
</p>

<p id="p_8">   9. The only question that would arise for consideration in all the appeals is whether
the impugned orders of closure issued to the industries of the appellants in the present
appeals are to be set aside for all any of the reasons putforth by the appellants and
whether the consequential directions to BESCOM is also liable to be set aside.
</p>

<p id="p_9">   10. Advancing the arguments on behalf of the appellants, the learned counsel for the
appellants would submit that the units of the appellants are granite cutting and polishing
units and one card board cutting unit which do not require consent for operation either
under Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 ( for short '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_10">Water Act</a>') or
Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (for short '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_12">Air Act</a>).and though 3 of the
units obtained consent from the Board, the same was not necessary since none of them
is causing air or water pollution, that the said orders of the closure were passed by the
authority without giving any opportunity of being heard and that consequential electric
power disconnection was also illegal. The appellants have set up water recycling units
wherein water used for the industrial process is completely recycled and at the end of
recycling process, the granite sludge/ the effluent is stored in the septic tank, dried and
transported to a common disposal site as specified by the respondent/Board. Thus, the
process followed by the appellants/industries did not cause any pollution to water or air.
The appellants have not violated any environmental law. No allegation was made
against the appellants/industries by general public at any point of time. No inspection
was caused by the Board on the ground of pollution being caused by the appellants. By
the orders of closure, number of workers, who were employed, have lost their jobs. The
respondent/Board has relied on the Government Notification No. FEE 215 ENV 2000
dated 18.11.2003 and Government Order dated 12.01.2004 issued under <a href="/doc/26991507/" id="a_13">section 18(1)</a>
</p><p id="p_10">(b) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_14">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_15">Air Act</a>, respectively on the ground that the industries of the
appellants are located within 1 km radius from the banks of the confluence of Rivers
Arkavathi and Kumudhavathi ( for short ' rivers' ) in which Tippagondahalli Reservoir (for
short ' TGR) has been built which has been the source of drinking water to the city of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                                          9</span>
 Bangalore and surrounding areas since 1930 which is shown as Zone-3 as per the
Government Notification dated 18.11.2003, where industrial activities are prohibited.
Questioning the vires of the Government order dated 12.01.2004, the learned counsel
would contend that the said Government order was absolutely illegal since the plan laws
cannot be directed to be implemented by the Board and that too by denying consent
under a statute meant for industries. Even as per the Notification of the Government
order, the Board was not an authority prescribed for implementation of the plan
regulation. A statute provides for grant or refusal of consent and the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_16">Water Act</a>s
cannot be repealed by an executive order. A direction for blanket refusal of consent for
violation of plan laws can only be a direction to enforce the planning law and not pollution
laws. The Notification was based on an aerial survey of the Indian Space Research
Organisation (ISRO) conducted in the year 2000 and has no relevance in the year 2013,
when settlements have grown by indiscriminately granting approval by the planning
authorities. The zonal classification was arbitrary. The Government of Karnataka has
constructed thousands of houses in the area in question under the housing scheme for
the poor and also a bus depot along with quarters for the staff of Karnataka State Road
Transport Corporation. It is pertinent to point out that though the closure orders were
given as if the industries of the appellants fall within Zone-3, the respondent/Board has
granted permission to operate the industries to 3 of the appellants who have filed appeals
in Appeal Nos. 98-101 of 2013 (SZ) to carry on the industries and the same was being
satisfied that the industries of the appellants were outside Zone-3. The appellants were
never given the opportunity of being heard as contemplated under <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_17">Section 21</a> of the
Water Act. A reading of the impugned orders would clearly indicate that they were not
speaking orders and did not contain cogent reasons. The impugned orders were passed
without application of mind. Before passing the orders of closure, neither an inspection
was made nor any notice was given, nor has the Board measured the pollution level
inside and outside the industries of the appellants. The respondents have caused a gross
violation of the principles of natural justice, since the appellants were not given an
opportunity of being heard to put forth their stand while passing the orders and thus, all
orders of closure and consequential direction for disconnection of electric energy are



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                                         10</span>
 bad, illegal, arbitrary and without application of mind an hence, all the impugned orders
have got to be set aside with permission to the appellants to run the units.
</p>

<p id="p_11">  11. Countering the above contentions with vigour and vehemence the counsel for the
respondent/Board would submit that all the closure orders given to the appellants to
close their units were in accordance with law. All the contentions put forth by the
appellants are meritless. The appeals in Appeal Nos. 105-113, 156-158 of 2013 (SZ)
have never obtained consent either to establish or operate which are mandatory under
the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_18">Air Act</a>s, while the period covered by the consent in respect of the
appellants in Appeal Nos. 98-101 of 2013 (SZ) came to an end on 30.09.2013 and they
were not renewed. It is pertinent to point out that the appellants in Appeal Nos. 98-101
of 2013 (SZ) obtained the consent by misrepresentation of facts and that can be termed
as illegally obtained. The Government of Karnataka, in exercise of powers conferred
under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_19">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 issued a Notification
classifying the entire TGR catchment area into 4 zones specifying the nature of activities
in the said zones. The Board has also prepared a map as found in Annexure-R3 wherein
Zone 3 specified the distance factor as 1 km from the river bank and the industries of
all the appellants have been established within the radius of 1 km from the river bank
and many of them even without obtaining consent for establishment. Some of the
appellants filed affidavits stating their industries are located in Zone-1 of TGR catchment
area Notification. On such information, consent was given on 30.09.2013, while the
industries of the appellants are located within Zone-3. The contentions of the appellants
that their industries are located beyond 1 km from the river bank is factually not correct
and thus, the directions issued by the respondent/Board for closure of the industries on
that ground was correct. Even assuming that some of the industries of the appellants
are located beyond 1 km, the granite cutting units cannot be allowed to operate in Zone-
4, since the granite cutting units are classified under Orange Category and only Green
Categorised industries can be permitted in Zone-4 and not the industries falling under
Orange Category.

<p id="p_12">  12. The learned counsel would further add that the contentions put forth by the
appellants' side in respect of validity of the Notification have to be rejected in view of
the decision of the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka made in W.P.No. 38162/2009
decided on 06.06.2011 which was also affirmed in W.P.No. 15928/2010. While issuing
the Notification dated 18.11.2003 and the Government order dated 12.01.2004, the
Government of Karnataka has taken a policy decision to protect and prevent any
contamination of water in the TGR keeping in view the Principles of Sustainable
Development and Precautionary Principle. Pointing to <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_20">Section 25</a> of Water Act, the
counsel would submit that no person shall establish or take any steps to establish,
operation or process or any treatment and disposal system which is likely to discharge
sewage or trade effluent without the consent of the State Board. In the instant case,
many of the appellants were carrying on with the industries without consent either to
establish or operate and some of them were carrying on by obtaining consent from
misrepresentation and the period covered by the consent in their cases was also over.
Any contravention of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_21">Section 25</a> of the Water Act is punishable under
<a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_22">Section 44</a> of the same Act. Answering the contention that no show cause notice was
given nor any inspection was made before issuing the directions for closure of the units,
the counsel would submit that under sub rule (6) of rule 34 of Karnataka State Board for
the Prevention and Control of Pollution (Procedure for Transaction of Business) and the
Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976 as amended with effect from
23.12.1983, the Board was of the opinion that in view of likelihood of grave injury to the
environment, it was not expedient to provide an opportunity to file objections against the
proposed direction, the Board can issue direction, since all the appellants have
established and were operating the industries illegally even without consent, it was not
open for them to claim any hearing and as violators of law, they could not ask for equity.
All the appellants by operating their industries illegally were causing pollution of water
in the TGR catchment area and under such circumstances, the directions for closure of
the units of the appellants were given which are to be sustained and hence, all the
appeals have got to be dismissed.

<p id="p_13">   13. The Tribunal paid its anxious consideration on the submissions made and looked
into all the available materials.
</p>

<p id="p_14">  14.   All these appeals concentrate on challenging the orders dated 29.07.2013
passed by the respondent/Board directing the industries of the appellants to close the
operations and process forthwith and further direction to the Bengaluru Electric Supply
Company Limited (for short ' BESCOM'), Bengaluru to terminate the electric power
supply to the industries of the appellants. The industries of the appellants were engaged
in granite cutting and polishing activities. Admittedly, only 3 of them obtained consent
and remaining 13 units did not obtain consent either to establish or operate. Even in the
case of the 3 units, who obtained consent to establish, these consents were valid till
30.09.2013 and these 3 units also operated without renewal of the consent. Thus, it is
an admitted position that as on the date of impugned closure order served upon the
appellants, all the appellants were carrying on without consent to establish or consent to
operate.

             Pollution Board is obtained, neither can the industry be
             established nor any steps can be taken to establish it. The
             learned Additional Solicitor General of India, Sri Trivedi is
             right in contending that the 7th respondent industry ought
             not to have taken steps to obtain approval of plans by the
             Gram Panchayat, nor for conversion of land use by the
             Collector, nor should it have proceeded with civil work in a
             installation of machinery. The action of the industry being
             contrary to the provisions of the Act, no equities can be
             claimed. The learned Appellate Authority erred in thinking
             that because of the approval of plan by the Panchayat, or
             conversion of land use by the Collector or grant of letter of
             intent by the Central Government, a case for applying
             principle of "promissory estoppel" applied to the facts of this
             case. There could be no estoppel against the statute. The
             industry could not therefore seek an NOC after violating the
             policy decision of the Government. Point 4 is decided
             against the 7th respondent accordingly.

<p id="p_19">  The very reading of the judgment of the Apex Court would make it clear that the
consent of the Pollution Control Board of the State is a condition precedent for
establishment of an industry or for taking any steps for establishment. Thus, it can well
be stated that all the appellants, were carrying on their units illegally, since they were

a resolution was passed to protect the ecologically sensitive area as a quantum and
quality of water supply from the TGR has direct impact on larger population of
Bangalore and necessity to protect the catchment area of TGR by preventing any
activity that would lead to contamination of the reservoir.        The Government of
Karnataka in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_36">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act,
1986, has issued a Notification whereby the entire TGR catchment area was classified
into 4 zones specifying the nature activities in each zone. The said Notification dated
18.11.2003 and a map prepared by the Board are produced as Annexure-R2 and R3.
From the Annexure-R2 and R3 it could be seen that Zone-3 is within 1 km radius from

accord any consent to any industry within Zone-3.

 principles of natural justice, cannot be countenanced for the simple reason that all

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">          " Though before issuing direction under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_44">Section 33-A</a> of the
          Water(Prevention and Control of ) <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_45">Pollution Act</a>, 1974, the Board is
          required to issue notice of proposed directions, in view of the
          sensitiveness of the area and also keeping in view the larger interest
          of the public who are depending for their drinking water from
          Thippagondanahalli Reservoir, and further, the area where you are
          operating the industry falls within the catchment area of the said
          Reservoir, notice of issuance of proposed direction is dispensed

<p id="p_25">   18. In the instant case, the appellants who have been carrying on their units in
violation of law without consent to establish or consent to operate cannot be allowed to
state they were not given opportunity of being heard before the issuance of closure
orders and the respondent/Board was justified in issuing the directions for closure in
view of the larger interest of the society who are depending for the drinking water from
the reservoir in question and the injury likely to be caused by the industries of the
appellants.
</p>

<p id="p_26">       20.    Yet another contention raised by the appellants' side that all the units of the
appellants are not situate in Zone-3 (i.e., 1 km from the river bank) and part of them
are beyond the said Zone is satisfactorily answered by the respondent/Board. Even
assuming the units of the appellants are situate beyond 1 km radius in Zone-4, the
granite cutting and polishing units cannot be allowed to operate in Zone-4, since they
are classified as Orange Category units and not categorized under Green industries.,
which alone can be permitted in Zone-4.
</p>

<p id="p_27">       21. Thus, all the contentions putforth by the appellants do not merit acceptance
and hence, they are liable to be rejected and accordingly rejected. The Tribunal is
unable to notice any infirmity in the impugned directions issued by the respondent/Board
for the closure of the appellants' units.
</p>

<p id="p_28">       22. Hence, all the appeals are dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_29">       23. Since all the main appeals are dismissed, the miscellaneous applications
filed by the appellants pending the appeals are also dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_30">       24. Pursuant to the orders of closure issued by the respondent/Board, all the
appellants have stopped the operation of their units. Though the units are not in
operation, it is an admitted fact that all the machinery and materials used by the
appellants and are kept within the premises have to be removed by the appellants for

all the machinery and materials along with the construction made by them for carrying
on the activities within a period of 3 months herefrom.
