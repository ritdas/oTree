</pre>

<p id="p_1">       The   grievance   of   the   petitioner   who   claims   to   have   been


conducting a Skin and Hide Collection Centre at Kurianad in Kottayam


District   within   the   area   of   the   1st  respondent-Panchayat   under   the


name and style of 'Pavackal Skin and Hide Collection Centre' for the


past   40   years   is   that   the   1st  respondent   is   refusing   to   renew   the


licence for the petitioner's unit  under one pretext  or the other at the


instance of the interested parties in spite of the renewal of   consent


by   the   Pollution   Control   Board   for   operating   the   same   upto


31.12.2007   as   evidenced   by   Ext.P1.   The   2nd  respondent   is   the


Secretary   of   the   Panchayat,   the   third   respondent   is   the   Pollution


Control   Board   and   the   4th  respondent   is   the   Tribunal   for   Local   Self


Government   Institutions.   The   petitioner   complains   that   though   his


unit has been in existence for the past 40 years, during the last five


years the petitioner is being obstructed in the conduct of the unit by


interested   parties   in   the   locality   exerting   political   pressure   and


influence   over   the   authorities   including   the   Pollution   Control   Board,


the   Panchayat   and   the   local   police.   At   their   instance   the   Pollution


Control Board  refused  to  renew  their  consent  for   operating  the  unit


subsequent to 31.12.2001. The petitioner had to approach this court


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.C.No.26246/06                                    -  2  -</span>



filing  two   Original   Petitions   for   obtaining  directions.   Notwithstanding


the   directions   of   this   court,   the   Pollution   Control   Board   refused   to


renew  the   consent.  The   decision  of  the   Pollution   Control   Board   was


challenged   before   the   Water   Appellate   Authority,   Trivandrum.   The


Water   Appellate   Authority   disposed   of   the   appeal   by  passing   Ext.P2


order   granting  opportunity   to   the   petitioner   to   apply   for   renewal   of


consent upon completion of the construction of an effluent treatment


plant.   The   1st  respondent-Panchayat   was   not   entertaining   the


petitioner's application for renewal of licence.  This the Panchayat was


doing at the instance of  interested parties. The petitioner approached


this court filing W.P.C.No.34147/05 which was disposed of by Ext.P3


judgment.   Ext.P3   judgment   directed   the   Panchayat   to   consider   and


decide upon the petitioner's application for licence within six weeks.


After   Ext.P3,   the   Panchayat   took   the   stand   that   the   application


submitted by the petitioner for licence was not in  proper form. Hence


the petitioner submitted a fresh application dated 17.2.2006, Ext.P4.


Along   with   Ext.P4   the   petitioner   submitted   Ext.P5   representation


dated   17.2.2006.   Thereafter   the   2nd  respondent   issued   Ext.P6


communication   to   the   petitioner   alleging   that   the   petitioner   is


conducting   the   unit   in   violation   of   the   relevant   rules   and   requiring


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.C.No.26246/06                                    -  3  -</span>



him to stop operation of the unit within 15 days and to show cause, if


any, against the  proposed action within seven days. The allegation in


Ext.P6   is   that   the   unit   was   being   operated   in   a   building  other   than


building No.1/47 mentioned in the application. It is contended that it


was   the   very   same   building   which   was   reconstructed   with   the


permission of the  Panchayat and that there are no other buildings in


that   entire   compound.   The   petitioner   points   out   that   on   the


petitioner's   application   dated   11.10.2004,   the   Panchayat   issued   an


order   No.M2.8/04   permitting   the   petitioner   to   reconstruct   the


building. The Panchayat instead of taking decision on the application


for  renewal   of   licence   as   directed  by  this  court   in  Ext.P3   judgment,


got the time-limit fixed in Ext.P3 extended. The petitioner alleges that


simultaneously,   at   the   instance   of   the   Panchayat,   Police   started


obstructing   the   petitioner   in   his   conduct   of   trade   relying   on   Ext.P6.


The   petitioner   approached   this   court   again   by   filing


W.P.C.No.14909/06 seeking directions against the Police. As directed


by this court the Pollution Control Board was also impleaded in that


Writ   Petition.   The   Panchayat   filed   a   counter   affidavit   in   that   Writ


Petition   claiming   that   they   had   already   taken   decision   on   the


application of the petitioner for licence on 29.4.2006. Ext.P8 is copy


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.C.No.26246/06                                    -  4  -</span>



of   that   decision   (which   had   been   produced   already   along   with   the


counter affidavit as Ext.R3(a). The petitioner points out that Ext.P8 is


a  concocted   document   as   will   be   clear   from   Ext.P6.   Ext.P8   decision


was   taken   by   the   Panchayat   Committee       behind   back   of   the


petitioner. The petitioner also points out that it is for the President of


the   Panchayat     to  take   a   decision   on   the   application   for   renewal   of


licence   and   not   for   the   Committee   as   per   Rule   6   of   the   Kerala


Panchayat Raj (Issue of Licence  to Dangerous  and Offensive Trades


and  Factories)  Rules.  Even   though  objection  was   taken   to  Ext.P8   in


that   Writ   Petition,   this   Court   directed   the   petitioner   to   challenge


Ext.P8 before the statutory authority and disposed of the Writ Petition


by   passing   Ext.P9   judgment.   Pursuant   to   Ext.P9,   the   petitioner


submitted   Ext.P10   appeal   before   the   Tribunal   for   Local   Self


Government Institutions. The Tribunal disposed of Ext.P10 appeal by


passing Ext.P11 order by issuing several directions. The first direction


is that the Committee of the Panchayat shall take a fresh decision on


the petitioner's application for licence after considering his application


dated   19.9.2005,   22.11.2005   and   17.2.2006   after   rendering


opportunity   of   being   heard   to   the   petitioner   and   other   interested


persons.   The   second   direction   is   that   petitioner   shall   stop   the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.C.No.26246/06                                    -  5  -</span>



operation of the Skin and Hide Collection Unit till a decision is taken


by   the   Panchayat     pursuant   to   direction   No.1.   Pursuant   to   Ext.P11


order   of   the   Tribunal,   the   Secretary   of   the   Pancyanat,   the   2nd


respondent has issued Ext.P3 notice to the petitioner preventing the


petitioner's   "unauthorised   storing  and  Tanning  of  Skin".  In  this  Writ


Petition   the   petitioner   challenges   Exts.P11   and   P12   to   the   extent


they restrains the petitioner from continuing with the conduct of his


Skin and Hide Collection Centre at Kurianad and for a declaration that


the petitioner is entitled to continue operating his unit subject to the


conditions   contained   in   Ext.P1   by   virtue   of     Section   236(3)   of   the


Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">         2. A detailed counter affidavit has been filed by the Panchayat


denying the averments, allegations and the grounds raised in the Writ


Petition and supporting Exts.P11 and P12 to which the petitioner has


filed   a   detailed   reply   reiterating   his   stand.   The   Environmental


Engineer   of   the   Pollution   Control   Board   has   filed   reports   on


15.11.2006   and  27.11.2006.  In  the   first  report   it  is   stated  that  the


Environmental   Engineer   has   conducted   an   inspection   of   the


petitioner's   unit   on   8.11.2006   for   verifying   the   compliance   with   the


additional   safeguard   measures   directed   to   their   effluent   disposal


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.C.No.26246/06                                    -  6  -</span>



system.   During   inspection,   the   unit   was   in   normal   function.   It   was


found   that   the   effluent   disposal   system   with   evaporation   technique


was seen functioning satisfactory. The additional safeguard measures


directed were seen complied with as:
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">i)   The   entire   waste   water   gets   disposed   off   through   evaporation


method.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">ii) Applying Sodium Hypo Chlorate and Ferrous Sulphate solution with


the waste water to eliminate odour problems during evapporation.


</p><p id="p_8">iii)   The   condensed   water   outlet   pipe   has   been   routed   back   to   raw


effluent collection tank and to avoid any condensed water discharge


from the sunit.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">iv) Provided  pucca  leak-proof  plat  form  with  sidewalls   to  collect   the


concentrated salt slurry obtained through evaporation of waste liquid


for re-use.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
It is further reported that the stock rooms and premises were seen


kept   clean.   No   significant   odour   problems   could   experienced   in   the


premises.   From   the   inspection,   it   is   not   anticipated   any   significant


pollution problems if the unit is working in strict compliance with the


consent conditions of the Board. In the subsequent inspection report


dated  27.11.2006,   the  first  report   is reiterated   and it  is  stated  that

during the  inspection  held on   8.11.2006  the  unit  was  open and  the


waste   water   disposal   system   was   in   normal   functioning   and   the


following observations made in compliance with additional measures


suggested:

<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">i)   The   changes   suggested   in   the   waste   water   disposal   system   has


been   complied   with   and   the   system   was   found   to   be   working


effectively.   The   condensed   water   outlet   has   been   connected   to   the


raw effluent collection tank for re-cycling.

The store rooms of skin and the premises of the unit were seen kept


clean.   No   significant   odour   problems   could   be   experienced   in   the


premises during inspection. In general the unit is found to be working


in compliance with consent conditions of the Board satisfactorily.

Dr.P.S.Krishna   Pillai,   learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   who   would


make   arguments   on   the   basis   of   the   grounds   raised   in   the   Writ

Petition. He   referred to Section 236(3) of the Kerala Panchayat Raj


Act,   1994,   Rule   6   of   the   Kerala   Panchayat   Raj   (Issue   of   Licence   to


Dangerous and Offensive Trades and Factories) Rules, 1996, <a href="/doc/1122308/" id="a_1">Section


60</a>   of   the   Water   (Prevention   &amp;   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control   of   Pollution)   Act</a>   and   the


various materials placed on record including Exts.P9, P6, P7, P8, P11,


P2   and   P5.   Dr.Krishna   Pillai   would   place   strong   reliance   on   the


judgment of the Supreme Court in  <a href="/doc/391843/" id="a_3">P.E.K.Kalliani Amma v. K.Devi</a>


(AIR  1996  S.C. 1963)  in support of  the arguments he  addressed in

the provision relating to deemed licence.

equally   emphatic   in   his   submissions.   Learned   counsel   would   refer


extensively to Ext.P11 order of the Tribunal and submit that this court


will not be justified in interfering with Ext.P11 in judicial review since


Ext.P11 is a well reasoned order. Continuance of the order directing


maintenance   of   status   quo   will   be   unjust   since   admittedly   the


petitioner is not presently having a current licence and his application


for  renewal of licence has only been directed to be disposed by the


Tribunal.   The   Tribunal   on   an   evaluation   of   the   entire   materials   was


satisfied that the petitioner should be restrained from conducting the

directed that as regards the conduct of the petitioner's unit by name


"Pavackal Skin and Hide Collection Centre", the status quo obtaining


as on 6.10.2006 will continue.

<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">         6. I have considered the rival submissions made at the Bar in


the   light   of   the   rival   pleadings   and   the   materials   placed   on   record.


The   submissions   of   Dr.P.S.Krishna   Pillai   that   Ext.P8   decision   dated


29.4.2006 was not taken in due course had some appeal since I feel


that if as a matter of fact a decision in the nature of Ext.P8 had been


taken   by   the   Panchayat   on   29.4.2006,   show   cause   notice   dated


2.5.2006 referring to the judgment in W.P.C.No.34147/05 as the first


item would not have been silent about   Ext.P8. But it is too late for


the   petitioner   to   voice   such   a   grievance   since   as   directed   by   this


court,   the   petitioner   already   preferred   Ext.P10   appeal   before   the


Tribunal   which   was   disposed   of   by   the   Tribunal   through   Ext.P11


impugned   order.   Dr.Krishna   Pillai's   argument     with   reference   to


<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">Section   236(3)</a>,   i.e.   provision   relating   to   deemed   consent   also   was


attractive   to   a   certain   extent.   But   those   arguments   also   cannot   be


accepted  in view  of Ext.P10  appeal and Ext.P11 appellate  order.  So

also it will be difficult to accept the argument of the learned counsel


that the Panchayat is bound to follow   Ext.P1 consent issued by the


Pollution   Control   Board     while   taking   a   decision   on   the   petitioner's


application   for   licence.     The   Pollution   Control   Board   is   certainly   the


statutory authority vested with powers to issue appropriate directions


for preventing and abating pollution related hazards and consents are


issued   normally   by   the   Board   only   when   its   functionaries   with


technical expertise are convinced that a given unit does not generate


pollution beyond permissible limits. But at the same time the power


of the Local Authority to take a proper decision on considerations of


public interest cannot be lost sight of  particularly in the  light of the


judgment   of   the   Supreme   Court   in  <a href="/doc/1314958/" id="a_5">Action   Council   v.   Benny


Abraham</a>  [2002 (2) K.L.T. 228 (S.C.) ]. But the Panchayat shall not


be   totally   unmindful   all   of   the   interest   of   the   entrepreneur     who   I


notice   is   an   octogenarian.   The   individual   citizens   right   to   carry   on


lawful avocations in accordance with law  should not be allowed to be


defeated   by   irrational   mass   protests     which   in   many   cases   may   be


based   on   mere   apprehensions.   I   am   not   inclined   to   interfere   with


Ext.P11  since  as rightly submitted by Mr.Mathew  John it will not be


proper  to  correct   a  fairly  reasoned  order  like  Ext.P11   in  exercise  of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">W.P.C.No.26246/06                                    -  11  -</span>



this court's narrow jurisdiction for judicial review under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of


the Constitution. I direct the Panchayat to comply with direction No.1


in   Ext.P11   immediately   and   dispose   of   the   licence   applications


referred  to in Ext.P11 after hearing the petitioner and anybody else


who   is   concerned   within   one   month   of   receiving   a   copy   of   this


judgment. As regards direction No.2, even as I do not find any reason


to   set   aside   the   same,   I   notice     the   consistent   stand   taken   by   the


Pollution   Control   Board   in   this   court   and   direct   that   the   order   for


directing maintenance of status quo which was passed by this court


on 6.10.2006 and is being continued will continue for a period of one


more month from today.
