(MANU ANAND MANAGING DIRECTOR Vs MADHYA PRADESH POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD
                        HEAD OFFICE BHOPAL THR.)


02-12-2015

Parties through their counsel.
Present petition has been filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for quashment
of the criminal complaint preferred by the
respondent- Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control
Board.
The contention of the petitioner is that he is a
managing director of M/s Cadbury India Ltd. now
known as Mondelez India Foods Private Limited ( a
Multinational Company). It has been further stated
that at present, he is posted at Mumbai as Managing
Director the the company.
Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> of the case reveal that on 14.08.2014, on
account of heavy rains, as alleged, certain effluents
have been found in the local drain and in the
industrial area outside of the factory and on an
allegation that the factory is discharging effluents,
alleged offence has been registered under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_2">Sections
43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_3">44</a> and <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_4">49</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
</p><p id="p_2">Learned senior counsel has vehementally argued
before this Court that keeping in view <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_6">Section 47</a> of
the Act, 1947, the question of impleadment of the
Managing Director, does not arise.
 It has been further argued that the company by a
resolution dated 23.05.2014 has appointed Mr. Jai
Kumar Nair as Factory Manager under the provisions
of â<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_7">Factories Act</a>, the Environmental (Protection)
Act, the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution
Cess Act</a>, the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution
Act</a> as well as for the purposes of other statutes.
He has further stated that present petitioner has
been falsely implicated in the matter as by no stretch
of imagination the liability can be fastened upon the
applicant keeping in view <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_11">Section 47</a> of the Act, 1974.
<a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_12">Section 47</a> of the Act reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       â47. Offences by companies.â

       (1) Where an offence under this Act has
       been committed by a company, every
       person who at the time the offence was
       committed was in charge of, and was
       responsible to the company for the
       conduct of, the business of the
       company, as well as the company, shall
       be deemed to be guilty of the offence
       and shall be liable to be proceeded
       against and punished accordingly:
       Provided that nothing contained in this
       sub-section shall render any such
       person liable to any punishment
       provided in this Act if he proves that
       the offence was committed without his
       knowledge or that he exercised all due
       diligence to prevent the commission of
       such offence.</blockquote>

<p id="p_3">       (2) Notwithstanding anything
       contained in sub-section (1), where an
        offence under this Act has been
       committed by a company and it is
       proved that the offence has been
       committed with the consent or
       connivance of, or is attributable to any
       neglect on the part of, any director,
       manager, secretary or other officer of
       the company, such director, manager,
       secretary or other officer shall also be
       deemed to be guilty of that offence and
       shall be liable to be proceeded against
       and punished accordingly.â
Keeping in view the statutory provisions of law,
 learned counsel has been able to make out a prima
facie case for grant of interim relief. Resultantly, it is
directed that the further proceedings in criminal case
No.434/15 pending in the court of Judicial Magistrate
First Class, Gohad shall remain stayed till the next
date of hearing.
</p><p id="p_4">Issue notice to the respondents on payment of P.F.
within a week, failing which the M.Cr.C. shall stand
dismissed without reference to this Court.
List the matter on 04.02.2015.
</p><p id="p_5">C.C. today itself.
