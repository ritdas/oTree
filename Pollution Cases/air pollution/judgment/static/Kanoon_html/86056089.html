                      ground water utilization, and thereby, they were also permitted to

                      draw 1.50 lakh litres of ground water per day from three bore-

                      wells. It is the further claim of the writ petitioner Company that

                      they have employed about 150 persons from the local village

                      residents in their plant. After some time, a revised agreement

                      political reasons, the writ petitioner Company was directed not

                      not draw any ground water on the pretext that the same was

                      the Hon'ble Mr.Justice M.Sathyanarayanan is a well considered

                      act, is not in order. In a case of this nature, Courts must endevour

</p><p id="p_78">                          18. Regarding the specific finding recorded by my learned Sister

                      Hemalatha, J. to the effect that the land in question is situated in a

                      Mixed Residential Zone, I am not able to concur with the same and

                      wish to agree with the findings of M.Sathyanarayanan, J. for the

                      reason that it is an admitted fact that when the Factory

                      commenced its production process, the Pollution Control Board,

                      inspected the factory and they noticed no irregularity and also

                      found that there is no harmful discharge of chemical, which is

                      prohibited or declared as hazardous. It must be pointed out that

                      the matter was remanded to the Authority for fresh consideration

                      only to decide as to whether the subject lands fell under “Mixed

                      Residential Zone” or “Controlled Industrial Zone”. In that regard,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                                       37</span>

                      as I referred to earlier, the learned Single Judge made it very clear

                      that   the   Secretary   to   Government,   Housing     and   Urban

                      Development Department, Chennai, among other things, shall also

                      evaluate the public perception / opinion in proper perspective to

                      ensure a balance between the rule of law and over bearing public

                      opinion with dispassionate mind. That being so, I fear that the

                      view taken by Hemalatha, J. may amount to pre-judging the

                      matter, since the issue regarding conversion of land from “Mixed

                      Residential Zone” to “Controlled Industrial Zone” needs to be

                      decided quasi-judicially based on broader facts and data by the

                      competent authority viz., the Secretary to Government, Housing

                      and Urban Development Department, Chennai. In other words,

                      any conclusion, in a case of this type, when the writ petitioner

                      Factory alleges political motives against Mrs.Saradadevi, President

                      of Suriyur Panchayat / R7 in W.A.(MD).No.976 of 2017, would
