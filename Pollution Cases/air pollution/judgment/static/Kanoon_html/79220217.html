 Mrs Purav for Respondent No. 2. We have carefully considered the
 Petition with its annexures, the Affidavit in Reply fled by the 3rd
 Respondent VVMC and the written submissions tendered by Mr
 Raiyani.
</p>

<p id="p_4"> 4.      The Petition relates to a development of plot bearing Survey
 No. 105(pt) and 106(pt) in Phadkal Street, Village Gokhivare,
 Taluka Vasai, District Thane.
</p>

<p id="p_5"> 5.      The facts of the matter run like this. Between 1988 and 1990,
 the planning authority for the Vasai Virar Sub Region, within the
 meaning of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act
 ("MRTP          Act"),        was   the     Mumbai       Metropolitan         Region
 Development Authority ("MMRDA"). On 14th May 1990, the 1st
 Respondent, CIDCO, came to be appointed as a Special Planning
 Authority for the Vasai Virar Sub Region. In 1992, CIDCO prepared
 a Draft Development Plan for Vasai Virar Sub Region. This was
 fnalised in 1995. It was then submitted in 1998 to the State
 Government for fnal approval. That approval was accorded in
 February 2007. The 3rd Respondent, VVCMC, was formed in
 2009. It took over charge as the Planning Authority in July 2010.
</p>

<p id="p_6"> 6.      The development on these plots (Survey No. 105 (pt) and 106
 (pt)) consists of two building of two wings each. This is a layout
 which was approved at the instance of the original developer, one
 RKfi Wadhwan. Petitioner No.1 appears to be a sub-developer. The
 approved plans were for two buildings called Type 'A' and Type 'B'
 (we will ignore the names given to these buildings to avoid



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     Page 4 of 14</span>
                                 27th September 2019




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">::: Uploaded on - 27/09/2019                            ::: Downloaded on - 28/09/2019 02:57:36 :::</span>
                                        La'builde Associates &amp; Anr v CIDCO &amp; Ors
                                                             ASWP11247-14.DOC




 confusion). The Type 'A' building has two wings, Wing 'A' and
 Wing 'B', of stilts and seven foors, with 56 fats. The Type 'B'
 building also had two wings, 'A' and 'B', is of stilts and seven foors,
 and also has 56 fats.
</p>

<p id="p_7"> 7.      The Affidavit in Reply fled by the 3rd Respondent, the
 VVCMC, indicates that there is an Occupation Certifcate granted
 on 24th August 2004 for the Type 'A' building (both wings). As far
 as the Type 'B' building is concerned, there is a part Occupation
 Certifcate dated 6th March 2007 issued only respect of Wing 'B' of
 the Type 'B' building. The Petitioners have since applied for an
 Occupation Certifcate of the remaining Wing 'A' of the Type 'B'
 building. In response CIDCO raised certain requisitions. It did so by
 its letter dated 13th July 2009 when it was still the Special Planning
 Authority for the Vasai-Virar Sub-Region. After the VVCMC took
 over as the Planning Authority of the Sub-Region in July 2010, the
 Petitioners made an application on 16th March 2012 for the grant of
 the remaining Occupation Certifcate.
</p>

<p id="p_8"> 8.      The frst difficulty, according to the VVCMC, is that the
 entire project continues to stand in the name of the original
 developer R. Kfi. Wadhwan and at no point has the name of the 1st
 Petitioner been entered on record. It is also asserted that the
 Petitioners' application does not comply with Section 44 of the
 MRTP Act and, hence, no letter was issued under Section 45 of that
 Act. The 3rd Respondent has only replied to the Petitioner and
 requested him to comply with the requisitions stated in the letter.
 Before we turn to the actual requisitions (as set out in the Affidavit
 in Reply), we must note Section 44 of the MRTP Act:

 the Affidavit from pages 114 to 116. There is an earlier show-cause
 notice of 8th November 2016 from pages 117 to 119. Both notices are
 addressed to Wadhwan. These notices are issued invoking <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_2">Section
 33A</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974

 Act</a> 1981 respectively. These communications seem to emanate from
 an application made by a journalist, one Pratik Thakur on 24th
 August 2016, following which there were reports by the Sub-
 Regional Officer on 11th November 2016. Exhibit "D" of 4th
 January 2017 (the date is incorrectly typed on page 114) refers to the
 previous documents of October to December 2016. It mentions that
 the MPCB consent has not been obtained and that the necessary
 water and air pollution control devices were not installed. The
 communication at Exhibit "D" records that the Board Officer
 visited the construction site on 25th October 2016 to investigate and
 noted that the construction activity had started without MPCB
 consent or environmental clearance. Construction of about 10 lakhs

 been allowed without permission, but at the same time there was no
 sewage treatment plant and untreated waste water was being
 discharged into the nearby nalla leading to the creek. There was no
 municipal solid waste treatment facility to treat solid wastes, and
 unsegregated solid waste was being disposed of in haphazard
 manner in the vicinity. No environmental measures like rainwater
 harvesting or solar energy had been installed. Wadhwan's
 representative was unable to produce documents regarding planning
 permissions from the local body, present air statement, FSI and non-

<p id="p_10"> 13.     What emerges from this Affidavit in Reply is that contrary to
 the assertions in the Petition there are several hurdles in the
 Petitioners' way. The frst is that there does not seem to have been a
 formal change of name of developer from Wadhwan to Petitioner
 No.1. This is not an idle formality. If the Petitioners seek, as they do,

 a grant of an occupation certifcate and other such reliefs, they must
 be able to show that they are entitled to these in their name. We are
 not concerned with the generalised allegations made in the Petition
 about of shortage of staf or manpower in the PWD department or a
 lack of provision of drinking water. Equally, we are not concerned
 with the allegations made in the Petition about the nature of
 hearings that the Petitioners may have attended. In our Writ
 jurisdiction we have only to see whether the Petitioners able to make
 out a case justifying our intervention. If the Petitioners seek a
 positive relief, as they do in prayer clauses (a) to (e), then the
 Petitioners must be able to demonstrate, frst, a legal entitlement to
 such relief; and, second, that there is no compliance yet due from
 the Petitioners. In paragraph 35, after a quite extraordinarily
 discursive narrative covering several unnecessary issues, the
 Petitioners say that the CIDCO's policy in levying a fre cess is
 arbitrary, unjust and unreasonable; that the water supply issue
 should be streamlined across the State. This is not something we
 can examine in this writ petition. The Petition appears to us to be
 unclear about whether it is raising a wider question as might be
 permissible in a public interest litigation. If this is in fact so, then the
 matter cannot be listed before us because it is not our roster or
 assignment. Mr Raiyani is clear that he is not arguing the present
 matter as a public interest litigation. If that be so, then we are not
 concerned with any larger or broader issue.

<p id="p_11"> 14.     It is no answer to a requirement of compliance with a
 municipal or statutory norms to say that it was not demanded while
 issuing a previous certifcate. Indeed this is a very risky argument to
 venture, because it would lead a Court to order the cancellation of

 the previous occupation certifcate rather than the grant of a fresh
 one.
</p>

<p id="p_12"> 15.     The written submissions from the 2nd Petitioner raise several
 distinct points. As regards paragraphs 3 to 5 of these written
 submissions, the fact that the plinth of an entire building was not
 earlier checked or that lifts were not inspected or in regard to
 portable water have no bearing on the specifc requisitions set out in
 the Affidavit in Reply. The Petitioners rely on a document at Exhibit
 "O" at page 61. That document is dated 25th June 2007 and is from
 CIDCO but this will not assist the Petitioners because it is clearly in
 respect of one wing of one of the two buildings. This does not mean
 that each wing does not need independent certifcation.
</p>

<p id="p_13"> 16.     In paragraph 6 of the written submissions that are allegations
 made against the previously serving Managing Director of CIDCO.
 We decline to go into these questions. This is not our remit under
 <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226.</a> If allegations of mala fdes are being made, they must be
 particularised.
</p>

<p id="p_14"> 17.     Then reference is invited to a notice under Section 80 of the
 Code of Civil Procedure 1908 ("CPC") at Exhibit "T", but that
 again does not mean that the Petitioner has been able to establish
 any legal entitlement to the relief sought.
</p>

<p id="p_15"> 18.     Then it is argued that CIDCO's insistence that the plinth of
 the building for which the occupation certifcate sought was to be
 completed in one year of the earlier commencement certifcate is

 arbitrary because this was not previously insisted upon. The
 submission need only be stated to be rejected.
</p>

<p id="p_16"> 19.     We cannot in exercise of our jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a> of
 the Constitution of India direct an authority to act contrary to law.
 This is also the case in regard to fre cess mentioned in paragraph 9
 of the written submission, where the Petitioners say that this
 demand was waived. We can issue no Mandamus directing such a
 waiver. We are not concerned with the generalised allegations in
 paragraphs 10, 11 and 12.
</p>

<p id="p_17"> 20.     The Petitioners insist that the building has been fully
 completed and had been so certifed by their Architect and therefore
 they should now be issued an unconditional occupation certifcate.
 We are unable to accept this submission.
</p>

<p id="p_18"> 21.     We are particularly dismayed by the wording of paragraph 17
</p><p id="p_19"> (vi) where the Petitioners say that their Affidavit in Reply are
 annexed some "irrelevant exhibits" and that "these are in Marathi
 which the Petitioner No.2 in person or his partners do not understand."
 We will not countenance any such argument about the official
 language of this State from any litigant before us. If the Petitioners
 are unable to understand Marathi then it is high time they took steps
 to do so. We also cannot fathom how they can conclude that the
 exhibits are 'irrelevant' if they cannot understand them. We are
 aware that the 2nd Petitioner has fled many public interest
 litigations in this Court, in some of which he may have succeeded
 but that does not give the 2nd Petitioner or any commercial frm

 with which he is associated in any capacity to make statements of
 this kind regarding the official language of the State.
</p>

<p id="p_20"> 22.     It does not also give the Petitioners the license to come to
 Court seeking that there private commercial interest be protected by
 this Court without insisting on compliance with statutory and
 regulatory conditions and norms. The 2nd Petitioner himself has
 been known to fle public interest litigations against non compliant
 constructions in this city, and to insist on strict compliance. We fail
 to understand how when it comes to his own project he can seek a
 waiver of even one condition.
</p>

<p id="p_21"> 23.     Throughout            the     petition,   no      ground     is    made       out
 demonstrating a legal entitlement. The only allegation is that some
 previous permissions and certifcates are given, and therefore there
 should be no insistence on compliance with current norms, nor levy
 or penalties or charges. The basis of this submission seems to be
 some form of estoppel by conduct against CIDCO and VVCMC.
 There can be no estoppel against a statute. What is being sought is a
 mandamus ordering a waiver from compliance with the law.
