(Order of the Court was made by P.  Sathasivam, J.,)



Since the issue raised in all these writ petitions is one and the  same,  they
are being disposed of by the following common order.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                2.   The  petitioner  in  W.P.No.35545  of  2004  is  a senior
Advocate and he seeks to  issue  a  writ  of  declaration,  declaring  <a href="/doc/1312751/" id="a_5">Section
4</a>(1-A)(a)  of  Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974, introduced by the
Tamil Nadu Amendment Act 27 of 1998, as amended by the <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_6">Tamil Nadu Act</a> 1  3  of   
2003,  by  substituting Schedule III, Part-I and <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_7">Section 3-A</a> levying Green Tax
in respect of vehicles mentioned under the Fourth Schedule of the  Tamil  Nadu
Motor  Vehicles  Taxation Act, 1974 as ultra vires and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_8">Article 14</a>
of the Constitution of India, in so far as it amounts to levy of life tax  for
new registration of vehicle of the petitioner is concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_9">3.   For  convenience,  we  shall  refer the case of the petitioner in W.P.No.
35545 of 2004:
</p>
<p id="p_10">                (a) According to  the  petitioner,  he  placed  an  order  for
purchase  of  SKODA  Car with Millinem Motors, Chennai, and the dealer gave an
invoice for Rs.11,00,000/-, being the cost  of  the  vehicle,  and  while  the
petitioner  approaching the second respondent for registration of the vehicle,
the second respondent insisted to pay life tax  of  the  vehicle  as  per  the
amendment  made to the <a href="/doc/1152907/" id="a_9">Motor Vehicles Taxation Act</a>, 1974, as amended by Act 13   
of 2003.  The proposed life tax would come to Rs.69,000/- as  per  the  latest
amendment of  the  <a href="/doc/1032324/" id="a_10">Taxation  Act</a>.  In contrast, annual tax payable by the said
vehicle is around Rs.1,000/-, which will account for  a  period  of  15  years
(life), not  more than Rs.15,000/- if paid annually.  There is a clear case of
expropriatory tax levied by way of  compulsion  in  respect  of  new  vehicles
registered  in  the  State  of  Tamil  Nadu  on  the basis of the value of the
vehicle, instead of the unladen weight of the vehicle as per  the  established
principles of  the Motor Vehicle Taxation.  Therefore, it has become necessary
for the petitioner to challenge the validity of the  amendment  of  the  Tamil
Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">(b)  Notwithstanding the above, the levy of a new tax called "Green Tax" under
Section 3-A of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, proposing  to  levy
an  additional tax in respect of vehicles specified in the Fourth Schedule for
Motor Cycles exceeding 15 years a sum of Rs.500/- and other vehicles a sum  of
Rs.1,000/-.   <a href="/doc/1312751/" id="a_11">Section 4</a>(1-A(a) read with Schedule-III, Part-I of the Tamilnadu
Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974, as amended by Tamilnadu Act 13 of 2003,  is
violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_12">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and beyond the competency
of State Legislature.
</p>
<p id="p_12">4.   Similar  averments have been made in the other writ petitions questioning
lifetime tax.
</p>
<p id="p_13">5.  Heard Mr.  K.M.  Vijayan, learned Senior  Counsel,  appearing  in  person,
Mr.R.  Natesan, and  Mr.  M.  Krishnappan, learned counsel for petitioners and
Mr.  N.R.  Chandran, learned Advocate General, Mr.  A.L.   Somayaji  and  Mrs.
Bhader Syed, learned Additional Advocate Generals for respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                6.  Mr.K.M.    Vijayan,  learned Senior Advocate, appearing in
person, has submitted that "Green Tax" for the object of eliminating pollution
is not enumerated in the entries either under List-I or List-II of the Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution of India.  The residuary power of Taxation  under
<a href="/doc/1018229/" id="a_13">Article  248(2)</a>  read  with Entry 97 in List-I enables the Parliament alone to
levy such "Green Tax" and it is therefore liable to be set aside for  want  of
legislative competency.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                7.   Regarding  levy  of  life  tax  for  new  registration of
vehicles, Mr.K.M.  Vijayan, learned Senior Advocate  and  Mr.Natesan,  learned
counsel for some of the petitioners, have raised the following contentions.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                (a)The  levy  of Motor Vehicle Tax, solely on the value of the
vehicle alone, is not sustainable.  The present Act which  levies  6%  of  the
total  cost  of  the  vehicle  as  life tax at the time of registration of the
vehicle will have no relevance or nexus in levying the life tax.  The same  is
arbitrary and beyond the leg islative competence of the State Legislature.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                (b)Inasmuch  as the Motor Vehicle Taxation has been held to be
compensatory and the present levy will cease to be compensatory  in  character
in so far as the levy is on the basis of the status of the owner or the nature
of  the  vehicle  or  on  the  basis  of  the  price  or value of the vehicle.
Therefore, the levy of life tax would be without jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_18">        (c) The levy is discriminatory, as it creates three different levy  in
respect of same class of motor vehicle which was used for a period of 15 years
(life).
</p>
<p id="p_19">(d)  <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_14">The  Act</a>  did  not  satisfy  the  test  of reasonableness, as there is no
justification for levying Rs.72,000/- for a period of 15 years  towards  motor
vehicle tax, when the same is paid annually works out to Rs.12,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_20">        (e)  Even  though  the  Supreme  Court  has upheld the validity of the
provisions introduced for levying "lifetime tax" based on "weightcum-value" in
the <a href="/doc/1152907/" id="a_15">Motor Vehicles Taxation Act</a>, under the Act 27 of 1998 , the Supreme  Court
did not decide the point relating to same category of motor vehicle used for a
period of 15 years, which suffered different rate of motor vehicle tax.
</p>





<p id="p_21">        8.   Learned Advocate General and Additional Advocate Generals met all
the points.  In so far as challenge relating to life time  tax,  it  is  their
contention  that the issue has been covered by a decision of the Supreme Court
in <a href="/doc/1497806/" id="a_16">STATE OF TAMIL NADU v.  M.  KRISHNAPPAN</a>, reported in (2005) 4 Supreme Court      
Cases 53.

<p id="p_22">                9.  Now, let us consider the challenge relating to "Green Tax"
imposed under Section 3-A of the Tamil Nadu Motor  Vehicles  Taxation  Act,  1
</p><p id="p_23">974.   <a href="/doc/1152907/" id="a_17">Section  3-A</a>  has been introduced by Act 13 of 2003 and came into force
with effect from 01.08.2003.  <a href="/doc/1152907/" id="a_18">Section 3-A</a> reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_24">        "3-A.  Levy of Green Tax:- (1) There shall be levied and collected  an
additional tax called "green tax", in addition to the tax levied under <a href="/doc/991785/" id="a_19">section
3</a>,  on the motor vehicles suitable for use on road, as specified in the Fourth
Schedule for the purpose of implementation of various measures to control  air
pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_25">(2)  The  additional  tax  levied  under sub-section (1) shall be paid in such
manner as may be prescribed. 
</p>
<p id="p_26">(3) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), the provisions  of  the  Act
and the rules made thereunder excluding those relating to refund of tax shall,
so  far  as  may  be,  apply  in  relation  to  the levy and collection of the
additional tax payable under subsection (1), as they apply in relation to  the
levy and collection of motor vehicles tax under this Act."
</p>
<p id="p_27">                10.   The  rate  of  tax  is mentioned in the Fourth Schedule,
which reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_28">"1.  Motor Vehicles other than a
transport vehicle which has
completed 15 years from the 
date of registration

</p><p id="p_29">(i) Motor Cycle Rs.500.00
(for five years)

</p><p id="p_30">(ii) Other Motor vehicles Rs.1000.00
(for five years)

</p><p id="p_31">2.  Transport Vehicle which has Rs.500.00
completed 7 years from the (per annum) 
date of its registration
(other than Autorickshaw)


</p><p id="p_32">11.  The only contention of the petitioners is that the State is not competent
to levy 'green tax', because the tax is levied for implementation  of  various
measures  to  control air pollution and according to them, it is a law falling
within the Union List.
</p>
<p id="p_33">                12.  It is the stand of the Government that the  tax  in  this
case  is  on  the  vehicle  using the road and the tax is collected on a motor
vehicle  suitable  for  use  on  road  as  specified  for   the   purpose   of
implementation of  various measures to control pollution.  This would not make
the pith and substance of the levy of the 'green tax' as a tax falling  within
the subject "pollution".  The incidence of taxation is on the use of the motor
vehicles on the road and the fact that the amount is collected to take measure
to  control pollution is only incidental and the tax cannot be considered as a
law on pollution.  For instance, if a person is disqualified  from  holding  a
post  of  President  of  a  Panchayat  on the ground that he is declared as an
insolvent, then it cannot be held that such restriction is a law on insolvent.
This is because it only prescribes a disqualification on a  president  who  is
holding an  office  under  the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_20">State Act</a>.  Even though the purpose is to take
measures in public interest to  control  prohibition,  but  still  it  can  be
imposed only on a vehicle which uses the roads in Tamil Nadu.
</p>
<p id="p_34">13.  This issue has been considered by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/833158/" id="a_21">STATE OF W.B.  AND    
OTHERS v.    PURVI  COMMUNICATION (P) LTD</a>., reported in (2005) 3 SCC page 711.      
In that case, an Entertainment Tax was levied on a multi system  operator  who
exhibits the film through Cable TV Network under a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_22">Central Act</a>.  This levy was
made  under  a  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_23">State Act</a>, namely, West Bengal Entertainment-cum-Amusement Tax     
Act.  It was contended therein that it  is  a  law  falling  under  the  Union
Legislation,  namely <a href="/doc/1776076/" id="a_24">Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act</a>, 1995 and that
therefore the State Government cannot impose any tax.  This plea was rejected.
The following discussion and conclusion are relevant:  (para 3 6, 37,  38  and
</p><p id="p_35">41)

        "36.   Therefore,  the respondents as a cable operator have direct and
proximate nexus with the entertainments provided by them through  their  cable
television  network  and,  as  such, they are the taxable person in respect of
their gross receipts in relation to any month for providing entertainments  to
the individual  viewers.    Therefore,  the  respondents  have  a  direct  and
proximate nexus with the entertainments presented to the viewers  inasmuch  as
in terms  of the respondent's agreement vide clause 4(d):  "Recording and then
retransmission of the signals by the franchisee is not allowed."  That  apart,
the  name  of every subscriber having connection with the respondent's network
must be on their records  and  the  franchisee  must  furnish  information  of
business honestly and completely to the respondents pursuant to clause 4(c) of
the said  agreement.    In the event, any charge received from a subscriber is
not paid to the respondent, the franchisee shall pay a sum equivalent to three
times of the amount that the franchisee has saved by not paying the  requisite
amount to the respondents in respect of such subscriber.
</p>
<p id="p_36">        37.  In our view, the respondents as a cable operator, for the purpose
of  levy  and  collection of tax under sub-section (4-a) of <a href="/doc/1152907/" id="a_25">Section 4-A</a> of the
Act have direct and close nexus with the entertainments made available to  the
viewer through  their  cable  television  network.    The performance, film or
programmes shown to the viewers through  the  cable  television  network  come
within  the  meaning  of  entertainments  and therefore within the legislative
competence of the State Legislature under Entry 62 of List II of  the  Seventh
Schedule to the Constitution to make law for the levy and collection of tax on
such entertainments.
</p>
<p id="p_37">        38.   A  tax  under Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution may be imposed not only on the person spending  on  entertainment
but also on the act of a person entertaining, or the subject of entertainment.
It  is  well  settled  by this Court that such tax may be levied on the person
offering or  providing  entertainment  or  the  person  enjoying  it.      The
respondents  are  admittedly  engaged  in  the business of receiving broadcast
signals and then  instantaneously  sending  or  transmitting  such  visual  or
audio-visual  signals  by  coaxial  cable, to subscribers' homes through their
various franchisees.  It has been made possible for the individual subscribers
to choose the desired channels on their individual TV sets  because  of  cable
television  technology  of  the  respondents  and  of  sending  the  visual or
audio-visual signals to sub-cable operators, and instantly retransmitting such
signals  to  individual  subscribers  for  entertaining  them  through   their
franchisees.    The   respondents  act  is,  no  doubt  an  act  of  offering
entertainment to the subscribers and/or viewers.  The respondent is very  much
directly   and   closely   involved  in  the  act  of  offering  or  providing
entertainment to the subscribers who are on his  record.    For  the  fact  of
offering  or  providing  entertainment  to the subscribers and/or viewers, the
respondents  receive  charges,  which  are  realised  or  collected  by  their
franchisee from  the  ultimate  subscribers.    Their  franchisee,  called  as
sub-cable operator under the said 1982 Act having no independent role to offer
or provide entertainments to the subscribers inasmuch as franchisees  have  to
depend   entirely   on   the   respondents'  communication  network  and  this
communication network of the respondents consists  of  receiving  and  sending
visual  images  and  audio  and  other  information  for  preparation  of  the
subscribers and/or viewers; without the communication network service  of  the
respondents,  no  entertainments can be offered or provided to the subscribers
and/or viewers.
</p>


<p id="p_38">        39.  In the tax matters, the State Legislature  is  free,  if  it  has
legislative  competence,  to  choose  the  persons from whom the tax levied on
entertainments is to be collected.  In other words, what  are  taxed  are  the
entertainments,  which is very much within the ambit of Entry 62 of List II of
the Seventh Schedule.  It is the respondents who as  cable  operator  for  the
purpose  of  the  said  198  2 Act are engaged in the business of providing or
offering entertainments which  include  showing  of  films,  various  serials,
cricket  matches  and dramatic performances to the subscribers, and the tax is
imposed on the act of  offering  such  entertainments  in  this  way  to  such
subscribers and/or viewers.  The entire communication network service is built
up and  controlled  by  the  respondents.    Whatever  amount  is  received or
receivable by the respondent in respect of  providing  such  entertainment  is
taxable  under sub-section (4-a) of <a href="/doc/1152907/" id="a_26">Section 4-A</a> of the said 1982 Act which has
a direct and sufficient nexus with the entertainment.
</p><p id="p_39">        40.  .....
</p>
<p id="p_40">        41.  We also see no substance in  the  submission  that  the  impugned
legislation impinges  on  the  field occupied by the Central legislation.  The
aforesaid Central legislation has been enacted to regulate  the  operation  of
cable  television  network  in  the country and matters connected therewith or
incidental thereto whereas the State legislation is for levy of  entertainment
tax  on entertainment within the legislative field exclusively assigned to the
State Legislature under Entry 62 of List II of the  Seventh  Schedule  of  the
Constitution.   Thus  the  objects sought to be achieved by two different Acts
enacted under two different legislative fields  exclusively  assigned  to  the
respective legislatures  are  entirely  distinct  and  separate.    <a href="/doc/1776076/" id="a_27">The  Cable
Television Networks (Regulation) Act</a>, 1995 of the Union Legislature  does  not
denude  the  State  Legislature  of  the power of levying entertainment tax on
entertainment."
</p>
<p id="p_41">                14.  Without prejudice to the above  stand,  learned  Advocate
General  and  Additional  Advocate Generals submitted that the assumption that
pollution law would fall within Union List and only the Central Government has
power to legislate law on that subject does not appear to be  right.    It  is
submitted  that the Supreme Court was concerned of the pollution caused by the
Auto- Rickshaws in  the  City  of  Delhi  and  therefore  directed  the  State
Government  to  make  it  compulsory  to  fit CNG Converters to use Compressed
Natural Gas in all public transport vehicles.  <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_28">In M.C.  MEHTA  v.    UNION  OF
INDIA</a>,  reported  in  1998  (8) SCC Page 648), the Supreme Court observed that
necessary subordinate rule or legislation should be  enacted  prohibiting  the
registration  of  any  public  transport  vehicle  to  ply  without  catalytic
converter.  This direction was issued to a registering authority and therefore
the law could be passed only by the State Government.  As a  matter  of  fact,
Karnataka  Government  has issued a notification under <a href="/doc/694875/" id="a_29">Section 67</a> of the Motor
Vehicles Act 1988 directing all Auto-Rickshaws to convert  into  CNG  vehicles
within a particular time.
</p>
<p id="p_42">                15.  There is no entry in Seventh Schedule to the Constitution
of  India  regarding  pollution,  but  the subject comes under Entry 6, Public
Health, which is in the State list.  Therefore, even assuming  the  law  falls
within  the  subject pollution, State Government would be competent to enact a
law under Entry 6 of List II of State List.  The submission  of  the  Advocate
General and Additional Advocate General are well founded.
</p>
<p id="p_43">                16.   It  is also brought to our notice that Water (Prevention
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_30">Control of Pollution) Act</a> was enacted by the  Central  Government.    But,
Central Government  has  no power to enact such law on the above subject.  Yet
the said Acts were enacted by the Central Government under <a href="/doc/1883579/" id="a_31">Article 249</a> of  the
Constitution  of  India,  which  enable  the  Union  to  legislate on National
interest even in respect of State list.  This is made clear from the  preamble
of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_32">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.  The preamble of
the said Act reads as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_44">"WHEREAS  it  is  expedient to provide for the prevention and control of water
pollution and the maintaining or restoring of wholesomeness of water, for  the
establishment,  with  a view to carrying out the purposes aforesaid, of Boards
for the prevention and control of water pollution and for  conferring  on  and
assigning to such Boards powers and functions relating thereto;
</p>
<p id="p_45">AND  WHEREAS  Parliament has no power to make laws for the States with respect    
to any of the matters aforesaid except as provided in Articles 249 and 250  of
the Constitution;
</p>
<p id="p_46">AND  WHEREAS  in  pursuance  of  Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_33">Article 252</a> of the Constitution
resolutions have been passed by all the Houses  of  the  Legislatures  of  the
States of Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir,   
Karnataka,  Kerala,  Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tripura and West Bengal to the 
effect that the matters aforesaid should  be  regulated  in  those  States  by
Parliament by law;"
</p>
<p id="p_47">                17.  From the above discussion, we conclude that,

                (1)  the Notification under <a href="/doc/941659/" id="a_34">Section 3(A)</a> is not a law relating
to Pollution Control.  It is a law pertaining to imposition of tax on a  motor
vehicle using Tamil Nadu roads which are old vehicles;
</p>
<p id="p_48">(2)  the fact that the amount recovered are used for implementation of various
measures to control pollution will not make the  pith  and  substance  of  the
amendment of the Act as one falling within Pollution;
</p>
<p id="p_49">                (3)  the  Supreme  Court  itself  has  directed that necessary
legislation and rules are to  be  issued  to  prevent  motor  vehicle  causing
pollution  and  such  direction should be issued to the registering authority,
which means that can be issued only by the State Government; and 

                (4) the subject 'pollution' falls under Entry 6 of State List,
namely "Public Health" and the Pollution Control  Legislation  are  passed  in
National interest  under  <a href="/doc/1883579/" id="a_35">Article 249</a> of the Constitution.  In fact, a law has
been enacted by the Central legislation in respect of Water and Air Pollution,
but it does not take away the power of the State Government  to  legislate  on
the above  subject.    The  power  is still available under Entry 6 of List II
State List, for State to legislate.  Accordingly, we  reject  the  contentions
raised by Mr.Vijayan, learned Senior Advocate, relating to "Green tax".
</p>
<p id="p_50">                18.    Now,  we  shall  consider  the  challenge  relating  to
"lifetime tax".  It would be useful to refer the relevant  provisions  of  the

<p id="p_85">19.  We have already referred to the challenge relating to imposition of  life
time tax  in  the  earlier  part of our order.  In reply to those contentions,
learned Advocate General as well  as  the  Additional  Advocate  Generals,  by
taking  us through the judgment of the Supreme Court, reported in (2005) 4 SCC

53, -(<a href="/doc/1497806/" id="a_41">State of T.N.  v.  M.  Krishnappan</a>), contended that  the  said  decision
covers all the contentions raised, including the validity of the life time tax
based on the value of vehicles.
</p>
<p id="p_86">                20.  It is the claim of Mr.K.M.Vijayan, learned senior counsel
as  well  as  Mr.Natesan,  learned  counsel  for some of the petitioners, that
though an argument was advanced contending that the levy of tax based on value
of the vehicle cannot be sustained, according to them, the said issue has  not
been dealt  with  by  the  Supreme Court.  Inasmuch as the main issue revolves
around the above referred decision of the Supreme Court, let us  consider  the
factual aspects, contentions raised and the conclusion arrived at therein.
</p>
<p id="p_87">                21.   The  question  that  arose  for  determination  in  that
decision was whether "lifetime tax" leviable in lumpsum in advance for  the  "
lifetime"  of  a  motor  vehicle  (four  wheeler) on the basis of the index of
"weight-cum-value" ceases to  be  compensatory  in  nature,  as  held  by  the
impugned judgment of this Court, dated 11.11.1999 in W.P.Nos.118 15, 15139 and  
others of  1999.    It  is  to  be  noted  that  before  this  Court, the writ
petitioners  sought  to  challenge  <a href="/doc/8820/" id="a_42">section   4</a>(1-A)(a)   read   with   Part-I
Schedule-III  of  the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974 as amended.
The first writ petition which was dealt with by this Court is W.P.No.15139  of
1998 filed by Mr.M.  Krishnappan.  The facts of the said case are as follows.
</p><p id="p_88">        (a) Mr.M.    Krishnappan, challenged the provisions of <a href="/doc/8820/" id="a_43">Section 4</a>(1-A)(
</p><p id="p_89">a) imposing lifetime tax on motor vehicles  to  be  registered  on  and  after
1-7-1998  being the date on which the amending Act 27 of 1998 came into force.
By the said amending  Act,  <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_44">Section  3-A</a>  as  also  the  aforestated  <a href="/doc/8820/" id="a_45">Sections
4</a>(1-A)(a),  (b)  came to be inserted in the said 1974 Act by which a dichotomy
was created between the vehicles registered prior to 1-7-1998  (old  vehicles)
and the  vehicles registered thereafter (new vehicles).  In respect of the old
vehicles, an option was given either to pay one-time tax or an annual tax, but
in the case of new vehicles no such option was provided for and  consequently,
it became  compulsory  to  pay  one-time  tax  on and after 1-7-1998.  At this
stage, it may be stated that the respondent-Mr.  M.Krishnappan, had purchased,
on 23-9-1998.  a passenger car "Tata Sumo", on payment of  Rs.5,25,45  1,  the
unladen  weight of which was 1700 kg on which he was charged a one-time tax of
Rs.20,540. 
</p><p id="p_90">        (b)  The  impost  was  accordingly  challenged  as   unconstitutional,
discriminatory,  arbitrary  and  violative  of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_46">Article 14</a> of the Constitution,
besides being inconsistent with the scheme of the 1974 Act.  The  main  thrust
of  the  challenge  was that the levy of motor vehicle tax was compensatory in
nature for the use of public road; that  the  wear  and  tear  of  such  roads
maintained  by  the  State had relevance to the unladen weight of the vehicles
and not to the value of the vehicle specified in Part I of the Third Schedule;
that the value of the vehicle cannot  constitute  the  basis  for  fixing  the
lifetime  tax and that such value had no relevance with the maintenance of the
roads and consequently the levy was arbitrary and  unreasonable.    The  other
incidental  contentions  were that by insertion of <a href="/doc/8820/" id="a_47">Section 4</a>(1-A)(a) read with
Part-I of Schedule-III to the Act, an inconsistency stood  introduced  in  the
said  1974  Act,  as  the pre-amended Act was based on the laden weight of the
vehicle; that the said parameter continued to apply  for  vehicles  registered
before  1-7-1998;  that the new index of "weightcum-value" was made applicable
only to new vehicles; that the said index had no  relevance  to  the  use  and
maintenance of the road, that the differentia between old and new vehicles had
no  nexus  with  the  wear and tear of the roads; that there was no difference
between the two types of vehicles in terms of user of the roads; and that  the
State  Legislature  had  committed  a  grave  blunder  in  introducing <a href="/doc/8820/" id="a_48">Section
4</a>(1-A)(a) making it compulsory for the registered  owners  of  the  new  motor
vehicles  to  pay  one-time  tax  resulting  in an unwarranted and unjustified
increase in the payment of tax.
</p><p id="p_91">        (c) In the counter affidavit, filed on behalf of the State,  the  levy
was  sought  to  be  justified  on the ground that w.e.f.1-4-1989, two-wheeler
(non-transport)) vehicle were made to pay " lifetime" tax at the time of their
registration by inserting an amendment to <a href="/doc/8820/" id="a_49">Section 4</a> of  the  Act,  as  <a href="/doc/8820/" id="a_50">Section
4</a>(1-A).
</p><p id="p_92">        (d)  In  view  of  the  success of "lifetime tax" for twowheelers, the
Government  decided  to  introduce   lifetime   tax,   without   option,   for
four-wheelers, like  cars and jeeps.  (See Statement of Objects and Reasons of
the amending Act 27 of 1998.) That option given to the said old  vehicles  was
continued  and  the  classification between old and new cars in the payment of
"lifetime tax" was based on an intelligible differentia, hence, there  was  no
violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_51">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_93">        (e)  By  the  impugned judgment, the High Court held that the impugned
amending Act 27 of 1998, which imposed the levy of lifetime tax based  on  the
value  of  the vehicle registered on and after 1-7 -1998 was inconsistent with
<a href="/doc/8820/" id="a_52">Section 4</a>(1-A)(b); that prior to the amending Act 27  of  1998,  the  tax  was
levied  only  on laden weight and not on the value of the vehicle which had no
nexus with the use of the roads; that by introducing the "value" as an  index,
the  tax has ceased to be compensatory and consequently, the levy fell outside
Entry 57 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, which in turn
attracted <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_53">Article 265</a> of the Constitution resulting in levy and collection  of
tax without the authority of law."
</p>
<p id="p_94">                22.   The  following  points were urged on behalf of the State
before the  Supreme  Court:    The  concept  of  collection  of  one-time  tax
incorporated  in  <a href="/doc/8820/" id="a_54">Section 4</a>(1-A(a) read with Schedule III (para I) of the 1974

of this  Court  in  the  case  of <a href="/doc/110034/" id="a_55">State of Maharashtra v.  Madhukar Balkrishna
Badiya</a> (AIR 1988 SC 2062).  It was urged that the index of  "weight-cum-value"
will not  make the levy lose its regulatory and compensatory character.  That,
the mode of collection will not alter the nature of the levy under  <a href="/doc/935822/" id="a_56">Section  3</a>
of the  said 1974 Act.  That, imposition of tax depending on the status of the
owner or the nature of the vehicle will not alter the nature of the levy.   It
was  urged  that  continuance  of  the  option  to  pay the tax annually or on
one-time basis did not violate <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_57">Article 14.</a>  According to the learned  counsel,
the  State  Legislature was competent to tax the vehicles, hence, the impugned
impost  fell  under  Entry  57  List  II  of  the  Seventh  Schedule  to   the
Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_95">23.   On  behalf  of  the  vehicle  owners/assesees,  it  was  submitted  that
collection of one-time tax based on the value of the vehicle in  the  garb  of
regulation  had  no nexus with the use and maintenance of roads; that, "value"
had no connection with the costs  or  expenses  of  administration;  that  the
impugned  levy  based  on the status of the owner or the nature of the vehicle
made the levy fall outside Entry 57 List II and  the  classification  for  the
purposes  of  the  said tax between the old and the new vehicles made the levy
arbitrary,  discriminatory  and  unreasonable  under   <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_58">Article   14</a>   of   the
Constitution.  In the circumstances, it was submitted that no interference was
called for with the impugned judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_96">                24.   After referring to the rival submissions, the Honourable

<a href="/doc/1892561/" id="a_60">3(1)</a>,  <a href="/doc/1844023/" id="a_61">3(2)</a>,  <a href="/doc/8820/" id="a_62">4</a>,  Third  Schedule Part-I, added by amending Act 27 of 1998 and
framed the following questions for consideration.

<p id="p_97">        "Whether  the  High  Court  was  right  in  holding  that   with   the
introduction  of  the concept of "value" as the basis of the tax, the impugned

Constitution."
</p>
<p id="p_98">The Supreme  Court  has  also  framed a limited question i.e.  whether the tax
ceased  to  be  compensatory  and  regulatory   with   the   introduction   of
"weight-cum-value"  index and whether the said index is contrary to the scheme
of the said 1974 Act.
</p>
<p id="p_99">                25.  As observed earlier, we are duty bound to  refer  to  the
discussion  and  conclusion  of Their Lordships on the above mentioned issues.
(para 19, 22, 23, 24, 27 and 28)

"19.  At the outset, it may be noted that depreciation is a function  of  time
and maintenance.    In  the  present case, we are concerned with the "lifetime
tax" which is one-time payment spread over the economic life of  the  vehicle.
The said tax is based on time, use and maintenance of the roads.  As stated in
the  judgment  of  this  Court  in Bombay Tyre (AIR 1984 SC 420) any standard,
which maintains a nexus with the  essential  character  of  the  levy  can  be
regarded as a valid basis for assessing the measure of the levy.  Applying the
said  test  to  the present case, we hold that the index of "weight-cum-value"
maintains the nexus with the essential character of the levy in question  and,
therefore,  the  High Court erred in holding that by introduction of the value
of the  vehicle  as  a  parameter,  the  levy  ceases  to  be  regulatory  and
compensatory in nature.  It is important to bear in mind that Entry 57 of List
II  of  the  Seventh  Schedule to the Constitution refers to taxes on vehicles
suitable for use on roads.  Under the said entry, a field is provided  to  the
State  Legislature  to impose the impugned tax in respect of every aspect of a
vehicle.  When the Constitution provides a field of legislation it has  to  be
read in  the  broadest  possible  terms.   When the State is empowered to levy
taxes on goods it is empowered to levy such taxes  on  every  aspect  of  such
goods.   Similarly, when the State is empowered to levy tax on the vehicle, it
is empowered to levy tax on every aspect  of  the  vehicle.    Throughout  the
Constitution the legislative power relating to taxes and the legislative power
relating to general subjects is treated separately and is not subsumed under a
general head.    Applying  the  above tests to the present case, we are of the
view that the High Court had erred in holding that on account of  introduction
of "weight-cum-value" index in the Third Schedule to the Act, the impugned tax
had  ceased  to be regulatory and compensatory and consequently, the said levy
fell outside Entry 57 List II.
</p><p id="p_100">        .....
</p><p id="p_101">        22.  In the present case we are satisfied that the  levy  in  question
being one-time  tax  continues  to  be  a  part  of  regulatory  measure.  For
administrative reasons, in the matter of collection of tax,  one-time  payment
of  tax  is  administratively  convenient  and  at  the  same time, it is also
beneficial to the users of the vehicles who do not have to go to the office of
the RTO every year to pay the annual taxes.  It  is  also  beneficial  to  the
users of the motor vehicles, as they do not have to pay taxes at the increased
rates  from time to time over the economic life of the vehicle as contemplated
by <a href="/doc/1844023/" id="a_63">Section 3(2)</a> of the  Act.    Moreover,  weight  alone  may  not  provide  a
sufficient parameter/basis   for   imposition   of  "lifetime  tax".    As  an
illustration, we may point out that the weight of Honda CRV car is 1500 kg  as
against the weight of Tata Indigo GLX which weighs 1490 kg and yet the cost of
Honda  CRV  is  Rs.15,24,396  lakhs  whereas  the  price  of  Tata  Indigo  is
Rs.5,08,651 lakhs.  Hence, weight index alone may not constitute the basis  of
"lifetime tax".
</p>
<p id="p_102">23.     In    the   circumstances,   we   reiterate   that   introduction   of
"weight-cum-value"      index      will      not      make      the       levy
non-regulatory/non-compensatory.   Further,  under  the  unamended  1974  Act,
weight was the basis of the impugned levy as an annual  tax.    But  with  the
introduction of a "lifetime tax", the entire future projection spread over the
economic  life  of  the  vehicle had to be taken into account along with other
factors like fall in the value of the rupee, inflation, rising  costs  of  the
material, cross-subsidy, etc., and consequently, it was necessary to introduce
the  new  index  of "weight-cum-value" and factors like paying capacity of the
owner.  In our view, these factors have nexus with the use of the roads over a
period of time and hence, the impugned levy fell within Entry 57  List  II  of
the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_103">24.   We also do not find the impugned levy to be discriminatory, arbitrary or
unreasonable so as to violate <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_64">Article 14</a> of the Constitution as  held  by  the
High Court.  In the case of <a href="/doc/557586/" id="a_65">Municipal Corpn.  of the City of Ahmedabad v.  Jan
Mohammed  Usmanbhai</a>  (1986)  3 SCC 20) this Court held that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_66">Article 14</a> forbids
class legislation and not reasonable classification and in order to  pass  the
test  of  reasonable  classification, the classification must be founded on an
intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or class of persons  that
are  grouped  together  from  the  others left out of that group and that such
differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be  achieved
by the statute in question.
</p><p id="p_104">        ....
</p><p id="p_105">        27.   There  is  no  merit in the contention advanced on behalf of the
respondent herein that there is violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_67">Article 14</a> of the Constitution by
imposing higher burden of tax on vehicles  owned  by  "others"  vis-a-vis  the
vehicles owned  by  the  "individuals" in Part-I of the Third Schedule.  We do
not find merit in this argument.  Firstly, as held by this Court in  the  case
of  Bombay Tyre, levy is a constitutional concept, whereas collection of a tax
as well as incidence of tax comes within the statutory measure.  The  mode  of
collection or the incidence of tax cannot be the conclusive test to decide the
nature of  the  levy.   The nature of the levy is a concept different from the
mode of collection of tax.  Levy is a constitutional concept whereas  mode  of
collection of  tax  is a statutory concept.  They stand on different footings.
Secondly, it is important to remember the words of  Lord  Wilberforce,  quoted
with  approval  by  the  House  of  Lords  in  the case of Barclays Mercantile
Business Finance Ltd.  v.  Mawson ( Inspector of Taxes) (2005) 1  All  ER  97)
stating that,

"a   tax   is  generally  imposed  by  reference  to  economic  activities  or
transactions which exist in the real world".
</p><p id="p_106">When an economic activity is to be valued it is open to the lawmaker  to  take
into  account  various  factors including the paying capacity of the user, the
value of the vehicle, the economic life of the vehicle, etc.  Lastly,  in  the
present  case,  for the vehicles registered before 1-7-1998 the option between
annual and one-time tax is retained.
</p>
<p id="p_107">        28.  Before concluding, we may quote the observations of the  Division
Bench of the Kerala High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/2693892/" id="a_68">Anas v.  State of Kerala</a> ((1999)
3 KLT 147) (to which one of us, Dr.AR.Lakshmanan, J, was a party), which state
as under:
</p><p id="p_108">"A  taxing  statute  can  be held to contravene <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_69">Article 14</a> of the Constitution
only if it purports to impose on the same class of property similarly situated
an incidence of taxation which leads to obvious inequality.   It  is  for  the
legislature  to  decide on what objects to levy what rate of tax and it is not
for the courts to consider whether some other objects should have  been  taxed
or whether  a  different  rate should have been prescribed for the tax.  It is
also to be noted that the legislature is  competent  to  classify  persons  or
properties  into  different  categories  and  tax them differently, and if the
classification thus made is rational, the taxing statute cannot be  challenged
merely  because  different  rates  of  taxation  are  prescribed for different
categories of persons or objects."
</p>
<p id="p_109">26.  The conclusion of the Honourable Supreme Court is as under:  (para 29)
`
"29.  For the aforestated reasons, there is no violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_70">Article 14</a> of  the
Constitution.   As stated above, the impugned levy of lifetime tax is based on
rational and reasonable classification founded on an intelligible  differentia
having a rational relation to the object of the impugned levy."
</p>
<p id="p_110">                27.   The  above  referred  decision  makes  it clear that the
Supreme Court considered the main issue, namely, whether the  introduction  of
the  concept  "value" as the basis of the tax and whether the tax ceased to be
compensatory and regulatory with the introduction of "weight-cum-value"  index
and whether the said index is contrary to the scheme of 1974 Act.  The Supreme
Court  has held that the index "weight-cum-value" maintains the nexus with the
essential character of levy in question and disagreed with the  contrary  view
taken by  this  Court.   The Supreme Court has also disagreed with the view of
this Court in holding that on account of  introduction  of  "weight-cum-value"
index  in  Third Schedule to the Act, the impugned Act ceases to be regulatory
and compensatory and consequently the said levy fell outside the Entry  56  in
List-II of  the  Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.  Their Lordships agreed
with the State's contention that the levy  in  question  being  one  time  tax
continues to  be a part of regulatory measure.  Their Lordships also held that
the new index "weight-cum-value" and factors  like,  paying  capacity  of  the
owner,  have  nexus  with the use of roads over a period of time and hence the
impugned levy fell  within  Entry  57  List-II  of  Seventh  Schedule  to  the
Constitution.  By rejecting the contention relating to violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_71">Article 14</a>
of the Constitution, finally, the Supreme Court has concluded that the levy of
life time tax is based on rational and reasonable classification founded on an

intelligible  differentia  having  a  rational  relation  to the object of the
impugned levy.  We are of the view that the said decision squarely applies and
covers all the issues raised.
</p>
<p id="p_111">                28.  In addition to the same,  learned  Advocate  General,  by
drawing our attention to the similar taxation provisions, namely, levy of life
time  tax  for  motor  vehicles  from  Karnataka  as  well  as Andhra Pradesh,
contended that the Supreme Court has upheld  similar  action  taken  in  those
States.   He  also  placed reliance on the entries in the Schedule appended to
Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation Amendment Act,  1997  (Karnataka  Act  8  of 
1997), which reads as follows.

cars and jeeps exceeding 1500 CC and cost of vehicle exceeding more  than  six
lakhs  was under challenge before the Karnataka High Court as unconstitutional
and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_73">Article 14</a> of  the  Constitution  of  India.    It  was  also
challenged  on  the  ground that there was no rational basis for fixing higher
tax liability.  The learned Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court by  order
dated   29.06.1999  held  that  the  vehicle  costing  Rs.6  lakhs  and  above
constituted a different class by itself and, therefore it cannot be said  that
there is discrimination in the levy of tax and therefore the provisions cannot
be  considered  to be violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_74">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and
accordingly dismissed the writ petition.    Aggrieved  by  the  order  of  the
learned  Single  Judge,  dismissing  the  writ  petition,  the  vehicle  owner
preferred Writ Appeal before a Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court.  By
order, dated 23.02.2000 in Writ Appeal No.7000 of  1999,  the  Division  Bench
upheld the  order  of  the  Single  Judge.  The petitioner/ appellant, namely,
Mohan Das N.  Hegde, filed appeal before the Supreme Court.    The  Honourable
Supreme Court, by Judgment, dated 18.03.2005, in Civil Appeal No.7398 of 2000,
reported  in  (2005)  4 SCC 64, following the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/1497806/" id="a_75">State of
Tamil Nadu vs.  M.  Krishnappan</a> (2005) 4 SCC 53, dismissed  the  civil  appeal
and confirmed the judgment of the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_116">                29.   It  is useful to elaborate the contentions raised before
the Karnataka High Court and the issues raised before the Supreme Court.   The
appellant  before  the  Supreme  Court was the owner of "Opel Astra" which was
taxed on "value" basis under 1997 Act.  The said 1997 Act  was  challenged  on
the  ground  that the levy of "lifetime tax" on the value of the car exceeding
1500  cc  was  arbitrary,  discriminatory  and  hit  by  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_76">Article  14</a>  of   the
Constitution of  India.   As said earlier, the said contention was rejected by
the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the  Karnataka  High
Court.   Even  before  the  Supreme  Court,  an argument was advanced that the
introduction of one more parameter, namely, the "value" of  the  vehicle,  the
impugned  levy  has  ceased to be regulatory/compensatory in nature, as such a
parameter has no nexus with the wear and tear of the  public  road.    In  the
circumstances,   it   was   urged   that   the  impugned  Act  was  arbitrary,
discriminatory and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_77">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.  Repelling the
said contention, the Honourable Supreme Court has concluded as follows:  (para
</p><p id="p_117">6)

"6.We do not find any merit in the above arguments.  The above  classification
indicates a measure or a rate of tax applied differently on different vehicles
depending  upon  various  circumstances  and so long as there is competence to
levy and collect the tax under Entry 57 List II of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution, the levy cannot be struck down  only  on  the  ground  that  the
incidence  of  the  tax falls differently on different categories of vehicles.
The burden has to be distributed  on  different  classes  of  vehicles  or  on
different persons  who  owned the vehicles.  How equitably such tax could fall
on different persons is not for the Court to decide.  Lastly, this  matter  is
squarely  covered by our judgment delivered today in the case of <a href="/doc/1497806/" id="a_78">State of T.N.
v.  M.Krishnappan</a>.  (2005) 4 SCC 53.
</p>
<p id="p_118">        7.  For the aforestated reasons, we do not find any infirmity  in  the
impugned judgment  of  the  High  Court.  Accordingly, the appeal fails and is
dismissed, with no orders as to costs."
</p>
<p id="p_119">                30.  As rightly pointed out by the learned  Advocate  General,
the  above  judgment  in  Mohan  Das  N.Hegde  case shows that an argument was  
advanced on behalf of the appellant/vehicle owner, that by introduction of one
more parameter, namely, the "value" of the  vehicle,  the  impugned  levy  has
ceased  to  be  regulatory/ compensatory in nature, as such the said parameter
has no nexus with the wear and tear of the public road.  With  regard  to  the
said  argument,  which  finds place in paragraph 5 of the said decision, their
Lordships have rejected the same in paragraph 6, by saying "We do not find any
merit in the above arguments".  We are satisfied that the  Honourable  Supreme
Court  not  only  followed  the  judgment  in  M.Krishnappan's  case, but also
considered the other relevant factor, namely, the "value" of the  vehicle  and
rejected the contention raised by the appellant therein.

<p id="p_126">                32.  The above mentioned third schedule was inserted by Act 23
of 19 95 and came into force with effect from 24.05.1995,  in  and  by  which,
life tax  had  been  increased from 5% to 7%.  The said life tax introduced by
the Andhra Pradesh Government was challenged in a  batch  of  writ  petitions,
namely, W.P.No.3499  of  2000,  etc.    before  the Andhra Pradesh High Court.
Similar contentions as urged in the cases of Krishnappan and Mohan Das N.Hegde  
were raised before the Andhra Pradesh High  Court.    The  Division  Bench  of
Andhra  Pradesh High Court, having regard to the rival contentions advanced by
both parties, framed the following question for consideration:
</p>
<p id="p_127">        "Whether the impugned amendments to the extent they permit computation
of life tax in respect of four wheelers other than chasis  of  motor  vehicles
and omni buses on the basis of the cost of those vehicles is unconstitutional,
besides  certain  other  subsidiary  questions  such  as  whether the impugned
provisions  are  unconstitutional,  ultra  vires  the  power  of   the   State
Legislature and offe nd Articles 14 and 19(1)( g) of the Constitution, whether
the  levy  of life tax is compensatory or regulatory in nature or ceases to be
compensatory." 
</p>
<p id="p_128">                33.  It is clear that the main thrust of the  argument  before
the  Division  Bench  of the Andhra Pradesh High Court was relating to levy of
tax based on the cost of the  vehicles.    The  following  conclusion  of  the
Division Bench is relevant.  (page 52)

        "In  order to determine whether a tax is compensatory or not, what the
Court has to see is whether what is required by way of tax  is  in  truth  and
substance  either  a  contribution towards the construction and maintenance of
the roads, bridges and other facilities that are  necessary  for  providing  a
smooth  transport  service  or an exaction far in excess of what is needed for
providing such facilities.  Further, the Court cannot  insist  upon  an  exact
correlation  between  the  tax recovered and the cost so incurred because such
exact correlation is in the very nature of things  impossible  to  attain  and
impracticable to  maintain.  It is also well settled that the mere fact that a
tax falls heavily on certain goods or persons may not  always  result  in  its
invalidity,  if  it can be shown the tax so collected is used by the State for
providing services to the tax payers.  The levy of different rates of  tax  or
different  methods  of  tax  ipso  facto  would  not  result  in  any  hostile
discrimination to attract the wrath of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_80">Article 14</a>  postulates.    In  evolving
different  rates  or  method  of tax, it is open to the law-maker to take into
account the administrative  convenience,  convenience  of  the  users  of  the
facilities  and  such  other  considerations  which are intended to reduce the
administrative costs in collecting the taxes.  It needs to be emphasised  that
the amount of wear and tear caused to the roads by any class of motor vehicles
may  not  always  be  a  determining  factor in classifying motor vehicles for
purposes of taxation."
</p>


<p id="p_129">                34.  Finally, rejecting all the contentions raised on the side
of the vehicle owners, the Division Bench  upheld  the  Andhra  Pradesh  Motor
Vehicles  Taxation  Act,  1992  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_81">(Amendment  Act</a> 11 of 1992), and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_82">Amendment Act</a>  
23/1995, as constitutionally valid and dismissed all the writ petitions.   The
said  decision  of  the  Division  Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court also
supports the stand taken by the Government. 
</p>
<p id="p_130">                35.  The Courts have permitted the legislatures to exercise an
extremely wide discretion in classifying items for tax purposes, so long as it
refrains from clear and hostile discrimination against particular  persons  or
classes.   Entry  57  of  List  II  does  not  specify  any base for taxation.
Therefore, if more than  one  could  be  a  basis,  the  legislature  has  the
discretion  and  the  latitude  to choose any one of the permissible/available
basis.  Therefore, it cannot be said that the motor  vehicles  tax  should  be
levied  always  on  the  basis of unladen weight and it cannot be on any other
basis.  To the same effect, matters have been  disposed  of  by  the  Division
Benches of Karnataka  High  Court  vide <a href="/doc/1391723/" id="a_83">Gajanan Motor Transport Co.  Ltd.  vs.
State of Karnataka</a> - AIR 1991 Karnataka 40 and Mohan Das N.Hegde  as  well  as  
the  judgment  of  the  Andhra Pradesh High Court in W.P.No.3499 of 2000, etc.
Batch, dated 01.11.2002, with which we are in respectful agreement.   We  have
already  referred  to  the  conclusion  of the Supreme Court rejecting similar
contentions.
</p>
<p id="p_131">                36.  In the light of the above discussion,  we  are  satisfied
that  the  State  Legislature  has  the  power  to fix motor vehicles tax as a
percentage of the total cost of the vehicle and there is no prohibition  under
any law  against  the  same.    It is brought to our notice that several other
States in India have been adopting  this  formula  for  several  years.    The
contention  of  the  petitioners that this levy which is based on the value of
the vehicle has no relevance or nexus in  levying  life  time  tax  cannot  be
accepted.   It  is futile to contend that the levy is arbitrary and beyond the
legislative competence of the State Legislature.  The motor  vehicle  tax  has
been held  as  compensatory.    The Government have explained in their counter
affidavit that because of the  increasing  expenditure  on  the  construction,
improvement  and  maintenance  of  roads,  it  was  announced in the budget to
mobilize more resource to facilitate development  and  proper  upkeep  of  the
roads and  infrastructure.    In  order  to  meet  the increasing cost of road
construction and maintenance, according to the State Government, such revision
was notified.  The following details have been furnished  to  demonstrate  the
receipt and expenditure on road construction.
Receipt under Motor Vehicles tax
                2002-2003 Rs.556.00 crores

2.Maintenance           228.50 crores 257.56 crores

        Total           567.50 crores 1052.16 crores
------------------------------

</pre><p id="p_132">                37.   We  have  already concluded that levy of lifetime tax on
the basis of the "cost  of  the  vehicle"  will  not  alter  the  compensatory
character of  the  motor  vehicle tax.  Therefore, the levy of lifetime tax on
this basis is within the jurisdiction of the State Legislature.   It  is  also
brought  to  our  notice,  in respect of two wheelers levy of life time tax is
based on the cubic capacity of the engine.    Besides,  in  respect  of  stage
carriages, the  tax  is  collected  with  reference  to seating capacity.  The


discussion also shows that the levy of motor vehicle tax as  a  percentage  on
the  cost  of the vehicle is neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in character
as alleged.
</p>
<p id="p_133">                38.  In conclusion, we do not find any substance in any of the
contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioners while  assailing
the constitutional validity of the impugned provisions.
</p>

<p id="p_134">39.   In  the  result, we hold that <a href="/doc/8820/" id="a_84">Section 4</a>(1-A)(a), introduced by the Tamil
Nadu Amendment Act 27 of 1998, as amended by the <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_85">Tamil Nadu Act</a> 13 of 2003, by    
substituting Schedule-III, Part-I, of the Tamil Nadu Motor  Vehicles  Taxation
Act,  1974  as  it  relates  to  levy  of lifetime tax for new registration of
vehicles and <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_86">Section 3-A</a>, levying Green Tax in respect of  vehicles  mentioned
in  Fourth  Schedule  of  the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974 are
constitutionally valid.  Consequently, we dismiss all the writ petitions, with
no order as to costs.  Consequently, connected W.P.M.Ps., are closed.
