                             CAV JUDGMENT


(PER : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE R.P.DHOLARIA)


</p><p id="p_9">1.          The present writ petition in the nature
of Public Interest Litigation is filed by the
petitioner         -   Kheti      Vikas           Seva    Trust        as     the
respondent authorities have accorded permission
to respondent Nos.4 and 5 to construct a power
generation station as well as Port and SEZ in the
area,     where        the     members            of     the      petitioner
association are having their agricultural lands,
in violation of the Environmental Laws and this
writ petition is also filed in the interest of
villagers         of   villages           viz.,         Zarpara,        Dhrob,
Navinar, Siracha and Kandagara situated in Mundra
Taluka,      District        Kutch,          as     the    valuable           and
fertile       agricultural           land         has     so     far        badly
affected       because       of   the       project       undertaken           by
respondent Nos.4 and 5 and serious environmental
issues have cropped up due to violation of laws
by respondent Nos.4 and 5. The petitioner has

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">        C/WPPIL/12/2011                                              CAV JUDGMENT</span>



also      raised           the        issue           of        profiteering          by
respondent           No.4       who     after         purchasing          the       land
from various Government authorities at a throw
away price is arbitrarily selling the land to
various industries by earning a huge profit which
amounts to unjust enrichment.
</p>

<p id="p_10">2.            The facts of the case of the petitioner
are that the petitioner association is consisting
of more than 200 villagers of the local vicinity
where        certain             projects             are        undertaken           by
respondent           Nos.4        and     5.        Against        the     activity
carried        out        by     respondent            Nos.4        and       5,    the
villagers           have         made        certain             representations
before      the          respondent        authorities,                however       the
authorities              have     not      paid        any       heed     to       their
representations and as such have not taken any
action against the respondents. It is the case of
the     petitioner               that      since           a      larger       public
interest         is       involved        qua         various       issues,          the
petitioner has approached this Court by way of
this     present           writ       petition             in    the    nature       of
Public Interest Litigation.
</p>

<p id="p_11">3.            It is the case of the petitioner that
respondent               Nos.4     and          5      are        carrying           out
excavation           on     a    large       scale          which       has    caused
serious hazard not only to the environment but
also to the human habitation as well within the

jurisdiction                  of    respondent              No.3       -     District
Collector who has made allotment of the land in
favour of the respondent company at throw away
price.      It      is        the    case        of      the    petitioner           that
respondent No.5 is a company incorporated under
the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a> and, after getting conditional
clearance          form        the       respondent            authorities,          has
established               a        huge       power         plant          with      the
established capacity of generation of 4600 MW.
The respondent No.5 company has already started
its operation of power generation at its plant
situated          within            the      SEZ         being       developed        by
respondent No.4.
</p>

<p id="p_12">4.            It         is    further          case      of     the       petitioner
that for the purpose of development of Special
Economic Zone as per the project submitted by
respondent No.4, the State Government carried out
necessary exercise and, as such, huge Government
land including government waste land as well as
pasture land were allotted to respondent No.4.
Over     and      above            the    Government            waste       land     and
pasture        land,           respondent            No.4      was     in    need     of
other huge chunk of the land, therefore the State
Government has acquired a huge parcel of land of
various         villages             of      Mundra         Taluka          from     the
agriculturists. The respondent No.4 in its SEZ
allotted the land to respondent No.5 company for
establishing a power plant with the capacity of

4620 MW of power. The respondent No.5 company was
required       to       take     various            clearance      from       the
authorities            for     establishing            the     power        plant
within     the         SEZ.     The      respondent           no.5     company
started the execution of its project in the year
2008 and it has achieved its substantial capacity
of the power generation in the last quarter of
2010.      For         execution         of         the     said      project,
respondent         No.5       has     over         looked    the     necessary
requirement as well as the conditions under which
the permissions were accorded to it and committed
blatant      violation           of      the        Environmental           Laws,
which has resulted into hardship to the local
villagers within whose vicinity respondent No.5
has established its power plant.
</p>

<p id="p_13">5.          It         is    further      case       of     the    petitioner
that the area in question which is affected by
the operation of the project by respondent No.5
is   the     following           villages            of     Mundra     Taluka,
District Kutchchh. i) Zarpara, ii) Navinar, iii)
Siracha, iv) Kandagara, v) Dhrob and vi) the city
of Mundra as well. The above villages of Mundra
Taluka are known for its fertile land where a
rare species of Indian Dates (Kachchhi Kharek)
grow. Over and above the plantation of Indian
Dates,     the         villagers       were         having     orchards        of
chiccku,       coconut,         lemon          and        bijora     etc.     The
villagers were also taking various crops from the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">       C/WPPIL/12/2011                                              CAV JUDGMENT</span>



fertile       land           namely      crops         of    wheat,        bajara,
cotton, corn etc. The entire Mundra Taluka of
District Kutch is having fertile land and the
same is known as Green Belt of Kutch. The farmers
of    the    aforesaid            villages            were    taking       two     to
three crops in a year.                      A substantial part of the
above villages were having irrigation facilities
and as such the agriculturists were reaping the
benefits of such irrigation facilities over their
fertile land and the agriculturists were earning
substantial              part     of        their       income          from      the
production              of    Indian        Dates.          Looking        to     the
importance of fruit bearing trees of Indian Dates
and    its      rare         qualities,          the        Sardar      Dantiwada
Krushi       University            established               its     Date         Palm
Research        Station           over      51       hectors       of    land      in
Mundra Taluka. Such Date Palm Research Station
was established in Mundra Taluka as in the entire
country Mundra Taluka is the only place where the
orchards        of       Indian       Dates          (Kharekh)       are    found.
Nowhere in the country there is any other Date
Palm Research Centre is established. Since the

<p id="p_14">6.           It is the case of the petitioner that
the major part of the agricultural income of the
agriculturist of the area was coming from Indian
Dates (Kachhchhi Kharekh) and chiccku as the area
in    question           was    having          orchards        of      the       said
fruits spread over hundreds of acres of the land
and   the      farmers         used      to      export       the     fruits        of
Indian Dates to various parts of the country as
well as the best of the quality of Indian Dates
was having market in the foreign countries also.
Apart     from          the    fruit      bearing           trees     of     Indian
Dates, the orchards of chicckus were the another
substantial              earner           of          revenue          for         the
agriculturist             of    the     above         villages.         The       main
market      of      excellent          quality             chiccku      from       the
orchards         of       the     above              villages        was      APMC,
Jamnagar,          Rajkot        and       Anjar,           from     where         the
agriculturist used to get a return of their hard

It is submitted that the aforesaid CGPL is also
taking water from sea by constructing a Pakka
Concrete Canal with a view to preserve the land
and    to     protect              the     land          of    the   nearby         area
against salinity. It is submitted that the said
CGPL has also constructed three huge ponds for
storing sea water for its subsequent use in the
cooling       tower           of    the       power           project.     In   stark
contrast to the above, the photographs taken from
the facility created by respondent No.5 clearly
demonstrate that respondent No.5 is drawing water
from the sea which is situated at the distance
around four to five kilometers from its project
by    creating           a    Kachcha           Channel         which      leads     to
spreading salinity in the surrounding areas. The
resultant effect of sea water stored in the huge
water body created by respondent No.5 in form of
a Kachcha Pond would be damaging the under ground
water as the seepage of the sea water takes place
from the Kachcha Pond. As per the best of the
knowledge               of         the        petitioner,             conditional

its cooling tower is also discharged in sea by
another kachcha channel. It is averred that such
illegal activities carried out by respondent No.5
has led to steep decline of production from the
orchards of Indian Dates, Chiccku and coconuts as
well as it has affected the quality of the above
fruits.        It       is    averred         that        because       of      the
salinity        which         has    spread         due     to      unmindful,
illegal and haphazard developmental activities of
respondent Nos.4 and 5, the quality of the land
has    also         been      deteriorated.               Because       of      the

effect of the project of respondent No.5, almost
70%   of       the       Chiccku        trees        of     the      area       are
destroyed. It is averred that due to the effect
of the pollution caused by the power plant of
respondent No.5, chiccku trees have over night
dried down and the farmers were compelled to cut
it down and the same has also caused damage to
farming of Indian Dates. The existing orchards of
Indian Dates has suffered a serious blow in terms
of production and at the same time the quality of
the   Indian            Dates    have       also     been        deteriorated

<p id="p_22">14.          It is the case of the petitioner that
though      necessary               conditional             permissions           were
given     to      respondent              No.4        for     development          of
various        ports,          respondent             No.5     has       committed
blatant violation of the conditions by causing
serious       damage           to    the       coastal        area.        On     the
coastal        line        of       Mundra            Taluka,       lush        green
mangrove forests were existing. In a haste to
develop the port over a huge tract of land on the
coastal        area,          respondent              No.4    has        destroyed
mangrove       forest          from       a    huge     area       and    as      such
reclaimed lands by filling the dredging material.
The modus operandi adopted by the respondent SEZ
developer was first of all to create a clay wall
so that the sea water may not enter the area of
mangrove forest and the resultant effect in the
instant       case       is     total         destruction          of     mangrove
forest in the area which is known as East Port.
At present, respondent No.4 herein is developing
the port on the Western Side which is known as
the West Port. The recent photographs taken from
the   site        where        the        mangrove          forests       were     in
existence         clearly           indicate           that    the       same     are
almost entirely destroyed.                            So far as East Post
is    concerned,               the        office         bearers          of      the
petitioner              were        not       allowed         to        take      any
photographs              of     the           same.         However,        recent
photographs taken at the site of the West port
where the work is in progress clearly go to show

that the mangrove forests are badly damaged. Many
of    the      mangrove         trees       have          already    dies        down
which is causing serious damage to the ecology.
Once upon a time the mangrove forests was lush
green       and      as     such      mangrove             forests       are     the
natural wall against spreading of salinity and
the same protects the main land at the time of
hurricane and tsunami. It is averred that even
geographical position of the area is also altered
by respondent No.4 company by reclaiming land of
the coastal area.
</p>

<p id="p_23">15.            It is averred in the petition that in
fact, at present, the work is in progress at the
West Port. In the area near the West Port, number
of     natural            creeks       are           in    existence           since
thousands           of     years.        The         three       major     creeks
situated near the area are Kotadi, Navinal and
Thragdi        creeks.          At    present,             the    activity        of
filling up the creeks is going on which is likely
to have a long term impact on the ecology of the
area      in      question.              The         respondent          No.4     is
carrying         out      the    dredging            activity       on    a      very
large scale by installing heavy machinery for the
same. It is stated that the recent photographs
taken from the site reveal the existence of heavy
duty pipes leading to the area of creeks which is
sought      to      be    filled       in     by      the    respondent           SEZ
developer. By filling up the creeks, respondent

No.4 is creating reclaimed land and over which
the     respondent                 is     carrying              out       its     various
activities.

<p id="p_24">16.           It         is    further           case          of    the     petitioner
that respondent No.4 has submitted its proposal
for the proposed expansion of Mundra Port and SEZ
by    which        it         is    evident           that          the    company         is
carrying         out          its       expansion              project          over      the
coastal        area           of    the       Mundra           Taluka.          As     such,
respondent               No.4           company           has         proposed            for
expansion and construction of four ports namely
West,      South,             North        and       East           ports.      The      map
showing the strategic location of the proposed
expansion of the above four ports are clearly
indicated           in         Annexure-Q                 to        the     main         writ
petition.          Out         of       four      ports,            respondent           No.4
company has almost completed the construction and
development              of    East        Port.          The       respondent           No.4
company is at present carrying out its activity
for the development of West Port and North Port.
As    stated        hereinabove,                 for       the       development           of
East     Port,           respondent            No.4        company          has      almost
destroyed          that            lush     green         and        thick       mangrove
forests and at present the company is adopting
the same tactic over the area of West Port and
North      Port.          It       is     stated          that       for     the       local
villagers mangrove trees were like Kalp Vruksh

farmers for their cattle. The agriculturists from
the     villages              Zarpara,        Dhrob,          Mundra,       Baroi,
Navinal, Siracha etc. were used to collect the
fruits of the mangrove trees which were generally
used as cattle feed which results into giving
good     amount          of    milk,       however,          because       of      the
destruction of the mangrove forests even the milk
production has been badly affected.
</p>

<p id="p_25">17.           It is averred that for the purpose of
destroying the mangrove forests, respondent No.4
company has adopted various methods which have
lead     to      large         scale       destruction             of    mangrove
forest.        The       respondent           No.4       company         has      also
deployed heavy equipments to cut down and remove
the mangrove trees. In Annexure-S to the writ
petition,            one        of      the           photographs          clearly
indicates          the        small     stumps          of    mangrove         trees
standing          at     the      site        after          the    forest        was
destroyed          by     the     respondent             company.           It     is
averred that photograph taken from a website -
Google       shows        the     pre-existing               mangrove       forest
over the coastal area of Anjar and Mundra Taluka.
However, the lush green mangroves forests which
were there in existence in the coastal area of
Mundra Taluka since hundreds of years have been
deliberately and systematically either destroyed
or    badly        damaged,          which        has     lead      to     serious
ecological imbalance in the area.

<p id="p_26">18.          It          is     averred           that         regarding            the
contention              made     hereinabove                with        respect      to
manifest          violations             of           the     norms        by       the
respondent              company       was       noticed            by     the      team
consisting          of        eight      different            officials            from
various         authorities.                Bare            reading        of       the
independent report based on the site visit by the
subject experts clearly shows that the respondent
company has carried out systematic and deliberate
operation         of      destruction             of        natural       resources
badly affecting the ecology. The said report was
submitted by the committee lead by Dr.A.Senthil

and Forests and the other officers of GPCB and
Gujarat      Ecology           Commission.             The     said       committee
carried out the visit of the site of respondent

visit      carried            out     by      the       committee         led      by
Dr.Senthil Vel, Additional Director, Ministry of
Environment and Forest, a show cause notice has
also been issued to respondent No.4 company on
15.12.2010.             Even    after         receipt         of    show      cause

its   operation              which     tantamount            to    wide     spread
destruction             of    mangrove         forests.        The     aforesaid
report of the committee as well as the show cause
notice      dated            15.12.2010          have        not    taken         into
account the other serious issues stated in the
foregoing paragraphs namely the issues relating
to excavation of clay in the local area to create
a huge pond without any concrete lining as well
as digging up of a Kachcha channel having the
width of nearly 100 meters and depth of almost 30
to 40 meters to bring sea water (saline water).
Such other issues like destruction of sand dunes
which are also in existence since hundreds of
year are also not the part of the report/show

<p id="p_28">20.           It is averred that another issue which
the    petitioner           agitates         in     the   larger       public
interest is the issue relating to profiteering by
respondent           No.4   by     selling          the   land    to       other
entities at different discriminatory rates. The
respondent No.4 company, though is a company duly
constituted under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_3">Companies Act</a> is required
to maintain transparency in its transactions. It
would be relevant to note that for the purpose of
establishment of SEZ, the respondent company has
purchased valuable Government land from the State
Government at throw away prices. Other part of
land which were of the private ownership were
acquired          by     the     State         Government         from      the
original             owners/agriculturists.                   Even           the
compensation awarded for the acquired land was a
very meager amount. The Government in case of
respondent No.4 has acted in haste and allotted
thousands of acres of land to the company hardly
at    Rs.2/-        to   Rs.4/-      per      square      meter.       A    huge
tract      of     lands     from      Mundra        Taluka     which        were
earmarked          for   the     purpose           of   Gauchar    (Pasture
land) were overnight de-notified and allotted to
respondent No.4 company by the State Government
for the reasons best known to it. Over and above
the Gauchar land, the State Government has also
allotted its waste land to respondent No.4 for
the development of SEZ at throw away price. The
Government has also taken back the pre-existing

lease of the salt pan owners and assigned the
same to respondent No.4 company for its project.
Thousands of acres of lands which were purchased
by respondent No.4 company from the Government at
throw away price were sold to other companies at
different rates by resorting to profiteering. As
per      the            information            available           with         the
petitioner, the respondent company has purchased
various lands from the Government at the rate of
Rs.2/- to Rs.4/- per square meter, however the
same has sought to be sold to various companies
at the rate of Rs.600/- to Rs.750/- per square
meter,      which         amounts        to      huge     loss      to    public
exchequer.          Apparently,            respondent           No.4     company
has connived with the Government machinery and
used the same for its own purpose to purchase
various       parcels          of    land        at     throw     away      price
and/or      to      get        the    land           acquired     from      their
original owners/farmers. Some of the transactions
of respondent No.4 company clearly suggest that
the interest of the State revenue is compromised
in terms of making payment of stamp duty. Hence,
the present writ petition is filed.

deliberately not complying with its commitment.

are, in fact, throwing the fly ash generated in
the    power        plant        at     various          places        in    blatant
violation of the provisions of the Act and the

       petitioner are concerning the environ-

       actions undertaken by respondent No.4.
       After having received the environmental
       clearance certificate, respondent No.4
       Company has constructed a channel in the
       year 2009. Respondent No.4 - Company is
       using sea water for its power plant
       through intake channel which is not con-
       structed but it is in a raw form and
       natural form. According to the petition-
       er, it should be a permanent pakka chan-
       nel made of cement. This amounts to
       challenging the Environmental Clearance

       para 18.1, 19 and 20 as under:-
</p>

<p id="p_85">       "18.1 As regards the contention that the
       report has been filed without relying
       upon experts opinion, we do not find any
       force in the said contention as the Com-
       mittee constituted by the Collector,
       Bhuj comprises of high ranking Govern-
       ment officials having adequate technical
       expertise. As regards the contention for
       appointing an independent fact finding
       commission to look into the matter as
       the report of the aforesaid committee is
       not satisfactory, in our view and in our
       reading of the report, no blockage, ob-
       struction and bunding to the natural
       flow of above 14 rivers in question are
       found. Prima-facie, in our opinion,
       there is no cause or concern to appoint
       an independent fact finding commission
       to look into the matter. We are also ap-
       prised of the facts that the respondent-
       company has been granted phase-wise En-
       vironmental Clearance beginning the year
       1995 by the Ministry of Environment and
       Forests (MOEF), Government of India, New
       Delhi for their project and the State
       Government has allotted various parcels
       of lands to the respondent-company and

       they have developed the area pursuant to
       such Environmental Clearance and allot-
       ment of lands. Therefore, we cannot ac-
       cede to the above request made by the
       learned counsel for the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_86">       19. We have gone through the decisions
       of this Court as well as of the Hon'ble
       Supreme Court relied upon by the learned
       Senior Counsel for the petitioners. We
       do not find the ratio decidendi pro-
       pounded by the said decisions will be of
       any help to the petitioners in the facts
       and circumstances of the present case.
       The prime contention or concern which
       appears on the part of the petitioners
       is that 14 rivers were flowing and due
       to allotment of the land and resultant
       development, the respondent-company has
       blocked natural flow of water in above
       14 rivers which has resulted into bund-
       ing of rivers. However, as narrated
       above, the report submitted by the Com-
       mittee constituted by the Ministry of
       Environment and Forests (MoEF), New Del-
       hi as well as the report of the inspec-
       tion carried out by high ranking Govern-
       ment officials clearly reveals that no
       where natural flow of rivers is blocked
       or obstructed in such a way that it may
       result into bunding. Even otherwise
       also, 14 rivers appear to be seasonal in
       nature and so during rainy season, there
       may be flowing water and during the end
       of winter and summer, they must be get-
       ting dry. The nature of flowing water is
       such if there is any blockage in the way
       of canal, then naturally, it may result
       into bunding of adjacent land, but in
       both the reports referred above, nowhere
       bunding is noticed which itself clearly
       indicative that the respondent company
       has not done material change in the flow
       of water and river-bed by which major

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_113">                   Page 56 of 73</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_114">       C/WPPIL/12/2011                                           CAV JUDGMENT</span>



             blockage results into bunding. In view
             of the aforesaid observations made by
             the committee, we are convinced that no
             direction is required to be issued in
             the matter and the complaint and griev-
             ance raised by the petitioners appears
             to be baseless.
</p>
<p id="p_87">             20. In view of the aforesaid discussion,
             we do not find any merit in the writ pe-
             tition. The writ petition fails and is
             accordingly   dismissed.  Notice  stands
             discharged. No order as to cost."

<p id="p_88">47.          Mr.Shakeel Qureshi, learned advocate for
respondent          No.6       submitted          that    the      additional
reply affidavit dated 26.9.2014 filed on behalf
of    Ministry           of    Environment           and        Forests        and
Climate Change, Government of India clinches the
issue. On the basis of the report submitted by
Sunitha Narain Committee, show cause notices have
been issued to M/s.Adani Port and SEZ Pvt. Ltd
and Gujarat Maritime Board and letters have been
addressed         to      Principal        Secretary,            Environment

directions.             They     have        duly        submitted         their
response. However, as the matter involves complex
issues,       the        examination         took        time    and     it    is
expected that the final order in the matter could
be issued within three months.

raised by the petitioner in this writ petition is
to    direct        the        respondent              authorities            to       take
effective steps against the respondent companies
who    are       causing          large          scale            damage       to      the
ecosystem of the coastal area and also to take
effective measures to protect and preserve the
mangrove         forests,          areas,              and        to     appoint         an
independent             committee           to         examine          the     serious
issues raised in the present writ petition. The
petitioner              has     also       prayed            to        restrain         the
respondent companies from drawing sea water by
using kachcha channel, and storing saline water
in kachcha pond dug at the site, and reclaiming
the lands by filling up the creeks.

have come across such similar contention while
deciding Writ Petition (PIL) No.122 of 2013 and
other cognate matters. The prime contention or
concern      on         the   part     of     the      petitioner          in      the
aforesaid matter was that 14 rivers were flowing

and due to allotment of the land and resultant
development, the respondent-company has blocked
natural flow of water in above 14 rivers which
has resulted into bunding of rivers. A committee
of    high          ranking     Government            officials          was
constituted by the Collector, Bhuj and the said

</pre><p id="p_95">54.           Upon examining the issues raised in the
aforesaid Writ Petition, this Court came to the
conclusion that "even otherwise also, 14 rivers
appear to be seasonal in nature and so during
rainy      season,          there       may       be     flowing       water       and
during the end of winter and summer, they must be
getting dry.              The nature of flowing water is such
if there is any blockage in the way of canal,
then naturally, it may result into bunding of
adjacent land, but in both the reports referred
above, nowhere bunding is noticed which itself
clearly       indicative              that      the      respondent         company
has not done material change in the flow of water
and    river-bed           by     which        major         blockage       results
into       bunding.              In        view         of     the      aforesaid
observations              made        by     the        committee,          we     are
convinced that no direction is required to be
issued       in      the        matter        and       the     complaint          and
grievance raised by the petitioner appear to be
baseless.

<p id="p_96">55.           In         that    view        of        the    matter,       we     are
convinced          that         the    contention             of    the     learned
counsel         for       the     petitioner                 that    even        power
project        is        constructed            on      the     Siracha          river
appears to be baseless and misplaced.

existence since hundreds of years are not part of
the report/show cause notice, we had also come
across such similar issues while deciding Writ
Petition (PIL) No.210 of 2014. This Court, while
dealing         the       aforesaid         issues,         came       to      the
following          conclusions        at      para     20   &amp;     21    of     the

<blockquote id="blockquote_42">              "20.     The prime contention or concern
              which appears on the part of the
              petitioner is that the respondent No.2
              company     has    been     carrying     on
              construction / demolition / flattening
              activities on all sand dunes in and
              around    Tunda   and    Vandh    villages,
              Taluka : Mundra, Kutch, without any kind
              of   permission    from   any    authority,
              causing tremendous damage to the ecology
              of the region and continuation of such
              activities will lead to a situation
              where the loss caused to the environment
              will be irreversible. The sand dunes
              have   never    been   allotted    to   the
              respondent No.2 company and inspite of
              that, they are clandestinely flattening
              the dhuva backwards and claiming that
              the land is created as a result of
              reclamation activities by dumping dredge
              spoils. However, as narrated above, the
              reports submitted by the Collector,
              Kutch,    pursuant    to    this    Court's
              directions clearly reveals that Bharadi
              Mata Dhuva, Vekri Dhuva and Bet Dhuva
              are not allotted to the User Agency,

             however, the area forming the part of
             the Mor Dhuva has been allotted to the
             User Agency in the year 2009 and during
             the   site    visit   of    the   Committee
             constituted by the Collector, Kutch, it
             is noticed that the company has made a
             temporary road and on the northern side,
             a channel for discharge of water is
             seen. No other work is seen in this
             area. No construction activities are
             seen at the site proposed for ship
             recycling facility. This conclusion is
             also    confirmed     during    the    site
             inspection carried out by the Regional
             Office of the Ministry of Enviroment and
             Forests (MoEF) at Bhopal on 25.9.2014,
             as detailed in their affidavit dated
             3.11.2014.    Moreover,    the    committee
             constituted     by    the    Ministry    of
             Environment and Forests (MoEF), New
             Delhi   to   look   into   the   complaints
             regarding severe impact upon environment
             safety   and    integrity    committed   by
             M/s.Adani Port and SEZ Ltd has submitted
             its detailed report with recommendation
             to the Government of India and the same
             is under consideration of the competent
             authorities. In view of the aforesaid
             observations made by the committee, we
             are convinced that no directions is
             required to be issued in the matter and
             the complaint and grievance raised by
             the petitioner appears to be misplaced.

opinion, there is no cause or concern to appoint

matter. We are also apprised of the facts that
the      respondent               company            has        been         granted
Environmental               Clearance           by        the        Ministry        of

India, New Delhi, for their project and the State
Government has allotted various parcels of lands
to the respondent company and they have developed
the area pursuant to such environmental clearance
and    allotment            of     lands.        Therefore,             we    cannot
accede to the request made by the learned counsel
for    the       petitioner          to      appoint            an    independent
committee to look into the matter.

recommendation to the Government of India and the
same       is      under      consideration             of    the        competent
authorities.                 In    view            of        the         aforesaid
observations               made   by      the       committee,            we       are
