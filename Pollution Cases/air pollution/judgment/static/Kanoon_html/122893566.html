                J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">(Judgment delivered by the Bench)

         These two appeals are directed against the orders
passed by the Appellate Authority, Uttar Pradesh
Pollution Control Board, Respondent No. 1.
</p>
<p id="p_2">         The Appeal No. 6 of 2011 is filed against the
Order dated 16th May 2011 passed in the Appeal No.
4/2011 by the Appellate Authority (Uttar Pradesh
Pollution Control Board i.e. Respondent No. 1) under the
Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Pollution Control) Act</a> 1981 and the
Appeal No. 7 of 2011 is filed being aggrieved by the
Order dated 20th May 2011 passed in Appeal No. 3/2011
by the Appellate Authority (Uttar Pradesh Pollution
Control Board i.e. Respondent No. 1) under the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Pollution Control) Act</a> 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        Since, in both the Appeals, common questions of
law and fact arise for consideration, they are being
disposed of by this common order.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        It is the case of the appellants that they are the
owners of certain extents of land wherein mango trees are
planted (existing) and their mango trees are being



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                        Page 3 of 10</span>
 affected by the brick kiln erected by the Respondents No.
2 in both the Appeals. Due to their close proximity, the
heat generated and ash emanated from them spoils the
flowering and fruiting of mango crop. Apart from this,
the brick kiln is also located very close to the human
habitation which results in health hazard. The authorities
have not measured the distance between the mango
orchards and the brick kiln. The distance between the
brick kiln and the human habitation and mango orchards
is against the prescribed distance under the governmental
orders issued from time to time. The direction of the wind
was not properly taken into consideration looking into
the location of the orchard and human habitation. It is
also argued that the sum total area of various owners of
mango orchards within the prescribed limits from the
brick kiln is also more than the prescribed limit of area
under orchards. All the reports of inspection are
manipulated and the authorities have blindly accepted
the same.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         Whereas, it is the case of the respondents that the
brick kiln is located beyond the distance prescribed by the
governmental orders, from the mango orchards as well as
human inhabitation in both the cases. The Counsel
appearing for the Pollution Control Board supported the
order passed by the Appellate Authority in both the cases
and stated that absolutely there is no mango orchard
worth the name nearby the brick kiln erected by the
Respondents No. 2, in both the cases. Reliance to this
effect was placed on the site inspection reports submitted


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                         Page 4 of 10</span>
 by the representative/s of Uttar Pradesh Pollution
Control Board and District Horticulture Department.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         In Appeal No. 6 of 2011, it appears that the
appellant is the owner of land to an extent of 0.076 acres
in Survey No. 403 and 0.076 acres in Survey No. 404 of
Village Kamauli, Tehsil Unchahar, District Raibareli,
Uttar Pradesh and the brick kiln is located in Survey No.
429 of the same village. There are few mango trees in
Survey No. 403 and 404 and there are some other mango
orchards located within a distance of 300 to 400 meters
from the brick kiln of M/s Nikhil Brick Field. Human
habitation is around 330 meters from the brick kiln. In the
prevailing wind direction of East-West where as per the
prescribed government norms, the restriction is upto a
distance of 1.5 km with respect to mango orchards having
area of 2.5 acres; it is noted that 7-8 mango orchards
having total area of more than 2.5 acres are present within
the prescribed limits.
</p>
<p id="p_7">         In Appeal No. 7 of 2011, it appears that the
appellant is the owner of land in Survey No. 178, 173, 96,
180, 192, 189 of Kalupur Village. There are number of
mango orchards near brick kiln within the restricted area
over the Survey No. 118, 121, 117, 198, 351, 396 and 359
measuring about 7 acres. The Respondent No. 2 has
erected a brick kiln in Survey No. 178 of Kalupur village,
Tehsil Biswan, District Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh, contrary
to the governmental instructions.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                        Page 5 of 10</span>
<p id="p_8">          We have heard the learned counsel on either side
and perused the documents made available on record.
The following points arise for consideration:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         i)    Whether the brick kiln established by the
               respondents is causing any pollution and
               resulting in the damage of flowering and
               fruiting of the mango trees of the appellants;
               and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">         ii)   Whether the appellate authority has committed
               any error calling for our interference.</blockquote>

<p id="p_9">         It is the allegation of the appellant that the brick
kiln in both the cases is located within a distance of 200
meters from the mango orchard of the appellant as well
as other landlords of the vicinity. Similarly, in the
prevailing wind direction where restriction is upto 1.5 km
in respect of mango orchards, a good number of them are
existing. Human habitation is also in close proximity of
the brick kiln. The report furnished by the district officials
dated 24.09.2007 and 08.09.2007 and District Horticulture
Officer dated 01.11.2007 to the UP Pollution Control
Board authority in respect of Appeal No. 6 of 2011 reveals
that the distances from the brick kiln are varying. Reports
in respect of Appeal No. 7 of 2011 were furnished on
10.11.2010; 07.08.2011; 09.09.2010 and 15.04.2011. It is also
well accepted by the parties that the lands held by the
appellant is more than 200 meters away from the lands
held by the respondents. The other lands referred to in
the respective appeals are far further away from the brick



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                          Page 6 of 10</span>
 kilns. During the pendency of appeal before the Appellate
Authority, Pollution Control Board, Uttar Pradesh also
called for a fresh report from the District Pollution
Control authority of the respective districts and found
that the distance between the brick kiln and the lands
held by the appellants is beyond the restricted distance as
per the standards fixed in case of establishment of brick
kiln. Further, absolutely there is no mango orchard worth
the name as defined under the instructions issued from
time to time i.e. there is no orchard which is 2.5 acres in
the vicinity of the brick kilns in both the cases. The
human habitation is far away from the brick kilns. Thus,
there is no threat for the flowering and fruiting of the
mango trees, if any, available in the lands of the
appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_10">          The appellant and the respondents in both the
cases have filed the revenue (Khasra) documents of the
villages showing that the appellants are the owners of
certain lands. But practically there are no mango orchards
thereon belonging to them. In Appeal No. 6 of 2011, the
appellant is the owner of survey No. 403 and 404 of
Village Kamauli, Tehsil Unchahar, District Raibareli. As
per the records, there are only three mango trees in
Survey No. 403 and five mango trees in Survey No. 404.
In Appeal No. 7 of 2011, the position is almost the same.
Before giving consent for establishment and operation,
the District Pollution Control Board authorities inspected
and submitted report and even during the pendency of
the appeal before the Pollution Control Board, the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                        Page 7 of 10</span>
 Appellate Authority on its own called for a report and
found the same to be in consonance with the earlier
report. Further, this Tribunal also directed the appellants
as well as the respondents to submit a fresh report
indicating the survey nos. and the number of trees there
on in the lands along with a rough sketch map held by
the appellants and also the distance of the trees from the
brick kilns in question. Absolutely, there is no difference
between the report of the appellants and the respondents
including the distance from the place of brick kilns.
However, the learned counsel for appellants vehemently
argued that the reports submitted to the consenting
authority as well as the Appellate Authority are all
managed and fabricated by the respondents brick kiln
owners, at all stages as is evident from varying distances
mentioned in different reports furnished by various
officials. We cannot go into this aspect in a proceeding of
this nature. We are of the considered opinion that the
appellants have not made any case to demonstrate that
the brick kilns established by the respondents is causing
any damage to the mango flowering or fruiting and the
Appellate Authority has not committed any error calling
for our interference.
</p>
<p id="p_11">         However, we have noticed that there are other
fields having mango orchards in the close proximity to
the brick kilns though confirmed distances of them are
not readily available. Moreover, the affected parties, if
any, are not before us though, the learned Counsel for the
appellant stated that there is environmental threat for the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                        Page 8 of 10</span>
 mango trees of other landlords. Therefore, the matter has
to be examined in details by calling for a fresh report
from the authorities concerned. We are not impressed by
this submission, since, it is brought to our notice that the
letter of consent given by the District Pollution Control
Board authorities is valid for another two months only.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        Under these circumstances, the appeal is
disposed of with the following directions for compliance
while granting renewal of the consent to operate is given
by the Pollution Control Board authorities in favour of
the Respondent brick kiln owners:
</p>
<p id="p_13">  i)    Before renewing the consent to operate in favour
        of the respondent brick kiln owners, the District
        Environmental Engineer concerned shall issue
        notices to all the landlords whose lands are
        located within the restricted distance from the
        brick kiln (as prescribed in the government
        order) and also the villagers of the village which
        fall within the restricted distance from the
        influence zone of the brick kilns (as prescribed in
        the government order) keeping in view the
        environmental standards.
</p>
<p id="p_14">  ii)   For this purpose the District Environmental
        Engineer shall issue a notice on the conspicuous
        places in the villages concerned apart from
        serving personal notice on the affected parties.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                         Page 9 of 10</span>
<p id="p_15">            The notice of enquiry shall be notified by beating
           of drum (Dugdugi/Munadi).
</p>
<p id="p_16">    iii)   The appellant is at liberty to take appropriate
           steps as per law, if these directions are not
           complied while renewing the consent to operate
           in favour of the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_17">  The appeal stands disposed of subject to above directions.</p><pre id="pre_2">
