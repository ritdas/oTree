JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON)

The first applicant in this application claims to be a public

spirited person who has been working in the field of environment

conservation. The second applicant is an organisation working in

the field of environment across the country. Both these applicants

raise a specific substantial question relating to environment with

respect to water pollution in the River Ganga, particularly,

between Garh Mukteshwar and Narora, due to discharge of highly

toxic and harmful effluents. It is alleged that highly toxic and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                4</span>
 harmful effluents are being discharged by the respondent units

into the Sambhaoli drain/Phuldera drain that travels along with

the Syana Escape Canal which finally joins River Ganga. These

units had constructed underground pipelines for such discharge.

According   to   the   applicants,    Simbhaoli   Sugar   Mills   was

established in 1933 and presently is operating three sugar mills

and three distilleries in the State of Uttar Pradesh. The total

crushing capacity of all three complexes is of 20100 TCD. The

unit at Simbhaoli alone has a crushing capacity of 9500 TCD. In

just outside the premises of this sugar mill, untreated effluents

are being discharged into the drain which finally joins the River

Ganga. The other unit, Gopalji Dairy which is producing milk and

milk products of different kinds, also discharges untreated

effluents in the same Simbhaoli drain. The contamination from

discharge of trade effluents is so high that it not only pollutes the

Syana Escape canal and the River Ganga but also threatens the

life of endangered aquatic species such as dolphins, turtles and

other aquatic life. It has also polluted the groundwater of villages

from where it passes through, like Bauxar, Jamalpur, Syana,

Bahadurgarh, Alampur, Paswada and Nawada village. It is the

submission of the applicant that the Gangetic Dolphin is a highly

endangered species and is listed in Schedule I of the Wildlife

(Protection) Act, 1972. It is also submitted that the WWF India

has come out with a report on Ganges and has recorded the

finding that a large number of factories like sugar, chemicals,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  5</span>
 fertilizers, small-scale engineering etc. located at the bank of the

river, discharge their effluents directly into the River Ganga and

pollute the river to a considerable extent. It is estimated that

nearly 260 million litres of industrial waste-water, largely

untreated, is discharged by these units while the other major

pollution inputs include runoff from the agricultural fields. It is

submitted that more than 6 million tonnes of chemical fertilizers

and 9,000 tonnes of pesticides are used annually within the

basin. The dumping of untreated effluents has also been reported

in several newspapers many times and one of the news article

published in India Today dated 19th July, 2010 titled as "Ganga

Chokes as Sugar Mills Dump Wastes" reported that Simbhaoli

Sugar Mills has been rushing its poisonous industrial waste

directly into the River. As a result thereof, the colour of green

water is black and it stinks around the year. Several large fishes

have died and four of the buffaloes of the villagers died after they

drank the drain water.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">2.   It is further the averment of the applicant that the issue of

pollution by the Simbhaoli Sugar Mills is very old and as back as

in 1997 a book titled "Geography and Environment Vol. III, local

issues" stated that harmful pollutants are released by Simbhaoli

Sugar Mills polluting units, which are adversely affecting

Simbhaoli and its environment. Sulphur dioxide is produced by

fuel combustion and burning of sulphur about 3-4 times daily, for

sulphitation and sugar mills and distiller. The leakage of S02


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 6</span>
 causes eye irritation and if greater in amount, even leads to acid

rains. Fly ash that escapes through chimneys with CO2 not only

contributes to air pollution but causes immense harm to human

health. The sugar mill discharges about 1.25 lakh litres effluents

approximately per hour for lagooning. The seepage of the effluents

pollutes the ground water. The water becomes harder, oily and

greasy and unfit for consumption. Thus, the unit causes both air

and water pollution. The applicants who became particularly

aware about the extent of pollution being caused by these

industries, wrote a letter dated 24th June, 2013 to the Chairman

of Ganga River Basin Authority, apprising them of large scale

pollution by these industries. However, this letter was responded

to by the said authority vide their letter dated 6th August, 2013

stating that it was outside their ambit of work and as such they

would not be in a position to do anything in furtherance to the

letter of the applicants. The applicants also approached the Uttar

Pradesh Pollution Control Board (for short 'the UPPCB') and

informed them about the extent of pollution and about the failure

on the part of the Board in not controlling the said pollution.

However, the applicants got no response.       The Applicants to

substantiate their complaint, went to the extent of collecting

effluent samples from the Simbhaoli drain which finally joins the

River Ganga. These water samples were collected on 7th August,

2013 from the drain at different locations and a test report was

issued by the said laboratory on 25th August, 2013, inter alia


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                7</span>
 showing extreme violation by these industries of the prescribed

standards as declared under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,

1986 (for short 'the Act of 1986'). Some of the results in relation to

Total Suspended Solid, Biological Oxygen Demand and Oil and

<p id="p_8">Concerned with the constant discharge of untreated effluent,

contamination of the River water, ground water and the

environment, the applicants, while relying upon Articles 48A and

51A(g) of the Constitution of India and the judgments of the

Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/124028/" id="a_3">Dr. B.L. Wadehra v. Union of India</a>, (1996) 2

SCC 594, <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_4">M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath</a> and Others, (2000) 6 SCC

213, <a href="/doc/1646284/" id="a_5">Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar &amp; Others</a>, (1991) 1 SCC 598,

contended that the authorities entrusted with the work of

pollution control cannot be permitted to sit back with folded

hands on the pretext of financial or other limitations. Pollution is



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   8</span>
 a civil wrong. By its very nature, it is a tort committed against the

community as a whole. Right to life being a fundamental right

under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_6">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, includes the right of

enjoyment of pollution-free water and air for full enjoyment of life.

There is a vested right in the applicants and all others to have

pollution free water and air in that area of which they are the

residents. There itself the duty of the State to prevent and control

pollution of water and air and to provide cleaner environment to

the citizenry.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">3.    On the above premises, the applicants pray that these

industries should be restricted from releasing harmful effluents in

Sambhaoli drain leading to River Ganga and they should also be

directed to pay the cost of restoration of the environment which

the   applicant   is   unable   to       quantify   in   the   application.

Respondents No. 1 and 2 have filed a common affidavit stating

that there is pollution of River Ganga by discharge of untreated

effluents by the industries including the Respondent Units.

However, it is stated that MoEF under the aegis of NGRBA has

taken several steps to check pollution in the River Ganga. The

main role of checking industrial pollution as well as inspection

and monitoring of industrial units, comes under the purview of

the CPCB and various State Pollution Control Boards. It is averred

that all the three units had been inspected by the Central

Pollution Control Board (for short 'the CPCB)' on 4th September,

2013 of which one unit namely Simbhaoli Sugar unit was found


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     9</span>
 not in operation due to off crushing season. M/s Simbhaoli Sugar

Mills Ltd (Distillery Division) and M/s Gopalji Dairy Pvt. Ltd. were

found not complying with the standards for effluent disposal and

the CPCB had issued directions under the provisions of the Act of

1986, to these industries to adhere to the prescribed standards.


</p><p id="p_11">4.     UPPCB (Respondent No. 6) has filed an independent reply.

According to the UPPCB, Simbhaoli Sugar Mills was having two

units. One is a sugar mill and the other is a distillery unit. The

sugar mill was having a capacity of 10000 TCD and the distillery

unit was having the capacity of 90 KL/day. The distillery unit was

subsequently made into Simbhaoli Spirits Ltd. and even prior

thereto the consents for the two units were being granted

there was a shed to store the prepared compost but it was

damaged. No storage sheds were provided for press mud.

Compost yard is lined but the catch pits and drains have been

damaged on many places and press mud stored on underlined

</p>
<p id="p_40">

</p><p id="p_41">        The analysis of the above reports clearly demonstrated that

this unit was a polluting unit.
</p>
<p id="p_42">
</p><p id="p_43">11. However, in relation to Gopaljee Dairy Pvt. Ltd., a detailed

inspection was conducted, copy of which is annexed to the

inspection report as Annexure 3. It was found that the unit was

complying with the prescribed effluent norms except that there

were no flow measuring devices at the outlet of the ETP.


</p><p id="p_44">12. Still another affidavit was filed on behalf of the Board in

furtherance to the inspection conducted on 16th January, 2014

wherein it was observed that the unit was in operation and found

bypassing /discharging untreated effluent into mill's lagoons



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                  22</span>

of farmers.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">13. Consequently, on 10th February, 2014 the CPCB issued

show cause notice to M/s Simbhaoli Sugar Ltd. as to why the

unit be not ordered to be closed for all its manufacturing

operation till the direction contained in the order dated 10 th

August, 2011 are complied with, to its satisfaction. Objections

from the unit were invited. In this show cause notice and with

reference to different inspections, it was specifically stated that "it

is evident that the unit has not complied with the CPCB

directions dated 10th August 2011 and found discharging the

commissioned effluent exceeding prescribed limitations into the

Phuldera drain." It may be noticed that such high officials of

respective Boards not only filed inspection reports simplicitor, but

photographs showing various activities by this unit which were

generating pollution in both ground and surface water. The

analysis reports of the samples collected on 13th February, 2014

showed that the discharge levels were beyond the prescribed

limitations. Leachate along with run off rain water, stored into an

unlined pit near storage lagoons, showed very high quantity of

pollutants like pH 8.15 TSS (mg/l) 840, TDS (mg/l) 12280, BOD

(mg/l) 1700 and COD (mg/l) 5403. Deficiencies were noticed and

consequently, the sugar unit was directed to install incineration

boiler for spent wash management. It was directed to dismantle

unlined lagoons which had not also not been done up till then.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                  23</span>
 The unit was also directed to carry out monitoring of the impact

of using treated effluent for irrigation on the ground water

through the piezometric wells which had also not been installed.


</p><p id="p_47">14. Simultaneously, M/s Gopaljee Dairy Pvt. Ltd. was directed

to stabilize the aeration tank and maintain the desired level of

MLSS and to confer to the prescribed norms. It was contended on

behalf of the UPPCB that in view of persistent defaults on the part

of this unit, either the Tribunal may issue appropriate directions

or the unit should be ordered to be closed down.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">15. Respondent No. 7, Simbhaoli Sugar Mills, has filed various

affidavits in response to the main application filed by the

applicant. In its affidavit filed on 11th December, 2013 the stand

of the unit was that Simbhaoli distillery is one of the latest

industries in the area and was established in the year 1943. It is

situated in a low lying area along-side other nearby villages where

more than 250 families are residing. On the one side of the

factory, there are railway tracks and on the other side, there is

Nawada Road, an irrigation canal and then the Phuldera drain.

Agricultural land, residential houses, educational institutions,

and a Gurdwara are also situated in nearby vicinity. It is the case

of the Sugar unit that it is because of the low lying area, that the

domestic waste water from the habitants of worker's colony and

residents of nearby villages as well as rain water, flows into the

Phuldera   drain   through   a   pipeline   constructed   upon   the

Anoopshahar branch of the Ganga canal. This is in existence for a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                 24</span>
 long time. In replying to the allegation of brown colour of the

drain, it is stated that milky blackish water which is sometimes

observed in Phuldera drain is attributable to the flow of rain

water along with the domestic water of village situated near that

drain. The respondent unit claims to be regularly following all

rules and regulations and directions issued by the concerned

Boards and regional offices from time to time. This respondent

further states that they have already disconnected the starting

point of Phuldera drain from the factory side and information was

sent long back to the Board. It claims to have installed the MEE

after which it has full facility to control and treat the effluent. The

distillery effluent is properly treated to be discharged. It is

primarily treated for reducing its BOD, COD and obtained

methane gas is used in its boilers and then concentrated through

Reverse Osmosis Plant and MEE to achieve the required levels.

The effluents then is stored in lagoons and used in bio-

composting process for making good quality bio-manures. It is

stated that the allegation of contamination of ground water is

baseless and not supported by any evidence. For the period

starting from 1st October, 2010 to 30th September, 2013, the

unit of the respondent has earned Rs 293.43 lakhs after selling

5.24.730.65 quintals of organic bio-manure. It is further the case

of the said respondent unit that the Simbhaoli drain does not

exist and it is only the Phuldera drain which originates from

Phuldera village and carries domestic waste, rain water, village


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                  25</span>
 effluent and animal dung waste, as a number of villages are

situated near to this drain. In the study stated by the applicant

which was carried in 82 km stretch of upper Ganga River region

from Brijghat to Narora. The study was published in 2005. The

area was found to be rich in biodiversity. The area was declared

as Ramsar site where various species of dolphins and hundreds

of wetland birds and crocodiles etc. were recorded to be the part

of this biodiversity. This itself is a good evidence that units are

not polluting Ganga River and the allegation of pollution from

industries,   including   the   respondents   are   baseless.   The

respondent unit has adopted latest technology for producing

sulphur free refined sugar and sold under the brand name

TRUST and the customers of its refined sulphur free sugar are

IRCTC, Air India, Hotel Taj and many other organizations. All

these purchasers are quality sensitive. It is the case of the

respondent unit that since the sugar mill is producing sulphur

free refined sugar, now the question of gas emission arises no

more. Boiler of both the units are carrying stack monitoring as

per norms prescribed by the UPPCB and obtaining air consent

every year, to keep check on CO2 levels. The factory also carried

assessment of ground water quality near the sugar and distillery

units by a competent authority and the results have been found

to be within the parameters. In all, the answering respondent

state that they are not discharging any industrial effluent into the

Phuldera drain and that they have installed all the pollution


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                 26</span>
 control equipment/devices like anaerobic digesters for reduction

of COD and BOD level of effluent, reverse osmosis plant of 720 KL

and MEE having capacity 720 KL. The unit contended that the

samples collected and as disclosed in the articles published in

2010 in various newspapers, were without notice to the replying

respondent and they are even contrary to the facts existing on

site. Some photographs have been placed along with this reply to

show that the flooding takes place during the rainy season and

flooding the plant, machinery and the lagoons of the unit. In the

affidavit filed on 10th February, 2014, it is stated that the

Respondent unit had consent till the year 2013 and for the years

2014-2015, it has deposited the requisite fee and is awaiting

formal order. In furtherance of the order of the Tribunal dated

10th February, 2014, the Respondent unit had applied for renewal

of the consent. It is also averred that the Respondent unit

purchases/receives molasses and sends it for fermentation and

distillation in alcohol-manufacture division of the Distillery unit

and has provided details thereof. In its affidavit dated 3rd March,

2014, it was stated by the Respondent unit that the distillery unit

has disconnected and dismantled the pipeline existing within its

premises in the year 2008 after receipt of show cause notice dated

25th January, 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_50">
</p><p id="p_51">16. We may also notice here that surprisingly this Respondent

unit filed objection to the report prepared by the experts of the

CPCB and UPPCB on the basis of inspection visit held on 24th


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                27</span>
 February, 2014. It is stated that the report of the CPCB is not

sustainable and admissible as the visit was done ex parte and the

samples were taken in violation of the provisions of law. it is

submitted that while the visit was on 24th February, 2014, the

distillery unit of Respondent No. 2 had stopped operating and was

lying closed since 20th February, 2014 following the rejection of

consent by the CPCB vide order dated 17th February, 2014. There

was no discharge through concrete pipeline but still the

inspecting team went to notice that brown colour effluent was

seen in the Phuldera drain at the time of the inspection. It

specifically denied that it was found to be discharging untreated

effluent into the municipal drain which runs outside the

boundary of the unit. Still by another affidavit dated 20th March,

2014, it was stated by the replying respondent unit that analysis

reports and results cannot be relied upon which had been

collected by the team of experts on 13th February, 2014 as they

were not collected in accordance with law. It is stated that the

laboratory established and recognised by CPCB can only take

samples in the area situated in the Union Territory. Thus it finally

submitted that the joint inspection report dated 13/2/2014

conducted by the Respondent Boards cannot form the basis for

declining consent to the unit and the order declining consent

under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_23">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_24">Air Act</a> may be re-considered by the

Authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_52">
</p><p id="p_53">17. Like Respondent No. 7, Respondent No. 8 has also filed


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                 28</span>
 different affidavits. First affidavit by this respondent no. 8 i.e.

Gopaljee Dairy Food Pvt. Ltd. is dated 13th January, 2014. It is

stated that livelihood of about 1 lakh small farmers/family

members are dependent upon the answering Respondent as they

regularly supply raw milk to this unit. The unit claims to be

complying with all environmental laws and that it has installed all

devices and machineries which are required under the terms of

the consent given by the respective Boards. The unit also states

that it has installed ETP and it has full facility to control and treat

all its effluent to bring the desired parameters. According to this

respondent also, the Simbhaoli drain does not exist and there is

only the Phuldera drain in which villages discharge domestic and

other wastes. It is not contaminated because of discharge from the

respondent unit and that reports which found pollutants in the

River Ganga are because of other factors and not as a result of

effluents   being   discharged   by    the   Respondent    Unit.   The

Respondent unit got its effluents analysed by EKO PRO Engineers

Pvt. Ltd. on 30th October, 2013 from the ETP installed and reports

were found to be satisfactory.
</p>
<p id="p_54">
</p><p id="p_55">18. In the affidavit dated 18th February, 2014, respondent no. 8

stated that earlier it was running its dairy on the basis of the

lease taken by M/s. Milan Dairy Foods Pvt. Ltd. but in 2008 the

unit was brought under the umbrella of M/s. Gopaljee Dairy Food

Pvt. Ltd. It was given consent to establish in the year 1983 which

was renewed from time to time. The unit was given consent to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                  29</span>
 operate from year to year basis.      It had applied for seeking

consent of the UPPCB to operate in December 2013 for the year

2014-15 which is stated to be pending with the respondent-Board.

Further, it is averred that the unit completely understands its

corporate social responsibility and has been involved in recycling

of water, thereby continuously endeavouring to reduce the water

extraction from the earth.   The milk silos are cleaned through

automatic centralized CIP System and the CIP solution is collected

and re-circulated through close pipelines in CIP tanks and only a

small quantity of pre-rinsed water is wasted/drained.


</p><p id="p_56">19. This respondent also disputes the finding returned by the

Joint Inspection Team comprising of Member Secretary, CPCB

and the Member Secretary, UPPCB, on 13th February, 2014 as

well as the result of the water analysis taken by them.       With

reference to the various tests conducted by the UPPCB and

certain tests that the said respondent got conducted from the

laboratories recognised by the MoEF, attempt is made to show

that the unit is not causing any serious pollution.       Further,

according to this respondent, it has requested the UPPCB and the

Nagar Palika to allow disposal of ETP water in the sewer lines.

The Nagar Palika had in turn written to respondent no.6.

However, the matter is pending with the Board for a period of

nearly two years. In another affidavit dated 3rd March, 2014, it is

averred by respondent no. 8 that the sample has been collected by

the joint inspection team in violation of the provisions of law and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                30</span>
 the results thereof cannot be relied upon by the Tribunal. It is the

case of respondent no. 8 that since the inspection team itself

noticed that the MNSS records the reading of 3109 mg per unit,

which itself show that the BOD, COD would remain within the

parameters prescribed.     The action plan within the acceptable

operating range indicates a healthy aeration system capable of

achieving the prescribed norms for effluent quality. It is important

to note that the affidavit file by the Respondent No. 3 and 6 clearly

observes that the ETP was properly functioning. Respondent no.3,

on the basis of the inspection conducted on 3rd December, 2013

had issued the directions on 10th February, 2014 and the

compliance report was required to be filed within 60 days. This

was complied with and the respondent claims to have submitted

the compliance even prior to the expiry of 60 days vide letter dated

26th February, 2014 wherein they even requested to conduct re-

inspection of the premises.
</p>
<p id="p_57">
</p><p id="p_58">20. Still another affidavit dated 12th March, 2014 was filed on

behalf of respondent no.8. There the respondent stated that vide

letter dated 28th February, 2014, Respondent No.6 has declined

the consent to operate under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_25">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_26">26</a> of the Water Act on

the ground referred to in the joint inspection report dated 13th

February, 2013. The consent to operate was also declined under

the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_27">Air Act</a>. It further stated that it was taking all steps to further

improve the ETP functioning.           It proposes to construct an

additional oil and waste trap to reduce the load on the operational


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                  31</span>
 ETP. The sludge generated during centrifugal separation of milk

shall now be collected and sold to poultry farm as poultry feed, as

the sludge is nothing else but milk solids that is, protein,

carbohydrate etc.   The water used in bottled rinsing/ washing

shall be re-used in crate washer for washing the crates. Paneer

milking water was to be re-utilized for reconsideration of skimmed

milk powder after reprocessing it. An additional tank of 1 lakh ltr.

capacity is also planned to be installed at the ETP, to store

effluent up to 12 hours to ensure maximum retention and

maximum efficiency in ETP.      For this, the said respondent had

prayed for grant of four months time and after these modifications

it was stated that the unit would be absolutely pollution free and

would be a no discharge unit.
</p>
<p id="p_59">
Discussion on prevention and control of water and air
pollution by these units in furtherance to the directions
issued by respondents no.3 and 6 during the pendency of the
application :
</p>
<p id="p_60">
</p><p id="p_61">21. Having discussed the stand of the various parties to the lis,

now we have to dwell upon the cumulative effect of the pleaded

cases upon environmental issues, falling for consideration of the

Tribunal.   Since a specific case had been made out by the

applicant duly supported by Respondent no.3 and 6 as well as the

various inspection/analysis reports stating that respondents no.7

and 8 are polluting units. Respondent no.7, particularly, appears

to be a serious polluter and is responsible for polluting the

ground/surface water. We will now be discussing in some detail,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                 32</span>
 the extent of quantitative and qualitative pollution caused by this

unit in the later part of this judgement. At this stage, we must

notice that both the respondent nos.7 and 8 had, during the

pendency of the application, somewhat shifted their stand and

they came forward to take further steps and installed anti

pollution devices to ensure further prevention and control of

pollution in the interest of environment. As is evident from the

affidavits filed by the respective respondents, both respondents

had taken steps to improve performances of their anti-pollution

devices. These respondents not only made improvements in

existing devices but even made additions to ensure further

reduction in the pollutants resulting from their respective

activities.
</p>
<p id="p_62">
</p><p id="p_63">22. On 12th February, 2014, the Tribunal after hearing the

counsel for the parties at great length noticed that according to

the CPCB there is a pipeline laid down till Phuldera drain which

ultimately meets Ganga, by which the effluents are discharged by

respondent no.7.     In the consent application filed, it had been

stated by these units that they are discharging the trade effluents

on their own land.    Expressing dissatisfaction over the conduct

and records of the UPPCB, a query was also put to this Board as

to why despite persistent and admitted defaults since the year

2010, consents had been renewed by the said Board.             The

Tribunal therefore constituted a special inspection team headed

by the Member Secretary of the Central Pollution Control Board


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                 33</span>
 and Member Secretary of the UPPCB to inspect the premises and

submit a report in relation to both respondents no.7 and 8.


</p><p id="p_64">23. Further direction was issued in the said order to report if

both these units had complied with the directions that had been

issued by the Boards, right from the year 2010, at least.            A

number of deficiencies had been pointed out by the respective

Boards, which were noticed in the order of the Tribunal dated 12th

March, 2014.     There it was pointed out that even the maps

submitted by the project proponent which are placed on record

before the Tribunal, were not depicting the correct position at site.

The State of Uttar Pradesh as well as the CPCB pointed out the

following shortcomings and objections:-
</p>
<p id="p_65">
   "According to the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board inter
   alia but primarily following are the main shortcomings:
      i. The concrete pipeline should be demolished from sump
      well as shown in the map (it is the sump well of the
      Project Proponent itself and the pump adjacent thereto to
      Phuldera drain should be
      demolished).
</p><p id="p_66">      ii. MEE should be made operative to its optimum
      capacity.
</p><p id="p_67">      iii. Incinerator should be installed to incinerate the wasta
      and to ensure no discharge.
</p><p id="p_68">      iv. The Project Proponent should have its own STP for its
      domestic discharge of the colonies of its employees.


   According to the Learned Counsel appearing for the Central
   Pollution Control Board in relation to the above they have the
   following objections:
</p><p id="p_69">      i. There should be a separate settling tank and lagoon
         should not be used for settling of the effluents.
      ii. Lagoon capacity should be ensured on 30 days basis.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                 34</span>
       iii. The leachates are being stored in an unlined tank thus
           causing pollution of the underground water."
</p>
<p id="p_70">
</p><p id="p_71">24. Vide order dated 24th March, 2014, the Tribunal directed the

concerned engineers of the respective Boards and the project

proponent to prepare a Joint report in regard to some of the

material issues, which had been stated in the order, that is,

blockage of drains, not the main drain at Points B and C of the

Map prepared by the UPPCB, establishment of STP, installation of

incinerators, raising of the effluent from Lagoons to the fields for

agricultural purposes and possible points of discharge in the

Phuldera drain.    Persistently, there had been serious disputes

regarding installation of anti-pollution devices and measures and

the above issues remaining unresolved over a considerable period

of time   and more     particularly, the fact that the project

proponent/Units had been claiming that they had been taking

anti-pollution measures effectively and they were not polluting the

surface/ground water.       To put an end to this persistent

controversy and to ensure that the environmental interest does

not suffer any further and the matters are dealt with in their

correct perspective expeditiously, the Tribunal on that date also

directed that the Hon'ble Expert Members of the Tribunal would

visit the site on the date and time convenient to them.


</p><p id="p_72">25. The provisions of Section 19 of the NGT Act state that the

Tribunal is empowered to regulate its own procedure and is to be

guided by the principles of natural justice. In terms of Section


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                 35</span>
 19(4)(c) of the NGT Act, the Tribunal has the same powers for

issuance of Commission as are vested in a civil court under the

Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (for short 'the CPC') while trying a

suit. The Bench of the Tribunal consists of Judicial as well as

Expert Members. Thus, wherever it considers it appropriate and

in the interest of justice, the Tribunal can direct inspection by the

Court/Tribunal as is even contemplated under Order XVIII Rule

18 of the CPC.       The Members can prepare an inspection

note/memorandum, which would be part of the records. Such an

approach has been adopted by the Tribunal even in other cases.

The order of the Tribunal directing inspection by Expert Members

has been upheld by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 8781-

83/2013 titled Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests v. Nirma Ltd. and

Ors. decided on 4th August, 2014 where the Supreme Court held

as under: -
</p>
<p id="p_73">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">      "The primary challenge appears to be in respect of the
      determination of the National Green Tribunal
      (hereinafter referred to as 'the Tribunal') requiring two of
      its technical members to J.S. visit the site, and make a
      report after carrying out a personal inspection thereof.
      We find nothing wrong with the above procedure
      adopted by the Tribunal. The aforesaid procedure is
      well-known to law and is also contemplated under Order
      XVIII Rule 18 of the CPC."
</blockquote><p id="p_74">26. In furtherance to the order of the Tribunal dated 24 th March,

2013, the Expert Members of the Tribunal visited the units of

M/s. Simbhaoli Sugar and Distillery Units as well as Gopaljee

Dairy. As already noticed, the Member Secretary of the UPPCB as

well as the CPCB had visited the sites of these units and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                 36</span>
 submitted a report over which the industries had expressed

certain reservations on the ground that their concerns had not

been duly addressed.          Thus, considering the submission of the

parties and even with their consent, order dated 24th March, 2013

was passed.         Three Expert Members of the Tribunal visited the

site   on    29th    March,    2014   to   assess   the   adequacy   and

appropriateness of all the anti pollution measures taken by the

industries and by giving due considerations to the ground

situation.
</p>
<p id="p_75">
</p><p id="p_76">       The report prepared by the Expert Members was placed on

record of the file and copies provided to all the parties.


</p><p id="p_77">27. In the report, the Expert Members noticed various defects

and shortfalls in the functioning of these units and that they still

were a source of serious pollution. It was particularly noticed that

the effluents flowing in Phuldera drain was having high level of

pollution and that such level of pollution was not possible,

especially the BOD, COD and TDS, except due to discharge of

sugar mill effluents. The anaerobic digestors were not operating

satisfactorily as the BOD was still 12,042 mg per litre.             The

samples collected from the Phuldera drain showed TDS 8920

mg/l, BOD 661 mg/l and COD 6926 mg/l.                       Such highly

concentrated pollutants would only result from a sugar factory

and not even from any sewage discharge. The distillery unit had

provided treatment facility but the treatment units were not

adequately working. The concept of Zero Liquid Discharge was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                      37</span>
 also not adhered to. The unit had no separate arrangement for

collection, treatment and disposal of leachate and storm water,

therefore, the entire storm runoff gets contaminated by spent

wash, press mud or bio-compost as it is all in open and is exposed

to rain. The sugar mill ETP was found to be operational, however,

the lagoon receiving its treated effluent was having very high level

of pollution. The RO Plant was not operating for which the excuse

given was that of team shortage, which found no favour with the

Expert Members as the Unit could always provide external source

of energy to clean the water and avoid continuous pollution. The

Expert Members, taking advantage of the site inspection even

provided a "way ahead", giving different suggestions and steps

that the Unit should undertake to ensure no pollution. Out of the

14 suggestions made, 13 related to the Simbhaoli Sugar Mills and

Distillery Unit for preventing and controlling the pollution

resulting from their activities.          Only Suggestion 14 related to

Gopaljee Dairy where they were required to establish an

automatic continuous online monitoring system for assessing the

quality   of   final   effluent,   using     some   important   indicator

parameters. It was also suggested that the data transmitted to the

UPPCB and CPCB should be reviewed by these Boards and all

abnormal situations should be brought to the knowledge of the

industry along with corrective measures.

reference to the report submitted by the Member Secretaries of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                     38</span>
 the respective Boards as well as the suggestions that had been

advanced by the learned Expert Members of the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_80">29. Having considered various aspects, the reports on record

and the extent of pollution that was resulting from the activities of

these respondents no.7 and 8 respectively, vide a detailed order

dated 31st May, 2014, the Tribunal passed the following directions

in relation to respondent no.7 in paragraph 8 of the order, which

reads as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_81">
  "After hearing the parties we found it necessary and
  formulated the following directions to be complied to remedy
  the problems and directed them to be considered in the
  meeting after furnishing copies of the same to all the
  concerned:
</p><p id="p_82">  i.     The Unit shall operate the various plants/ equipment in
         a manner that the performance standards in relation to
         environmental norms are complied with. For example,
         primary treatment i.e. digesters is expected to achieve
         BOD level of 4000 mg/L against which the present level
         of BOD achieved from digester is about 12042 mg/L.
         Therefore, the unit should immediately improve the
         performance of anaerobic digester by upgrading it or
         installing the new ones. Similarly, the industry should
         have adequate capacity for achieving desired
         concentration of the entire spent wash through RO and
         MEE.
</p>
<p id="p_83">
  ii.    After concentration, the spent wash should be
         incinerated for which the unit should make
         arrangements for co-processing with cement plant or
         should install its own incinerator with boiler apropos to
         its requirement. The excuses for poor performance of
         any of the units based on non- availability of biogas,
         effluent quantity or any other reason should not be
         permitted.
</p><p id="p_84">  iii.   The    industry  should     dismantle  all by-pass
         arrangements both in distillery and sugar unit
         including concrete channel crossing Gang canal,
         pipelines  and   portable/fixed   pumping  network


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                 39</span>
         immediately. All underground by-pass arrangements
        should also be dismantled.
</p><p id="p_85">iv.     The industry should plan and construct a well-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">        designed viable arrangement for draining the run-off
        water only from their area (both sugar and distillery
        units) which in any case should not mix with domestic
        or industrial effluent /leachate or compost/press mud
        or any other solid wastes.
</blockquote><p id="p_86">v.      Since, the present compost plant is exposed to the
        rainwater and is causing serious rainwater pollution;
        this plant should be closed down immediately. The
        industry should make arrangement for incineration of
        their concentrated effluents to achieve zero discharge.
vi.     The sugar unit should dismantle the unlined lagoon
        which in any case is on the other side of National
        Highway and hence no possibilities exist for repair and
        maintenance of the underground pipeline that transfers
        treated effluent from its ETP.
</p><p id="p_87">vii.    The ETP of the sugar unit should be operated round
        the clock in a manner that the prescribed
        environmental standards for effluent discharge are
        strictly adhered to.
</p><p id="p_88">viii.   Upon dismantling of all underground and surface
        bypass arrangement and segregating the storm water
        mixing with effluent, the industry should conceive and
        construct drain/pipe network for discharge of treated
        effluent to Phuldera drain such that the same could be
        utilized for irrigation purposes, if needed.
</p><p id="p_89">ix.     For the purposes of achieving desired output, the
        industry can take help from Irrigation &amp; PH and Public
        Works Departments for obtaining technically viable
        options.
</p><p id="p_90">x.      Both the units should have online automatic
        monitoring arrangements for compliance of adherence
        to environmental standards. For this facility of
        transmission of real time data on BOD/COD/TOC,
        Turbidity and Conductivity should be created for
        Digester, RO, MEE, and ETP. These units should also
        be connected to power backup such that these are
        operating even during power failure. The data
        transmitted to the UP-PCB and CPCB should be
        reviewed by 10 these Boards and all abnormal
        situations should be brought to the knowledge of the
        industry along with corrective measures.
</p>
<p id="p_91">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                               40</span>
   xi.     The units (both sugar and distillery) should reduce its
          water consumption as per the national norms. At
          present, the units are drawing substantial ground
          water for which online water consumption meter
          should be installed and accordingly, the water cess
          should be levied.
</p><p id="p_92">  xii.    The entire stretches of Phuldera drain from distillery
          unit upto its confluence with Siana Escape Canal
          should be properly dredged and aligned to clear any
          leachate/ sludge deposition.
</p><p id="p_93">  xiii.   The industry should submit an action plan
          incorporating the above suggestions along with time
          line. The renewal of consent and permission to operate
          shall be considered only after the action plan and
          implementation schedule are found satisfactory.
  xiv.    The sugar and distillery industry should be asked to
          pay appropriate cost for environmental damages for
          causing water pollution all these years.
</p>
<p id="p_94">
</p><p id="p_95">30. After the Tribunal had passed the above directions for

compliance by the unit, it was contended on behalf of Respondent

No. 7 that they would be able to comply with the directions of the

Tribunal and install appropriate anti-pollution devices with the

exception of a few directions, which according to the unit could

not be complied with due to economic considerations or because it

was not within their authority to comply with them. These aspects

also came to be examined by the Tribunal on subsequent

hearings.
</p>
<p id="p_96">
</p><p id="p_97">31. After the visit of the Expert Members and passing of the

directions by the Tribunal vide its order dated 31st May, the

UPPCB filed an affidavit dated 23rd July, 2014 stating that

separate water drain should be constructed and till that is done,

the unit should not be permitted to operate. The Board officers


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                 41</span>
 had visited the unit on 5th July, 2014 and found that cleaning of

bio-compost yard has not been done despite the fact that the

rainy season was approaching. According to the Board, the unit

should also be directed to collect all processed polluted effluents

effectively in lagoons and treat it with RO and MEE plant. They

should not be permitted to discharge the effluents directly into the

drain and in any case not before the effluent was fully treated

through separate ETP. At that point of time, the unit had not

installed any ETP. The unit should also get the concrete pipeline

demolished and no effluent generated in distillery should be

discharged outside the premises. Lastly, it was stated that the

Board has already refused consent to operate to the unit in terms

of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_28">Section 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_29">26</a> of the Water Act.
</p>
<p id="p_98">
</p><p id="p_99">32. The CPCB also filed a rejoinder affidavit dated 17th

September, 2014, dealing with the contentions raised by the unit.

Firstly, it was noticed that real progress in the field has not been

made in the matters of laying of alternative pipelines for storm

water discharge and installation of STP. The unit is not complying

with the environmental norms and it was necessary for the unit to

install incinerators. Reference was made to the 147th meeting of

the CPCB held on 23rd May, 2008 where after considering the

recommendations and the problems of pollution resulting from

distillery unit, it was stated that treatment methods of composting

from irrigation and one time land application of spent wash vis-a-

vis emerging technologies including evaporation, concentration


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                 42</span>
 and incineration of concentrated spent wash of power generation,

were discussed. It was decided that the existing distilleries (both

stand alone and those attached with sugar units) that are not

complying with the required environmental standards may be

asked to switch over to emerging technologies from existing

technologies of composting, ferti-irrigation and one time land

application of spent wash in a time bound manner by installation

of incinerator etc. As the unit was found not complying with the

environmental standard despite repeated directions, it was

directed that it must install incinerator as it was essential for

spent wash treatment. The CPCB had also stated that the

incinerator is a better technology to bio-composting for treatment

of spent wash because bio-composting of spent wash creates

certain other adverse effects on the environment. The latest trend

according to the Board for solving the problem is by adoption of

incinerators. Respondent No. 7 made an attempt before the

Tribunal to demonstrate that it had made progress towards the

compliance of the directions contained in the order of the Tribunal

dated 31st May, 2014 by filing an affidavit dated 5th September,

2014. In this affidavit it was contended that definite progress has

been made by respondent No. 7 towards laying of pipeline under

the existing railway track and that it has written to the Railways

for permission for drilling and laying underground pipeline, which

they are likely to resolve shortly. It is also averred by Respondent

No. 7 that it has commenced the process of thorough cleaning of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                 43</span>
 Phuldera drain and had issued the work order to M/s Hariom

Builders on 21st August, 2014 in that regard. The work is likely to

be completed by 20th September, 2014. The unit also claims that

it   has   undertaken   detailed    discussion   with   agencies   for

installation of STP. The work would be awarded in consultation

with the Pollution Control Boards which is likely to commence

shortly.
</p>
<p id="p_100">
</p><p id="p_101">33. In regard to installation of incinerators, it is the stand of the

unit that since it is already using technologies of bio-composting

and bio-methanation, it may be permitted to continue with the

same and achieve Zero Liquid Discharge through it and if after an

assessment of the Pollution Control Boards, the unit is unable to

achieve Zero Liquid Discharge then the unit may consider

implying alternative suitable technology. It was also stated that

the Ministry has permitted use of alternative suitable technology

to incinerators, even in the recent time by permitting bio-

composting process to other units. We have already noticed above

the stand of respective Boards in regard to the points raised by

the unit. After noticing persistent default and the resulting

pollution, certainly there is need for stringent measures to be

taken by the unit before it can really be permitted to recommence

its production and operate both sugar and distillery units.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                   44</span>
 Why Incinerator


</p><p id="p_102">34. Under clause 2 and 5 of Para 8 of the order dated 31st May,

2014, the Tribunal had directed that the unit should incinerate its

spent wash and concentrate effluents to achieve zero discharge. At

that stage also Respondent No. 7 had submitted that installation

of incinerator may not be insisted as it will cause unnecessary

functional difficulties to the unit and when most of the industries

have not installed incinerators, it would be a discriminatory

direction against it. Further, the unit also stated that process of

bio-composting was effectively functioning, thus, raising no

occasion for issuance of such direction. The respective Pollution

Control Boards had taken up the stand that in view of the

persisted defaults, pollution is being caused by the unit and since

better technologies like incinerators are available, the unit should

be directed to install incinerator and attain Zero Liquid Discharge.


</p><p id="p_103">35. The Tribunal in its order had clearly noticed that there

cannot be a negative discrimination in law and furthermore,

economic burden per se cannot be raised as a tenable plea for

preventing   and   controlling   excessive   pollution   caused   by

Respondent No. 7 by its activities. There was definite damage and

degradation of environment. The right of Respondent No. 7 to run

its business is subject to reasonable restrictions, provided by law

viz by environmental laws to ensure that the prescribed

parameters are adhered to and water and air quality is

maintained. Findings of various analysis reports clearly show

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                 45</span>
 serious pollution being caused by this Respondent No. 7 and

particularly the fact that Phuldera drain was highly polluted and

its water colour has changed to brown by excessive pollutants

being continuously discharged into the drain. Various inspecting

teams of highly qualified persons constituted from time to time

consistently had found pollution of ground and surface water and

air pollution being caused by this unit and that it was discharging

its untreated effluents into Phuldera drain. The Tribunal directed

Respondent No. 7 to comply with all the directions contained

under para 8 of the order dated 31st May, 2014.
</p>
<p id="p_104">
Having heard again all the stake holders, we do not find any merit

in the twin reasons advanced on behalf of the unit for not

installing incinerators. Firstly that it will be a serious financial

burden on the unit to install and operate incinerators is a

contention devoid of any substance. No unit can be permitted to

cause   pollution   of   water   and   air   and   more   particularly

continuously. This unit has operated both its sugar and distillery

units for more than 80 years with definite evidence on record to

show that it has been causing pollution right from the year when

the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_30">Water Act</a> of 1974 came into force and in         any case since

1986. Repeated directions issued by the respective Boards fail to

yield any result. The unit persisted with default with impunity.

The stand of the unit that it was not discharging any untreated

effluent, had been found to be factually incorrect and there is

definite evidence on record that the unit is discharging its


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                  46</span>
 untreated effluents into Phuldera drain and finally polluting river

Ganga. Defaults on the part of the industries were noticed in

various fields. The numerous directions issued by the Board from

time to time had not been fully and satisfactorily complied with.

The unit is a regular source of pollution till the time it achieves

Zero Liquid Discharge. It cannot be stated that the unit would

become a compliant or non-polluting unit. The plea of financial

burden cannot be permitted to raise as a defence for non-

compliance of law particularly, in the field of environment and

secondly, such financial implication is indispensable part of the

Corporate Social Responsibility of this unit. The other contention

that   Board   and    or   MoEF        have   even   permitted   other

sugar/distillery industries to adopt the process of bio-composting

and bio-methanation, suggesting that the imposition of condition

of installation of incinerators is not necessary and is not

uniformly complied. This contention is also without merit. Firstly,

no person can claim negative discrimination and secondly,

imposition of conditions by the respective authorities while

granting consent to a unit to operate has to be decided on case to

case basis. It will depend upon technical data, location, activity of

the unit and capacity of the unit to adhere to the prescribed norm

that would amongst others be the criteria for granting and/or

refusing consent to a unit. It was rightly contended by the

Learned Counsel appearing for the various authorities that this

would depend on the facts and circumstances of the present case.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                  47</span>
 There cannot be a hard and fast rule for imposition of the

conditions uniformly as various factories come into play while

considering the application of the unit for grant of consent to

operate.
</p>
<p id="p_105">
</p><p id="p_106">     In the present case, it is an admitted position that the area

of the unit is a low lying area and is surrounded by railway, road

and canal on other side of the plot. This low lying area has been,

according to Respondent No. 7, responsible for flooding of the area

and thus, getting the molasses, spent wash and the press mud

etc. getting mixed up with the flood water and thus, polluting both

the surface and ground water. Despite its efforts, the unit has

failed to become zero liquid discharge unit now for years. The unit

cannot claim a right to pollute the environment indiscriminately

and in perpetuity.
</p>
<p id="p_107">
</p><p id="p_108">36. Even the documents published by the CPCB on corporate

<p id="p_110">   The road map for utilization of spent wash by the distilleries
   to achieve zero discharge in inland surface water courses
   will be as below:

     Till 100 % utilization of spentwash is achieved, controlled
   and restricted discharge of treated effluent from lined
   lagoons during rainy season will be allowed by SPCB/CPCB
   in such a way that the perceptible colouring of river water
   bodies does not occur."
</p>
<p id="p_112">37. This very document further provides that monitoring is

essential and feasibility study for adoption of cleaner technologies

should be undertaken. The bare reading of the above shows that

anyone or a combination of the technologies stated above can be

provided by the Board to ensure adherence to the prescribed

standards.
</p>
<p id="p_113">
</p><p id="p_114">     In light of the above, now we may consider the reasons for

passing the direction for installation of incinerator:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">      a. "Apart from the view of the Expert Inspection Team of
      NGT, MoEF, CPCB and UPPCB have also recommended
      that the Unit should not resume its production without
      installing incinerator.
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                   49</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">       b. UPPCB has a right to make the standards more
      stringent if situation demand so (we may refer to MoEF
      Notification in this regard). We see therefore full
      justification in their stand in the present situation, where
      the unit is located in low lying area and close to Ganga
      River, which is very important river for the country and it
      cannot be allowed to continue its pollution in larger
      interest of society.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_34">      c. The contention related to affordably of cost of
      incinerator of the order of Rs 20 crores, we are of the
      opinion that there are more than 50 sugar and distillery
      plants in the country who already adopted this
      technology. The Unit can always increase the cost of
      alcohol to compensate part of the investment and part of
      it can be recovered through electricity and fertilizer
      generated out of incinerator. The unit can also claim
      carbon credit. This will be beneficial in long term.
      d. We are afraid that under the circumstances, the unit
      can be allowed to operate even at a reduced capacity
      without any time bound commitment for compliance of
      directions as mentioned in our interim order in para
      8(xiii)"</blockquote><p id="p_115">


</p><p id="p_116">     Besides the above compelling reasons for installation of

incinerator, there are definite benefits in addition to control of

pollution which inter alia are:
</p>
<p id="p_117">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">      a. "55 to 60 % solids concentrate of spent wash powder

<p id="p_118">38. Having found no merit in the contentions raised on behalf of

Respondent No. 7 either on law or on the facts of the case, we


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                  50</span>
 thus directed the unit to install incinerators to treat its effluents

discharge and the spent wash and achieve zero discharge within a

period of 6 months from the date of passing of this order.

However, if the unit within three months from the date of passing

of the order is able to attain zero liquid discharge for the

installed/sanctioned capacity, whichever is higher as well as fully

complies with the directions issued by the respective Boards and

as contained in the order of the Tribunal dated 31st May, 2014,

we grant liberty to the unit to move the CPCB as well as UPPCB

for grant of permission to operate without installing incinerators.

In that event alone, an inspection shall be conducted by Member,

Secretary, CPCB, Member Secretary, UPPCB and a representative

(Sr. Scientist, MoEF) from the Ministry of Environment and

Forests, on the request of the unit and then recommend to the

Tribunal if there is any possibility of accepting such a request of

the unit for non-installation of incinerators. The report that would

be   submitted    to   the   Tribunal   shall   be   complete    and

comprehensive report in relation to all matters including zero

liquid discharge and compliance of all other conditions.


Continuous Environmental Pollution caused by Respondent

No. 7, Breach of Precautionary Principle and its Resulting

liability on the Polluter Pays Principle


</p><p id="p_119">39. There is ample documentary evidence in the form of

affidavits, inspection reports and analysis reports to show that

Respondent No. 7 is not only been a source of continuous

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                 51</span>
 pollution particularly surface and ground water but also failed to

take precautions of its own accord and even in terms of the

directions issued by the respective Board from time to time. Thus,

it has endorsed itself to incurring a liability for relief and

compensation    for   causing   damage   and   for   restitution   of

environment in the concerned areas.
</p>
<p id="p_120">
</p><p id="p_121">40. Undisputed facts, as they emerged from the records, are that

the sugar unit was established and is operating since 1933 while

its distillery unit started its operation in the year 1940.

Apparently, it had taken no environmental precautions. However,

with the coming into force of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_31">Water Act</a> in the year 1974, the

said Act noticed problem of the pollution of rivers and stream

which had assumed importance and urgency in those areas as a

result of growth of industries and increasing tendency to

urbanization. The purpose was to ensure that domestic and

industrial effluents are not allowed to be discharged into water

sources without adequate treatment. <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_32">Section 24</a> of the Water Act

mandates that no person shall knowingly cause or permit any

poisonous, noxious or polluting matter determined in accordance

with such standards as may be laid down by the State Board to

enter into any stream or well. Violation thereof was made

punishable under the Act. <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_33">Section 25</a> of the said Act further

provided that no person shall, without the previous consent of

the State Board, establish or take any steps to establish any unit,

operation or process, or any treatment and disposal system or any


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                 52</span>
 extension or addition thereto, which is likely to discharge sewage

or trade effluent into a stream or well etc. It also prohibited any

person bringing into use of any new or altered outlet for discharge

of sewage and/or beginning to make any new discharge of sewage.

The application for obtaining consent from the Board was required

to be moved by such person and was to be dealt with by the Board

in accordance with the provisions of the Act, default thereof was

made punishable. <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_34">Section 26</a> of the Act required that Where

immediately before the commencement of this Act any person was

discharging any sewage or trade effluent into a stream or well or

sewer or on land, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_35">section 25</a> shall, so far as may,

apply in relation to such person as they apply in relation to the

person referred to in that section subject to the modification that

the application for consent be made under sub-section (2) of that

section within a period of three months of the constitution of the

Board. Of Course, this was amended by Act 44 of 78 to be the

date as may be specified by the State Government. On the plain

reading of the above provisions, it is clear that it was obligatory on

the part of Respondent No. 7 to obtain consent of the Board

within three months from the date the Board was constituted. It is

the duty of every person, certainly of any unit, dealing with sugar

manufacturing industry having distillery unit to comply with the

environmental requirements without default and delay, which the

unit, Respondent No. 7, failed to comply. It has been brought to

our notice on behalf of the UPPCB that the Respondent No. 7 had


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                  53</span>
 not obtained consent of the Board till the year 1991. During the

period 1992 to 1999, the unit had applied for obtaining the

consent of the Board but the consent was not granted. Thereafter

additional consent to operate was granted and the unit is

operating from 2000 onwards but violation of the conditions

imposed in the consent orders, passed from time to time.


</p><p id="p_122">41. The UPPCB as back as on 15th December, 1986 filed an

application before the special judicial court in Lucknow, Uttar

Pradesh submitting that the unit was operating without consent

or discharging its untreated effluent resulting in pollution of the

surface and ground water. It was stated in that application that

notices have been given to the unit, further that a sample was

collected as per the analyst report BOD was found to be 1266.7

mg/l while COD was 2866.7 mg/l and even other parameters

which are quite in excess of the prescribed parameters.       Even

other parameters were found to be beyond prescribed standards.

An application for obtaining consent has been moved. The special

court vide its letter dated 25th October, 1991 directed the unit to

discharge its trade effluent only in accordance with the prescribed

standards specified by the Board and also directed the UPPCB to

inspect the units from time to time to ensure compliance.

Documents have been placed on record to show that the consent

had been refused even in the year 1992 as the parameters were

found to be excessive. Test report dated 29th June, 1996 showed

the following violative parameter:
</p>
<p id="p_123">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                 54</span>

      and
      SS of 450 mg/l - Against the standard of 100 mg/l."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_124">42. Further, from the record, it appears that in view of persistent

default and non-compliance of the unit, Respondent No. 7, the

Board vide its order dated 2nd July, 1996 for the first time passed

a closure order of the unit due to unsatisfactory performance of

effluent discharge resulting in pollution of ground water source

and unsafe disposal of hot ash. At the request of the unit, this

closure order was suspended on 30th July, 1996 and the unit was

permitted to resume its production capacity which was reduced

from 60 KL/day to 30 KL/day. Finally the Board revoked the

order of closure by additional order dated 21st March, 1997.

Subsequently the effluent samples that were taken on 9th June,

1997 were found to be violative of the prescribed parameters.

Therefore, the Board refused to grant consent to operate vide

order dated 27th August, 1997. On 26th September, 1998, the unit

again applied for consent which was refused. The BOD was found

to be 960 mg/l and thus, the consent was again declined vide

order dated 28th May, 1999. In face of the assurance for

compliance given by the unit and it having furnished the requisite

bank guarantee as required by the Board on 25th March, 2000

having established a bio-compost plant along with storage and the

consent to operate was granted to the unit. In violation to the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                55</span>
 conditions of the consent order, the industries were discharging

effluents into the drain. The bank guarantee furnished was

returned to the unit for revalidation.
</p>
<p id="p_125">
</p><p id="p_126">43. The unit was subjected to inspection by the concerned

authorities even in the year 2006, when it was found that the

conditions of the consent order had not been complied and the

unit was still persisting with serious environmental pollution

issues. Inter alia it was stated (a) colour of the water was brown,

</p><p id="p_127">(b) bio-compost plant was not working satisfactorily, (c) the

pipeline had not been dismantled/removed. We may also notice

that vide letters dated 26th September, 1998 and 28th May, 1999,

the consent applied for was refused for the years 1998 and 1999

respectively. It was upon installation of bio-compost plants that

the consent was granted, conditions of which again was not

adhered to by the unit. Show cause notice was issued on 8 th May,

2002 bringing to the notice of the unit the violation and

requirement to furnish the bank guarantee. The consent was

again granted on 24th May, 2003 permitting the unit to increase

its production capacity to 90 KLD provided, they become zero

discharge unit through bio-composting method. At that Stage, the

CPCB came into picture and issued directions under <a href="/doc/68540/" id="a_36">Section 5</a> of

the 1986 Act on 17th May, 2006 and 16th May, 2007 requiring

installation of MEE plant. Since there was breach of conditions

imposed and directions issued the bank guarantee of Rs 30000

was forfeited on 29th January, 2008. After RO plant was installed


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                 56</span>
 along with MEE, consent was again granted with a clear

stipulation that effluent discharged up to Phuldera drain shall be

removed and new MEE would be installed in view of the fact that

the existing MEE was not working efficiently. Emphasis was again

laid on zero discharge.
</p>
<p id="p_128">
</p><p id="p_129">44. The unit was inspected by the officials of the Regional Office

of the UPPCB on 8th January, 2010 reiterating the conditions

earlier imposed and the unit was called upon to furnish a bank

guarantee of Rs 5 lakhs. The unit was required to restrict

production in such a way that effluent is consumed through bio-

composting or stored in lagoon till they restart MEE or install

additional RO. The unit was specifically directed to disconnect the

pipeline up to Phuldera drain and become zero liquid discharge.

The unit was again inspected by the District Level Committee as

per District Magistrate orders dated 29th October, 2010 on 21st

December, 2010, 30th December, 2010, 18th January, 2011, 28th

January, 2011. Upon inspection on 19th May, 2011 it was found

that the unit was operating the RO plant and bio-composting

plant and MEE was not operated. The CPCB also issued directions

on 10th August, 2011 which were incorporated by the UPPCB as

well. Again unit was inspected by the Regional Offices of the

Board on 30th December, 2011 and 25th January, 2012. A

direction was issued on 6th March, 2012 directing the unit to

install incinerator boiler and to ensure zero discharge and they

were required to restrict their production to 60 KLD and furnish a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                57</span>
 bank guarantee of Rs 5 lakhs. However, again on the basis of non-

compliance of these directions found on inspection dated 18th

December, 2012, the unit vide order dated 31st December, 2012

was directed to make no production till it reduces stored effluent

in storage lagoon by MEE, RO, Bio-composting up to the storage

capacity. In the beginning of 2013, it was found that the unit was

complying with the conditions of the consent order. When the unit

was inspected again on 8th October, 2013, it was found that the

RO and bio-composting was in operation but MEE was not in

operation. At that time, there was no discharge in the Phuldera

drain during the inspection as Sugar unit was shut but the colour

of the Phuldera drain was dark brown up to Syana Escape before

meeting river Ganga which indicated heavy pollution of the drain

and resultantly river Ganga. Thus, a Show Cause notice was

issued on 22nd October, 2013 and unit was again inspected on

28th October, 2013. The Board even forfeited a bank guarantee of

Rs 5 lakh on 8th November, 2013 due to non-compliance of

operation of MEE and non-installation of incineration boiler which

were required to further reduce the quantity of spent wash for

better utilization in bio-composting and the unit was also directed

to restrict the production to 30 KLD and not to discharge any

effluent outside the premises. The unit was required to furnish a

bank guarantee of Rs 20 lakhs. The compliance report was

submitted on 18th January, 2014. In view of the persistent

default, the Board rejected the consent to operate vide its order


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                58</span>
 dated 17th February, 2014. Application of renewal was filed by the

unit on 19th September, 2014 which is stated to be under process.


</p><p id="p_130">45. According to the CPCB, the compliance was made and a

query was raised in the Lok Sabha, the unit was inspected by the

zonal office of the Central Pollution Control Board on 15 th July,

2005 when it was observed that bio-compost yard is not adequate

and coloured effluent/spent wash is reaching Phuldera drain.

Directions were issued to the unit on 3rd March, 2006 and they

were also required to furnish a bank guarantee of Rs. 10 lakhs.

Direction in regard to demolition of pipeline was issued, upon

which the unit wanted reconsideration by the CPCB with the

assurance that no quantity of industrial effluent shall be

discharged in to the drain. The Bank Guarantee was also

furnished by the unit. The bank guarantee was revalidated from

time to time. There was compliance noted in 1st August, 2006 and

since the bank guarantee was expired, the same was returned to

the unit and they were directed installation of MEE and

augmentation of compost yard. Here again public complaints were

received and unit was inspected on 12th January, 2009. A letter

of shortcomings was thus issued in 20th April, 2009 requiring the

unit to take corrective measures. Defaults persisted and a Show

Cause notice under <a href="/doc/68540/" id="a_37">Section 5</a> of 1986 Act was issued on 5 th July,

2011 as major violations were observed including existence of

bypass arrangements in both the units, non-operation MEE and

presence of distillery effluent and sludge deposit in Phuldera


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                59</span>
 drain. After examining, the unit was directed to restrict its

production to 60 KLD, demolish the pipe line to Phuldera drain to

block all other arrangements and furnish bank guarantee of Rs 20

lakhs which were submitted by the industries. The unit was again

inspected on 4th September, 2013 and 3rd December, 2013 to

verify the compliance of directions and it was found not complying

with some of the directions issued by the CPCB vide its letter

dated 10th August, 2013. Result of analysis of sample collected

from Phuldera drain indicated presence of distillery effluents. Vide

order dated 10th February, 2014, the unit was directed to close all

its manufacturing operations till compliance of the directions

issued by CPCB. The unit substantially was lying closed because

of consent rejection by the UPPCB.
</p>
<p id="p_131">
</p><p id="p_132">46. The Learned Counsel appearing for the unit submitted that

they have been taking measures and installing anti-pollution

devices in furtherance to the various directions issued by the

CPCB and conditions of the consent order passed by UPPCB.

According to it, the unit is not causing any serious pollution.

Further, it is contended that the various bank guarantees were

returned to the unit, thus, implying that the unit was compliant

and non-polluting. In this regard, they had placed on record

certain documents and also contended that it is not necessary for

the unit to install incinerators.
</p>
<p id="p_133">
</p><p id="p_134">47. As far as the last contention in regard to non-installation of

incinerator is concerned, we have already dealt with this

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                    60</span>
 contention    in   detail   and   passed    appropriate    directions.

Contentions we may notice that they are based upon mis-

apprehension of the relevant documents. The applicant itself had

filed documents to show that they were called upon to furnish

bank guarantees from time to time, which they were furnished. As

far as encashment of the bank guarantees is concerned, vide

letter dated 27th September, 2006 original bank guarantee of Rs

10 lakhs was returned to the unit. This was not returned because

the unit had satisfactorily complied with the directions of the

Central Board but for the reasons that the validity of the bank

guarantee since had expired on 31st August, 2006 as evident from

the letter itself where it is so recorded. Not only this, the unit vide

its letter dated 30th September, 2006 addressed to the General

Manager, SBI had written to the same effect. The contention that

non-encashment of the bank guarantees ipso facto shows that the

conditions/directions had duly been complied with by the unit is

again without any merit. Firstly, one of the bank guarantees had

been duly encashed by the concerned Board of Rs 30000.

Subsequently, the bank guarantees were extended by the unit

from time to time and in terms of various directions issued by the

Board, the unit had furnished bank guarantees for various

amounts and last of them being for a sum of Rs 20 lakhs was

furnished by the unit on 19th September, 2011. Even vide their

letter dated 12th April, 2012, the unit had assured the Board that

they would made their best efforts to comply with the Board


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                  61</span>
 directions and keep the said bank guarantee in force. Similar was

the stand taken by the unit even vide their letter dated 13th May,

2013 and 12th August, 2013. Unit had applied for the renewal of

the consent to operate vide their letter dated 22nd November, 2013

which was refused by the UPPCB vide their letter dated 17th

February, 2014 and they were directed to close down their

operations.
</p>
<p id="p_135">
</p><p id="p_136">48. It requires to be noticed at this stage that at no point of time,

the unit had ever written unconditional letter over this long

period, to any of the Boards or concerned authorities that it was a

unit which was entirely compliant and non-polluting. All through,

it has been the case of the unit itself that it is making its best

efforts to resolve environmental issues by taking measures and

installing anti-pollution devices. The above documentary evidence

clearly demonstrates that the unit has been a polluting unit for all

this period. The allegation between the parties for environmental

offences started as back as 1986. Since then continuously the

unit has been found to be a defaulting, non-compliant and a

polluting unit. The various inspections and analysis reports

support this fully. The observation and conclusions of the joint

inspection conducted by the Member Secretary of the CPCB and

the Member Secretary, UPPCB based on inspection of 13th

February, 2014 clearly finds that the Phuldera drain and even the

municipal drain that joins Phuldera drain and then river Ganga

was containing pollutants. Press mud was found stored on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                 62</span>
 unlined land and leachate along with runoff from rainwater is also

stored into an unlined separate pit. The samples had been

collected. The Expert Members noticed serious issues and

violation in relation to surface and ground water. Various

shortfalls, defects and malfunctioning were noticed by the Expert

Members who have suggested the way ahead. The ground water

samples which were collected as late as 24th to 26th June, 2014

showed excessive parameters to the prescribed limitations. The

ground water sampling was carried out and as many as 19

samples were collected along Phuldera drain, upstream and

downstream. On examination downstream samples were found to

be polluted. These samples are entirely suggestive of effluent

discharge from the unit containing in permissible parameters.


</p><p id="p_137">49. Despite repeated notices from the Boards, violation of

conditions of the consent orders, closure orders passed by the

Court as back as in the year 1986 and directions issued by the

CPCB under <a href="/doc/68540/" id="a_38">Section 5</a> of the 1986 Act from time to time, the unit

had persisted with untreated effluent or pollutant discharge into

the municipal/Phuldera drain and caused serious pollution of

river Ganga. The unit has been discharging trade effluents on

land. The effluent containing molasses which was being stored in

the lagoons were washed away because of overflowing, resulting

from floods and, in turn, polluted the ground water. Undisputedly,

for all this period, the unit was responsible for causing serious

problem of the ground and surface water in and around its


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                63</span>
 premises as well as in Phuldera drain, finally leading to river

Ganga. The seriousness of the extent of pollution is evident from

the fact that even when the unit was non-functional, expert team

found the Phuldera drain water being brown in colour and

containing discharge from distillery and sugar factory. This Unit

has been causing pollution for years. In any case, right from

1975, even one year after the coming into force of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_39">Water Act</a> of

1974, they have failed to discharge their statutory obligations.

They   have   intentionally   avoided   to   discharge   their   Social

Corporate Responsibility. The unit did not even take the various

precautions to prevent and control pollution of ground/surface

water despite notices and directions by the competent authorities.

Such industries, which had been making profit for all these years

are expected to obey the law without demur and delay. Every unit

is expected to aid the State in discharge of its Constitutional

obligations, to provide clean and decent environment to the

citizenry. There is no cause, much less a plausible reason, for the

Tribunal to not to fasten the liability which ought to be imposed

upon this unit in consonance with the principle stated under

<a href="/doc/591495/" id="a_40">Section 15</a> read with Section 20 of the NGT Act, particularly in

view of the conduct of the unit over such a long period.


</p><p id="p_138">50. Some of the obvious points emerging from the record before

the Tribunal which show the extent of pollution caused by the

unit and the circumstances attendant thereto are:




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                 64</span>
   a. "The Sugar Unit has been working since 1933 and the
     distillery Unit is working since 1943 and polluting Ganga
     River and the land around the unit by discharging its
     effluent into the Phuldera drain - almost a stretch of
     around 18 kms.
</p><p id="p_139">  b. In addition, 22 acres land that is being used as Bio-
     compost Yard has been a continuous source of pollution of
     land and groundwater.
</p><p id="p_140">  c. The leachate along with run-off water was found having
     BOD as high as 1700 mg/L and COD as 5403 mg/L, with
     TDS as 12280 mg/L as observed by the Inspection Team
     comprising of Member Secretary, CPCB and Member
     Secretary, UPPCB carried out during 24.02.2014 under
     the order of this Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_141">  d. The surface water once polluted can be restored during
     monsoon due to high dilution and its flushing away
     through stream, however, groundwater needs much larger
     restoration time (sometimes more than 20 years), even if
     the polluting sources are removed.
</p><p id="p_142">  e. Water, soil and sludge samples collected from Phuldera
     drain in June, 2014 by CPCB and UPPCB under the order
     of this Tribunal dated 31st May, 2014 indicate pollution in
     terms of Potassium and organic matter, in spite of both
     Sugar and Distillery being closed, which indicates that
     residual pollution persist in the Phuldera drain and
     groundwater. Some of the handpumps are having organic
     pollution, as reflected by COD. The groundwater sample
     PDGW-5, which is a handpump at Buxor village is having
     colour in the order of 40 Hz Units and BOD 8 mg/L and
     COD 52 mg/L, which is definitely not fit for human
     consumption."
</p>
<p id="p_143">
</p><p id="p_144">51. It is not possible to assess exact environmental damage and

the cost of restoration thereof in view of the long period involved

in the present case and the fact that the statutory Boards

empowered to prevent and control pollution have not performed

their statutory duties in accordance with the spirit and object of

the   environmental   Acts   and     jurisprudence.   This   unit   is

responsible for causing great environmental pollution of different



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                65</span>
 water bodies including Phuldera drain, the Syana Escape canal,

the River Ganga and even the groundwater in and around the

area of this industrial unit. Besides scientific data of inspection by

the Expert teams, officers of the Pollution Control Board, analysis

report and the fact that the water in the Phuldera drain had

turned brown, even to the naked eye, demonstrates the extent of

pollution caused by this unit. Considering the magnitude of the

pollution caused by the unit, its capacity and prosperity,

responsibility of the unit to pay compensation cannot be disputed

on any plausible cause or ground. The Supreme Court in the case

of <a href="/doc/26352158/" id="a_41">Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. (2013) 4

SCC 575, enunciated the principle that a company which has

caused the damaged to the environment and for operating the

plant without valid renewal of consent for a fairly long period

would obviously be liable to compensate by paying damages.

While relying upon the judgment of the Constitution Bench of the

Supreme Court in the case of M.C. Mehta v. union of India (1987) 1

SCC 395, the Court further stated that the plea of reasonable care

and that the damage to environment occurred without specific

negligence on the part of the unit is not a sustainable defence to a

direction for payment of compensation for causing environmental

damage. The court further held that magnitude, capacity and

prosperity of the unit are the relevant considerations for

determining the extent of the liability in such case. Applying these

principles to the facts of the present case, there can hardly be any


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                  66</span>
 dispute that it is a polluting unit. It is also beyond controversy

that this unit has operated without consent of the Boards from

1974 till the year 1991, thereafter, it committed default in

compliance of the conditions of the consent right up to the year

2000. Even thereafter, it did not strictly comply with the

conditions and directions issued by the respective Boards. This

unit is a direct source of polluting River Ganga.


</p><p id="p_145">     The unit is a profit making unit. No record has been

produced before the Tribunal to establish anything to the

contrary. Though, it may not be possible to determine with

exactitude the exact amount of compensation payable on

account of damage to environment because of the long period

involved and also for the reason that even scientifically the

extent of damage and amounts required for restoration and

restitution thereof cannot be determined at this stage now.

Cleaning and removal of sludge from Phuldera drain, treatment

of other pollutants flowing in the said drain, preventing any

discharge into the Syana Escape Canal and making River

Ganga pollution free are the basic needs which require

attention of the Expert bodies particularly, in the facts and

circumstances of this case. We fix a compensation of Rs 5

crores which shall be deposited with the UPPCB and shall be

spent for that purpose alone by and joint team of CPCB,UPPCB,

MoEF including for removal of sludge and all pollutants in the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                 67</span>
 Syana Escape Canal till it joins river Ganga. This amount shall

also be used for preventing ground water pollution.

</p><p id="p_146">     The unit has caused serious pollution persistently. There is

sufficient material before the Tribunal to establish both direct and

indirect pollution being caused by this unit. The unit has even

intentionally failed to comply with the directions and conditions of

the consent order passed by the respective Boards. Not even

submitting an application to the Board for obtaining consent to

operate shows complete disregard towards law and its statutory

obligations by the unit. It is not a only case where it is a threat to

cause   environmental    pollution     but   is   a   case   of   causing

environmental pollution, in fact. Right to carry on business

cannot be permitted to be misused or to pollute the environment

so as to reduce the quality of life of others. Risk to harm to

environment or to human health is to be decided in the public

interest according to 'a reasonable person's test'. The man's

perception with reference to the facts of this case cannot return a

finding any different than the one recorded by us.


</p><p id="p_147">52. Another aspect of this case is that during the course of

inspection, even the expert members of the Tribunal and other

inspecting team have found very heavy deposits of sludge in the

Phuldera drain and even along the drain.               Such collection

apparently has resulted from discharge of effluents and even

untreated effluent by the unit into Phuldera drain. The learned

Counsel appearing for the unit stated that the work for removal of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                                  68</span>
 sludge from the drain as well as on the site was going on. As

already noticed above, the unit claims to have even wanted

removal of sludge from the site of the unit. Thus, we direct that

this work should be completed within two months from the date of

passing of this order and matter reported to the UPPCB for

inspection and compliance


</p><p id="p_148">53. Another aspect of this, may be an ancillary matter that has

been raised before the Tribunal, is that the application for renewal

of consent having been filed, the unit cannot be said to have

operated without consent. In view of the clear provisions of

<a href="/doc/1038612/" id="a_42">Section 22</a> to <a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_43">27</a> and the scheme of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_44">Water Act</a>, it cannot be

said that filing of application even for renewal of consent, be

treated as deemed consent in law. If any such practise is being

adopted by the Boards whether Central or State will be contrary to

the scheme of law. Where consent is given for a definite period, it

would come to an end on the last date of the stated period, unless

it is renewed for a further period but definitely on and before the

date on which the consent expires. Therefore, we will direct the

Board to stop such practise if is being followed by them presently

and grant consent for a specific period preferably 3 months or 6

months. It will be more appropriate for the Boards to grant

consent, minimum annually and preferably 2 to 3 years

depending upon the facts and circumstances of the given case.

This is for the reason that the Board is vested with vast powers of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                                 69</span>
 inspection and revoking consent or even directing closure of a

unit.

Gopaljee Dairy Pvt. Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_150">
</p><p id="p_151">54. This is the industry which is carrying on the business of

manufacturing of milk and milk products. From the records

before the Tribunal, it appears that the industry was established

in the year 1983 by the predecessors and in the interest of

present Respondent No. 8, i.e., Gopaljee Dairy Pvt. Ltd.    Their

consent was renewed from time to time. The present management

of the industry have been granted consent to operate in the year

2008 from where onwards, the industry is adhering to the

prescribed standards of treatment for effluent discharge in terms

of pH, Total Suspended Solids (TSS), COD, BOD, and Oil &amp; Grease

with minor variations. Sometimes the test reports have shown

effluent containing high parameters in comparison of the

prescribed parameters. The industry was required to stop

discharging trade effluent into the Syana Escape canal through

underground pipeline and was required to discharge the effluent

in the municipal drain. There is no specific permission granted by

any competent Authority permitting them to discharge the trade

effluent into the Syana Escape canal. The UPPCB took note of this

fact and even initiated action against the industry. According to

the industry, they have already approached the local Nagar Palika



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                                70</span>
 for permission to discharge their effluent in the municipal drain

and the matter is pending for considerable time with the said

Nagar Palika.
</p>
<p id="p_152">
</p><p id="p_153">55. We may also notice that the complaint had been made on

24th June, 2013 to the Chairman, National Ganga River Basin

Authority stating that Respondent No. 8 was discharging effluent

in and around the Syana Escape canal and was polluting river

Ganga and the groundwater of the surrounding villages. It was

complained that this industry has least regard for law (prescribed

standards). In support thereof, an effluent analysis report dated

25th August, 2013 by Noida Testing Laboratory was produced by

the Respondent No. 8 showing trade effluent containing high

parameters in comparison to the prescribed parameters. For

instance, the TSS was 1448 mg/l as against permissible 100 mg/l

while the COD was 4640 mg/l as against 150 mg/l and BOD

2209 mg/l as against 30 mg/l. Of course we cannot place total

reliance on this Report as effluent was not collected by the

Officials of the Board and in any case and in terms of <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_45">Section 21</a>

of the Water Act. However, even the joint inspection team

appointed under the orders of the Tribunal had found certain

shortfalls. Of course they noticed that it was not a seriously

polluting industry. A joint inspection report had specifically

noticed that the unit had installed ETP but the treated effluent is

discharged through underground pipeline of 1 km to Syana

Escape canal and ultimately meets river Ganga. It also noticed


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                                71</span>
 that the industry was asked by CPCB vide their directions dated

10th February, 2014 to stabilize the aeration tank, install flow

measuring devices at the outlet of ETP and provide acoustic

enclosure to remaining two DG sets and that the unit had valid

consent up to 31st December, 2013. The unit had filed an affidavit

rasing some objections to the joint inspection team. The said

objections are found to be totally without substance as no

supportive documents have been placed by the unit on record to

show that the observations recorded by the joint inspection team

were erroneous and were not the factual description of the site.

Further and as already noticed, the Learned Expert Members of

the Tribunal had themselves visited the premises of Respondent

No. 8. It was found that the unit generates about 300 KLD

effluent. It had installed ETP which had equalization tank,

anaerobic digester, aeration tank, secondary clarifier, sand and

carbon filters. The trade effluent coming out from the plant was

found to be more or less colourless. The Trade effluent was being

discharged into the Syana Escape canal. In the final observations

which were observed by the three Expert Members of the Tribunal

it was directed that the unit should establish an automatic

continuous online monitoring system for quality of final effluent,

using some important indicator parameters and all abnormal

situations should be brought to the notice of the Boards and unit

should take corrective measures. Largely the unit was found

operating satisfactorily.
</p>
<p id="p_154">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">                                72</span>
</p><p id="p_155"> 56. As already noticed, the consent was valid till 31 st

December, 2013, the consent had been revoked on 6 th

December, 2013 and was again granted. On 28th February,

2014, the UPPCB had again rejected the consent to the unit

under the Water as well as the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_46">Air Act</a>. Thereafter, the unit

had prayed for fresh sample of the effluents by the Tribunal.

We have already noticed that Respondent No. 8 filed an

additional affidavit on 12th March, 2014 raising certain

objections to the inspection conducted by the joint inspection

team. However, in paragraph 4 of the said affidavit, the unit

itself stated that in the inspection dated 13th February, 2014,

the BOD was observed a little higher but it was for the reason

that it was collected from Syana Escape and not from the ETP

outlet. It was further stated in the said affidavit that the

Respondent No. 8 is taking all steps to further improve the

ETP functioning and the proposed steps inter alia include the

following:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">     a.   "The remaining/residual fat shall be collected from
     the Flushing of milk tankers and would be stored in
     separate tank for further reprocessing. The said shall
     reduce the effluent load on ETP.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_43">     b.   The Ghee residue is currently treated with chilled
     water      to remove Ghee from it but now onwards the
     Ghee       residue shall be treated with Centrifugal
     Machine to      remove Ghee and then utilizing it for
     Cattle Feed     manufacturing. Thus, it would reduce the
     Effluent load in ETP.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_44">     c.      Water used in bottle rinsing/washing shall now be
             reused in crate washer for washing the crates.
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">                                 73</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">     d.   Paneer cooling water shall now be reutilized for
         reconstitution of skimmed milk Power after
    reprocessing   it.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_46">    e.    The treated water from Effluent Treatment Plant
    shall     now be utilized in the following manner:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">          i.    For Gardening - 5000 Ltr/Day
         ii.    For irrigation - 25000 Ltr/Day (For New and old
                plantations across the roads.

         iv.    For Toilets - 15000 Ltr/Day
    Thus, the water consumption would               be   reduced
    including the consumption of Raw Water.
    f.   An additional oil and Grease trap shall be
    constructed in the ETP to reduce the load on operational
    ETP.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_49">    g.    The sludge generated during centrifugal separation of
    milk shall now be collected and sold to Poultry Farm for
    Poultry feed as the sludge is nothing but milk solids
    (protein, Carbohydrates and Fat). This would further
    reduce the load on ETP.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_50">    h.   One additional tank of 1 lakh Ltr. Capacity is
    planned to     be installed at ETP to store Effluent upto
    12 hours to get maximum retention and better efficiency
    in ETP."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_156">57. The unit prayed for a re-inspection and reconsideration

of the revocation of consent on merits. Even in the inspection

dated 3rd December, 2013, the unit was found complying with

the prescribed effluent norms, however, non-compliance in

regard to no flow measuring devices at the outlet of ETP,

inadequate level of mixed liquor, suspended solids in the

aeration tank, indicating partial stabilization, were observed

and the unit was asked to take corrective measures. After the

inspection by the Learned Expert Members of the Tribunal,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">                                74</span>
 consent to the unit was restored on 16th May, 2014 as

informed during the course of arguments. It is evident from

the above narrated facts which are duly supported by

inspection reports and partially by the effluent analysis that

this unit has been causing pollution though, not of a serious

gravity. It has been discharging the effluent into the Syana

Escape canal for which it had no permission. It was expected

of the unit to take appropriate steps including legal steps, if

necessary, for getting permission to discharge the effluents

into the municipal drain from Nagar Palika or any other

appropriate authority. It is not only the corporate social

responsibility of the unit but even the statutory obligation to

ensure no pollution. We are taking a very liberal view with

regard to imposition of compensation for restoration of

environment in relation to this unit primarily for the reason

that it has made serious efforts to check and control the

pollution and particularly as stated in their affidavit on 12 th

March, 2014, it has further assured to attain complete status

of a 'compliant and non-polluting unit'


</p><p id="p_157">58. As a cumulative effect of the factors afore-discussed, we pass

the following directions in relation to this unit:




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                                  75</span>
 a.   The unit shall take all self-correcting measures as outlined

by the unit itself in its affidavit dated 12th March, 2014 within

three months from the date of passing of this order.


b.   The unit shall install online monitoring system for relevant

parameters of treated effluent discharge as agreed by UPPCB with

real time data transmission facility to UPPCB within three

months.
</p>
<p id="p_158">
c.   The unit shall obtain either consent from Nagar Palika for

discharging treated effluent into Sewer line or shall obtain

approval from State Irrigation Department, subject to the

satisfaction of UPPCB within three months.
</p>
<p id="p_159">
d.   In light of the provisions of <a href="/doc/591495/" id="a_47">Section 15</a> read with Section 20

of the NGT Act, we direct this unit to pay a sum of Rs. 25 lakhs

within one month, for not strictly complying with the conditions of

the consent order, directions issued by the CPCB and for

discharging its effluents into the Syana Escape Canal despite the

fact that it had been directed not to do so. This amount of Rs. 25

lakhs shall be paid to the UPPCB and shall be spent for

restoration of the environment, for taking general remedial

measures, for preventing pollution and for restoring the damage

already done to the Syana Escape Canal and ground water or

other water bodies.
</p>
<p id="p_160">

</p><p id="p_161">59. Reverting to the case of Simbhaoli sugar and distillery unit

which has been a serious polluter for all this time and has

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">                                76</span>
 damaged the ground water as well as polluted the River Ganga

through Phuldera Drain, now for years. This unit has failed to

take all remedial measures despite service of show cause notices,

closure orders and directions issued by the CPCB. The trade

effluent discharged by the unit had often been found to be in

violation of the prescribed standards. The unit had also failed to

dismantle the underground pipeline through which the effluent

containing the pollutants was being discharged into the Phuldera

drain, despite specific directions issued by the respective Boards.

Large extent of sludge which could only be generated from a sugar

and distillery unit was found in the Phuldra drain and on its

banks. The inspections on different occasions even noticed that

the unit was bypassing the ETP and throwing untreated effluent

into the drain and/or on the land. This Unit, on the one hand

violated the conditions of the consent order from time to time

while on the other, it even operated without consent of the Board

for short duration subsequent to 1991, till which year it operated

totally without consent. These are the few circumstances which

fully establish the fact that this unit is a seriously polluting unit

and has been polluting the different water bodies including the

groundwater now for a considerable time. There can hardly be any

doubt in inspecting the case advanced on behalf of the respective

Boards that this unit has continuously failed to comply with the

requirements of law and discharge its statutory obligations on the

one hand while on the other it has also failed to fulfil its corporate


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                                  77</span>
   social responsibilities. Therefore, the unit is liable to make good

  and to restore damage, degradation and pollution of environment

  caused by its activity particularly, the water bodies and with

  greater emphasis, the River Ganga. Thus, in our considered view,

  this unit must be held liable to pay heavy compensation for

  restitution, restoration, prevention and control of pollution of

  various water bodies and more emphatically River Ganga.

  Consequently, in exercise of the powers conferred upon this

  Tribunal under <a href="/doc/591495/" id="a_48">Section 15</a> and all other enabling provisions of the

  NGT Act and the legislative mandate contained under <a href="/doc/303980/" id="a_49">Section 20</a>

  of the said Act, we pass the following order:
</p>
<p id="p_162">
i.     For restoration and restitution of the degraded and damaged

  environment and for causing pollution of different water bodies,

  particularly River Ganga, directly or indirectly, resulting from its

  business activities carried on for a long period in the past, we

  direct the Unit to pay a compensation of rupees Five Crores

  (Rs.5,00,00,000/-) to UPPCB within one month from the date of

  passing of this order. Such direction is completely substantiated

  and is based on the Polluter Pays Principle, in the facts and

  circumstances of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_163">
ii.    The amount of compensation received by the UPPCB shall be

  utilised for the cleaning of Syana Escape Canal, preventing and

  controlling ground water pollution, installation of an appropriate

  ETP or any other plant at the end point of Phuldera Drain where it

  joins river Ganga in order to ensure that no pollutants are

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                   78</span>
    permitted to enter River Ganga through that drain. The amount

   should   also   be   utilised   for    restoring   the   quality   of    the

   groundwater.
</p>
<p id="p_164">
iii.    The amount shall be spent under and by a special

   Committee consisting of Member Secretary, CPCB, Member

   Secretary, UPPCB and a representative of MoEF, only and

   exclusively for the purposes afore-stated.
</p>
<p id="p_165">
iv.     The unit shall carry out the removal of sludge and cleaning

   of Puldhera drain in terms of our order dated 31 st May, 2014 as

   the work in furtherance thereto has already started, as stated by

   the unit. If the work of cleaning and removal of sludge in and

   along the Puldhera drain is not completed within three months by

   the industry, in that event, it shall be liable to pay a further sum

   of Rs. 1 crore, in addition to the amount afore-ordered to UPPCB.

   This amount of one crore will be used by the Committee only for

   cleaning of and removal of sludge in and along Phuldera drain.


 v.     We direct the unit to install incinerator as directed above

   within a period of 6 months from the date of passing of this order.

   However, if within a period of 3 months, the unit applies to the

   'special committee' afore-constituted to inspect the premises and

   to show that it has become a 'no discharge unit' for the

   installed/sanctioned    capacity,      whichever    is   higher    and    is

   absolutely a compliant and non-polluting unit, in that event, the

   said special committee may consider the request of the unit for



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                                         79</span>
    such inspection. Thereafter, if the Committee is of the opinion

   that it was possible to dispense with the condition of installation

   of incinerator, then it may recommend to this Tribunal for waiver

   of such condition.   Even if the Committee is of the opinion that

   it would not be necessary to enforce the condition of installation of

   incinerator against the unit, still, it would re-inspect the premises

   in the coming rainy season and the Committee will then submit a

   report to the Tribunal stating that the unit has become no

   discharge unit, is absolutely compliant and non-polluting and

   despite collection of water, there is no possibility of overflow of

   effluents from the premises of the unit. Such recommendation

   then would be considered by the Tribunal in accordance with law.

   We grant liberty to the unit as well as any of the Boards to move

   such an application before the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_166">
vi.     The unit shall, within a period of three months, comply with

   all the directions contained in our order dated 31st May, 2014

   without fail. We make it clear that subject to the above specific

   directions, the unit would be granted no further time to comply

   with all the directions and conditions contained in Paragraph 8 of

   the order of the Tribunal dated 31st May, 2014, which have been

   necessitated in view of the Precautionary Principle and to ensure

   that there is no pollution caused by this unit in future.


vii.    The unit would be permitted to operate for the current

   crushing season but continuance of grant of consent to the unit in

   terms of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_50">Air Act</a>, 1981 and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_51">Water Act</a>,

    committee constituted under this order. The first of such

    inspection would be conducted by the committee within one

    month from the date of passing of this order.
</p>
<p id="p_167">
viii.    The UPPCB shall consider and primarily rely upon the report

    of the said special committee, while granting or refusing consent

    to operate to the unit.
</p>
<p id="p_168">
 ix.     The unit shall dismantle the underground pipeline leading to

    the Phuldera drain within two weeks from today, if not already

    dismantled. All authorities are directed to fully cooperate in the

    dismantling of such pipeline, to ensure that there is no discharge

    of effluent through that pipeline into the Phuldera drain.


  x.     If the special Committee during its inspection finds the unit

    to be non-compliant, pollutant or a violator of any of the

    conditions or directions contained in this order including payment

    of Rs. 5 crores, it shall so inform the UPPCB, which in turn shall

    withdraw the consent to operate and shall direct closure of the

    unit forthwith. Such direction can also be issued by the CPCB

    keeping in view the fact that the unit in the event of default,

    would be a serious threat to environmental protection and would

    be a potent polluter.
