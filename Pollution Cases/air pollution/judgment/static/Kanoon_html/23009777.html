petitioner in the above writ petition are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">       2.. The writ petition has been directed against the proceedings of the

Chairman, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, (for short 'TNPCB') bearing

No. MA1/TNPCB/2.13302/2009 dated 13.11.2010 , which has been passed

pursuant to the order dated 8.2.2010 passed by the High Court in W. P. No.

6800 of 2009 and issued to the fourth respondent namely the

Commissioner/4th Respondent herein, Coimbatore Corporation, Coimbatore,

Commissioner, Coimbatore Corporation and also to other authorities and also

made a request for relocation of the sewage treatment plant (for short 'STP')

and also existing pumping station from the immediate vicinity of the residential

apartments in order to save the residents from serious health hazards.

Despite the same, the construction activities were being undertaken which

mechanical in nature, the High Court directed the Committee to make a spot

inspection of the proposed STP at Nanjundapuram and to submit a report in

respect of five specific materials issues. After filing of the report by the

Committee, the High Court by an order dated 08.02.2010 disposed of the writ

</p><p id="p_26">     11. The said writ petition on transfer from the High Court to this Tribunal

was taken on file as Application No. 34 of 2013 (SZ) (THC).


</p><p id="p_27">     12. The 4th respondent, Coimbatore Corporation filed the application for

consent with all required details and documents on 22.03.2012 before the

TNPCB. Pursuant thereto the TNPCB issued orders of consent for

establishing the STP under Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 (for short '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">Water Act</a>') and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1981 (for short '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a>'). These consent orders have been challenged by the

9th respondent on 21.12.2012 in Appeal Nos. 32 and 33 of 2012 before the

Appellate Authority, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control (for short 'Appellate

Authority') which are pending adjudication.

<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">       13. At the outset, the counsel for the respondents raised their

preliminary objection on the question of maintainability.


</p><p id="p_30">       14. The Tribunal paid its anxious consideration on the submissions

made by either side on the question of maintainability and also looked into all

the materials available. As could be seen above, the present application No.

34 of 2013 (SZ) (THC) which was taken on file by the Tribunal on an order of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                              9</span>
 transfer of W.P.No. 3561 of 2011 by the High Court is the 3 rd application filed

by the applicant/association. The first Writ Petition No. 6800 of 2009 seeking

a writ of mandamus forbearing the 4th Respondent/Corporation from

proceeding with the construction of the proposed open STP at the site in

question came to be disposed of by the High Court on 08.02.2010 with a

direction to the TNPCB to consider the matter as per the report submitted by

the Committee appointed in that proceedings on 06.10.2009 and to pass

orders on merits in accordance with law after hearing the parties within a time

frame of 4 weeks. In pursuance of the above order, the Chairman, TNPCB

made the impugned order on 13.11.2010 whereby the application filed by the

4th Respondent/Corporation on 22.10.2010 was returned for resubmission

after rectifying the defects therein and conducting required studies from the

stand point of the existing site being used for STP. The 4 th respondent was

also required to submit along with a revised DPR, layout, design, estimates

etc., necessary for the project. It is pertinent to point out at this stage that the

2nd writ petition made by the applicant/association in W.P.No.6695 of 2010

before the High Court for a writ of mandamus forbearing the respondents

including the Corporation from in any manner proceeding with construction

activities of the proposed STP was disposed of on 15.11.2010 since it was

represented by the TNPCB that the application originally filed by the 4th

Respondent/Corporation and pending in the hands of TNPCB was disposed

on 13.11.2010 and in view of the same the writ petition itself has become

infructuous. It is not in controversy that the application filed by the 4 th

respondent before TNPCB which was pending during the pendency of both

the Writ Petition Nos. 6800 of 2009 and 6695 of 2010 was returned for

resubmission on 13.11.2010. The present application challenges the said

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                                 10</span>
 order of TNPCB returning the original application of the 4th respondent dated

22.10.2010 for resubmission. There is nothing to indicate that the said

application was ever resubmitted. But, the 4 th respondent has submitted an

application to the TNPCB with all required details and documents only on

22.03.2012 after a lapse of 15 months. The said application made by the 4th

respondent dated 22.03.2012 resulted in the grant of consent orders on

25.12.2012 under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air Act</a>. This application questioning the

order dated 13.11.2010 for resubmission of original application was made on

19.01.2011. As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondent

that on 19.01.2011, when the W.P.No.3561 of 2011 was filed neither the

original application dated 22.04.2010 was resubmitted nor any new

application was made by the 4th respondent and thus, no application made by

the 4th respondent before TNPCB was pending consideration on 19.01.2011.

Pending the writ petition before the High Court, no stay of the impugned order

was granted by the High Court. What was asked in the writ petition was only

a direction to forbear the respondents from doing any construction activities

for STP in the site in question.
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">     15. Thus, it can be well stated that the applicant had no cause of action

to file on the date when the application was made. The contention putforth by

the learned counsel for the applicant such a preliminary objection as to the

maintainability cannot be raised in view of the liberty given on 15.11.2010

while disposing of the Writ Petition No. 6695 of 2010 by the High Court, cannot

be disputed that the liberty has been given to the applicant to approach the

Court in case of any grievance. But, the applicant cannot be allowed to take

advantage of the liberty given by way of an application like this when he had


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                            11</span>
 not even had the cause of action. Admittedly, the TNPCB has passed the

order of consent to establish on 25.10.2012 both under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">Air Act</a>

which are the subject matter of two appeals before the Appellate Authority in

Appeal Nos. 32 and 33 of 2012. Having preferred two appeals before the

Appellate Authority, the applicant in M.A.No. 84 of 2013 (SZ) has chosen to

implead as a party in this application as 9th respondent. The comparison of

the grounds set out in this application and the appeals before the Appellate

Authority referred to would clearly indicate that many of them are the same. It

is true that the applicant has not preferred those appeals. But, it is a fact that

these are the appeals preferred challenging the order of consent given by

TNPCB to the 4th respondent and if allowed, it would be allowing two parallel

proceedings. As to the contention putforth by the learned counsel for the

applicant that this application challenges the proceedings at the initial state

even before the grant of consent by the TNPCB and the grant of consent by

TNPCB was subsequent in point of time and hence either the grant of consent

or pendency of appeals would not stand as an impediment for this application,

the Tribunal is afraid whether it can agree with the contention putforth by the

learned counsel for the applicant for the simple reason that what is challenged

by the applicant is regarding the siting criteria which is a part of the process

of issuance of consent orders. Admittedly, on the application made by the 4 th

Respondent/Corporation after following through several processes, the

proceedings have culminated into consent order which is also challenged

before the Appellate Authority. by none else than the newly impleaded 9th

respondent herein. This application is pertaining to resubmission of an

application originally made by the 4th respondent before the TNPCB. But, the

above referred to appeals have challenged the grant of consent orders.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                               12</span>
</p><p id="p_33">      16. The learned counsel for the applicant with vigour and vehemence

would contend that the reliefs sought for by the applicant were not only on the

ground that the setting up of the subject STP was in violation of the provision

of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_12">Air Act</a>, but also on the ground that the subject site did not

qualify for setting up the STP, that the presence of large quantum of industrial

waste in the sewage to be treated in the proposed STP, that the proposal of

the 4th respondent to set up the STP at the site in question was contrary to

the enactments which cannot be raised before the Appellate Authority. The

Tribunal is of the considered opinion that all the above contentions can as

well be raised before the Appellate Authroity since the grant of consent,

though to be tested under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_13">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_14">Air Act</a>, would

definitely include other issues also from the point of view pollution and

environmental aspects.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">     17. Pointing to one of the conditions in the consent order, the learned

counsel would submit that the TNPCB is conscious of pending proceedings

and hence, the consent has been subject to the outcome of the present

appeals. (Condition No. 27). As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for

the respondents that once the consent orders are challenged by way of

appeals, the above condition attached to the consent order loses its

significance. Merely because such a condition was added to the consent

order it would not clothe the applicant with the right to maintain the application

which lacks even a cause of action.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">     18. It is true that the 4th respondent has filed an undertaking affidavit that

he would not make any construction without obtaining consent from the

TNPCB. It is not the case of the applicant/asoication that the 4th respondent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                                13</span>
 has, at any point of time breached the said undertaking. The contentions put

forth by the 4th respondent that the Corporation has not commenced the

activity is not disputed by applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">     19. Pending this application, the applicant has filed a Miscellaneous

Application seeking amendment of relief clause. He also relied on the

decisions to the effect that the amendment could be allowed at any stage of

the proceedings. There is no quarrel as to the preposition of law. But in the

instant case, the attempt made by the applicant , if allowed would certainly be

an introduction of a new cause of action which he did not have on the date of

filing of this application, Hence, it cannot be permitted.


</p><p id="p_40">     20. The only grievance ventilated by the applicant/association in all the

writ petitions was that the 4th respondent/Corporation was not justified in

selecting the site for setting up the STP in the subject site from the

environmental point of view. As could be seen from the grounds in the

Appeals before the Appellate Authority, the same grounds have already been

raised. Hence, no impediment is felt for the applicant/association to raise the

same ground before the Appellate Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">      21. For all the reasons given above, the application has to be

dismissed as not maintainable. But, in view of the fact and circumstances

of the case, the Tribunal is satisfied that it is a fit case where liberty has to

be given to the applicant/association to implead as a party to the

proceedings in Appeal Nos. 32 and 33 of 2012 pending before the

Appellate Authority, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control and raise all contentions

both legal and factual before the said authority.

</p><p id="p_44">        22. In the result the application is disposed of giving liberty to the

applicant/association to approach the Appellate Authority, Tamil Nadu

Pollution Control to implead as a party to the proceedings in Appeal Nos. 32

said Authority. With the above observations the application is disposed of.
