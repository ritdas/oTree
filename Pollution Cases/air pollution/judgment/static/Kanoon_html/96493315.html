              State of Jharkhand and another..........Opposite Parties

              CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.R.PRASAD

              For the Petitioner :Mr. Sumeet Gadodia
              For the State      : A.P.P

11/   12.2.13</pre><p id="p_1">.        Heard learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and learned

      counsel appearing for the State.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                      A case was lodged by the Sub-divisional Officer, Jagannathpur,

      West Singhbhum, Chaibasa on the allegation that on inspection of the premises

      of Shyam Mineral Crusher Plant, situated at village Sarbil, it was found that stone

      after being brought from the forest area is being crushed illegally without having

      any licence by the Mines and Mineral Department and also without having any

      permission from the Pollution Control Department.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                      On such allegation, a case was registered as Noamundi P.S. Case

      no.8 of 2011 under <a href="/doc/94452/" id="a_1">Section 414</a> of the Indian Penal Code,                under <a href="/doc/1914151/" id="a_2">Sections

      33</a>/<a href="/doc/446874/" id="a_3">41</a>/<a href="/doc/1568570/" id="a_4">42</a>/<a href="/doc/1716575/" id="a_5">52</a> of the Indian Forest Act and also under <a href="/doc/1195854/" id="a_6">Section 4(1A)</a>/<a href="/doc/801583/" id="a_7">21(1)(6)</a> of the

      Mines and Mineral (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_8">Development) Act</a> and also under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_9">Section 37</a>

      of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.

</p><p id="p_4">                      On submission of the charge sheet, when cognizance of the

      offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1914151/" id="a_11">Sections 33</a>/<a href="/doc/446874/" id="a_12">41</a>/<a href="/doc/1568570/" id="a_13">42</a>/<a href="/doc/1716575/" id="a_14">52</a> of the Indian Forest Act an also

      under <a href="/doc/1195854/" id="a_15">Section 4(1A)</a> and <a href="/doc/801583/" id="a_16">21(1)(6)</a> of the Mines and Mineral (Regulation and

      <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_17">Development) Act</a> and also under <a href="/doc/94452/" id="a_18">Section 414</a> of the Indian Penal Code was

      taken, vide order dated 16.3.2012, it was challenged to be bad in this application.

</p><p id="p_5">                      Mr.Gadodia,     learned    counsel    appearing   for   the   petitioner

      submitted that it is the case of the prosecution that the Sub-divisional Officer,

      Jagannathpur on receiving information that the petitioner has been running

      crusher unit illegally without having licence from the Mines and Mineral

      Department and also without having any permission from the Pollution Control

      Department inspected the premises and found the allegation tobe true and
 thereby lodged a case for commission of offences under <a href="/doc/1914151/" id="a_19">Sections 33</a>/<a href="/doc/446874/" id="a_20">41</a>/<a href="/doc/1568570/" id="a_21">42</a>/<a href="/doc/1716575/" id="a_22">52</a> of

the Indian Forest Act but in view of <a href="/doc/40754190/" id="a_23">Section 52D</a> of the Indian Forest Act as

amended by the State Government, power of entry, inspection, search and

seizure lies with the Forest Officer not below the rank of Range Officer of forest or

Police Officer not below the rank of Sub-Inspector in case of contravention of any

of the provision of the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_24">Forest Act</a> but here in this case, it is the Sub-divisional

Officer, who had made search and seizure,who has never been empowered

under the Act to make search and seizure and if the case lodged upon the

search and seizure which is illegal, entire prosecution gets vitiated so far the

offence under the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_25">Forest Act</a> is concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                 It was further submitted that similarly the court also committed

illegality in taking cognizance of the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1195854/" id="a_26">Sections

4(1A)</a>/<a href="/doc/801583/" id="a_27">21(1)(6)</a> of the Mines and Mineral (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_28">Development) Act</a> as the

court can take cognizance only on a complaint lodged by the authorized person

but here in this case, the complaint has never been lodged by the competent

authority raher an FIR has been lodged              by the Sub-divisional Officer,

Jagannathpur and thereby the court has certainly committed illegality.

</p><p id="p_7">                 It was further submitted that so far cognizance of the offence under

<a href="/doc/94452/" id="a_29">Section 414</a> of the Indian Penal Code is concerned, that also gets vitiated as

when an offence comes within the purview of any Special Legislation, one cannot

maintain prosecution for the said offece under the General Law, in view of the

provision as contained in <a href="/doc/1329373/" id="a_30">Section 4</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure and

thereby the court also committed illegality in taking cognizance of the offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/94452/" id="a_31">Section 414</a> of the Indian Penal Code as whatever allegation

has been made for commission of the offence under <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_32">Section 414</a>, that pertains to

allegation which would be covered by <a href="/doc/1195854/" id="a_33">Section 4(1A)</a>of the Mines and Mineral

(Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_34">Development) Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                 Thus, it was submitted that the entire order taking cognizance is fit

to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                 Learned counsel appearing for the State by referring to the

statements made in paragraph 16 of the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the
 Sub-divisional Officer, Jagannathpur submitted that the petitioner was illegally

running a crusher unit without having any licence and thereby he was causing

Public Nuisance under <a href="/doc/209076/" id="a_35">Section 268</a> of the Indian Penal Code and making

atmosphere by crusher dust noxious to health punishable under <a href="/doc/1368265/" id="a_36">Section 278</a> of

the Indian Penal Code and in such situation, Sub-divisional Officer does have

every power to make inspection and to effect seizure and thereby the order

taking cognizance can never be said to be illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_10">               The stand which has been taken on behalf of the State does not

appear to be tenable for the reason that the case has never been lodged for

commission of offence either under <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_37">Section 268</a> or under <a href="/doc/1368265/" id="a_38">Section 278</a> of the

Indian Penal Code, rather the case has been lodged for commission of the

offences under the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_39">Forest Act</a> and       the Mines and Mineral (Regulation and

<a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_40">Development) Act</a> and also for an offence under <a href="/doc/94452/" id="a_41">Section 414</a> of the Indian Penal

Code. Therefore, the plea which has been taken by the State with respect to

competency on the part of the Sub-divisional Officer to lodge the case is never

acceptable.
</p>
<p id="p_11">               Going further in the matter, it does appear that it is the Sub-

divisional Officer, who having effected search and seizure lodged the case for

commission of the offence under the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_42">Indian Forest Act</a>, though in view of <a href="/doc/574806/" id="a_43">Section

52</a> (State amendment) of the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_44">Forest Act</a> it is only an officer not below the rank of

Range Officer and also the Police Officer not below the rank of Sub-inspector are

competent to make search and seizure, if there has been reason to believe that

there has been contravention of the provision of the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_45">Forest Act</a>. Since search and

seizure have never been effected by the competent person, any prosecution

based on search and seizure gets vitiated, in view of the decision rendered in a

case of <a href="/doc/1037013/" id="a_46">Roy V.D</a> vs. State of Kerala [(2000) 8 SCC 590].
</p>
<p id="p_12">               Further I do find that for maintaining prosecution under the Mines

and Mineral (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_47">Development) Act</a>, a person authorized can only be

with the competent in view of the provision as contained in <a href="/doc/1492002/" id="a_48">Section 22</a> of the

Mines and Mineral (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_49">Development) Act</a> to lodge a complaint for

contravention of the provision of the      Mines and Mineral (Regulation and
       <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_50">Development) Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                        Here in the case as has been stated above, competent person

      has never come forward to lodge any complaint for commission of the offence

      under the Mines and Mineral (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_51">Development) Act</a> and thereby the

      court has certainly committed illegality in taking cognizance of the offences under

      the Mines and Mineral (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_52">Development) Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_14">                        Further it does appear that the court has also taken cognizance of

      the offence under <a href="/doc/94452/" id="a_53">Section 414</a> of the Indian Penal Code though in the facts and

      circumstances, the prosecution under the General Law is never permissible in

      view of the provision as contained in <a href="/doc/1329373/" id="a_54">Section 4</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure

      as the allegation constituting offence under <a href="/doc/94452/" id="a_55">Section 414</a> of the Indian Penal Code

      falls within the parameter of the provision as contained in <a href="/doc/1195854/" id="a_56">Section 4</a> of the Mines

      and Mineral (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_57">Development) Act</a> which speaks that no person

      shall undertake mining operations in any area, except under and in accordance

      with the terms and conditions of a permit or licence or of a mining lease granted

      under this Act.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                        Thus, under the circumstances stated above, the order dated

      16.3.2012 is hereby quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                        In the result, this application stands allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                                                                      ( R.R.Prasad, J.)
