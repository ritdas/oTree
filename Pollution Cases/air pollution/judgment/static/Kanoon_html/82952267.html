PS MAYAPURI

STATE VS. JITENDER GULATI ORS.

U/S. 63 OF COPYRIGHT ACT, 1957.



                                           ORDER ON CHARGE

1.</pre><p id="p_1">    Brief facts of this case are that four accused namely Kulbeer Singh, Devesh
Kumar Rathore, Surender Wadhwa and Jitender Gulati have been sent up for trial
for offences u/s.63/65 &amp; 68<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_1">A of the Copyright Act</a>, 1957 and, <a href="/doc/1704109/" id="a_2">section
292</a>/<a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_3">468</a>/<a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_4">471</a> of IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.    The case of prosecution is that Indian Music Industry (hereinafter referred to
as IMI) is a trade association of various music companies in India and, the said
IMI claims to be authorised by the member music companies in India to take
appropriate action against infringement of their copyright. Said IMI further
authorised M/s. Super Network to take such necessary action against piracy. On
behalf of M/s. Super Network, Mr. Hansraj Gautam, gave a written complaint on
25.11.2002 to the DCP stating that it has come to the knowledge of the
complainant that at premises no. C-3/12, Mayapuri Industrial Area, Phase II, New
Delhi, infringement of copyright is being done by a company namely M/S Namit
Plastics. On this complaint, a raiding party was organised and on 27.11.2002,
the said premises no. C-3/11, Mayapuri Indl. Area, was raided. It is the case of
prosecution that at the said factory a company by the name of M/S Sidharth
Optical Disc was being run and, at the time of raid, the door was opened by
accused no.2 Devesh Kumar Rathore. Accused no.1 Kulbeer was also present in
the factory. From the said factory 482 MP3 songs infringed CDs; 13 MP3
stampers; 39 positives of MP3 audio CDs; 10600 VCDs of blue films (obscene
films); 9 blue films stampers; 21 positives of blue films; two CD recording
machines; two CD recording units; one CD printer; one 14" colour TV; one CD
player; two computer speakers and one audio/video to RR converter, were

                                                     23 k
 recovered. The VCDs/MP3s were found to be infringed and, therefore, they were
seized and both accused no.1 &amp; 2 namely Kulbeer Singh and Devesh Kumar
Rathore were arrested. The premises were sealed. Subsequently, on their
disclosure, the said premises was again raided after desealing the same on
01.12.2002 i.e. after three days after the initial raid, and again 22500 VCDs of
different titles, 547 stampers and 274 masters were seized. The premises were
again sealed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.    It is the case of investigating agency that accused no.3 Surender Wadhwa
obtained anticipatory bail and joined investigation. During the hearing of
anticipatory bail, he claimed that the company i.e. M/s. Sidharth Optical Disc has
indemnity bonds and purchase orders for reproduction of CDs received from
third parties which were, during the course of investigation, supplied to the
investigating officer from time to time and they were verified to be genuine. Out
of the recovered 547 stampers, 274 masters and 22500 VCDs which were seized
on 01.12.2002, all the VCDs i.e. 22500 VCDs, 523 stampers (out of 547
stampers), and 272 masters (out of 274 masters) were released after they were
verified by the IO and pursuant to the order of Court. That means, out of the
case property recovered on 01.12.2002, only 24 stampers and 2 masters
remained which are claimed to have been used for infringement. During
investigation, accused no.3 Surender Wadhwa supplied the investigating officer
various indemnity bonds given to M/S Sidharth Optical Disc, by                                                      the
persons/companies who placed the order for replicating/reproducing the CDs.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    Out of those stampers and masters which are remaining, the investigating
agency claim that 6 stampers + 1 master relates to films "Ek Phool Do Maali and
Phool Aur Pathar" and was sent for replication alongwith an indemnity bond
signed by accused no.4 Jitender Gulati. Investigating agency claims that the
descendant's of the producers of those two films denied having authorised
anyone to replicate the CDs of films. There is one more 'master' relating to film
"Kuwaari Dulhan" regarding which indemnity bond is signed by accused no.4
Jitender Gulati, but investigating agency claims that since producers of that film
was not traceable, therefore, it could not be known whether accused Jitender
Gulati had any licence/authority to reproduce the work or not. Investigating

ORDER ON CHARGE/STATE VS. JITENDER GULATI ORS./ FIR NO.243/02/PS MAYAPURI/U.S.63 of Copyright Act, 1957/01.7.2009/ Page 2 of  
                                                     23 k
 agency further claims that out of the remaining stampers and masters which
were recovered on 01.12.2002, the producers could not be traced and,
therefore, it is not known whether the third parties i.e. M/s. Kamal Electronics
Producers and M/s. Friends Video who gave order for reproduction to M/s.
Sidharth Optical Disc were authorised or not to get the copies reproduced from
M/s. Sidharth Optical Disc.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.    Thus, regarding fourth accused Jitender Gulati, the case of investigating
agency is that he placed orders for replication of CDs pertaining to movies "Ek
Phool Do Maali and Phool Aur Pathar", amongst certain other films, but so far as
these two films are concerned, he was not authorised to get it reproduced and,
therefore, he is an offender. The letter dated 16.10.2002, vide which this
accused no.4 Jitender Gulati placed the order with M/s. Sidharth Optical Disc Pvt.
Ltd., is on record, on which signatures of accused no.4 Jitender Gulati are tallied
by the handwriting expert with the admitted signatures and specimen
signatures of the accused no.4 Jitender Gulati.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.      Thus, the case of investigating agency as revealed from chargesheet
against the above said four accused is that accused Kulbeer was an employee
and accused Devesh Kumar Rathore was a director of M/s. Sidharth Optical Disc
Pvt. Ltd., and they were physically present on 27.11.2002, when the raid was
conducted and infringed material was recovered. It is also the case of
prosecution that the accused Devesh Kumar Rathore being director was also in
charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company and
similarly accused Kulbeer was also managing the affairs of company, therefore,
they both are claimed to be liable.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.    Regarding, accused no.3 Surender Wadhwa, it is the claim of investigating
agency that he was also one of the directors of the company, rater he is claimed
to be managing Director, of the company. He was not found present on the day
when the raid was conducted on two occasions. Perusal of chargesheet reveals
that it is mentioned by the investigating agency that accused Surender Wadhwa
is placed in column no.4 of the chargesheet for facing trial since he applied for
Superdari and got the seized goods released in his name and he also perused
other matters in Court. Besides this, against accused no.3, it is alleged that

ORDER ON CHARGE/STATE VS. JITENDER GULATI ORS./ FIR NO.243/02/PS MAYAPURI/U.S.63 of Copyright Act, 1957/01.7.2009/ Page 3 of  
                                                     23 k
 accused no.1 Kulbeer and accused no.2 Devesh Kumar Rathore in their
disclosure statements told the IO that accused Surender Wadhwa was the
Managing Director of M/s Sidharth Optical disc.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.     I have already mentioned the role attributed to accused Jitender Gulati is
that he placed orders for replication of CDs of two movies "Ek Phol Do Maali and
Phool Aur Pathar" to be reproduced/replicated by M/s. Sidharth Optical Disc
without having any authority/licence from the copyright holders of those movies.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.    The investigating agency alongwith the chargesheet has also filed on record
the copy of the minutes of the Boards of Directors of M/s. Sidharth Optical Disc
which are dated 09.2.2002 i.e. nine months prior to the alleged recovery. In the
said minutes book, it is mentioned that Surender Wadhwa and D.K.S. Rathore
were Directors of this company. The item no.1 of said meeting mentions that
accused Surender Wadhwa, on the request of accused D.K.S. Rathore agreed to
act as the Chairman of the meeting and then it was recorded as follows :
</p><p id="p_10">             "Resolved that Sh. Surinder Wadhwa, Director of the company be and
is hereby elected as the Chairman of this meeting of the Board of Directors of
the company and shall continue to act upon as such the Chairman in future also
until otherwise decided by the Board" Then Sh. Surinder Wadhwa, took the chair
and welcomed the Directors to the First Meeting of the Board of Directors of the
company".
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.    In the same minutes, at item no.12, it is recorded as follows :
 "The Chairman informed the Board that since the company has started its
business activities, it is necessary to delegate power to someone to act on
behalf of the Board to carry on the day to day activities including
manufacturing, running and supervision of factory premises, production, sales,
purchase, accounts, income tax, sales tax, excise laws factory Act. Compliance
of trade mark, patent laws and all other laws applicable to the company until
otherwise decided by the Board then he suggested the name of Sh. D.K.S.
Rathore, Director of the company. The matter was discussed and in this
connection          the       following          resolution          was        passed         unanimously.
</p><p id="p_12">      "Resolved that Sh. D.K.S. Rathore, Director of the company be and is hereby
authorised to handle all kinds of day to day operations of the company including

ORDER ON CHARGE/STATE VS. JITENDER GULATI ORS./ FIR NO.243/02/PS MAYAPURI/U.S.63 of Copyright Act, 1957/01.7.2009/ Page 4 of  
                                                     23 k
 manufacturing, running and supervision of factory premises, production sales,
purchase, accounts, income tax, sales tax, excise laws, factories Act,
compliance of trade mark, patent laws and all other laws applicable to the
company until otherwise decided by the Board".
</p>
<p id="p_13">11. It may be mentioned that the minutes dated 09.2.2002 are relied upon by
none other than the prosecution itself. This document is filed by the prosecution
itself and a specific query was asked to Ld. APP and the investigating officer
whether this document is verified to which the investigating officer replied that
these minutes are genuine and, therefore, relied upon by the prosecution and it
is also stated by the IO that even the concerned clerk from the Registrar of
Companies was also examined and is cited as a witness to prove this document.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12. Before proceeding further it                        may be mentioned that law regarding
considerations at the stage of charge are well-settled now. The court has power
to sift and weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether or
not a prima facie case against accused has been made out. It is held that when
the material placed before the court discloses great suspicion against
the accused which has not been properly explained the court will be
justified in framing charge. The judge should not make a roving inquiry
into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence is if he
was conducting a trial. If on the basis of materials on record a court could
come to the conclusion that commission of the offence is a provable
consequence, a case of framing of charge exists. To put it differently, if the
courts were to think that the accused might have committed the
offence it can frame a charge, though for conviction the conclusion is
required to be that the accused has committed the offence. At the stage of
framing of a charge probative value of the materials on record cannot be
gone into, the material brought on record by the prosecution has to be
accepted as true at that stage. The truth, veracity and effect of the
evidence which the prosecutor proposes to adduce are not to be
meticulously judged. Nor is any weight to be attached to the probable
defence of the accused. It is not obligatory for the Judge at that stage of the
trial to consider in any detail and weigh in a sensitive balance whether the facts,

ORDER ON CHARGE/STATE VS. JITENDER GULATI ORS./ FIR NO.243/02/PS MAYAPURI/U.S.63 of Copyright Act, 1957/01.7.2009/ Page 5 of  
                                                     23 k
 if proved, would be incompatible with the innocence of the accused or not. The
standard of test and judgment which is to be finally applied before recording a
finding regarding the guilt or otherwise of the accused is not exactly to be
applied at this stage of deciding the matter under<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_5"> S. 227</a> or<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_6"> S. 228</a> of the code.
At that stage the Court is not to see whether there is sufficient ground for
conviction of the accused or whether the trial is sure to end in his conviction.
But at the initial stage if their is a strong suspicion which leads the Court
to think that there is ground for presuming that the accused has
committed an offence then it is not open to the Court to say that there is no
sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. While deciding the
question of framing of charge in a criminal case, the court is not to apply
exactly the standard and test which it finally applies for determining
the Guilt or otherwise. This being the initial stage of the trial, the court is
not supposed to decide whether the materials collected by the
investigating agency provides sufficient ground for conviction of the
accused or whether the trial is sure to culminate in his conviction. What is
required to be seen is whether there is strong suspicion which may
lead to the court to think that there is ground for presuming that the
accused has committed an offence. Reliance placed on the cases of <a href="/doc/1404566/" id="a_7">Union
of India vs. Prafulla Kumar AI R</a> 1979 Supreme Court 366 : <a href="/doc/702724/" id="a_8">State of

<p id="p_15">13. Ld. counsel for accused no.1 Kulbeer Singh argued that no charge
against Kulbeer Singh is made out since he was merely an employee and he was
merely managing marketing. It is argued that this accused is neither owner nor
director of M/s. Sidharth Optical Disc and articles were not taken by him on
Superdari and he was not to gain anything, therefore, he cannot be charged.
</p>
<p id="p_16">14. I am afraid none of the arguments advanced on behalf of this accused gives
any benefit to the accused. It is the case of prosecution that this accused was

 physically present on 27.11.2002 inside the factory where he was working and
from where a large part of infringed material was recovered. It is not necessary
that in order to be liable a person has to be director of a company.
</p>
<p id="p_17">15. <a href="/doc/1153026/" id="a_12">Section 69</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957, clearly provides that where any
offence under the said act is committed by the company, every person who at
the time, the offence was committed, was in charge of and was responsible to
the company for the conduct of the business of the company, shall be deemed
to be guilty of such offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against.

<p id="p_18">16. Sub section (2) of <a href="/doc/1153026/" id="a_13">section 69</a> of the said Act further provides that
notwithstanding anything contained in sub section (1), if it is proved that the
offence was committed with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to
the negligence on the part of, director, manager , secretary or other officer of
the company, such person shall also be deemed to be guilty and liable to be
proceeded against.
</p>
<p id="p_19">17. The definition in sub sec (2) of this section is wider enough to include any
officer in the company who was in connivance with or who consented or due to
whose negligence the offence is committed. The stand of accused Kulbeer that
he was merely an employee and not a director does not help his case at all.
There is statement u/s 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_14">Cr.P.C</a>. of witnesses particularly employees of the
company that this accused was actively involved in procuring business for the
company regarding reproduction of CDs. There are other communications with
third parties which show that the accused was procuring business for
reproduction of CDs. There is a disclosure statement of this accused Kulbeer
Singh and pursuant to that disclosure statement, the second set of infringed
material was recovered on 01.12.2002. The recovery pursuant to the disclosure
of accused Kulbeer makes admissible the said part of the disclosure which has
led to the recovery. No doubt u/s.25 &amp; 26, confession made to a police officer
and confession made while in custody of police officer, except when it is made in
the presence of a Magistrate, is inadmissible. But <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_15">section 27</a> of the Indian
Evidence Act, 1872, makes admissible such information, whether confession or
not, which relates distinctly to the fact discovered in consequence of the
information provided by an accused. This recovery pursuant to disclosure of this

                                                     23 k
 accused together with the earlier recovery and other material on record show
that this accused Kulbeer was actively involved in the management of the affairs
of the company. The presence of the accused in the factory at the time of
recovery where infringement was being done together with the documents on
record show that Kulbeer was actively participating in the business of the
company and once this is shown, prima facie it is enough at this stage to frame
charges against accused Kulbeer Singh.
</p>
<p id="p_20">18. In view of above discussion, prima facie there are sufficient
material against accused Kulbeer Singh to frame charges u/s.63,65 &amp;
68-<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_16">A of Copyright Act</a>, 1957, as also u/s.292 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17">IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_21">19. So far as second accused Devesh Kumar Rathore is concerned his
Counsel argued that no charges against this accused are made out since this
accused was not a director but he was also merely an employee. It is also
argued that the offence of infringement requires specific mens rea and
knowledge which is lacking in this case and, therefore, charges cannot be
framed. It is also argued that none of the CDs recovered were played by the
prosecution to see its contents and in such circumstances how infringement is
presumed and how it can be said that the blue film CDs were pornographic in
nature. Ld. Counsel for the accused even went to the extent of arguing that
there is a very fine distinction between expression of art and obscenity and also
that unless copies of all such CDs are supplied, the accused is deprived of
proper opportunity to rebut. This accused even dispute the minutes dated
09.2.2002 as mentioned above which are against this accused. It is claimed that
this accused was not a director and was merely an engineer. It is also argued
that in the complaint it is mentioned that infringement is being committed by
company Namit Plastics, whereas in the chargesheet the case was made against
Sidharth Optical Disc. It is also argued that no site plan was prepared by the IO
as to from which place of factory what thing was recovered. It is also argued
that regarding recovery on 01.12.2002, the case of the prosecution remains only
qua two films and                  how the           prosecution         is    presuming          that the two
plates/stampers recovered were pertaining to that film only and also that copies
of that plate were not given to the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_22">ORDER ON CHARGE/STATE VS. JITENDER GULATI ORS./ FIR NO.243/02/PS MAYAPURI/U.S.63 of Copyright Act, 1957/01.7.2009/ Page 8 of  
                                                     23 k
</p><p id="p_23"> 20. None of the arguments raised on behalf of accused Devesh Kumar Rathore
is of any help to him. The argument that copies of plates/stampers and blue film
CDs etc. are not supplied to the accused is absolutely misconceived. It is not
necessary in every case that copies of the case property particularly the cases
of this nature, the infringed copies are to be supplied. In some cases, there may
be machinery which may be huge and heavy. If the arguments of this accused
are to be accepted, the accused will start asking copies of those machines also.
It is also noticed that mostly those machines are expensive. I don't see any
reason as to why prosecution should be burdened with such additional expenses
to prepare copies of infringed articles or plates for supply of the same to
accused. At the stage of charge, it is sufficient that those were found to be
infringed by the witnesses during investigation. When the case property will be
produced in the Court, the contents of the same can indeed be seen by playing
those CDs/MP3 during evidence. Therefore, arguments that copies of plates and
CDs not supplied to the accused are without force. Similarly, the argument that
there is a distinction between expression of art and obscenity is also matter of
trial and at this stage, what is to be seen is whether the CDs were containing
pornographic material. It is on record in the statement of witnesses that those
CDs were containing pornographic material and at this stage, it is sufficient to
frame charges.
</p>
<p id="p_24">21. The next argument of the accused that he was not a director or that he was
merely an engineer is absolutely against the record which the prosecution has
filed. Memorandum of article of association of the company M/s. Sidharth Optical
Disc is on record which shows that Devesh Kumar Rathore was director. It is
already mentioned above that the minutes dated 09.2.2002 were verified by the
investigating agency and were found to be genuine. Those minutes contains
signatures of this accused and in the item no.12 taken on that day in the
meeting, it is specifically mentioned that it is this accused who was responsible
for all business activities, day to day activities, including manufacturing running
and supervision of factory premises, production, sale, purchase, account,
taxation and compliance of the laws of land. Besides this, there are number of
documents placed on record with the chargesheet which shows that this


ORDER ON CHARGE/STATE VS. JITENDER GULATI ORS./ FIR NO.243/02/PS MAYAPURI/U.S.63 of Copyright Act, 1957/01.7.2009/ Page 9 of  
                                                     23 k
 accused who was actively managing the business of this company with various
clients and he has signed various such communications sent to the clients of the
company. This accused was also physically present in the factory when it was
raided and on the disclosure of this accused, again recovery dated 01.12.2002
was effected. The said part of disclosure is admissible u/s.27 of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_18">Evidence
Act</a>, as mentioned above. The argument that the site plan was not prepared and
the difference of name of company in the complaint and ruqqa is also of no help
to the accused at this stage. The case of prosecution is that although complaint
mentioned the name of M/s Namit Plastics but when the premises was physically
raided, the company was found to be run under the name of Sidharth Optical
Disc and recovery was effected from there. This accused is a director of Sidharth
Optical Disc, rather the documents alongwith the chargesheet, which this
accused communicated with the clients of company, and also the minutes dated
09.2.2002 clearly reveals that it was this accused who was managing the affairs
of M/s. Sidharth Optical Disc.
</p>
<p id="p_25">22. Accordingly, there are prima facie sufficient material to frame
charges u/s.63,65 &amp; 68-<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_19">A of Copyright Act</a>, 1957 and <a href="/doc/1704109/" id="a_20">section 292</a> of IPC
against this accused Devesh Kumar Rathore also.
</p>
<p id="p_26">23. Counsel for accused no.3 Surender Wadhwa argued that charges against
this accused also are not made out. It is argued that the complaint in the
present case is undated and on a printed format, where after filling up certain
blanks, the name of Namit Plastics is mentioned. It is also argued that the first
date of the complaint which appears on the complaint is 25.11.2002 and, there
is no marking by DCP to ACP and, as to how the ACP started action on this
complaint is anybody's guess. It is also argued that without registering FIR, how
the raid could be conducted and such raid and seizure is illegal. It is further
argued that as to from where Jasvinder Sharma's name came to be mentioned in
the ruqqa, whereas it is not there in the complaint. It is next argued that SI
Ranbir Singh, who is a witness of everything himself became the Investigating
Officer and the investigation was not assigned to anybody else and, as to how
before the raid was conducted, the name of accused came to be known to the
police. It is argued that all these things shows that it is a false case and it is

ORDER ON CHARGE/STATE VS. JITENDER GULATI ORS./ FIR NO.243/02/PS MAYAPURI/U.S.63 of Copyright Act, 1957/01.7.2009/ Page 10 of  
                                                      23 k
 general complaint, therefore, no charges can be framed.
</p>
<p id="p_27">24. Again, none of the arguments raised as above on behalf of the accused
Surender Wadhwa is of any help to him. All the contentions as raised above are
questions of fact including the question whether the case is truthful or not,
which can be decided only after trial and after the evidence is recorded and it
cannot be prejudged without taking evidence. It is well settled law that defects
in investigation, if any cannot go to the benefit of accused unless prejudice is
shown similarly the Investigating Officer SI Ranbir Singh was himself a witness of
everything and himself investigated the case is also not a fatal lacuna and
benefit of the same can be asked by the accused only if serious prejudice is
shown. Those questions can be gone into after the evidence is recorded and
not prior to it. The arguments which are raised above might prove to be good
arguments at the stage of cross examination of witnesses or at the stage of final
arguments. But at the stage of charge when only prima facie case is to be seen,
none of these arguments help the case of accused Surender Wadhwa at all.
</p>
<p id="p_28">25. On behalf of accused Surender Wadhwa second limb of argument raised is
that, he was not in charge of and responsible for the conduct of business of the
company, he was not even present in the factory; vide resolution dated
09.2.2002, it was accused Devesh Kumar Rathore, who was managing the
affairs of the company and, therefore, this accused Surrender Wadhwa cannot
be charged as there is no evidence whatsoever with the prosecution to show
that this accused Surender Wadhwa was in charge of and responsible for the
conduct of the business of the company. It is also argued that without charging
the company and without making the company as an accused, charges against
accused Surender Wadhwa cannot be framed. It is also argued that perusal of
chargesheet would reveal that he has been charge sheeted merely because he
applied for Superdari and in order to hold this accused vicariously liable, his
liability as on the date of offence is to be seen and not his subsequent conduct.
Ld. Counsel for accused Surender Wadhwa relied upon various cases.
</p>
<p id="p_29">26. Hon'ble Supreme Court in a catena of judgment has held that a Managing
Director of a company is deemed to be incharge of and responsible for the
conduct of the business of the company. In the case of SMS Pharmaceuticals

ORDER ON CHARGE/STATE VS. JITENDER GULATI ORS./ FIR NO.243/02/PS MAYAPURI/U.S.63 of Copyright Act, 1957/01.7.2009/ Page 11 of  
                                                      23 k
 Vs. Neeta Bhalla &amp; another (2005) 8 SCC 89, a three Judge Bench of
Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a Managing Director or a Joint Managing
Director would be admittedly incharge of and responsible to the company for the
conduct of its business. It was held that holders of such position in a company
make them liable by virtue of the office they hold as Managing Director or Joint
Managing Director. To the same effect is the decision in various other cases of
Hon'ble Supreme Court and this issue is no longer res Integra.
</p>
<p id="p_30">27. <a href="/doc/1153026/" id="a_21">Section 69</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957, specifically provides that those
directors who are in charge of and responsible for the conduct of business of the
company would be deemed to be guilty and liable. The question in this case
regarding accused Surender Wadhwa is, whether he was in charge of and
responsible for the conduct of business of the company? In case material prima
facie suggest that accused Surender Wadhwa was a Managing Director, as
claimed by the prosecution, there would be a presumption that he was in charge
of and responsible for the business of company and he would be vicariously
liable since every Managing Director is presumed to be in charge of and
responsible for the conduct of the business of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_31">28. All that is mentioned in the chargesheet against accused Surender Wadhwa
is that accused Surender Wadhwa is charge sheeted and is placed in column no.
4 because he obtained the articles on Superdari after the raid. I am afraid this
stand of prosecution is absolutely misconceived. In order to impose a vicarious
liability, the investigating agency was supposed to bring some material on
record other than obtaining the goods on superdari, which shows that accused
Surender Wadhwa was in charge of and responsible for the business of the
company on the day when the offence is committed and prosecution cannot rely
on the circumstance after of the commission of the offence that the accused
was in charge of and so responsible. It may also be mentioned here that the
vicarious liability does not get invoked merely because a person is in charge of
the business of the company rather in order to fasten vicarious liability u/s. 69 of
the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_22">Copyright Act</a>, 1957, the person must be shown to be both in charge of as
well as responsible for the conduct of business of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_32">29. Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Everest Advertising Pvt. Ltd. Vs.

                                                      23 k
 State AIR 2007 SC 1650 has specifically observed that the liability of a
director must be determined on the date of offence and also it was held
that       before         legal        fiction        of     fastening            vicarious          liability        is
invoked/raised, the ingredients thereof must be satisfied. It is also
mentioned that a Chairman of a company may not be aware of the transaction.
Merely on the basis that accused Surender obtained goods on Superdari, the
accused cannot be fastened with vicarious liability.
</p>
<p id="p_33">30. However, <a href="/doc/1153026/" id="a_23">Section 69</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957, and as mentioned above,
provides, that where any offence is committed by a company under this Act,
every person who at the time the offence was committed was incharge of and
was responsible to the company for, the conduct of the business of the
company, as well as the company shall be deemed to be guilty of such offence.
The proviso clause of subsection (1) of <a href="/doc/1153026/" id="a_24">section 69</a> provides that if a person
proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge or that he
exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence, he shall
not be liable.
</p>
<p id="p_34">30. The question whether the offence was committed without knowledge of
accused Surender Wadhwa or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent the
commission of offence, would arise only after evidence is taken, since ,such fact
will have to be proved in evidence. This issue cannot be prejudged without
taking evidence. The very word used in the proviso is that if such person proves
(emphasis supplied). The word proving means proving in evidence. Therefore,
accused Surender Wadhwa cannot claim that the offences were committed
without his knowledge or that he exercised due diligence to prevent the
commission of such offences.
</p>
<p id="p_35">31. Not only this, subsection (2) of <a href="/doc/1153026/" id="a_25">section 69</a> is wider in definition and it reads,
that notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (1), where an offence
under this Act has been committed by a company, and it is proved that the
offence was committed with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to
any negligence on the part of, any Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer
of the company, such person shall also be deemed to be guilty of that offence.

deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against
and punished accordingly. Proviso to sub-s. (1) however engrafts an exception
in the case of any such person if he were to prove that the offence was
committed without his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to
prevent the commission of such offence. It would be noticed that sub-s. (1) of<a href="/doc/232464/" id="a_30"> S.

Act, 1954 which fell for consideration in I. K. Nangia's case. Furthermore,
proviso to sub-s. (1) shifts the burden on the delinquent officer or
servant of the company responsible for the commission of the offence.
The burden is on him to prove that he did not know of the offence or
connived in it or that he had exercised all due diligence to prevent the
commission of such offence. The non obstante clause in sub-s. (2)
expressly provides that notwithstanding anything contained in subs.

</p>
<p id="p_39">33. In the present case, it is the case of prosecution that accused Surender
Wadhwa was a Managing Director, and even though the minutes dated
09.2.2002 is true, but still accused Surender Wadhwa was managing the affairs


ORDER ON CHARGE/STATE VS. JITENDER GULATI ORS./ FIR NO.243/02/PS MAYAPURI/U.S.63 of Copyright Act, 1957/01.7.2009/ Page 14 of  
                                                      23 k
 of the company. Whether or not accused Surender Wadhwa was managing the
affairs after 09.2.2002, but one thing is clear that even after 09.2.2002, the
accused Surender Wadhwa was taking part in the affairs of the company. Some
of the communications by the third party which are on record show that accused
Surender Wadhwa was actively taking part in the affairs of the company. There
is one letter dated 31.8.2002 by M/s. AEC Info race which is addressed to this
accused Surender Wadhwa as Managing Director. There is another letter dated
08.10.2002 by M/s. Spinks India wherein the name of accused figures. Similarly,
there is one letter dated 07.9.2002 by Venus Records &amp; Tapes. There is another
letter dated 01.7.2002 to the accused Mr. Wadhwa from Lucky Star
Entertainment which goes to say that further to discussion between the accused
Surender Wadhwa and the sender of the letter, order was being placed. Besides
this, there is statement of the witnesses u/s.161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_32">Cr.P.C</a>. namely Mohinder Singh
and Prabhat Kumar, employees of the company who has specifically stated that
accused Surender Wadhwa was involved in procuring orders. All these
primafacie suggest that accused Surender Wadhwa was managing the affairs of
the company despite the minutes dated 09.2.2002. At least it shows gross
negligence by accused Surender Wadhwa and consent and connivance of this
accused due to which the offence was committed by the company M/s. Sidharth
Optical Disc. Primafacie, therefore, the case of accused Surender Wadhwa is
covered u/s.69 (2) of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_33">Copyright Act</a>, 1957, and, therefore, accused Surender
Wadhwa is liable to be charged for the offences committed by the company M/s.
Sidharth Optical Disc.
</p>
<p id="p_40">31. Ld. Counsel for the accused Surender Wadhwa relied upon the case of N.K.
Wahi Vs. Shekhar Singh and others, 2007 (4) SCALE (page 188) to show
that only such person would be liable who at the time when the offence was
committed was in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of
the business of the company. Merely being a director of the company in absence
of any evidence or allegation that he was in charge of and so responsible, a
director would not be liable. It was also held that to launch a prosecution,
therefore, against the alleged directors, there must be specific allegation in the
complaint as to the part played by them in the transaction and that there should

                                                      23 k
 be clear and unambiguous allegation as to how the directors are in charge of
and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company. It is also
mentioned that description should be clear and although it is not necessary to
use precise words from the provisions of the Act but still in absence of any such
evidence or specific evidence, such complaint would not be maintainable. To the
same effect is the decision in the case of K. Srikant Singh Vs. M/s. North
East Securities Ltd., 2007(9) SCALE (page 371). He has also placed
reliance upon the case of Vidyawati Lakhotia Vs. Local Health Authority,
2001(60) DRJ 242, from Delhi High Court, wherein it was held that when the
petitioner in that case was not shown to be anywhere responsible for the
conduct of the business of the firm, the petitioner could not be held responsible.
Reliance is also placed upon the case of State of Madras Vs. C.V. Parekh,
AIR 1971 SC 447, wherein it was held that when an offence is committed by a
clerk of company and there was no evidence from which it could be inferred that
Manager of Director had any knowledge of the offence, mere circumstances that
they were in de-facto management of affairs of company and were aware of
arrival of goods which were subsequently sold by the clerk could only create
suspicion but not proof against them and the Manager and the Director cannot
be convicted.
</p>
<p id="p_41">32. The judgments relied upon by the accused as above does not help the case
of accused Surender wadhwa as they are distinguishable on facts as discussed
above and that the case of accused is covered u/s 69(2) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_42">33. Ld. counsel for accused Surender Wadhwa also relied upon the case of N.L.
Lakhotia &amp; Ors. vs. State 36(1988) DLT 175, to argue that if the company is
not prosecuted or punished, the Directors cannot be prosecuted. That case was
for offence u/s.53 of the MRTP Act.

company which committed the offence, (2) Everyone who was in
charge of and was responsible for the business of the company, (3) any
other person who is a director or a manager or a secretary or officer of
the company, with whose connivance or due to whose neglect the
company                    has               committed                      the              offence.                  "

only if the company is prosecuted. But instead of prosecuting the company if a
payee opts to prosecute only the persons falling within the second or third
category the payee can succeed in the case only if he succeeds in showing that
the offence was actually committed by the company. In such a prosecution the
accused can show that the company has not committed the offence, though
such company is not made an accused, and hence the prosecuted accused is
not liable to be punished. The provisions do not contain a condition that
prosecution of the company is sine qua non for prosecution of the other persons
who fall within the second and the third categories mentioned above. No doubt
a finding that the offence was committed by the company is sine qua non for
convicting those other persons. But if a company is not prosecuted due to any
legal snag or otherwise, the other prosecuted persons cannot, on that score
alone, escape from the penal liability created through the legal fiction envisaged

In the light of the aforesaid view we do not consider it necessary to deal with

and hence the High Court quashed the proceedings as against the others.

this Court can summon an additional accused if it appears to be involved in the

</p><p id="p_52">         "30. As the company cannot be sentenced to imprisonment, the court has
to resort to punishment of imposition of fine which is also a prescribed
punishment. As per the scheme of various enactments and also<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_48"> the Indian Penal
Code</a>, mandatory custodial sentence is prescribed for graver offences. If the
appellants' plea is accepted, no company                                or corporate bodies could be
prosecuted for the graver offences whereas they could be prosecuted for minor
offences as the sentence prescribed therein is custodial sentence or fine. We do
not think that the intention of the legislature is to give complete immunity from
prosecution to the corporate bodies for these grave offences. The offences
mentioned under Section 56(1) of the FERA Act, 1973, namely, those under
<a href="/doc/4010217/" id="a_49">Section 13</a>; clause (a) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1703533/" id="a_50">Section 18</a>; <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_51">Section 18-A</a>; clause (a)
of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/262036/" id="a_52">Section 19</a>; sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/526211/" id="a_53">Section 44</a>, for which the
minimum sentence of six months' imprisonment is prescribed, are serious
offences and if committed would have serious financial consequences affecting
the economy of the country. All those offences could be committed by company
or corporate bodies. We do not think that the legislative intent is not to
prosecute the companies for these serious offences, if these offences involve
the amount or value of more than Rs. one lakh, and that they could be
prosecuted only when the offences involve an amount or value less than Rs. one
lakh.                                            (Emphasis                                                 supplied)
             As the company cannot be sentenced to imprisonment, the court
cannot impose that punishment, but when imprisonment and fine is the
prescribed punishment the court can impose the punishment of fine which could
be enforced against the company . Such a discretion is to be read into the
section so far as the juristic person is concerned. Of course, the court cannot
exercise the same discretion as regards a natural person. Then the court would
not be passing the sentence in accordance with law. As regards company , the
court can always impose a sentence of fine and the sentence of imprisonment
can be ignored as it is impossible to be carried out in respect of a company .
This appears to be the intention of the legislature and we find no difficulty in

 construing the statute in such a way. We do not think that there is a blanket
immunity for any company from any prosecution for serious offences merely
because the prosecution would ultimately entail a sentence of mandatory
imprisonment. The corporate bodies, such as a firm or company undertake a
series of activities that affect the life, liberty and property of the citizens. Large-
scale financial irregularities are done by various corporations. The corporate
vehicle now occupies such a large portion of the industrial, commercial and
sociological sectors that amenability of the corporation to a criminal law is
essential to have a peaceful society with stable economy."
</p>
<p id="p_53">37. Ld. counsel for the accused also placed reliance upon the case of Maqsood
Syed Vs. State of Gujarat and Others, 2007 (11) SCALE (Page 318)
wherein it was held that there is no provision for attaching vicarious liability on
the part of the Managing Director or the directors of the company when the
accused is the company unless there is specific provision in the statute existing
in that behalf. On the basis of this judgment, it is argued that for the offence u/s.
292 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_54">IPC</a> there cannot be any vicarious liability. Reliance is also placed upon the
case of S.K. Alagh Vs. State of UP, AIR 2008 SC 1731, wherein also it was
held that in absence of any provision laid down under statute, a Director of a
company or an employee cannot be held to be vicariously liable.
</p>
<p id="p_54">38. No doubt in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_55"> the Indian Penal Code</a> there is no provision for vicarious liability
therefore accused Surender Wadhwa cannot be charged for the offence u/s 292
of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_56">IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_55">39. Reliance is lastly placed upon the case of State Vs. Md. Iqbal Gazi, 154
(2008) DLT 481, to support the argument that without registering FIR, when
the complaint disclosed cognizable offences, seizure was illegal. The said
judgment does not anywhere lays down such a law. All that it says is, that where
information is given to Officer Incharge of a PS which discloses cognizable
offence, the officer in charge is bound to reduce information in writing in book
prescribed in this behalf u/s.154 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_57">Cr.P.C</a>..

 the company M/s. Sidharth Optical Disc be summoned as an accused.
</p>
<p id="p_57">35. Coming to the question of charge against fourth accused Jitender Gulati,
as mentioned above, the prosecution case against him                                         is only regarding
duplicating the CDs/VCDs of two movies namely 'Phool Aur Pathar' and 'Ek Phool
Do Maali'. The case of prosecution against him is that the accused Jitender
Gulati asked the accused M/s. Sidharth Optical Disc to reproduce/replicate the
CDs of these movies whereas accused Jitender Gulati had no such assignment of
copyright or licence of copyright from the producers of movie or the copyright
holders of the movie. The prosecution also chargesheeted accused Jitender
Gulati for the offences u/s.468 &amp; 471 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_59">IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_58">36. <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_60">Section 468</a> of IPC provides punishment, where a document is forged for the
purposes of cheating.
</p>
<p id="p_59">37. <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_61">Section 471</a> of IPC provides punishment for using a forged document by a
person knowing or having reasons to believe it to be forged.
</p>
<p id="p_60">38. In the present case, the prosecution was specifically question as to which is
the document which is claimed to be forged by the accused. Prosecution claims
that accused Jitender Gulati as proprietor of M/s. Shanti Enterprises wrote a
letter to M/s. Sidharth Optical Disc Pvt. Ltd., which is dated 16.10.2002 under his
signatures         and      vide     this     letter      the     accused         company          was      supplied
stampers/masters for replication and it was vide this letter that the
stampers/masters of movie 'Phool Aur Pathar' and 'Ek Phool Do Mali' was
supplied to accused company. Ld. APP for the State argued that in this letter the
accused Jitender Gulati claimed that he has copyright of the said movies and,
therefore, this letter is forged. The signatures of accused Jitender Gulati is
confirmed by the handwriting expert, but I am afraid that these allegations does
not bring the document within the definition of forgery as defined in <a href="/doc/1745798/" id="a_62">section 464</a>
of IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_61">39. <a href="/doc/1745798/" id="a_63">Section 464</a> of IPC so far as relevant for our purposes, provides that a person
is said to make a false document, if he dishonestly or fraudulently makes, sign,
seals or execute a document or part of a document; or makes any mark
denoting the execution of a document, with the intention of causing it to be

 believed that such document or part of document was signed, made, sealed,
executed or affixed by or by the authority of a person by whom or by whose
authority he knows that it was not so made, signed, sealed or executed. In the
present case at the most it can be said that the accused Jitender Gulati made a
false claim in the letter dated 16.10.2002, but merely making a false claim by
itself does not bring the document within the document of making a false
document as defined in <a href="/doc/1745798/" id="a_64">section 464</a> of IPC. Once forgery is not there, there is no
question of using a forged document, therefore, charges u/s.468 &amp; 471 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_65">IPC</a>
are not made out against accused Jitender Gulati.
</p>
<p id="p_62">40. Ld. counsel Sh. Suman Kapoor for accused Jitender Gulati argued that
charges under <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_66">Copyright Act</a> cannot be framed against accused since he is not
connected with the company, he was not present at the spot at the time of
recovery, nothing was recovered from his possession. Ld. Counsel for the
accused Jitender Gulati during arguments relied upon documents dated
16.7.1998 executed between Ralan Productions and Kay Kay Vision vide which
copyright of movie 'Phool Aur Pathar' is claimed to be assigned to M/s. Kay Kay
Vision. He also relied upon one document executed by M/s. Kay Kay Vision in
favour of M/s. Wide Angel Media Ltd., assigning the copyright further and one
letter by M/s. Wide Angel Media Ltd., in favour of M/s. Shanti Enterprises.
Similarly, regarding movie 'Ek Phool Do Maali' he relied on a document executed
by Goel Cine Corporation in favour of M/s. Jordan Electronics and on letter by
Jordan Electronics in favour of M/s. Shanti Enterprises. He also relied upon one
document dated 20.11.2002 to show that stampers of these two movies were
given to the accused company only for testing purposes. On the basis of these
documents, he argued that the IO of this case without verifying these
documents to be genuine or not chargesheeted the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_63">41. The IO of this case was questioned about these documents, and the IO
specifically stated that these documents were not supplied by the accused to
the investigating agency during investigation nor its original were ever produced
and these documents are not at all relied upon by the prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_64">42. Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Orissa Vs. Devender Nath
Padhi, AIR 2005 SC 359 has specifically held that at the stage of charge, the

                                                      23 k
 documents relied upon by the prosecution only can be looked into and the
documents relied upon by an accused in his defence cannot be considered. In
such circumstances, these documents have no bearing on the question of
decision on charge and cannot be looked into by this Court. Even otherwise, the
accused did not furnish the original of these documents and claimed on
06.6.2009 in the Court that originals were given to accused company and the
accused was unaware about the status of these original documents.
</p>
<p id="p_65">43. The question which arises is what offence is made out against accused
Jitender Gulati?
</p>
<p id="p_66">44. <a href="/doc/1038145/" id="a_67">Section 51</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957 defines infringement and <a href="/doc/363642/" id="a_68">section 63</a> of
the Copyright Act, 1957 provides that any person who knowingly infringes or
abets the infringement of the copyright in a work shall be punishable.
</p>
<p id="p_67">45. In the present case, when the accused Jitender Gulati supplied stampers of
these two movies namely 'Phool Aur Pathar' and 'Ek Phool Do Maali' without
having any copyright in his favour, he abetted the reproduction of the CDs of
these two movies by the accused company.
</p>
<p id="p_68">46. <a href="/doc/4010217/" id="a_69">Section 13</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957 provides that copyright subsists in a
cinematograph film. <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_70">Section 14</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957 provides that in case
of a cinematograph film, the right to make the copy of a film, including a

</p>
<p id="p_69">47. Accordingly, primafacie there are sufficient material to frame charges u/s.63

</p>
<p id="p_70">48. Charges against all the four accused be framed accordingly, as above.
