        W.P.(C)Nos.33982 of 2015 &amp; 862 of 2018
        -------------------------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 8th day of June, 2018

                            JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       These two writ petitions have been filed by one

person, who claims to be the owner of a property,

neighbouring that of Smt.Alphonsa James, who has been

arrayed as the third respondent in W.P.(C)No.33982/2015

and as fourth respondent in W.P.(C)No.862/2018 .

</p><p id="p_2">       2. Even though these two writ petitions relate to

different causes of action, the constitutive issues in both

are common and are entwined to each other. I, therefore,

propose to dispose of these writ petitions by this

judgment, but for the sake of convenience, I treat W.P.

(C)No.33982/2015 as the lead case and reference to the

parties and exhibits herein will be as appearing in that

writ petition, unless specified otherwise.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WPC 33982/15 &amp; 862/18            2</span>



</p><p id="p_3">        3. I have heard Sri.K.Abdul Jawad, learned counsel

for the petitioner, Sri.T.M.Chandran, learned counsel

appearing for the party respondent, Smt.Alphonsa James,

Sri.K.S.Bharathan, learned Standing Counsel for the

Panchayat, Sri.T.Naveen, learned Standing Counsel for

the Pollution Control Board and the learned Senior

Government Pleader appearing on behalf of the official

respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4. As I have already said above, the petitioner

says, he is the owner of the property neighbouring that of

Smt.Alphonsa James, who asserts, is making an attempt

to   establish    a     new   M-Sand   unit   in   her    property.

Smt.Alphonsa James is stated to be already operating a

stone crusher unit in her property for the last several

years and the petitioner's allegations appear primarily to

be targeted against the establishment of the new M-Sand

Unit   by    Smt.Alphonsa      James   in     an   area   property

contiguous to the property where the stone crusher unit
WPC 33982/15 &amp; 862/18       3



is functioning, though he also has a case that the horse

power of the existing stone crusher unit is sought to be

enhanced without following the due procedure.

</p><p id="p_5">        5. The materials available on record would show

that Smt.Alphonsa James had obtained a building permit

to construct a factory to house the M-Sand unit on

17.12.2014 and that she made an application for D &amp; O

licence on 02.11.2017. The singular allegation of the

petitioner is that the building permit was issued by the

Panchayat on 17.12.2014 even though Smt.Alphonsa

James had not even applied for or obtained the imperative

establishment licence under Section 233 of the Kerala

Panchayat Raj Act. According to him, it is now settled law

that no activity, of the kind mentioned in Section 233 of

the Act, can be permitted without a specific permission

being obtained from the Panchayat. He thus alleges that

Smt.Alphonsa James had illegally constructed a building

on the strength of the building permit issued by the
WPC 33982/15 &amp; 862/18        4



Panchayat unlawfully and prays that the construction,

intended to house the M-Sand unit, made without

securing the establishment permit under Section 233 of

the Act be declared to be illegal and to consequently

injunct her from establishing any such unit.

</p><p id="p_6">        6. While W.P.(C)No.33982/2015 was pending, it

appears that Smt.Alphonsa James had applied for and

obtained a consent from the Pollution Control Board to

establish the unit and that it was challenged by the

petitioner by filing an appeal before the competent

Appellate Authority under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. On the allegations that this appeal

was not being considered by the said Appellate Authority

and that his objections against the building permit was

being refused to be considered by the Panchayat, he

approached this Court by filing W.P.(C)No.25699/2015,

which culminated in Exhibit P5 judgment. As is clear from

the said judgment, the petitioner had confined his relief
WPC 33982/15 &amp; 862/18       5



to have his objections before the Panchayat Committee

and his appeal, against the consent issued by the

Pollution Control Board, pending before the competent

Appellate Authority, be considered expeditiously. It is

relevant and pertinent that at the time when he preferred

W.P.(C)No.25699/2015, he had not raised a claim that the

building permit was incompetent on account of the fact

that    Smt.Alphonsa    James   has   not   obtained   the

establishment permit under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Section 233</a> of the Act.

</p><p id="p_7">        7. Even though the Air Appellate Authority was

directed to consider and dispose of the appeal preferred

by the petitioner before it by this Court in Exhibit P5

judgment, it appears that the petitioner did not pursue it

before the siad Authority and the learned counsel for the

petitioner submits that this was because there was no

sitting of the said Authority for a continuously long

duration of time. Even though the pleading on record

simply state that the appeal was dismissed as having
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WPC 33982/15 &amp; 862/18            6</span>



become      infructuous,   the       learned   counsel   for   the

petitioner submits that, in fact, the appeal was closed

because by then a new consent to operate had been

issued by the Pollution Control Board. He says that this

consent has been placed on record as Exhibit P9 in W.P.

(C)No.862/2018 and that the same has been challenged

on the ground that it is vitiated in law and having been

issued without jurisdiction by the Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_8">        8. On an examination of the facts as are above

narrated, it becomes obvious that even Smt.Alphonsa

James does not have a case that before she applied for

and   obtained     the   building     permit   and   commenced

construction of the factory intended to house the M-Sand

unit, she had obtained any establishment permit under

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Section 233</a> of the Act and it is now well settled, by a

catena of decisions on this point, that any construction or

establishment of a factory can be made only after a

permit is obtained under the provisions of this Section .
</p><p id="p_9">WPC 33982/15 &amp; 862/18       7



</p><p id="p_10">        9. That being said, in the case at hand, I notice

that when Smt.Alphonsa James started construction on

the strength of a building permit issued to her, the

petitioner challenged the same by preferring objections

before the Panchayat Committee but without specifically

including therein that she had not obtained a <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Section 233</a>

permission prior to it. This was why in Exhibit P5

judgment, the learned Single Judge had disposed of the

writ petition directing that the objections preferred by

the petitioner before the Panchayat Committee, against

the building permit, be considered expeditiously, but

without, however, being aware that no establishment

permit had been obtained prior to the building permit

being issued by the Panchayat, since such a contention

had not been taken by the petitioner therein.

</p><p id="p_11">        10. Taking advantage of this apparent omission,

Sri.T.M.Chandran, the learned counsel appearing for

Smt.Alphonsa James, submits that the allegation of the
WPC 33982/15 &amp; 862/18        8



petitioner, based on <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Section 233</a> of the Act in this writ

petition, is, thus completely untenable and impermissible

at this point of time, because the petitioner had not raised

this objection when he had approached this Court earlier

and therefore that, since the construction of the building

has now been completed, it is inequitable and improper

for the petitioner to raise such contentions and file a

subsequent writ petition before this Court.

</p><p id="p_12">        11. Even though I have heard the learned counsel

as above, the fact remains that the law specifies that no

person shall, without the permission of the Village

Panchayat under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Section 233</a>, construct or establish any

factory. Obviously, therefore, the construction of the

factory also has to be preceded by a <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Section 233</a>

permission. In other words, before Smt.Alphonsa James

had obtained the building permit, she should have

ensured she had applied for and obtained a <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Section 233</a>

permit. The officials of the Panchayat who issued the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WPC 33982/15 &amp; 862/18             9</span>



building permit were also in error in not ensuring that a

prior <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Section 233</a> permission had been issued. However,

the fact also remains that the petitioner had challenged

the building permit by approaching this Court, which

culminated in Exhibit P5 judgment, wherein directions

were given only to consider the objections to the building

permit but not to assess its validity in having been issued

without a prior <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Section 233</a> establishment permit having

been    obtained        by   Smt.Alphonsa    James,    since   the

petitioner had raised no such contention then.

</p><p id="p_13">        12.    The      learned   Standing   Counsel     for   the

Panchayat relying upon the counter affidavit filed on

behalf of the Panchayat submits that the petitioner has

made the challenge under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Section 233</a> of the Act

belatedly and that he should be seen to have given up

such contentions when he obtained Exhibit P5 judgment.

However, he concedes that Smt.Alphonsa James has not

obtained a <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Section 233</a> permission prior to the building
WPC 33982/15 &amp; 862/18         10



permit was issued but his contention on this is that that

would be of no consequence any more because the

petitioner has virtually given up such contentions in

Exhibit P5 judgment. When I asked him pointedly

whether the Panchayat would have any objection in a

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Section 233</a> application being considered by it, if it is

preferred by Smt.Alphonsa James, his answer was to the

affirmative and he said that they would have no objection

in doing so.      The above being so, I am of the firm view

that even though Smt.Alphonsa James had obtained a

building permit and has completed the construction even

prior to the issuance of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Section 233</a> permission, such

construction, in the particular facts noticed above, cannot

be automatically found illegal and that she should be

given the benefit of an opportunity of setting things right,

but subject to the rigor of the specific provisions of law.

</p><p id="p_14">        13. In that view of the matter, I am certain in my

opinion that Smt.Alphonsa James cannot be allowed to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WPC 33982/15 &amp; 862/18            11</span>



establish the new factory or to run the business of

manufacture of M-Sand unless she applies for and obtains

a <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Section 233</a> permit from the Village Panchayat. It is

only on the basis of such a permission can she establish

the factory, though the construction of the building is

complete and to operate it, of course, subject to a D &amp; O

licence to be obtained by her.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        14. As regards the consent to operate issued by

the Pollution Control Board is concerned, I am of the view

that since the earlier consent to establish issued to

Smt.Alphonsa       James   had        been   challenged   by   the

petitioner by filing a statutory appeal before the Air

Appellate Authority but had then chosen not to prosecute

it in spite of Exhibit P5 judgment, it is not justified on his

part in challenging the subsequent consent to operate,

namely Exhibit P9 in W.P.(C)No.862/2018, before this

Court directly. This is more so because, the remedy of a

statutory appeal, available to the petitioner under the
WPC 33982/15 &amp; 862/18        12



provisions of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, is equally efficacious, if not more, than approaching

this Court because the said Appellate Authority has the
