Appeal (civil)  106 of 2001

PETITIONER:
Federal Bank Ltd.				

RESPONDENT:
Sagar Thomas &amp; Ors.

Brijesh Kumar &amp; Arun Kumar.

JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">JUDGMENT

Brijesh Kumar, J.
</p>


<p id="p_2">		The respondent no.1 Sagar Thomas was working as a 
Branch Manager in Karunagappally branch of the appellant Bank, 
namely, the Federal Bank, having its registered office at Alwaye, Kerala.  
He was, however, suspended on 29.5.1982, since a disciplinary enquiry 
was ordered into some charges against him for having exceeded his 
authority in grant of loans and advances to different parties.  The inquiry 
officer found him guilty of the charges and ultimately punishment of 
dismissal was awarded to the respondent. 
</p><p id="p_3">		The respondent no.1 challenged the order of his dismissal by 
filing a writ petition in the High Court.  A preliminary objection about 
maintainability of writ petition seems to have been taken, in defence by 
the Federal Bank, saying that it is a private bank and not a State or its  
agency or instrumentality, within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_1">Article 12</a> of the 
Constitution of India, hence a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the 
Constitution is not maintainable against it.  The learned single Judge, 
however, found that the Federal Bank performs  public duty and observed 
thus:
</p><p id="p_4">"As per statutes, the Reserve Bank and the Central 
Government exercise all pervading functional, fiduciary 
and managerial control over the banking industry.  Every 
banking company is duty bound to carry on banking 
business as per the banking policy under stringent control 
of the Reserve Bank in the interest of banking system or 
in the interest of monetary stability of sound economic 
growth, having due regard to the interest of the 
depositors.  The activities carried on by the bank are vital 
to public interest and have potential to affect the socio-
economic development and growth of the nation. 
Banking companies are therefore, public institutions, 
accepting deposits from public, financial assistance from 
the State through its agencies/instrumentalities, for the 
purpose of lending or investment, pursuing banking 
policy and engaged in matters of high public interest or 
performing public functions, ensuring monetary stability, 
sound economic growth, equitable allocation of various 
funds to efficient use, for the promotion and growth of 
economy and welfare of the State.  The first respondent 
is, thus, performing a public duty and a positive 
obligation towards its employees and customers exists.  
Therefore, it is amenable to writ jurisdiction."
</p>
<p id="p_5">Ultimately the order passed by the learned single Judge is :
"....In the light of the above decisions of the Apex Court, 
I can very well find that the Federal Bank Ltd., is 
performing public duty and as such it comes under the 
definition of 'other authority' within the meaning of 
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_3">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India and as such the 
writ petition is maintainable before this Court."
</p>
<p id="p_6">Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment of the learned single Judge, the 
appellant preferred a writ appeal but  referring to a decision of this Court 
in <a href="/doc/63700409/" id="a_4">U.P.State Co-operative Land Development Bank Ltd. vs. Chandra 
Bhan Dubey &amp; Ors</a>. , the Division Bench, observed that in an identical 
fact situation it was held that writ application would be maintainable,  
minor distinctions on facts, here and there, would not make the aforesaid 
decision inapplicable to scheduled banks.  With such observations the 
appeal was dismissed providing that the learned single Judge shall decide 
writ petition on merits.  The Federal Bank Ltd. has preferred this appeal, 
against the aforesaid judgment of the High Court.
		Learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant, so as to 
indicate the structure of the appellant, submits that the Federal Bank Ltd. 
is a 'company' incorporated under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_5">Indian Companies Act</a>, 1913, now 
replaced by the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_6">Companies Act</a>, 1956. Its activities are regulated by the 
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_7">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949.  The entire shareholding 
of the company is held by private individuals and entities. The finances 
of the banks are raised by its own resources and efforts, and the profits of 
the bank are utilized by the bank for its own purposes.  It does not 
perform any sovereign function nor does it exercise any authority over a 
third person.  The nature of the activity of the bank is that of a 
commercial undertaking which receives deposits from the individuals and 
advances loans and performs other ancillary monetary transactions.  The 
management of the bank is in the hands of the Board of Directors.  There 
are 10 Directors, out of which 7 are selected by the General Body of the 
shareholders.  Two members are co-opted by the Board of Directors and 
one of them is nominated by the Reserve Bank  of India.  The Board of 
Directors exercise the powers of superintendence and control over the 
bank.  The bank is, therefore, merely a private limited company; it is 
neither a 'State' nor any 'authority' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_8">Article 12</a> of 
the Constitution nor it is amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court.  
It is also the case of the appellant bank that services of an employee or an 
officer of a private body, cannot be imposed or thrust upon it nor a relief 
of reinstatement can be granted.  In this connection,  the appellant has 
referred to the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition, which are as follows:
"i)	a writ of Certiorari or any other appropriate writ, 
order or direction quashing Exhibit P3 Enquiry 
Report and P6 and P7 orders of the disciplinary 
authority and the Board of Directors as illegal and 
unsustainable in law;
</p>
<p id="p_7">ii)	a writ of Mandamus or any other appropriate writ, 
order or direction commanding the respondents to 
reinstate the petitioner with all wages and 
increments in the salary applicable to him as if he 
had continued in service from the date of his 
suspension;
</p>
<p id="p_8">iii)	any other appropriate writ, order or direction as 
this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and necessary on 
the facts and in the circumstances of the case and 
allow this petition with all costs."
</p>
<p id="p_9">In the light of the prayer made for issue of a writ of certiorari  for 
quashing of inquiry report and the order of punishment and further for 
issue of a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ or direction for 
reinstatement of the petitioner with all wages and increments etc.  as if, 
he had been continued in service,  a plea in reply has been raised by the 
appellant that it being a private body incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_9">Companies 
Act</a>, it is not amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court.  It is in the 
above background that the learned Single Judge considered the matter 
and held that the Federal Bank Limited  is  performing public duty,        
as such it is covered under the expression of 'other authority', within the 
meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_10">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, hence the writ petition is 
maintainable  before the High Court. 
</p><p id="p_10">The question thus,  which falls for consideration is as to whether 
the appellant bank is a private body or  falls within the definition of the 
State or local  or other authorities under the control of the Government.  
A body or organization which is an instrumentality or agency of the State 
or a company owned and controlled  by the State are all included in the 
expression "the State".  If it is found that the petitioner falls within the 
later category,  there would be no  hurdle  in  holding  that such a body or 
organization would undoubtedly be amenable to the writ jurisdiction 
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_11">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.  On the other hand, if it is 
found that the appellant is a private body in that event it may have to be 
examined whether a writ petition would be maintainable or not and the 
extent to which such powers can be exercised.	
In support of their respective contentions   learned counsels 
placed reliance upon certain decisions of this Court as well as on some 
decisions of the High Court.  
</p><p id="p_11">On behalf of the appellant, a decision in the case of Pradeep 
Kumar Biswas Vs. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology &amp; Ors , 
decided by a 7 Judges Bench has been referred.  The majority judgment 
considered a catena of  decisions on the point and it has been observed in 
paragraph 25 of the judgment : "The tests propounded by Mathew, J. in 
Sukhdev Singh  were elaborated in Ramana  and were reformulated 
two years later by a Constitution Bench in Ajay Hasia .  What may have 
been technically characterized as obiter dicta in Sukhdev Singh (supra) 
and Ramana (supra) (since in both cases the "authority" in fact involved 
was a statutory corporation), formed the ratio decidendi of Ajay Hasia 
(supra)".  Thereafter the court has extracted  para 11, at page 737-38 of 
the case of Ajay Hasia (supra),  as follows : "The concept of 
instrumentality or agency of the Government is not limited to a 
corporation created by a statute but is equally applicable to a company or 
society and in a given case it would have to be decided, on a 
consideration of the relevant factors, whether the company or society is 
an instrumentality or agency of the Government so as to come within the 
meaning of the expression 'authority' in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_12">Article 12."</a>  It is then observed 
that Ramana's case (supra) noted with approval in Ajay Hasia (supra) 
and quoted the tests laid down in the case of Ajay Hasia (supra) at page 
737 in para 9.  It reads as follows :
</p><p id="p_12">"(1)	One thing is clear that if the entire share capital of 
the corporation is held by Government, it would 
go a long way towards indicating that the 
corporation is an instrumentality or agency of 
Government. (SCC p.507, para 14)

(2)	Where the financial assistance of the State is so 
much as to meet almost entire expenditure of the 
corporation, it would afford some indication of 
the corporation being impregnated with 
governmental character. (SCC p.508, para 15)

(3)	It may also be a relevant factor .. whether the 
corporation enjoys monopoly status which is 
State-conferred or State-protected (SCC p.508, 
para 15)

(4)	Existence of deep and pervasive State control 
may afford an indication that the corporation is a 
State agency or instrumentality. (SCC p.508, para 
</p><p id="p_13">15)

(5)	If the functions of the corporation are of public 
importance and closely related to governmental 
functions, it would be a relevant factor in 
classifying the corporation as an instrumentality 
or agency of Government. (SCC p.509, para 16)

(6)	'Specifically, if a department of Government is 
transferred to a corporation, it would be a strong 
factor supportive of this inference' of the 
corporation being an instrumentality or agency of 
Government. (SCC p.510, para 18)"
</p>

<p id="p_14">This Court has observed in paragraph 31 as follows :
"The tests to determine whether  a body falls 
within the definition of "State" in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_13">Article 12</a> laid 
down in Ramana (supra) with the Constitution 
Bench imprimatur in Ajay Hasia (supra) form the 
keystone of the subsequent jurisprudential 
superstructure judicially crafted on the subject 
which is apparent from a chronological 
consideration of the authorities cited."
</p>

<p id="p_15">After considering a number of decisions it has been observed in para 40 
of  Pradeep  Kumar Biswas (supra) as follows :
 "The picture that ultimately emerges is that the 
tests formulated in Ajay Hasia (supra) are not a 
rigid set of principles so that if a body falls within 
any one of them it must, ex hypothesi, be  
considered to be a State within the meaning of 
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_14">Article 12.</a>  The question in each case would be - 
whether in the light of the cumulative facts as 
established, the body is financially, functionally 
and administratively dominated by or under the 
control of the Government.  Such control must be 
particular to the body in question and must be 
pervasive.  If this is found then the body is a State 
within <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_15">Article 12.</a>  On the other hand, when the 
control is merely regulatory whether under statute 
or otherwise, it would not serve to make the body a 
State."
</p>
<p id="p_16">The appellant then refers to a decision in <a href="/doc/1664838/" id="a_16">Bank of Baroda Ltd. 
vs. Jeewan Lal Mehrotra</a> , which is a decision of  a three 
Judge Bench, wherein it has been laid down that a contract of 
service could not be enforced on a private employee.  Needless 
to say that the case is related to the services of an employee of a 
Scheduled bank.  Our attention has been particularly drawn to 
paragraph 3 of the judgment where it is observed : 
".....The law as settled by this court is that no 
declaration to enforce a contract of personal 
service will be normally granted.  The well 
recognized exceptions to this rule are (1) where a 
public servant has been dismissed from service in 
contravention of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_17">Article 311</a><a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_18">, (2)</a>where re-
instatement is sought of a dismissed worker under 
the industrial law by labour or industrial tribunals, 
(3) where a statutory body has acted in breach of a 
mandatory obligation imposed by statute...."  
</p>

<p id="p_17">		However, so far the above proposition is concerned, learned 
counsel for the respondent submitted that the point relates to the merits of 
the matter which is yet to be gone into by the learned Single Judge in 
case it is found that a writ petition is maintainable. 
U.P.State Co-operative Land Development Bank Ltd. 
(supra) has been relied upon by the Division Bench while passing the 
impugned order dismissing the appeal.  We may examine the position as 
involved in that  case in some  detail. It is registered as a Co-operative 
society under the provisions of the U.P.Co-operative Societies Act.  
While holding it to be an instrumentality of the State, the Court took note 
of the fact that though  registered as a co-operative society, it was 
constituted under the provisions of the U.P.Co-operative Land 
Development Bank Act, 1964.  The Managing Director and the Chief 
General Manager of the Bank are officials of the State, who are at the 
helms  of the affairs of the Bank.  The service rules for the employees 
and officers of the Bank were framed by the State Government in 
exercise of powers under Section 30 of the U.P.Co-operative Land 
Development Bank Act, 1964.  The rules are called the U.P.Co-operative 
Land Development Banks Rules, 1971, which lay down the conditions of 
services of the employees.  The Institutional Service Boards constituted 
under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_19">Section 122</a> of the Co-operative Societies Act has also framed 
service rules according to which dismissal of an employee can be ordered 
only after its approval by the Institutional Service Board.  The U.P.State 
Co-operative Land Development Bank Ltd. is the only bank constituted 
under the provisions of the U.P.Co-operative Land Development Bank 
Act and there cannot be any other State level Land Development Bank 
for the whole of the State. Apart from the fact that the Bank had 
exclusive jurisdiction over the whole of the State of Uttar Pradesh,  the 
other Land Development Banks could also be made members of the 
U.P.State Co-operative Land Development Bank, in any number, as the 
Registrar of the Co-operative Societies may deem it necessary. It is 
further found that the Registrar of the Co-operative Societies, U.P. is the 
trustee for the purpose of securing the fulfillment of the obligations of the 
State Land Development Bank to the holders of debentures issued by the 
Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors are entitled to issue 
debentures from time to time with the previous sanction of the State 
Government and the trustee, against the unconditional guarantee by the 
State Government for the repayment in full of the principal and  interest 
thereon, or on the security of mortgages, charges or hypothecations etc.  
The State Government constitutes a Guarantee Fund under <a href="/doc/1549225/" id="a_20">Section 9</a> of 
the Act for the purpose of meeting losses that might accrue on account of 
loans advanced by the Land Development Banks.  The Guarantee  Fund 
is maintained by the Finance Department of the State Government.  On 
the basis of the facts noted above, the Court took the view that the 
U.P.State Co-operative Land Development Bank Ltd., though registered 
as a Co-operative society, is an instrumentality of the State and its 
employees have a statutory protection under the statutory rules. 
		It is quite apparent that the decision in the case of U.P.State 
Co-operative Land Development Bank Ltd. (supra) would in no way 
be applicable to the case in hand. The participation and control of the 
State in the whole activity of the U.P.Land Development Bank Ltd. is all 
pervasive.  Its officers head the institution.  U.P.Land Development Bank 
is constituted as the only State level Bank in the State.  Under the 
statutory provision there cannot be any other Land Development Bank  at 
the State level.  The government guarantees repayment in the event of 
losses suffered by the Bank and with the approval of the State, the Bank 
may also issue debentures.  To cap it all the service conditions of the 
employees are governed by the statutory rules.  It is submitted by the 
appellant that this case will have no application to the present case and 
the same has been wrongly followed and relied upon by the High Court 
to dismiss the appeal.
</p><p id="p_18">		Shri Rajinder Sachar, learned senior counsel appearing for 
the respondent, refers to a Constitution Bench decision in All India Bank 
Employees'  Association Vs.  National  Industrial Tribunal &amp; Ors. .  
</p>
<p id="p_19">Our attention has been particularly drawn to the observations made at 
page 299 of the report wherein it is observed as follows:-
"....If it was not the Reserve Bank of India, the 
only other authority that could be entrusted with 
the function would be the Finance Ministry of the 
Government of India and that department would 
necessarily be guided by the Reserve Bank having 
regard to the intimate knowledge which the 
Reserve Bank has of the banking structure of the 
country as a whole and of the affairs of each bank 
in particular......".
</p>
<p id="p_20">It has been referred to indicate that the control of the Reserve Bank of 
India over all the banks would be as if the control is in place of  Finance 
Ministry, Government of India.
</p><p id="p_21">		A reference has then been made to Air India Statutory 
Corporation &amp; Ors. Vs. United Labour Union &amp; Ors. ,  a decision of 
a three Judge Bench.  It has been held that the industry carried on by Air 
India under authority of central government would involve public law 
element even though its activity may be commercial in nature.  It was 
held that the Air India was being run by the Airport Authority of India of 
the Central Government and there was element of deep and pervasive 
governmental control.  Initially it was a statutory authority under the 
<a href="/doc/988937/" id="a_21">International Airports Authority of India Act</a>, 1971.  Later it was 
amalgamated with National Airports Authority and thereafter it is 
constituted as a Company under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_22">Companies Act</a>.  In that context, it 
has been held,  if the company is run wholly or partially by the share 
capital floated from public exchequer, it gives indication of its control by 
the appropriate government. On consideration of a number of decisions 
on the point, the Court found the following principles which may be 
considered, for coming to a conclusion whether any public element is 
involved or not, the paragraph 26 of the decision,  reads as under : 
"(1)	The  constitution of the corporation or 
instrumentality or agency or corporation 
aggregate or corporation sole is not of sole 
material relevance to decide whether it is by 
or under the control of the appropriate 
Government under the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_22">(2)	If it is a statutory corporation, it is an 
instrumentality or agency of the State.  If it 
is a company owned wholly or partially by a 
share capital, floated from public exchequer, 
it gives indicia that it is controlled by or 
under the authority of the Appropriate 
Government. 
</p>
<p id="p_23">(3)	In commercial activities carried on by a 
corporation established by or under the 
control of the appropriate government 
having protection under Articles 14 and 
19(2), it is an instrumentality or agency of 
the State.
</p>
<p id="p_24">(4)	The State is a service corporation.  It acts 
through its instrumentalities, agencies or 
persons - natural or juridical.
</p>
<p id="p_25">(5)	The governing power, wherever located, 
must be subject to the fundamental 
constitutional limitations and abide by the 
principles laid in the Directive Principles.
</p>
<p id="p_26">(6)	The framework of service regulations made 
in the appropriate rules or regulations should 
be consistent with and subject to the same 
public law, principles and limitations.
</p>
<p id="p_27">(7)	Though the instrumentality, agency or 
person conducts commercial activities 
according to business principles and are 
separately accountable under their 
appropriate bye-laws or Memorandum of 
Association, they become the arm of the 
Government.
</p>
<p id="p_28">(8)	The existence of deep and pervasive State 
control depends upon the facts and 
circumstances in a given situation and in the 
altered situation it is not the sole criterion to 
decide whether the agency or 
instrumentality or persons is by or under the 
control of the appropriate Government.
</p>
<p id="p_29">(9)	Functions of an instrumentality, agency or 
person are of public importance following 
public interest element.
</p>
<p id="p_30">(10)	The instrumentality, agency or person must 
have an element of authority or ability to 
effect the relations with its employees or 
public by virtue of power vested in it by law, 
Memorandum of Association or bye-laws or 
Articles of Association.
</p>
<p id="p_31">(11)	The instrumentality, agency or person 
renders an element of public service and is 
accountable to health and strength of the 
workers, men and women, adequate means 
of livelihood, the security for payment of 
living wages, reasonable conditions of work, 
decent standard of life and opportunity to 
enjoy full leisure and social and cultural 
activities to the workmen.
</p>
<p id="p_32">(12)	Every action of the public authority, agency 
or instrumentality or the person acting in 
public interest or any act that gives rise to 
public element should be guided by public 
interest in exercise of public power or action 
hedged with  public  element and is open to 
challenge.  It must meet the test of 
reasonableness, fairness and justness.
</p>
<p id="p_33">(13)	If the exercise of the power is arbitrary, 
unjust and unfair, the public authority, 
instrumentality, agency or the person acting 
in public interest, though in the field of 
private law, is not free to prescribe any 
unconstitutional conditions or limitations in 
their actions."
</p>
<p id="p_34">One of the important factors to be considered is, if it is a statutory 
corporation, an instrumentality or agency of the State or a company 
owned wholly or partially by a share capital floated from public 
exchequer, it gives indicia that it is controlled by and under the authority 
of the Appropriate Government.  We find that it is this factor which 
brings in public element.  Paragraph 61 of the judgment reads:-
"The legal right of an individual may be founded 
upon a contract or a statute or an instrument 
having the force of law.  For a public law remedy 
enforceable under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_23">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, 
the action of the authority needs to fall in the realm 
of public law - be it a legislative act of the State, 
an executive act of the State or an instrumentality 
or a person or authority imbued with public law 
element. The question requires to be determined in 
each case.  However, it may not be possible to 
generalise the nature of the action which would 
come either under public law remedy or private 
law field nor is it desirable to give exhaustive list 
of such actions.......The distinction between 
public law and private law remedy has now 
become thin and practically obliterated."
</p>
<p id="p_35">Shri Sachar then referred to a decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_24">Andi 
Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti 
Mahotsav Smarak Trust &amp; Ors. Vs. V.R.Rudani &amp; Ors</a>.  case.  It has 
been held in this case that the college in question which was managed by 
a trust registered under the Bombay Trusts Act was amenable to writ 
jurisdiction and a direction could be issued to the institution to make the 
payment of arrears of salary and other benefits to the teacher. It is further 
submitted that if a private body discharges a public duty it would be 
amenable to the writ jurisdiction.  Paragraph 17 of the judgment has been 
particularly referred to, which reads as under :
"There, however, the prerogative writ of 
mandamus is confined only to public authorities to 
compel performance of public duty. The 'public 
authority' for them mean every body which is 
created by statute - and whose powers and duties 
are defined by statute. So government departments, 
local authorities, police authorities, and statutory 
undertakings and corporations, are all 'public 
authorities'.  But there is no such limitation for our 
High Courts to issue the writ 'in the nature of 
mandamus'.  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_25">Article 226</a> confers wide powers on 
the High Courts to issue writs in the nature of 
prerogative writs.  This is a striking departure from 
the English Law. Under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_26">Article 226</a>, writs can be 
issued to "any person or authority".  It can be 
issued "for the enforcement of any of the 
fundamental rights and for any other purpose".
</p>
<p id="p_36">Shri Sachar has also stressed upon the observation made in the later part 
of para 19  and para 20 where it has been observed: 
".....Any attempt to equate the scope of the power 
of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_27">Article 226</a> of the 
Constitution with that of the English courts to issue 
prerogative writs is to introduce the unnecessary 
procedural restrictions grown over the years in a 
comparatively small country like England with a 
unitary form of government into a vast country like 
India functioning under a federal structure....."
</p>
<p id="p_37">	 Para 20       
"....The words "any person or authority" used in 
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_28">Article 226</a> are, therefore, not to be confined only 
to statutory authorities and instrumentalities of the 
State. They may cover any other person or body 
performing public duty. ......What is relevant is 
the nature of the duty imposed on the body. The 
duty must be judged in the light of positive 
obligation owed by the person or authority to the 
affected party....."
</p> 
 
<p id="p_38">While making his submissions in reply,  the appellant 
referred to paragraph 15  of the above judgment wherein it has been 
observed that if the rights are purely of a private character, no mandamus 
can be issued.  It is further observed that if the management of the 
college is purely a private body with no public duty, mandamus would 
not lie. But it has been held that the college run by a private trust was 
affiliated to the university to which public  money is paid as government 
aid.  It is then observed :
</p><p id="p_39">"...Public money paid as government aid plays a 
major role in the control, maintenance and working 
of educational institutions.  The aided institutions 
like government institutions discharge public 
function by way of imparting education to 
students.  They are subject to the rules and 
regulations of the affiliating University.  Their 
activities are closely supervised by the University 
authorities.  Employment in such institutions, 
therefore, is not devoid of any public character.  So 
are the service conditions of the academic staff. .... 
The service conditions of the academic staff are, 
therefore, not purely of a private character.  It has 
super-added protection by University decisions 
creating a legal right-duty relationship between the 
staff and the management.  When there is 
existence of this relationship, mandamus cannot be 
refused to the aggrieved party."
</p>
<p id="p_40">On this basis, it is submitted in reply that those features by reason of 
which it has been held that a writ of mandamus would lie against a 
private management, are not present in the case in hand.  A reference   to 
para 12 of the Andi Mukta's case  (supra) has been made,   where it has 
been held that no writ would issue where  dismissal was not in violation 
of any statutory provision.  No reinstatement could be ordered.  
Shri Sachar then refers to Unni Krishnan, J.P. &amp; Ors. Vs. 
State of Andhra Pradesh &amp; Ors.   a Constitution Bench judgment.  In 
reference to para 79 it is submitted that educational institutions discharge 
public duties irrespective of the fact they receive aid or not.  The absence 
of aid does not detract from the public nature of the duty.  The 
submission, therefore, is that even though a body or institution may be a 
private body but if the duty that it discharges  is that of a public nature, a 
writ would lie.
</p><p id="p_41">In this connection <a href="/doc/1513693/" id="a_29">Life Insurance Corporation of India &amp; 
Anr. vs. Consumer Education &amp; Research Centre &amp; Ors</a> . also has 
been referred to, which in turn refers to Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi 
Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh ,     holding   that    arbitrariness,   even    in 
contractual obligation of public character is violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_30">Article 14</a> of the 
Constitution.   the Court   held   that rates of premium must be reasonable 
and acceptable.  It cannot   be   unjust   and   excessive.  Thus  the  
touchstone  of  test  is the reasonableness and non-arbitrariness of the 
action even in the contractual matters of the State or its agencies and 
instrumentalities.
</p><p id="p_42">		The appellant in reply also referred to The Praga Tools 
Corporation Vs. Shri C.A.Imanual &amp; Ors. , where it was held that a 
company registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_31">Companies     Act</a>   is    neither   statutory  
nor    any public duty is imposed on it by any statute in respect of which 
enforcement would be sought by means of a mandamus.  Mandamus lies 
to secure the purpose of a public or statutory duty.  No mandamus or 
order of reinstatement of an office which is essentially of a private 
character can be issued. A mandamus can be issued to compel the official 
of a society to carry out the terms of the statute under or by which the 
society is constituted or governed and also to companies or corporations 
to carry out duties placed on them by the statutes authorizing their 
undertakings.
</p>
<p id="p_43">		Executive Committee of Vaish Degree College, Shamli &amp; 
Ors. Vs. Lakshmi Narain &amp; Ors. , was also referred to on the 
proposition that contract of personal service cannot ordinarily be 
enforced.
</p><p id="p_44">		From the decisions referred to above, the position that 
emerges is that  a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_32">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of 
India may be maintainable against (i) the State (Govt); (ii) Authority; (iii) 
a statutory body; (iv) an instrumentality or agency of the State; ( v) a 
company which is financed and owned by the State; (vi) a private body  
run  substantially on State funding; (vii) a private body discharging 
public duty or positive obligation of public nature (viii) a person or a 
body under liability to discharge any function  under any Statute,  to 
compel it to perform such a statutory function.
	Learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent has drawn our 
attention to the various provisions of the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_33">Reserve Bank of India Act</a>, 
1934 (for short 'the RBI Act'), the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_34">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1941 and the 
Industries (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_35">Regulation) Act</a>, 1951 so as to emphasise 
that there is deep and all pervasive statutory control and the control of the 
Central Government over the Scheduled Banks.  It is submitted that these 
banks discharge functions of public nature and owe the statutory 
responsibilities, hence there is an element of public law, involved in the 
activities of the Bank.  <a href="/doc/195670/" id="a_36">Section 22</a> of the Banking Regulation Act 
provides for Licensing of banking companies.  No company can carry on 
banking business in India unless it holds a licence issued by the Reserve

down under sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/601001/" id="a_37">Section 22</a> as to whether the company

company:
</p>
<p id="p_83">xxx			xxxx"
</p>
<p id="p_84"><a href="/doc/258343/" id="a_53">Section 36AE</a> has also been referred to which empowers the Central 
Government to acquire undertakings of banking companies in the 
interests of the depositors, the banking policy or for the better provision 
of credit generally or of credit to any particular section of the  community 
or in any particular area.  Lastly, our attention has been drawn to 
provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_54">Section 45</a> of the Banking Regulation Act which 
empowers the Reserve Bank to apply to Central Government for 
suspension of business by a banking company and to prepare scheme of 
reconstitution of amalgamation of a banking company.
		In view of the aforesaid provisions it is submitted that the 
control of the Reserve Bank of India and the Central Government is all 
pervasive over the banking companies, they can cause an inspection to be 
made, can make scrutiny of the working and accounts of the banking 
company, can remove the Chairman or appoint additional directors,  the 
functioning of the banking company can also be suspended, the 
undertaking can also be acquired.  It is further submitted that the Reserve 
Bank of India has been constituted to regulate issue of bank notes and for 
keeping reserves with a view to secure and maintain monetary stability in 
the country.  It is with that end in view that powers have been vested in 
the Reserve Bank of India to keep proper check on the working and 
functioning of the banking companies as also in the interest of the 
depositors and the own interest of the banking company. Such a nature of 
control indicates that the Banking Companies discharge functions of 
public nature. 
</p><p id="p_85">		As against the submission made on behalf of the respondent 
regarding control of the Reserve Bank of India over the banking 
companies, the appellant submits that such measures as indicated by 
reference to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_55">Banking Regulation Act</a> are only 
regulatory in nature.  Such regulatory control is also exercised over other 
companies as well, registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_56">Companies Act</a>, 1956.  In this 
connection, a reference has been made to <a href="/doc/1329181/" id="a_57">Section 233A</a> of the Companies 
Act which empowers the Central Government to direct special audit of 
the companies in certain eventualities.  For example as indicated in sub-
clauses (a) to (c) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_58">Section 233A</a>, which reads as 
under :
</p><p id="p_86">"233A. (1) Where the Central Government is of 
the opinion -
</p>
<p id="p_87">(a)	that the affairs of any company are not 
being managed in accordance with sound 
business principles of prudent 
commercial practices; or

</p><p id="p_88">(b)	that any company is being managed in a 
manner likely to cause serious injury or 
damage to the interests of the trade, 
industry or business to which it pertains; 
</p><p id="p_89">or

</p><p id="p_90">(c)	that the financial position of any 
company is such as to endanger its 
solvency;........."
</p>
<p id="p_91">The report of the special audit is to be submitted to the Central 
Government by the Chartered Accountants deputed for special audit. The 
special auditor, in the audit report  shall include all the matters required 
to be included in an auditor's report under <a href="/doc/1183967/" id="a_59">Section 227</a> of the Companies 
Act and the matters as the Central Government may, also direct to 
include. The Central Government is also authorized to direct any 
particular person to furnish such information or additional information to 
the auditor and failure to do so shall render such person liable to be 
punished by imposition of fine.  The Central Government, on 
consideration of the report is empowered to take such action as provided 
under the Act or any other law for the time being in force. <a href="/doc/1613691/" id="a_60">Section 235</a> of 
the Companies Act empowers the Central Government to appoint one or 
more competent persons as inspectors to investigate the affairs of any 
company on the application of the shareholders and submit the report to 
the Central Government.  Similar power for investigation is also vested 
under <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_61">Section 237</a> of the Act.  The company by a special resolution or 
court by an order can declare that affairs of the company ought to be 
investigated by an inspector appointed by the Central Government, where 
the business of the company is being conducted with intent to defraud its 
creditors, members or any other persons or otherwise for fraudulent or 
unlawful purpose.  Then a reference has been made to <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_62">Section 250</a> of the 
Companies Act which empowers the Central Government to impose 
restriction upon the transfer of shares and debentures of the company. 
Any transfer of shares  made during the period of the restriction, would 
be void under clause (a) of sub-section (2).  Such actions are permissible 
to be taken in the public interest. <a href="/doc/681574/" id="a_63">Section 255</a> falls in the Chapter II  
pertaining to directors and constitution of Board of Directors which 
mandates for retirement of directors in given proportion by rotation.  
<a href="/doc/617856/" id="a_64">Section 267</a> places restrictions on appointment of Managing Directors.  
Such persons who are undischarged insolvents or at any time have been 
adjudged so or having been convicted by a Court of an offence involving 
moral turpitude.  So far the financial aspect is concerned, the Central 
Government has powers  in that regard as well and in that connection our 
attention has been drawn to <a href="/doc/1922097/" id="a_65">Section 58-A</a>.  Sub-sections (1) and (2) of 
<a href="/doc/1922097/" id="a_66">Section 58-A</a> read as under :
</p><p id="p_92">"58 A. (1) The Central Government may, in 
consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, 
prescribe the limits up to which, the manner in 
which and the conditions subject to which deposits 
may be invited or accepted by a company  either 
from the public or from its members.
</p>
<p id="p_93">(2) 	No company shall invite, or allow any other 
person to invite or cause to be invited on its behalf, 
any deposit unless -

</p><p id="p_95">(b)	an advertisement, including therein a statement 
showing the financial position of the company, 
has been issued by the company in such form 
and in such manner as may be prescribed....."
</p>

<p id="p_96">Under Section 388 B the Central Government is empowered to state a 
case and refer to the High Court where in certain circumstances it 
considers that any person concerned in conduct and the management of 
the affairs of the company is not fit to hold the office of Director or any 
other office, to make an inquiry into the case and record its decisions in 
that regard. On the basis of the report of the High Court the Central 
Government has power to remove such a person as  the Director or as the 
case may be. 
</p><p id="p_97">A reference has also been made to certain provisions of 
Industries (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_67">Regulation) Act</a>, 1951.  <a href="/doc/1173330/" id="a_68">Section 15</a> 
empowers the Central Government to cause investigation to be made into 
the affairs of the industrial undertaking in certain eventualities.  The same 
reads as under :
</p><p id="p_98">"15. Power to cause investigation to be made 
into scheduled industries or industrial

</p>
<p id="p_106"><a href="/doc/1143598/" id="a_69">Section 15-A</a> also empowers the Central Government to investigate into 
the possibility of running or restarting the industrial undertaking which is 
being wound up by or under the supervision of the High Court and to 
make an application in that regard to the High Court.  Chapter III-A 
provides for direct management or control of industrial undertakings by 
Central Government in certain cases.  Relevant part of <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_70">Section 18-A</a>, 
which falls under Chapter III-A,  reads as under :
"18-A. Power of Central Government to assume

</p>
<p id="p_110"><a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_74">Section 18-AA</a> empowers the Central Government to take over the 
industrial undertaking  without investigation in the given circumstances.
		In view of the provisions indicated above under the 
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_75">Companies Act</a> and the Industrial (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_76">Regulation) Act</a>, it 
is submitted that the nature and the control over the companies is more or 
less of the same degree and nature as the control exercised over the 
banking companies under the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_77">Banking Regulation Act</a>.  There is control 
and supervision over the functioning and working and the conduct of 
business of the companies. A watchful eye is kept over the interest of the 
share holders, the interest of the company itself as well as over the 
production of company, even managing director can be removed by the 
Central Government.  It has also the powers, as indicated above, to take 
over the management of a company.  Such powers are drastic; 
nonetheless they remain regulatory in nature in the interest of the 
industry, the company, the shareholders and in the general interest since 
production of goods of importance is most essential for proper economic 
growth and stability of the country. 
</p><p id="p_111">		A company registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_78">Companies Act</a> for the 
purposes of carrying on any trade or business is a private enterprise to 
earn livelihood and to make profits out of such activities.  Banking is also 
a kind of profession and a commercial activity, the primary motive 
behind it can well be said to earn returns and  profits.  Since time 
immemorial, such activities have been carried on by individuals 
generally. It is a private affair of the company though case of nationalized 
banks stands on a different footing.  There may, well be companies, in 
which majority of the share capital may be contributed out of the State 
funds and in that view of the matter there may be more participation or 
dominant participation of the State in managing the affairs of the 
company.  But in the present case we are concerned with a banking 
company which has its own resources to raise its funds without any 
contribution or shareholding by the State. It has its own Board of 
Directors elected by its shareholders.   It works like any other private 
company in the banking business having no monopoly status at all.Any 
company carrying on  banking business with a capital of five lacs will 
become a scheduled bank. All the same, banking activity as a whole 
carried on by various banks undoubtedly has an impact and effect on the 
economy of the country in general.  Money of the shareholders and the 
depositors is with such companies, carrying on banking activity.  The 
banks finance the borrowers on any given rate of interest at a particular 
time.  They advance loans as against securities.  Therefore, it is obviously 
necessary to have regulatory check over such activities in the interest of 
the company itself, the shareholders, the depositors as well as to maintain 
the proper financial equilibrium of the national economy.    The Banking 
companies have not been set up for the purposes of building economy of 
the State on the other hand such private companies have been voluntarily 
established for their own purposes and interest but their activities are kept 
under check so that their activities may not go wayward and harm the 
economy in general. A private banking company with all  freedom that it 
has, has to act in a manner that it may not be in conflict with or against 
the fiscal policies of the State and  for such purposes,  guidelines are 
provided by the Reserve Bank so that a proper fiscal discipline, to 
conduct its affairs in carrying on its business, is maintained.  So as to 
ensure adherence to such fiscal discipline, if need be, at times even the 
management  of the company can be taken over.  Nonetheless, as 
observed earlier, these are all regulatory measures to keep a check and 
provide guideline and not a participatory dominance or control over the 
affairs of the company. For other companies in general carrying on other 
business activities may be manufacturing, other industries or any 
business, such checks are provided under the provisions of the 
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_79">Companies Act</a>, as indicated earlier.  There also, the main consideration 
is that the company itself may not sink because of its own 
mismanagement or the interest of the shareholders or people generally  
may not be jeopardized for that reason.  Besides taking care of such 
interest as indicated above, there is no other interest of the State, to 
control the affairs and management of the  private companies.  The care 
is taken in regard to the industries covered under the Industries 
(Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_80">Regulation) Act</a>, 1951 that their  production which is 
important for  the economy may not go down yet the business activity is 
carried on by such companies or corporations which only remains a 
private activity of the entrepreneurs/companies. 
Such private companies would normally not be amenable to 
the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_81">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.  But in certain 
circumstances a writ may issue to such private bodies or persons as there 
may be statutes which need to be complied with by all concerned 
including the private companies.  For example, there are certain 
legislations like the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_82">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_83">Minimum Wages Act</a>, 
the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_84">Factories Act</a> or for maintaining proper environment say Air 
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_85">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 or Water (Prevention 
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_86">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 etc. or statutes  of the like nature 
which fasten certain duties and responsibilities statutorily upon such 
private bodies which they are bound to comply with.  If they violate such 
a statutory provision a writ would certainly be issued for compliance of 
those provisions. For instance, if a private employer dispense with the 
service of its employee in violation of the provisions contained under the 
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_87">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in innumerable cases the High Court interfered 
and have issued the writ to the private bodies and the companies in that 
regard.  But the difficulty in issuing a writ may arise where there may not 
be any non-compliance or violation of any statutory provision by the 
private body.  In that event a writ may not be issued at all.  Other 
remedies, as may be available, may have to be resorted to. 
The six factors which have been enumerated in the case of Ajay 
Hasia (supra) and approved in the later decisions in the case of Ramana 
(supra) and the seven Judges Bench in the case of Pradeep Kumar 
Biswas (supra) may be applied to the facts of the present case and see as 
to those tests apply to the appellant bank or not.  As indicated earlier, 
share capital of the appellant bank is not held at all by the government 
nor any financial assistance is provided by the State, nothing to say  
which may meet almost the entire expenditure of the company.  The third 
factor is also not answered since the appellant bank does not enjoy any 
monopoly status nor it can be said to be an institution having State 
protection. So far control over the affairs of the appellant bank is 
concerned, they are managed by the Board of Directors elected by its 
shareholders. No governmental agency or officer is connected with the 
affairs of the appellant bank nor anyone of them is a member of the 
Board of Directors.  In the normal functioning of the private banking 
company there is no participation or interference of the State or its 
authorities. The statutes have been framed regulating the financial and 
commercial activities so that fiscal equilibrium may be kept maintained  
and not get disturbed by the mal-functioning of such companies or 
institutions involved in the business of banking. These are regulatory 
measures for the purposes of maintaining the healthy economic 
atmosphere in the country. Such regulatory measures are provided for 
other companies also as well as industries manufacturing goods of 
importance.   Otherwise these are purely private commercial activities. It 
deserves to be noted that it hardly makes any difference that such 
supervisory vigilance is kept by the Reserve Bank of India under a 
Statute or the Central Government.  Even if it was with the Central 
Government in place of the Reserve Bank of India it would not have  
made any difference, therefore, the argument based on the decision of All 
India Bank Employees' Association (supra)  does not advance the case 
of the respondent. It is only in case of mal-functioning of the company 
that occasion to exercise such  powers arises to protect the interest of the 
depositors, shareholders or the company itself or to help the company to 
be out of the woods.  In the times of normal functioning such occasions 
do not arise except for routine inspections etc.  with a view to see that 
things are moved  smoothly in keeping with fiscal policies in general.  
There are a number of such companies carrying on the 
profession of banking.  There is nothing which can be said to be close to 
the governmental functions.  It is an old profession in one form or the 
other carried on by individuals or by a group of them.  Losses incurred in 
the business are theirs as well as the profits.  Any business or commercial 
activity, may be banking, manufacturing units or related to any other kind 
of business generating resources, employment, production and resulting 
in circulation of money are no doubt, are such which do have impact on 
the economy of the country in general.  But such activities cannot be 
classified one falling in the category of discharging duties, functions of 
public nature. Thus the case does not fall in the fifth category of cases 
enumerated in the case of Ajay Hasia (supra).  Again we find that the 
activity which is carried on by the appellant is not one which may have 
been earlier carried on by the government and transferred to the appellant 
company.  For the sake of argument even if it may be assumed that one 
or the other test as provided in the case of Ajay Hasia (supra) may be 
attracted that by itself would not be sufficient to hold that it is an agency 
of the State or a company carrying on the functions of public nature.  In 
this connection, observations made in the case of Pradeep Kumar 
Biswas (supra) quoted earlier would also be relevant.
We may now consider the two decisions i.e. Andi Mukta 
(supra) and the U.P. State Co-operative Land Development Bank 
Ltd.(supra)upon which much reliance has been placed on behalf of the 
respondents to show that a writ would lie against  the appellant company.  
So far the decision in the case of U.P. State Co-operative Land 
Development Bank Ltd.(supra) is concerned, it stands entirely on a 
different footing and we have elaborately discussed it earlier. 
The other case which has been heavily relied upon is Andi 
Mukta (supra).  It is no doubt held that a Mandamus can be issued to any 
person or authority performing public duty, owing positive obligation to 
the affected party.  The writ petition was held to be maintainable since 
the teacher whose services were terminated by the institution was 
affiliated to the university and was governed by the Ordinances, casting 
certain obligations which it owed to that petitioner. But it is not the case 
here.  Our attention has been drawn by the learned counsel for the 
appellant to paragraphs 12, 13 and 21 of the decision (Andi Mukta) to 
indicate that even according to this case no writ would lie against the 
private body except where it has some obligation to discharge which is  
statutory or of public character.  
</p><p id="p_112">Merely because the Reserve Bank of India lays the banking 
policy in the interest of the banking system or in the interest of monetary 
stability or sound economic growth having due regard to the interests of 
the depositors etc. as provided under <a href="/doc/216565/" id="a_88">Section 5(c)(a)</a> of the Banking 
Regulation Act does not mean that the private companies carrying on the 
business of or commercial activity of banking, discharge any public 
function or public duty. These are all regulatory measures applicable to 
those carrying on commercial activity in banking and these companies 
are to act according to these provisions failing which certain 
consequences follow as indicated in the Act itself. Provision regarding 
acquisition of a banking company by the Government, it may be pointed 
out that any private property can be acquired by the Government in 
public interest.  It is now judicially accepted norm that private interest 
has to give way to the public interest.  If a private property is acquired in 
public interest it does not mean that the party whose property is acquired 
is performing or discharging any function or duty of public character 
though it would be so for acquiring authority. 
 For the discussion held above, in our view, a private 
company carrying on banking business as a scheduled bank,  cannot be 
termed as an institution or company carrying on any statutory or public 
duty.  A private  body or a person may be amenable to writ jurisdiction 
only where it may become necessary to compel such body or association 
to enforce any statutory obligations or such obligations of public nature 
casting  positive obligation upon it.  We don't find such conditions are 
fulfilled in respect of a private company carrying on a commercial 
activity of banking.  Merely regulatory provisions to ensure such activity 
carried on by private bodies work within a discipline, do not confer any 
such status upon the company nor puts any such obligation upon it which 
may be enforced through issue of a writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_89">Article 226</a> of the 
Constitution.  Present is a case  of disciplinary action being taken against 
its employee by the appellant Bank.  Respondent's service with the bank 
stands terminated.  The action of the Bank was challenged by the 
respondent by filing a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_90">Article 226</a> of the Constitution 
of India.  The respondent is not trying to enforce any statutory duty on 
the part of the Bank.  That being the position, the appeal deserves to be 
allowed.  
</p><p id="p_113">In the result, the appeal is allowed and the judgment and 
order passed by the High Court is set aside and the writ petition is held to 
be not maintainable.  There will, however, be no order as to costs.
