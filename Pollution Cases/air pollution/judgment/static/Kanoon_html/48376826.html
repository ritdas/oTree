<p id="p_1">           The above writ petitions are filed with respect to the

same subject matter; being the unauthorised constructions

allegedly made by the first petitioner in W.P(C) No. 36380/2015, of

two apartment complexes. The buildings are named KBN

Apartments and KGN Apartments situated respectively in 33= and

14= cents. Petitioners in WP(C) Nos.3851/2016 and 34907/2015 are

said to be persons occupying/owning apartments in KBN

Apartments. The petitioner in W.P(C) No.14300/2013 is a

neighbouring resident of KGN Apartments who is concerned with

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                : 2 :</span>


the pollution caused by the residents for reason of the septic tank

and waste water pit being not properly maintained. All the other

writ petitions are with respect to the KGN Apartments and the

petitioners are said to be owners/occupiers. The owners/occupiers

of the apartments challenge the cancellation of numbering of the

apartments. The prayer in W.P(C) No.33380/2015 is with respect to

the ownership     certificate being issued in favour of the six

petitioners therein.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            2. The learned counsel appearing for the Panchayath

would at the outset submit that nothing is produced to establish

the ownership of the various apartments in the writ petition except

in W.P(C) No.3515/2016 and 36861/2015. But it is not an ownership

dispute that comes up for adjudication here and hence there need

be no enquiry on that aspect.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            3. Looking first at the KGN apartment, it is a four

storied building (1+3) having 38 flats constructed in a land having

extent of 33= cents. There are said to be 38 apartments in the said

building.    The issue has its genesis in W.P(C) No.14300/2013

wherein the petitioner, a neighboring resident approached this

Court with a prayer to consider the various representations made

by him before a host of authorities. The petitioner also prayed for

an enquiry under the provisions of Water(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 since the seepage from the septic tank and

the waste water pit in the apartment complex is alleged to have

contaminated his well. The petitioner also relied on the chemical

analysis report, he obtained from the Analytical Laboratory       ,

indicating gross contamination of well water; making it impossible

to be used as potable water.     While the said writ petition was

pending, presumably on the complaint raised therein, the

Vigilance wing of the Town Planning Department took up the

matter and inspected both the buildings. The vigilance report is

produced at Ext.P.17 in WP(C) No.36380/2015.

</p><p id="p_5">           4. The vigilance report found certain violations with

respect to the construction carried out, of both the buildings; the

KBN and KGN Apartments. It was recommended that action be

taken against the officials of the Panchayath. It was also found

that the well water of the nearby residents were contaminated due

to seepage of waste water from the adjacent property; ie; both the

apartment complexes.       Based on this, the Government issued

Ext.P18 order directing the Panchayath to cancel the numbering

of the various apartments in both the buildings. The Panchayath

had issued notice based on the Government directions, threatening

to cancel the numbers, upon which, the owners/occupiers

approached this Court and an interim stay of status quo has been

granted. Based on that the owners/occupiers are continuing in

both the apartment compleesx.
</p>
<p id="p_6">           5. The learned Counsel for the petitioners/occupiers

also contend that remedial measures were carried out and as of

WPC.No.36380/2015&amp; con.cases
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                : 5 :</span>


now, there is no pollution either from the septic tank or from the

waster water pit in the apartment complexes. The learned Counsel

also submits that the petitioners are willing for any inspection by

the Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            6. As to the construction being unauthorised, the

contention of the petitioners/occupiers of various apartments in

KGN Apartments, is that the construction itself was completed in

the year 2007 with a No Objection Certificate obtained in the year

2004. There was no requirement for a building permit since the

Kerala Municipality Building Rules, 1999 was not applicable to the

Panchayaths and the Kerala Panchayath Building Rules           was

brought into force only in the year 2011. However, the counter

affidavit of the respondent Panchayath indicates that there was a

permit applied for with respect to KGN Apartments and granted

on 18.12.2007. It is contended that earlier, the NOC issued was for

the ground floor and later three floors were constructed on the

WPC.No.36380/2015&amp; con.cases
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                : 6 :</span>


basis of subsequent permit issued; at which point the Kerala

Municipality Building Rules, 1999 were made applicable to the

Panchayaths. As of now, the Panchayath has issued notices to all

the owners/occupiers of both the buildings on the directions issued

by the Government. The owners/occupiers rightly contend that

they filed no objection        before the Panchayath since the

Panchayath could do nothing on the objections for reason of the

directions issued by the Government.     The occupants are still

continuing in the apartments on the basis of the status quo order

issued and the Panchayath has also not further proceeded in the

matter.
</p>
<p id="p_8">           7. With respect to the KBN Apartments, admittedly,

the same was constructed after the year 2011 when the Kerala

Municipality Building Rules, 1999 was in operation. KBN

Apartments was constructed in a land having extent of 14=cents

with 3 floors (1+2) and 17 apartments. The occupiers/owners of the

said apartment complex are also aggrieved by the cancellation of

the numbers issued to the respective apartments, on the very same

allegations.
</p>
<p id="p_9">            8. As of now, the allegation against both the apartment

complexes are violation of building Rules, as also pollution caused

from the septic tank and waster water pit. The Government has

also filed a counter affidavit contending that if at all there are

violations the petitioners could approach the Government for

regularisation through the Panchayath. If the petitioners have to

approach the Government        for regularisation, necessarily the

petitioners should be issued with notice and an inspection should

be carried out in their presence as to the violation of building

rules, which has to be verified with reference to the Building

Permit issued by the Panchayath and the plan submitted. Though

the learned Counsel for the owners/occupiers of KBN apartment

has a contention that regularisation fee of Rs. 2,26,000/- has been

remitted by them, as is evident from Ext.P12 in WPC

No.34907/2015, there is no order produced to substantiate on what

account the remittance was made. The regularisation application

also has to be made to the Government, routed through the

Panchayath; which admittedly has not been done as of now

</p><p id="p_10">            9. Looking at the totality of the circumstance, it is

proper that the Panchayath through their authorised officers/

engineers inspect the premises and verify as to the complaint of

unauthorised construction with the permit issued from the

Panchayath, in accordance with the Building Rules applicable. The

Panchayath shall issue notice to the occupants/owners of the

building of the respective apartments in the two buildings and

shall inspect the premises within one month from the date of

receipt of a certified copy of this judgment and shall issue specific

communication showing the violation of the two buildings by

separate orders.     The owners/occupiers    would be entitled to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               : 9 :</span>


approach the Government for regularisation of such violation if

law permits it. The Government on receipt of such applications

shall expedite the matter. Cancellation of the numbers issued to

the building shall be kept in abeyance      till the Government

considers the regularisation applications. As to the pollution

caused, which is alleged in 14300/2013; it is directed that the 4th

respondent shall inspect the respective properties; ie., KBN and

KGN Apartments with notice to the 5th respondent-Panchayath, the

petitioner in W.P(C) No.14300/2013 and the occupier/owners in

KGN and KBN apartments. The pollution alleged by the petitioner

in WPC no. 14300/2013 is only with respect to the KGN

Apartments, for which inspection alone he be issued with notice.

The allegation of pollution with respect to KBN Apartments is by

the Town Planner in his vigilance report. Both complexes shall

hence be verified and if found in existence, remedial measures

shall be directed. The owners/occupiers shall be given sufficient

time to make remedial measures and the Pollution Control Board

shall, after inspection, inform the Panchayath about the remedial

measures having been implemented upon which the cancellstion

of numbering shall be withdrawn.

no.14300/2013 in a suit said to have been filed for damages against

the builder of one of the apartment complexes, shall be left open

and so shall the defence of the builder. The suit shall be

adjudicated untramelled by the observations herein.
