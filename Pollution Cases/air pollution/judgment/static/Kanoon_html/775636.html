          In this petition for a writ of mandamus, the petitioner has

prayed for directions to the respondents not to use coercive,

unreasonable and harsh methods so as to force the petitioner to shift its

Dyeing Unit from B-XXIV-1899, Jalandhar Bye-pass Road, Opposite

New Shakti Nagar, Basti Jodhewal, Ludhiana to Plot No. D287, Focal

Point, Phase-VIII, Ludhiana. The petitioner also prays for a direction that

electric supply to the Unit should not be disconnected, till it is shifted to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Civil Writ Petition No. 6990 of 2009                                      2</span>




the new location.
</p>
<p id="p_8">          The material facts are not in dispute. It is not in dispute that

the petitioner-Unit is operating at the old location mentioned earlier from

where it was supposed to shift and be set up in an Industrial Plot in

Phase-VIII, Focal Point, Ludhiana, which plot was allotted to the

petitioner on preferential basis. Even after the allotment and the expiry

of period of one year granted for shifting of the old Unit, the petitioner did

not shift the Unit to its new location. In November 2004, the Board

appears to have taken note of the failure of the petitioner and issued a

notice under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33A</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. The Unit was once again visited in September 2005

only to find that the same had not been shifted to Focal Point where the

civil works were also incomplete. In December 2005, again the Unit was

directed, under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_3">Section 33A</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, to shift its operation to its new location. Notices and

proceedings held thereafter till the year 2009 have granted to the

petitioner further extension of time to shift to the new place but without

any worthwhile result. The position even as on date is that the same.

continues to operate from its old location where ETP set up by the

petitioner was found to be non-functional. That apart the Unit has been

working without any "consent to operate" from the Pollution Control

Board authorities. It is, in these circumstances, that the Board had

written a letter dated 4.5.2009 issuing directions to the Punjab State

Electricity Board to disconnect the electric supply. The petitioner has not

assailed the said direction. Instead it has filed the present petition in

which it has prayed for a mandamus seeking a direction against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Civil Writ Petition No. 6990 of 2009                                   3</span>




respondents not to use coercive methods for shifting of the Unit from its

old to new location.
</p>
<p id="p_9">          We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused

the record. We fail to understand how the unit has been running at the

old location without a consent to operate from the Pollution Control

Board as required under the statute and how can it claim a direction for

keeping in abeyance the order passed by the Board directing

disconnection of electric supply upon its failure to shift and to set up an

ETP at its new location. No mandamus can be issued directing the

respondents not to take any steps that must logically follow the orders

passed by us especially when such orders are not under challenge in

these proceedings. Confronted with this position, Mr. Behl made a

statement which has been separately recorded to the effect that the

Unit will be shifted to its new location latest by 15.9.2009 and that in

case the needful is not done, the Pollution Control Board shall be free to

have the electric supply disconnected and to take all other           steps

necessary to shut down the Unit.
</p>
<p id="p_10">          Mr. Takkar, counsel appearing for the Board submits that

while this Court could grant the time prayed for, it must be made clear

that no extension in the said period shall be granted and the Board and

the Punjab State Electricity Board shall be free to disconnect the electric

supply if the Unit is not shifted to its new location by 15.9.2009.

</p><p id="p_11">          In the circumstances, therefore, we are inclined to grant to the

petitioner the concession prayed for by Mr. Behl. We, accordingly, direct

that the directions issued by the Board for disconnection of electric

supply by the Punjab State Electricity Board at its old location shall not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Civil Writ Petition No. 6990 of 2009                                  4</span>




be enforced and shall remain suspended till 15.9.2009. In case the

petitioner does not shift the Unit or voluntarily shut down the same, the

Board shall be free not only to disconnect the supply of energy but also

take other steps necessary and permissible in law to stop its operation.

</p><p id="p_12">          The writ petition is, with the above observations, disposed off

leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
