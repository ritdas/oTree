</p>
<p id="p_3">2.             In Writ Petition No.3608 of 2010, the petitioner has

</p><p id="p_6">4.             On 21st January, 2009, the MPCB published an
advertisement in the newspaper inviting applications for various posts
including the post of Field Officer. Insofar as the post of Field Officers
are concerned, the said advertisement was published for inviting
applications for filling up 34 posts. By a letter dated 27 th January,
2009, the petitioner raised objection pointing out various lacunae
including that the State Government had not given wide publication of
advertisement and thus other duly qualified persons could not apply in
response to the said advertisement. The petitioner called upon the
MPCB to furnish various particulars.
</p>

<p id="p_7">5.             It is the case of the petitioner that the MPCB however
suddenly published a list of candidates for the post of Field Officer
including the waiting list. The said list provided the names of 105
candidates who were selected and further provided the names of 39
candidates who were shown in the waiting list. The said letter also
provided the educational qualification of each of those candidates, their
caste and also the marks obtained by them.
</p>

<p id="p_8">6.             It is the case of the petitioner that though the
advertisement was published by the MPCB in the month of January
2009, the actual selection was carried out after 10 months i.e. in the
month of October 2009.               The selection list was published on 6 th
November, 2009.           The Government was formed in the State of
Maharashtra and the Chief Minister had taken his oath on 7 th
November,2009.           It is the case of the petitioner that on 9 th

November,2009 i.e. on Monday about 80% candidates who were
selected by the MPCB for the post of Field Officer had joined the
service. Within one day of the publication of the selection list, the call
letters were alleged to have been received by the selected candidates
and within one day they were all ready for the appointment and
actually joined for the post.

</p><p id="p_29">10.            It is the case of the petitioner that he had been issued a
certificate by the District Rehabilitation Officer of Aurangabad on 2 nd
April, 2005 certifying that he came from the family of Project Affected
Persons (PAP). The name of the petitioner had been registered in the
Office of District Collector, Aurangabad. It is the case of the petitioner
that he is eligible and entitled to be appointed on the post of Field
Officer having fulfilled with all the eligibility criteria as per
advertisement dated 21st January,2009.        The petitioner has passed
Bachelor of Engineering Course in Chemical Subject.
</p>

<p id="p_30">11.            Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in the
advertisement issued by the MPCB, it was provided that out of 34
posts which was required to be filled on the post of Field Officer, one
post was reserved for Scheduled Caste, 5 posts for Scheduled Tribe, 1
post for NT and 27 posts reserved for open category candidates. No
post was however reserved for the project affected persons though
required to be reserved as per the Government policy and resolutions.
The petitioner submitted his application for the post of Field Officer.

the   Government            Departments,   Zilla   Parishads,       Municipal
Corporations, Municipal Councils etc. a priority has to be given to
such appointments. He submits that by another Government resolution
dated 3rd January 1997, it was further declared that for appointment in
Class III and Class IV posts, there should be 5% reservation out of
total posts advertised for the persons from project affected persons. He
also placed reliance on various other resolutions in support of this
submission. He submits that the post of Field Officer is Class III
category post.

<p id="p_33">13.            It is submitted that though the advertisement was issued in
respect of all the 34 posts of Field Officer,        MPCB selected 105
candidates and kept 39 persons in the waiting list. Though the MPCB
has maintained the reservation quota, SC, ST, NT, VJA, OBC
categories etc. are maintained but there was not a single selection made
from the category of project affected persons. He submitted that even
if the advertisement was in respect of 34 posts, as per the reservation
criteria of 5%, atleast two posts should have been kept to be filed in
from project affected persons out of 5 persons which has not been
maintained by the MPCB thereby violating various Government
resolutions and guidelines. The petitioner was thus seriously affected
and was deprived of legitimate appointment to the post of Field
Officer.

while making the appointment of the respondent nos. 4 to 8 and thus
the said appointments are totally illegal.       The petitioner has been
deprived of the appointment to the said post and thus the appointments
of respondent nos. 4 to 8 shall be quashed and set aside and the
petitioner shall be appointed to one of the said post.

persons in the category of project affected persons who were not
eligible nor were falling under the said category.            He also placed

MPCB. He submits that no seniority list was called by the MPCB of
the project affected persons before making any appointment.               The
respondent no.3 has appointed directly on the instructions of the State
Government illegally i.e. pursuant to the letter dated 24 th July, 2009.
He also pointed out that the father of the respondent no.7 was issued
project affected persons' certificate on 6th October,2009. The name of
the respondent no.7 was included in the project affected persons
category.     On 6th October,2009 however the respondent no.7 was
appointed under project affected persons category illegally. He invited
our attention to the letter dated 6th October, 2007. It is submitted by
the learned counsel that Ravindra Kshirsagar was not even qualified

<p id="p_40">20.            Insofar as respondent no.6 is concerned, it is submitted
that certificate of transfer in the name of respondent no.6 was from his
brother's name only on 5th February, 2009.        The respondent no.6
however was illegally appointed to the post in the category of project
affected persons. He submits hat the number of persons not having
certificate of project affected persons on the date of advertisement or
on the date of selection are still appointed. He submits that the JRF
post occupied by one of the candidate was not a sanctioned post.
However such candidate was illegally appointed as project affected

received the call letters from the MPCB and were called for the
purpose of interview. About 840 candidates were called for interview
as against 34 post advertised by the MPCB.

<p id="p_57">33.            Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the
selection list prepared by the MPCB would indicate that the candidates
at serial nos.1, 3, 25, 31, 41, 42, 52 and 55 were though possessing the

the advertisement dated 21st January, 2009, those candidates were
appointed by the MPCB contrary to and in violation of the eligibility
criteria mentioned in the advertisement.
</p>

<p id="p_58">34.            It is submitted that the candidates at serial nos.68 and 76
though were possessing the qualification of post graduate diploma in
Environment Science, only those candidates were also appointed in
contravention of the qualification prescribed in the advertisement.
</p>

<p id="p_59">35.            It is submitted that the candidate at serial no.13 viz.
Hemant Vasant Kulkarni, whose name was appearing in the waiting
list, who even did not apply pursuant to the advertisement nor his
name was appearing in the selection list, who were called for the
interview, the said candidate was appointed as one of the Field Officer.
It is submitted that the candidates whose names are at serial nos.36, 50,
74 and 99 had over aged i.e. had crossed the age of 35 years but were
still appointed to the post of the Field Officers. The MPCB while
preparing the selection list did not implement the criteria for providing
reservation and acted contrary to the scheme of reservation.

<p id="p_60">36.            It is submitted that no concession was provided to appoint
the existing staff working in some other department. The MPCB has
violated these norms also. Learned counsel for the petitioner placed

that there cannot be appointment beyond the number of vacancy
advertised and also to buttress the contention that the norms of the
selection cannot be altered after the commencement of the selection
process. He adopted the submissions made by the learned counsel for
the petitioner in Writ Petition No.3608 of 2010 insofar as the other
issues involved in the petition are concerned.
</p>

<p id="p_61">37.            Mr.Srihari Aney, learned senior counsel with Mr.Ajay
Deshpande, learned counsel appearing for the MPCB on the other hand
submits that insofar as Writ Petition No.3608 of 2010 is concerned, the
petitioner had admittedly not participated in the selection process. The
petitioner has also not prayed for his appointment to the post of Field
Officer. The petitioner has not challenged the appointment of the
candidates who were selected by the MPCB which according to the
petitioner were illegal. He submits that if the illegalities are of such
nature that it cannot be cured individually, only in that event, the whole
selection process can be set aside and not otherwise. The petitioner has
no locus to file this petition in his individual capacity.

<p id="p_62">               It is submitted that none of the writ petitions are in the
nature of public interest litigation.       The action initiated by the
petitioner in this case is not action in rem but is in personam and thus
unless the petitioner is individually aggrieved by the acts of the MPCB
and prays for setting aside the selection of the particular candidates
which is illegal according to the petitioner and in whose place the
petitioner deserves to be appointed, no relief can be granted by this
court in this petition. This court is not hearing any public interest

<p id="p_63">38.              It is submitted that since the appointment of none of the
candidates is challenged by the petitioner in the Writ Petition No.3608
of 2010, such writ petition is a futile writ petition and cannot be
entertained by this Court.

<p id="p_64">39.              Learned senior counsel invited our attention to various
grounds raised in the Writ Petition No.3608 of 2010 and more
particularly grounds (l), (n), (m) and (p) and would submit that each of
the grounds raised in the writ petition are totally vague and without
particulars. He submits that no woman candidate has filed any writ
petition challenging the alleged irregularities or illegalities committed
by the MPCB in conducting the selection procedure and making
appointments of various candidates to the post of the Field Officer. He
submits that only 60 candidates who were eligible to the post of Field
Officer have been appointed by the MPCB. He submits that since the
pleadings of the petitioners in each case are totally vague, the MPCB
was not required and expected to give a detail explanation to such
vague pleadings. The MPCB is not expected to answer any vague
plea.

court in the public interest litigation bearing Writ Petition Nos.32 of
2006 and 41 of 2006 respectively. He submits that this court had
directed the MPCB in those two public interest litigation to fill up
those posts to cope up with the increase workload of the Board due to
entrustment of the implementation of the said rules. The MPCB had
accordingly issued an advertisement in various newspaper for filling
up the post on the establishment of the board including 34 posts of
Field Officers. He submits that out of 34 posts, 24 posts of Field
Officer were sanctioned by the State Government in compliance with
the order dated 9th January,2009 passed by this court in Writ Petition
Nos. 32 of 2006 and 41 of 2006. He submits that the remaining 10
vacancies had arisen from the existing sanctioned posts of the Field
Officer prior to the date of the said order dated 9 th January,2009 passed
by this court in the aforesaid two writ petitions.        He invited our
attention to the aforesaid order dated 9th January,2009 passed by this

the MPCB considered the said report submitted by M/s.Crisil Advisory
Services in the meetings held on 25 th February, 2009 and 12th
March,2009 and resolved that there was an urgent need of additional
manpower on the establishment of the MPCB more than double the
existing strength. It was resolved that atleast 620 posts should be
sanctioned immediately.              The MPCB had accordingly submitted a
proposal to the Government of Maharashtra, Environment Department
for necessary approval. The State Government however sanctioned
517 posts including 84 posts of Field Officers. The MPCB therefore
considered to fill up 84 newly sanctioned posts of Field Officers along
with 34 posts which were advertised earlier by the respondent board in
view of the fact that sufficient number of eligible candidates were
available for the interviews and accordingly recommended 113
candidates for appointment as against 34 posts which were advertised.

appointed on the sanctioned posts whereas 24 candidates were
appointed on sanctioned post in compliance with the order passed by
this court in two public interest litigations.           9 candidates were
appointed in view of the vacancies arisen in the meanwhile. The

that the appointment of additional candidates was in these
circumstances and such action on the part of the MPCB was not
unlawful.
</p>

<p id="p_70">45.            It is submitted by the learned senior counsel that the
MPCB had applied for necessary permission to the Election
Commission to conduct the interviews in view of the fact that the
elections were announced during the period when the applications
were received and scrutinized by the MPCB and the Code of Conduct
had made applicable throughout Maharashtra due to such Assembly
Election. The Election Commissioner had granted an oral approval to
the MPCB to conduct the interviews of the candidates called for the
interviews. He submits that the submissions of the learned counsel for
the petitioners in each of these petitions that the approval from the
Election Commissioner was not obtained before conducting interviews
was thus factually incorrect.

category.      Whatever number of posts were mentioned in the
advertisement, the backlog was capable of being changed. The number
of posts could be changed after advertisement was issued and also the
reservation.

of the Department was not mentioned in the advertisement for the
reason that no candidate should approach the department which had
issued such advertisement with a           view to see that there was
transparency in the selection procedure in making appointment of
various candidates to various posts. He submits that merely because
the name of the particular department which issued the advertisement
was not mentioned, the same would not affect the candidates who
proposed to apply for such posts in any manner whatsoever. All other
details were already given in the advertisement. He submits that the
petitioner has not challenged the virus of the Recruitment Rules, 1996
which are followed by the MPCB while conducting the selection
process while making various appointments pursuant to the said
advertisement. Those rules are statutory in nature and are binding on
the MPCB as well as on the parties.

women Field Officers were selected who had already joined their
duties as Field Officers in the MPCB. Some of the Field Officers who
had not joined the duties and some of them had resigned after joining

that they had submitted the documentary evidence about their caste and
were already interviewed and their revised merits lists as per their
marks were placed on the website of the board. It is submitted by the

issued final selection list which is admittedly not challenged by the
petitioner in the writ petition. The said list was published on the

handicapped is concerned, it is submitted that the said candidate was
an eligible candidate from handicapped category for whom the age
limit prescribed in the Government resolution dated 10 th May, 2002
was 45 years. He was thus rightly called upon for the interview by the
MPCB and was appointed.

<p id="p_76">51.            Insofar as appointment of Pratap Garje is concerned, it is
submitted that he had been appointed for VJ(A) category of caste and
as per Government resolution dated 5th December,1994 had been
permitted to interchange the category of the appointment of candidate
from VJ(A) to NT(D). He submits that the MPCB has appointed
backward class candidate as per the Government resolution dated 16th
November,2007 and there was no illegalities committed by the MPCB
insofar as appointment of the backward class candidates are concerned.
He submits that after scrutiny, it was found that the candidates at serial
nos.57 to 63 of the selection list were from Schedule Tribe and
therefore were placed on the website of the respondent instead of serial
nos. 56 to 62.

</p><p id="p_80">53.            Mr.Aney, learned senior counsel for MPCB invited our
attention to some of the averments made in the affidavit filed by the
Chief Secretary to the Government of Maharashtra dated 13th August
2010 in Writ Petition No.7841 of 2009. He submits that it is clear that
the Environment department accorded its approval on 20 th August
2009 for creation of additional 517 posts including 84 posts of Field
officers. He submits that in the said affidavit, the State Government
has contended that since the applications received were more than
three times of the number of posts to be filled in, all 118 posts could
be filled up from those applicants. The said decision was taken
consciously to avoid re-advertisement and to save time. It is stated in
the said affidavit that it would have been prudent for the Member
Secretary to seek the consent of the Chairman since the number of
vacancies went up by more than two times.

though in the said affidavit, the State Government made its decision
clear, none of the petitioners applied for any amendment to the writ
petition so as to challenge the list dated 5 th November 2009 which was
final selection list issued by MPCB. He submits that the list was
already published on the website of MPCB on 29th October 2009.

impossible is concerned, it is submitted by the learned senior counsel
that it is not open to this Court to examine such issue. He submits
that every wrong cannot be corrected in a writ petition and even if it

it is submitted by the learned senior counsel for MPCB that giving of

committee is not a crime and no conclusion can be drawn by this
Court based on such marking. He submits that no such plea has been

           had also maintained a detailed record of marks

these petitions under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_22">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, the
petitioners have exercised their legal rights as well as fundamental
rights and thus these writ petitions are maintainable.

</p><p id="p_132">79.            In so far as the submission of the learned senior counsel
for MPCB that the pleadings filed by the petitioners are vague is
concerned, he submits that the pleadings have to be read as a whole
and not in isolation.           He invited our attention to various grounds
raised in Writ Petition No.3608 of 2010 and also to the averments
made in the rejoinder. He submits that since the respondents had
suppressed various true and correct facts, the petitioner was required
to obtain various information and documents under the provision of
the Rights to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_23">Information Act</a>, 2005 including the mark-sheets of the
said selected candidates. Those documents are placed on record. The
respondents did not deny the authenticity of those documents.                   He
submits that since the petitioner had brought the gross illegalities
and fraud committed by the respondents on record, this Court has
ample power to set aside the entire selection process in toto and can
direct the respondents to issue fresh advertisement and to appoint the
candidates in accordance with law.
</p>

<p id="p_133">80.            In so far as the        report submitted by Crisil Advisory
Services relied upon by MPCB is concerned, learned counsel for the
petitioner submits that the said agency was appointed by MPCB who
had submitted a report to the Board. No reliance thereon can be
placed by the respondents against the petitioners.          The MPCB had
considered      the said report        and did not send the same to the
Government.         He submits that the MPCB cannot justify its action
based on the said Crisil's report.        He submits that after considering
the problem of bio medical waste, the Government had sanctioned 31
posts for bio medical waste and 24 posts for field officers and not 31.

The advertisement however was issued on the same date for 34 posts.

<p id="p_135">81.            In so far as the two selection lists published by MPCB is
concerned, it is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that
neither MPCB nor the selection committee had power to revise the
selection list once displayed. He submits that the selection list was
revised by the Member Secretary, who was the Chairman of the
selection committee and had no power to issue such revised list. The
selection committee has not followed the requisite selection process
prescribed in various Government Resolutions. He heavily placed
reliance on the observations made by the Division Bench of this
Court about the conduct of MPCB            in carrying out the selection
process and tendered a separate chart showing the illegalities
committed by MPCB.

persons as against the 34 posts advertised while appointing the field
officers.

</p><p id="p_140">84.            It is not in dispute that the advertisement was issued by
the MPCB for appointing the field officers in respect of 34 posts on
21st January,2009 and the applications were invited in respect of
various posts including the posts of field officers. The MPCB has filed
an affidavit in reply to Writ Petition No.3608 of 2010 contending that
the Government of Maharashtra had sanctioned 31 posts on the
establishment for effective implementation of the Bio-Medical Waste
(Management and Handling) Rules, 1998 so as to comply with the
order dated 9th January,2009 passed by this court in Public Interest
Litigation Nos.32 of 2006 and 41 of 2006. It was contended that the
special permission is granted to recruit the posts so as to cope with the
implementation of Bio-Medical Waste Rules. A perusal of the record
indicates that all the posts of field officers were recruited by the MPCB
under water pollution and not for implementing the Bio-Medical Waste
Rules.
</p>

<p id="p_141">85.            The record further indicates that MPCB did not make any
appointment to the posts of field officers for implementation of the said
Bio-Medical Waste Rules. Though the MPCB placed reliance on oral
alleged permission from State Election Commission in the affidavit in
reply filed by MPCB, no confirmation is obtained from the Election
Commission purporting to have granted any such permission orally in
favour of MPCB for making appointment in respect of the
pronouncement of the Code of Conduct. A perusal of the affidavit filed
by MPCB indicates that it is the case of the MPCB itself that the
Selection Committee had decided to fill up 113 posts. None of the
rules relied upon by the MPCB for filling up such posts would indicate

that such decision could be taken by the Selection Committee itself to
fill up the posts more than the posts advertised. It has been vehemently
urged by the learned senior counsel for the MPCB that the Board had
received 1147 applications for various candidates from throughout
Maharashtra in response to the said advertisement dated 21 st
January,2009.
</p>

<p id="p_142">86.               It is also the case of the MPCB that in the meantime the
Environment Department, Government of Maharashtra sanctioned 517
new posts on the establishment of the Board which included 84 posts
of the field officers created on the establishment of the board. It is the
case of the MPCB that out of 1174 posts, 84 candidates were appointed
on the sanctioned posts whereas 24 candidates were appointed in
compliance with the order passed by this Court in two public interest
litigations, 9 candidates were appointed on new vacancies having
arisen in the meanwhile. It was also the case of the MPCB in the
affidavit that the State Government permitted the MPCB to fill up all
the posts in view of the fact that a large number of candidates had
applied for 34 posts and were available for filling up the additional
posts.
</p>

<p id="p_143">87.               A perusal of the record indicates that no such alleged
permission/sanctioned had been granted by the Government of
Maharashtra post issuance of the advertisement permitting the MPCB
to appoint candidates over and above the posts advertised on the
ground that the large number of the candidates had applied for the said
34 posts which were advertised and were available for filling up the

Government has been produced on record.
</p>

<p id="p_144">88.              On 25th June,2010 this court passed further order and
made prima facie observation that against the advertisement issued for
filling in 34 posts, how could 111 persons be appointed and that itself
raises eye-brows. This Court directed that it was imperative for the
respondent no.1- Secretary to disclose the stand of the State
Government. This Court directed the MPCB to publish on the website
and notice board regarding pendency of this writ petition wherein the
appointed candidates were made respondents. This court clarified that
the subject appointments shall be subject to the further orders passed in
this petition.
</p>

<p id="p_145">89.              This Court after perusing the original file produced by the
MPCB made various observations about the irregularities committed
by the MPCB in making appointments in an order dated 12 th July,
2010. noticed an order passed by the Division Bench in the public
interest litigation matter bearing Writ Petition No. 32 of 2006 wherein
it was recorded by the Division Bench a statement made by the learned
A.G.P. appearing for the MPCB that the Government had sanctioned
31 posts and they were in process of filling up the posts. Various
endorsements were made in the original file from pages P-1 to P-53 in
respect of 31 to 34 posts to be filled in. This court had also considered
the affidavit in reply filed by Shri Sham Narayan Dhakate, Deputy
Secretary, Environment Department, Mantralaya, Mumbai - 32, who
was one of the member of the Selection Committee who had contended

that in respect of the recruitment, the entire power and responsibility
vest with MPCB. The Member Secretary was the appointing authority
for the employees of Board whose maximum pay scale did not exceed
Rs.1150/-.
</p>

<p id="p_146">90.            It was contended in the said affidavit that the appointing
authority will be the Selection Committee constituted by the MPCB if
the pay scale of the employees was exceeding Rs.1150/-. It was
contended by the State Government in the said affidavit that the State
Government was not at all responsible for the appointment of the
employees and the officers in the MPCB. The MPCB was however
under obligation to follow the necessary directions given from time to
time apart from the Recruitment Rules framed by the MPCB and
approved by the State Government. It was also the case of the State
Government in the said affidavit that the State Government would
make necessary inquiry and take suitable action, if it was found that
any irregularities were committed and discrepancies were found in the
procedure adopted for making appointments.
</p>

<p id="p_147">91.            In paragraph (10) of the said order dated 12th July, 2010,
this Court prima facie observed that the Court was highly disturbed to
note that responsible statutory body constituted under the provisions of
Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_24">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 flouted various
mandatory procedure and went ahead to recruit more than 100

petitioners raising objection to the appointment, prima facie, appears to
be substantial and serious one. The original file before this Court

the marks were allotted by the Committee to the candidates. This court
also made it clear that in case there was some other file in respect of
allotment of marks, Pollution Board was still entitled to place before
this Court. This Court also observed that as on today, none of the
responsible members of the then Committee nor State Government was
taking over responsibility of the circumstances resulting in the present
situation. This Court in the said order directed the MPCB to intimate
in writing to the respondents-appointees in respect of the pendency of
the petitions and next date of hearing. This court made it clear that the
appointment made by the MPCB shall be subject to the outcome of
these petitions.

<p id="p_148">92.            This Court passed further order on 7th July,2010 and
observed that it would be appropriate if the Deputy Secretary of the
Environment and Pollution Control Department attends the hearing of
these petitions along with the responsible senior officer of the Pollution
Control Board with original record. This Court once again directed the
MPCB to intimate to all the appointees that their appointment would
be subject to outcome of these petitions and further directed not to alter
or modify the appointment orders, if they are already issued, until
further orders.

made by the MPCB much more than the posts advertised is concerned,

it is the stand of the MPCB that the MPCB had received 1147
applications from various candidates throughout Maharashtra pursuant
to the said advertisement dated 21st January,2009. It was decided to
call 843 deserving candidates fulfilling the recruitment criteria for the
interview. The Board had constituted a Selection Committee. It is
alleged in the said affidavit that the Board had considered the report
submitted by M/s.Crisil Advisory Services and also requirement of
additional manpower in its 148th Meeting held on 25th February,2009
and 12th March,2009 and resolved that there was an urgent need of
additional manpower on the establishment of the Board more than
double the existing strength.          However, to achieve minimum
compliance level and the norms of the Board, atleast 620 posts should
be sanctioned immediately. The MPCB had accordingly submitted a
proposal to the Environment Department, Government of Maharashtra
for necessary approval as required under sub <a href="/doc/1869099/" id="a_25">section 3</a> of <a href="/doc/1662929/" id="a_26">section 12</a> of
the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_27">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and
corresponding section under the provisions of the Air (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_28">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.       However, the State Government
sanctioned 517 posts out of which 84 posts of the field officers were
sanctioned. The Selection Committee decided to fill up the newly
sanctioned posts of the field officers, because of sufficient number of
eligible candidates being available for the interview and accordingly
113 candidates were recommended for the appointment.

<p id="p_150">94.            The State Government filed an affidavit dated 12th July,

in the MPCB, the entire power and responsibility vest in the MPCB. It
is further contended that the employees whose pay scale was
Rs.1150/-, the appointing authority would be the Selection Committee
constituted by the MPCB and thus the Member Secretary and the
Selection Committee of the MPCB are the responsible authority for
making appointments of the MPCB. It is contended that the State
Government is not at all responsible for the appointment of the
employee and the officers in the MPCB. The MPCB is supposed to
make appointment in pursuance of the Recruitment Rules approved in
this behalf by the State Government.                After approval of the
recruitment, respondent no.2 board is solely responsible for the
appointment to be made by the Board. The MPCB is supposed to
make appointment in pursuance to the Recruitment Rules and the
reservation made applicable to the State Government and is an under
obligation to follow necessary directions given from time to time apart
from the Recruitment Rules framed by the MPCB and approved by the
State Government.
</p>

<p id="p_151">95.            In paragraph (7) of the said affidavit it is stated that if it is
found that there were some irregularities committed while making
appointment and also there are some discrepancies found in the

will make necessary inquiry and take suitable action.

pursuant to the advertisement dated 21st January,2009, the MPCB had
received 1147 applications.          In the meantime, the Environment
Department recorded its approval on 20th August, 2009 for creation of
additional 517 posts including post of field officers. The Member
Secretary of MPCB decided to conduct selection procedure to make
recruitment of all 118 posts of field officers. It is contended that the
said decision was taken consciously by the MPCB to avoid re-
advertisement and to save time. However, it would have been prudent
for the Member Secretary to seek the consent of the Chairman since
the number of vacancies went up by more than two times. The MPCB
conducted the recruitment process by way of interview in the month of
October 2009 as per the provisions of the recruitment Rules and
considered the vacant posts that became available till end of August
2009. It is contended that in the present case, the additional new posts
had been taken into account by the MPCB.
</p>

<p id="p_153">97.            A perusal of the affidavit filed by the State Government as
well as by the MPCB clearly indicates that it is their case that the
additional posts were sanctioned by the State Government after
issuance of the advertisement by the MPCB. It is the clear stand of the
State Government that MPCB was solely responsible for appointment
of various candidates to the posts and not the State Government. Both
the authorities had taken a stand that the Selection Committee had
decided to fill additional posts and to call additional number of
candidates for interview. Neither the State Government nor the MPCB
could place on record any provision of the Recruitment Rules of
MPCB or any directives issued by the State Government for approval

granted by the State Government permitting the Selection Committee
to appoint additional candidates after issuance of the advertisement
issued based on the original sanction order and based on the sanctioned
granted posts issuance of the advertisement.
</p>

<p id="p_154">98.            It is the case of the MPCB itself that only 24 posts were
sanctioned pursuant to the order passed by this Court out of the said 34
posts and those posts were filled up for the purposes for which this
court had ordered MPCB to fill up those posts in public interest
litigation. It is thus clear that remaining posts filled by the MPCB
other than those 24 posts were not in accordance with any directions or
orders passed by this court in the public interest litigation or in any
other matters. A perusal of the record indicates that the stand taken by
the State Government and by the MPCB on this issue is inconsistent.
The MPCB also has taken a contradictory statement in various
affidavits filed in the aforesaid proceedings.

<p id="p_155">99.            We shall now deal with various judgments relied upon by
both the parties. Supreme Court in case of <a href="/doc/250338/" id="a_29">Prem Singh and others vs.
Haryana State Electricity Board and others</a> (supra) has held that the
selection process by way of requisition and advertisement can be
started for clearing vacancies and also for anticipated vacancies but not
for future vacancies.          If the requisition and advertisement are for
certain number of posts only the State cannot make more appointments
then the number of posts advertised, even though it might have
prepared a select list of more candidates. The State can deviate from
the advertisement and make appointments on posts falling vacant

thereafter in exceptional circumstances only or in an emergent situation
and that too by taking a policy decision in that behalf. In our view, the
MPCB and also the State Government could not produce any policy
decision taken by either of them for appointing more candidates than
the posts advertised. In our view, the Selection Committee who has
purported to have exercised such powers had no authority to appoint
any candidates in excess of the posts advertised.          Admittedly no
corrigendum was issued by MPCB to the earlier advertisement thereby
proposing to appoint additional candidates.
</p>

<p id="p_156">100.            There was no bar against the MPCB to appoint candidates
by issuing fresh advertisement pursuant to the additional sanction if
any granted by the State Government. Admittedly, the appointment
made by the MPCB pursuant to the said advertisement was after more
than the period of 12 months. It is also not the case of the MPCB that
it had cancelled the earlier advertisement and had issued a fresh
advertisement based on the additional sanction of the posts if any. The
principles of law laid down by the Supreme Court in case of <a href="/doc/250338/" id="a_30">Prem
Singh and others vs. Haryana State Electricity Board and others</a>
(supra) squarely applies to the facts of this case. We are respectfully

power to relax essential qualification, the entire process of selection so
far as the selected candidate is concerned gets vitiated. Being in
contravention of the establishment prescribed by the advertisement, the
power to relax must be clearly spelled out and cannot be otherwise. In
our view, this judgment of Supreme Court also applies to the facts of
this case. The powers of Selection Committee to ignore the condition
prescribed in the advertisement and to appoint additional candidates is
not spelled out clearly under any of the Recruitment Rules applicable
to the parties and thus such power should not have been usurped by the
Selection Committee to make additional appointment over and above
the posts advertised in the advertisement.

authority cannot make any selection/appointment beyond the number

than those advertised. The principles behind the said decision is that if
that was allowed to be done, such action would be entirely arbitrary
and violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution since other
candidates who had chosen not to apply for the vacant posts which
were being sought to be filled, could have also applied if they had
known that the other vacancies would also be under consideration for
being filled up. In the said judgment, Supreme Court also adverted to
the earlier judgment in case of <a href="/doc/183960/" id="a_34">State of U.P. vs. Rajkumar Sharma</a>

and that selectees could not claim appointments as a matter of right. It
is also held that even if in some cases appointments had been made by
mistake or wrongly, that did not confer any right of appointment to
another person, because <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_35">Article 14</a> of Constitution does not envisage

this matter, no extraordinary or exceptional circumstances existed
requiring filling up of additional posts after issuance of the

MPCB had received more applications than the posts advertised, that
could not be a ground for filling up substantial number of posts in
excess of what was advertised.         In our view, merely because the
petitioner in Writ Petition No.3608 of 2010 had not applied for the post
of field officer pursuant to the advertisement issued after pointing out
the illegalities and flaws in the advertisement issued by the MPCB, he
has still locus to challenge the entire selection process adopted by the

posts were likely to be increased, such note would not give blanket
powers to the appointing authority to appoint the candidates more than
the posts advertised and in any event, by taking such decision by the

vacancies over the notified vacancies is neither permissible nor
desirable, for the reason, that it amounts to "improper exercise of
power and only in a rare and exceptional circumstance and in emergent
situation, such a rule can be deviated and such a deviation is
permissible only after adopting policy decision based on some
rational", otherwise the exercise would be arbitrary. Filling up of
vacancies over the notified vacancies amounts to filling up of future

Supreme Court has held that the selection pursuant to the
advertisement should be confined only to the posts that were advertised
and the additional posts that were created after the expiry of the
recruitment year shall be filled up by issuance of an advertisement

<p id="p_167">110.            In our view, there is no merit in the submission of the
learned counsel for the MPCB and in the submission of the learned
counsel for the appointees that the MPCB was justified by appointing
more candidates than the posts advertised in view of there being a note
in the advertisement that the posts were likely to be increased or on
other grounds canvassed before this court. In our view, the MPCB
could not have appointed the candidates in excess of the posts
advertised. The actual appointments were made by the MPCB much
after expiry of the 12 months from the date of advertisement. In any
event, no policy decision was taken earlier to demonstrate that in what
circumstances the MPCB could have filled up the additional posts
sanctioned after the issuance of the advertisement or in the event of the
MPCB having received more applications for the posts advertised.
Admittedly, the posts sanctioned by the State Government was not the
posts more than the posts advertised before issuance of the

Gas Company (Proprietary) Ltd.(supra) has held that <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_49">Article 226</a>

writs of the nature mentioned therein for the enforcement of any of the
rights conferred by Part III or for any other purpose. It is held that the
persons other than those claiming fundamental right can also approach
the court seeking a relief thereunder. The Article in terms does not
describe the classes of persons entitled to apply thereunder; but it is
implicit in the exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction that the relief
asked for must be one to enforce a legal right. It is held that the right
that can be enforced under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_50">Article 226</a> also shall ordinarily be the
personal or individual right of the petitioner himself, though in the case
of some of the writs like habeas corpus or quo warranto this rule may

by the public body by filing a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_51">Article 226</a> of the

Ganpatrao Karad cannot be entertained by this court on the ground that
the petitioner had not applied for any relief in the nature of writ of

appropriate order against the MPCB or the State Government. It is not
in dispute that the all five petitions were heard together. The plea
raised by the respondents in all five petitions are also common. In
other four petitions, the petitioners have sought reliefs in their favour.
In our view, there is thus no merit in the submission of the learned
senior counsel for the MPCB that the petitioner in Writ Petition
No.3608 of 2010 had no locus to file such petition or that none of the
petitioners can also be allowed to agitate the grievances made in their
respective petition on the same ground.

who were eligible and were deprived from applying for such post in
absence of such publication.

<p id="p_174">117.            A perusal of the record further indicates that no woman
candidate was appointed in the selection committee though the same
was required         in terms of the government guidelines as per the
government resolution dated 10th December, 2004 and 19th October,
2007. In our view, the constitution of the selection committee itself
was thus not proper and in accordance             with the Government
Resolution dated 10th December, 2004 and 19th October, 2007.

<p id="p_175">118.            It is not in dispute that the appointment in question to
the post of field officers was of class III category. It is also not in
dispute that MPCB did not hold any written test before appointing
any candidate to the post of field officers.   In so far as the State
Government as well as the MPCB is concerned, it was their stand in
the affidavits as well as during the course of the arguments that the
recruitment rules did not provide for written test but only provided
for oral test/interview. This issue has been considered by this Court
in the case of Kisan Sukhdeo Lokhande (supra) specifically. In that
matter also, the selection could be made solely on the basis of the
assessment of oral interview. This Court         after adverting        to the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Lila Dhar Vs. State of
Rajasthan &amp; Ors., reported in 1981 (4) SCC159 and other judgments

that it gave unfettered discretion in the members of the selection
committee, to choose any candidate of their choice. There were no

guidelines, so as to guide the members of the committee in the manner
in which the candidates were to be assessed in the oral test.
</p>

<p id="p_176">119.            This Court also considered in that matter that the posts
sought to be filled in were Class-III posts. Considering such facts
which are identical to the facts of this case, this Court held that the
nature of the posts, for which the selection was made, were such as
could be selected only on the basis of assessment on viva voce test. In
such cases, since the posts sought to be filled in were Class-III posts, it
was necessary to have assessed the candidates on the basis of written
test and only after the candidates cleared the written test, the final
selection process could have been done on the basis of assessment on
written and oral examination, in the proportion permitted by the Apex
Court in its various pronouncements.

on hundred per cent viva voce test is unreasonable and leads to
arbitrariness. This Court accordingly quashed and set aside the entire
process and directed the authority to hold selection for the post
keeping in mind those observations. In our view, the principles laid
down by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Kisan
Sukhdeo Lokhande (supra) would squarely apply to the facts of this
case. We are respectfully bound by the said judgment passed by this
Court. In this case also admittedly, the entire selection was based on
the oral interviews only which also was conducted in an illegal manner
as already highlighted in the other part of the judgment. In this case
also, the appointments were made in respect of class III category post

and thus powers exercised by the selection board of MPCB was
exercised without any guidelines and were unguided powers which
leads to      total hardship          and    arbitrariness to the other genuine
candidates.
</p>

<p id="p_178">121.            The record produced before this Court by the petitioner
which is not disputed by the MPCB or the State Government showing
the marks allotted to each of successful candidates upon such so
called interviews shows glaring and patent illegalities and fraud
committed upon the genuine candidates so as to oblige the selected
candidates. In our view, in these circumstances, even though the
recruitment rules permitted the MPCB to appoint candidates merely
on the basis of the interviews on oral test, considering the nature of
post and the sanctity of such post, selection committee ought to have
conducted       the written test         so as to obviate any allegation             of
arbitrariness       and to make the process of appointment                       more
transparent. The entire selection process conducted by the MPCB
without holding written test in such a situation was illegal and thus
deserves to be set aside on this ground also. We are thus not inclined
to accept the submission made by the learned senior counsel for the
MPCB and also by the learned counsel for the appointees that there
was no illegality on the part of the selection committee to appoint
candidates merely based on the oral interviews. There was no bar
from conducting written test.

candidates and as a matter of record, the reservation exceeded upto
65%. MPCB also did not follow the ratio of 33% reservation of the
remaining category though the said reservation was given by the
Government resolution for the woman, Department of State including
the MPCB. The candidates at serial nos.14 to 16 and 56 to 62 who
were some of the respondents in this petition have been selected
though they were not in the list of selection or waiting list. Though the
advertisement did not provide the reservation on the post under the
category of Project Affected Person (PAP), selection committee
appointed several candidates purportedly under the category of PAP.
</p>

<p id="p_180">123.            A perusal of the record further indicates that MPCB has
selected over-age candidates. The advertisement has provided the
upper limit of 35 years whereas the MPCB has appointed the
candidates of 41 years and above on the pretext that those employees
were already in service of MPCB or the State Government. In our
view, the candidates who were already in service of MPCB or the
State Government could not have been given any relaxation in age
while making their recruitment to the post of field officers.
</p>

<p id="p_181">124.            A perusal of the record further      indicates that          the
candidates who were having more than two children were appointed
on the selection process contrary to the policy decision taken by the
State Government. The candidates who were appointed in the reserved
category were not even asked to produce caste validity certificate
when they were appointed on the reserved category posts.

engineering or post graduate in environment or equivalent qualification
whereas Mr.Karandkar Surendra Gajanan though was holding the
Bachelor of Technology degree which was not equivalent to the
qualified degree or post graduate in environment was selected by
MPCB contrary to the condition prescribed in the advertisement.

posts which were required to be filled for Field Officer, one post was
reserved for Scheduled Caste, 5 posts for Scheduled Tribe, 1 post for
NT and 27 posts reserved for open category candidates. No post was
reserved      for the project affected persons though required to be
reserved as per the Government policy and resolution dated 1980.

Collector, Jalgaon. Though Mr.Ravindra Govind Kshirsagar i.e.

appointed illegally to one of the posts of Field Officer.

project affected person at the time of advertisement or at the time of
selection but was issued certificate only on the date of appointment
i.e. 6th October 2009, he was however illegally appointed to one of the
posts of field officer. It is an admitted position that these appointments
were not recommended by the District Collector from the seniority
list maintained by the Collector's Office and are thus in violation of
the Government Resolution dated 18th August 2008. Some of the
petitioners were though eligible to be appointed in project affected
person category have been deprived of the appointment to the said
post under the said category. In our view, MPCB could not have
appointed such candidates under the category of PAP on the basis
of such recommendation made by the State Government or by the
Collector without inviting a list of such project affected persons from
the Collector's office. Even such persons who were eligible to be
appointed under the PAP category were also required to compete inter

<p id="p_188">130.            A perusal of the affidavit-in-reply dated 13th August 2010
filed by the State Government on the issue of appointments of PAP
indicates that MPCB had given appointment to six persons from
that category        i.e. one         candidate   on    4th August 2009 and five
candidates on         6th October         2009.        It is the case of the State
Government that at the time when these appointments were made,
Government Resolution dated 18th August 2008                       was in force for
appointments of PAPs. As per this Government Resolution, persons
under such category were to be given appointments on the basis of
seniority       after calling list           of PAP candidates from District
Collectors/Rehabilitation officers and posts reserved for PAP
categories were not required to be advertised. It is alleged in the said
affidavit that as per information given by MPCB officer, the said
five candidates were appointed on 6th October 2009 and were
already in       service with MPCB                on contract basis and          as per
Government letter dated 24th July 2009, the MPCB was requested to
consider the PAP employees                 who were already         in service, on a
priority.
</p>

<p id="p_189">131.            It is thus clear beyond reasonable doubt that no seniority
list of PAP was called from District Collectors/Rehabilitation officers
and    appointments were               made based on       letter addressed by the
Government letter dated 24th July 2009 or by the District Collector as
per their whims. Learned senior counsel for MPCB also could not

defend or justify the action of appointing such persons under
category of "project affected persons." In our view, the candidates
who claimed under the said category ought to have been eligible on
the date of advertisement and not on the date of the selection process
or interview or on the date of the appointment. No such candidate
who did not fall under                the said PAP category      on the date of
advertisement could apply and participate and also could not have
been appointed to the said posts.

Pandurang Pagare &amp; Anr. (supra) has held that though <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_55">Article 16(4)</a>
would permit a horizontal reservation to be made in favour of a weaker
section of the society which is socially and educationally backward,
like the project affected persons, the mandate of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_56">Article 14</a> and <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_57">16</a>
would not permit an appointment to be made of the persons from the
reserved category by ignoring the relevant recruitment rules and the
inter se merit.          It is held that the quota of 5% fixed for project
affected persons is nothing but a horizontal reservation provided for
project affected persons and the candidates from that category will
have to compete amongst themselves under the recruitment rules and
the best amongst them would be entitled to be appointed. By the said
judgment delivered by the Full Bench of this Court, the judgment

Full Bench of this Court in the case of Rajendra Pandurang Pagare

Constitution of India and the Maharashtra Project Affected Persons
Rehabilitation Act, 1999 would squarely apply to the facts of this case.

<p id="p_191">133.            We are not inclined to accept the submission of Mr.Dixit,
learned senior counsel for some of the project affected persons who
were appointed to the post of field officer that the said judgment of
the Full Bench was not pronounced           on the date of issuance of
advertisement by MPCB or on the date of selection and thus would
not apply to the facts of this case. In our view, MPCB was bound to
publish an advertisement calling applications from the candidates
from project affected persons while filling up posts from reserved
category and could not have appointed any candidate under that
category without such advertisement ignoring their qualifications and
merit merely on the basis of some recommendation letters issued by
State Government or by the District Collector or on the basis of those
employees already being in service with the department of MPCB.
Such candidates who deserved to be appointed under the said category
are also bound to compete with each other on merit and are required to
fulfill several other conditions. In our view, the appointment of these
candidates by MPCB under that category is ex facie illegal, contrary
to law and in violation of well settled principles of law laid down by
this Court. A perusal of the record clearly indicates that MPCB has
permitted these candidates to submit the alleged proof of they being
project affected persons much after issuance of advertisement and till

<p id="p_192">134.            In so far as the stand taken by the MPCB that some of
these employees who were appointed to the posts of field officer were
already appointed          on contract basis and were thus eligible to be
appointed to the posts of field officer is concerned, Supreme Court in
the case of Union Public Service Commission Vs. Girish Jayanti
Lal Vaghela &amp; Ors. (supra) has held that appointment of a person
not having been made after issuing the public advertisement and being
purely on contractual basis, the stage of acquiring the status of a
Government servant had not arrived and such contractual employees
were not governed by Government Service Rules, it was not possible
to hold that he was a government servant. Supreme Court held that
such employee could not be said to be a Government servant as he
was working on contract basis and thus he was not eligible for any
relaxation in upper age limit. In our view, the principles of law laid
down by the Supreme Court in the case of Union Public Service
Commission Vs. Girish Jayanti Lal Vaghela &amp; Ors. (supra) would
squarely apply to the facts of this case.

post of field officer on the basis of their existing appointment on
regular basis and they being          considered   as existing employees

contractual appointees already working with MPCB thus could not
have been considered for the post of appointment of field officer

contractual basis would have independently applied for such post in
response to the advertisement issued by MPCB and were also eligible

said post and not merely on the ground that they were already in

such appointments, instead of appointing them, MPCB selected
several candidates having no fulfilled eligibility criteria and were
not having requisite decrees required as one of the conditions for

No.3608 of 2010 and also other four petitions indicates that each of
the petitioners has           raised various grounds     in great detail with
particulars.      Be that as it may, the grounds raised in all the petitions
have to be considered and not only the grounds raised in the Writ
Petition No.3608 of 2010 in isolation when all the petitions were
heard together and are being disposed of by a common order. This
Court does not find any substance in this objection raised by the
learned senior counsel.

observed that a glaring illegality which has unfortunately not been
raised in these writ petitions, however since the same was self evident
from the decisions of this Court, the Court has to take note of such
circumstances while making appropriate directions in such matter.
The principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Anil
Kumar Gupta &amp; Ors. (supra) applies to the facts of this case. It is not
the case of the State Government            or MPCB      that they have not
followed and could not understand any of the grounds raised by the
petitioner in any of the petitions and thus are not in a position to deal
with such grounds being allegedly vague or without particulars. In
our view, since the grounds raised by the petitioner are ex facie
clear and supported by various judgments of the Supreme Court and
this Court, this Court has ample power to deal with such grounds in
these petitions which are substantial in nature and shows patent
illegality committed by MPCB in these matters.

<p id="p_202">144.            There is no substance in the submission made by the
learned senior counsel for MPCB             that the petitioner       cannot be
allowed to raise a ground that the MPCB has not appointed any
woman candidate since none of the women candidates has filed any
petition alleging such illegalities on the part of the MPCB.                   The
petitioner though not being woman can bring such illegalities to the
notice of this Court while pointing out other illegalities committed by
MPCB in conducting the selection process and making various
appointments to the post of field officers. This submission of the
learned senior counsel is devoid of merit and is accordingly rejected.

for the MPCB           that the MPCB           was required to appoint various
candidates in view of the directions given by the High Court in two
Public Interest Litigations is concerned, a perusal of the record and
the orders passed by the High Court indicates that out of large number
of appointments made by the MPCB, only 24 posts of field officers
were sanctioned by the State Government in compliance with the
orders passed by the High Court in those two writ petitions and thus
the MPCB cannot be allowed to take shelter of orders passed by this
Court in those two Public Interest Litigations for filling up large
number of posts illegally.            It is the case of the MPCB itself that out of
34 posts of field officers, 24 posts of field officers were sanctioned by
the MPCB in compliance with the orders passed by this Court in
those Public Interest Litigations.

<p id="p_205">146.            In so far as reliance placed on the report alleged to have
been submitted by M/s.Crisil recommending the filling up of the
vacancy or to make appointments is concerned, it is not in dispute
that though the said report was obtained in the year 2005, the same
was alleged to have been relied upon only in the meetings held on
25th February 2009 and 12th March 2009 which was much after the
issuance of advertisement and after receiving the applications in
response to the said advertisement from various candidates. The said
report thus could not have been considered for filling up of the
additional post in excess of the posts advertised by the MPCB.

provided that MPCB is empowered to relax the condition of the post
of the reserved category              and thus could have made additional
appointments is concerned, even if such condition was mentioned in
the advertisement, that would not empower the MPCB to commit

considered 30% reservation and under that quota, 20 women Field
Officers were selected, the MPCB could not produce any authentic
record before this Court. On the contrary, it is admitted in the
affidavit-in-reply that the roaster upto the year 2000 was not even
prepared and was under preparation. Having taken such stand in the
affidavit, the MPCB or the State Government cannot be allowed to
take a plea that           the appropriate     number of reserved category
candidates were appointed by the MPCB. Inaction on the part of the
MPCB in not preparing the roaster till 2000 itself was a serious
inaction and would clearly indicate that deserving reserved category
candidates were not appointed by the MPCB. There is no substance
in the submission of the learned senior counsel that Mr.Pantavane who
was allegedly a handicapped person was eligible candidate from
handicapped category and was rightly appointed in that category by
the MPCB.

obtained by the petitioner under the provisions of Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_58">Information
Act</a>, 2005 which document was not disputed by the MPCB or by the
State Government. Learned counsel for the petitioner pointed out
various discrepancies in the said mark memo of the field officers and
various patent illegalities           committed   therein       by the selection
committee. A perusal of those documents clearly indicates that the
interviews were alleged to have been held by the selection committee
between 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. in the slots of 9.00 a.m. to 11.00 a.m.
and 11.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m., 2.00 p.m. to 4.00 p.m. and 4.00 p.m. to

take a judicial notice that during that period, selection committee must
have taken a break for tea, refreshment and for lunch etc.                      Large

senior counsel could not justify as to how so many candidates could
be interviewed in a single day.
</p>

<p id="p_214">153.             The only submission of the learned senior counsel on this
issue was that it is not open to this Court to examine such issue in
writ petition and that the every wrong cannot be corrected and set
aside in a writ petition. In so far as the submissions of the learned
counsel appearing for some of the appointees that all the criteria
under those four categories were not to be considered when the actual
interview was taken but some of them were already considered earlier
such as scrutiny of documents and that the interview was not taken
only between 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. but continued on each day for 14
hours      i.e. between        9.00 a.m. to 11.00 p.m., no such record            is
produced by the MPCB or by any appointees before this Court.

did not take any such stand though filed various affidavits in these

illegalities alleged to have been committed by the MPCB and thus
selection cannot declared as illegal or cannot be set aside by this Court.
We are also not inclined to accept the submission of the learned
counsel for the appointees that some of the activities which were
considered at the stage of interview were already considered prior to
commencement of the interview or that the interview was held between
9.00 a.m. to 11.00 p.m. These two arguments advanced by the learned
counsel for the appointees are ex facie false, inconsistent and contrary

candidates by all the members of the selection committee is not a
crime and no conclusion can be drawn by this Court based on such

plea has been raised by the petitioner in this writ petition.                  He
however conceded that he is not able to explain as to why all the

these arguments made by the learned senior counsel for the MPCB is
made without any basis. It is not the case of the petitioner that the
selection committee had committed any crime by giving the same
marks to all the candidates in all the categories. The petitioner has
pointed out the patent fraud committed by the selection committee of
the MPCB while conducting the selection procedure. There is no
satisfactory explanation coming from MPCB. The arguments of the
MPCB that there is no crime committed by the selection committee or
that there is no actionable claim is irresponsible and deserves to be
rejected at the threshold.

could not have been given             the same marks by all the selection
committee members in different categories. It cannot be a matter of
coincidence that hundred of candidates are given the same marks by
five selection committee members in four categories. We are of the
considered opinion that the manner in which the selection process was
conducted by the selection committee appointed by MPCB and the
interviews were held including the number of candidates having been
interviewed       on each day and the pattern of marks would clearly
indicate that the MPCB had already pre-determined the names of the

perusal of this Court. Learned counsel fairly pointed out that the said
document was not forming part of these proceedings nor the same is
relied upon by MPCB in any of the affidavits or across the bar.
</p>

<p id="p_228">164.            A perusal of the said photocopy produced for perusal of
this Court by the learned counsel for the MPCB however indicates
that the said alleged chart was dated 26th October 2009 and was
signed by four persons. Out of those persons, one of the signatory was
the Law Officer of the MPCB. The interviews were almost over on 26 th
October 2009. All the selection committee members had not signed
the said alleged chart. This Court has also noticed that the said
document was allegedly signed            by Mr.Mahesh Pathak (Member
Secretary), Mr.Shyam Dhakate (Deputy Secretary) and Mr.Pramod
Jadhav (Special           Social Welfare Officer). Mr.Deshpande, learned
counsel informed that the said chart was also signed by Mr.D.T. Deole
who was not a member of the said selection committee out of five
selection committee members but was a Law Officer. He conceded
that the said alleged chart was not signed by other two selection
committee members. On close scrutiny of the said alleged document
produced by the MPCB from the compilation of documents of MPCB
not forming part of record, it is clear that there was overwriting on
page 527 of that compilation where the said so called chart was
inserted. The pagination on the said alleged chart was done by pencil.
The said chart though allegedly was dated 26 th October 2009 was
inserted in the said file after letter dated 6th November 2009.

</p><p id="p_230">165.             In our view, it is thus clear that the said so called chart
prescribing the marking pattern allegedly decided by the members of
the selection committee is a fraudulent document. Be that as it may,
the said alleged chart was not forming part of the record of MPCB
nor the same was brought to the notice of this Court by MPCB who
alone could be the custodian of the said document. A photocopy of
the said alleged chart was surprisingly            produced by some of
appointees. Be that as it may, the said chart was dated 26 th October
2009 when the interviews were almost over. No such marking pattern
could be decided by the selection committee after completion of
interviews or in any event, after commencement of interview without
framing of any guidelines by the State Government or by MPCB. Be
that as it may, the said alleged chart was not signed by all the five
committee members that was dated 26th October 2009 and was also
signed by the Law Officer who was not at all concerned with the
alleged marking patterns.
</p>

<p id="p_231">166.             A perusal of the said alleged document would also
conclusively prove that some of the selection committee members
have decided to allot identical marks to all the candidates who were to
be selected as predetermined by the selection committee of MPCB.
All the candidates having different qualifications could not have been
given       the same marks. Each candidates           may have different
personality, knowledge and qualification or can be given different
marks under General category. No satisfactory explanation has been
rendered either by the State Government or by MPCB or by appointees
to controvert the patent illegality and fraud committed by MPCB

<p id="p_232">167.            In so far as the submission of the learned senior counsel
for MPCB and the submission made by the learned counsel for the
appointees that even if this Court comes to the conclusion that there
was any       irregularities in the selection process         conducted by the
MPCB, this Court shall not quash the entire selection procedure and
shall not disturb the appointments of various candidates already made
and who are already in service for last several years is concerned, as
indicated aforesaid,          we are of the view that    the entire selection
procedure followed by the MPCB was totally illegal, fraudulent, in
violation of the conditions prescribed in the advertisement, in the
recruitment rules,         in various Government Resolutions referred to
aforesaid and also in violation of the principles of law laid down by
the Supreme Court and by this Court, the same thus deserves to be
quashed and set aside.

<p id="p_233">168.            Division Bench of this Court also made strong prima
facie observations about such illegalities committed by the MPCB and
had    observed that the Court was highly           disturbed to note that
responsible statutory body constituted under the provisions of the
Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_59">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 flouted various
mandatory procedure and went ahead to recruit more than                         100
candidates.      This Court also observed that          the    grounds raising
objection to the appointment prima facie appears to be substantial
and serious one. This Court also observed that the original file before
this Court at that time surprisingly did not contain document in

<p id="p_235">170.            It is not in dispute that this Court had passed several
orders in these writ petitions even at the threshold thereby directing
the petitioner to implead the appointees to the post of field officers
which appointments              were made on the basis of such selection
procedure and also directing the MPCB to inform each of them
about the pending procedure and that their appointments would be
subject to outcome of these petitions. Accordingly, all appointees were
put to the notice about these orders passed by this Court from time to
time and they continued to be in employment with full knowledge
of these orders.        None of the candidates appointed thus can claim

any equity on the ground               that they are already in the employment
for last more than 8 years and their appointments thus cannot be set
aside on that ground.

<p id="p_236">171.            In the aforesaid judgments, it is held by the Supreme
Court that recognition of power exercisable by the functionaries of the
State as a trust which will stand discharged only if the power is
exercised in public interest is an important milestone just as
recognition of the Court's power of judicial review to be wide enough
to strike at and annul any State action that is arbitrary, unguided,
whimsical, unfair or discriminatory.                 The Government and so also
all public bodies are trustees of the power vested in them. It is also
held by the Supreme Court in one of the aforesaid judgments that
illegal appointment of the selected candidates was at the cost of
claim of other genuine selected candidates whose cases could have
been considered if action                  had been taken     at appropriate time.
Supreme Court in such a situation directed the State of Haryana to
compensate by paying an amount of Rs.3 lakh within two months
and also deposit a sum of Rs.1 lakh with the Supreme Court
Mediation Centre.

<p id="p_237">172.            Supreme Court in the case of Khubh Ram Vs.Dalbir
Singh (supra) has set aside the appointment even after 20 years
having found the appointment totally illegal. Similar view is taken
by the Supreme Court                  in   the remaining judgments         referred to
aforesaid where the entire selection procedure came to be set aside
having held that the same was totally illegal. The principles of law

laid down by the Supreme Court in the aforesaid judgments would
squarely apply to the facts of this case.              In our view,         all the
appointees were illegally appointed and were put to the notice at the
threshold that their appointments were subject to outcome of these
petitions and having made strong prima facie observations cannot be
shown any equity by this Court by directing the State Government or
MPCB to regularize their appointments in the facts of this case.
However, we are not inclined to direct the employees who were
appointed pursuant to such illegal selection procedure to return the
salary and other benefits earned by these candidates from the date of
appointments till fresh selection procedure is adopted by the MPCB.
We are thus inclined to set aside              the entire selection procedure
conducted by the MPCB and all the appointments which were made of
various candidates pursuant to the said procedure which are the
subject matter of the aforesaid petitions. We are not inclined to direct
appointment of any of the petitioners to any of the posts fallen vacant
in view of this order setting aside the selection procedure.
</p>

<p id="p_238">173.            There is no dispute about the proposition of law laid
down by the Supreme Court in various judgments relied upon by
the respondents that a candidate having participated in selection
procedure cannot challenge the selection procedure. The petitioners
were however not expected to know the fraud and illegalities that
would be committed                after issuance of the advertisement by the
MPCB. Those judgments relied upon by the respondents would not
assist their case.
