<p id="p_1">                       (04.04.2017)

</p><p id="p_2">1.           This   intra-court    appeal     is   directed
against the order dated 6.3.2017 handed down
by the learned Single Judge in Writ Petition No.
13843/2016 whereby the petition preferred by
the     petitioners      (appellants        herein)    was
dismissed on the ground of non maintainability
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 2</span>

but    appellants       invoked       the     jurisdiction    of
learned Single Judge by challenging the order
dated 10.8.2016 passed by the respondent nos.
2 and 3 herein.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2. Relevant facts in short leading to the said
case are as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_4">3. Respondent no.1 is a registered Society
and the respondent nos. 2 and 3 are the Office
Bearers    of     the    said       Society    whereas       the
appellant no.1 is the registered Association for
the State of M.P. A notice was issued to show
cause why the election held on 31.8.2014 be
not declared as null and void. Reply to the said
show      cause      notice         was     submitted        and
thereafter      by   order      dated       10.8.2016,       the
respondent no.1 cancelled the affiliation of
appellant no.1 and also cancelled the election
and ad-hoc body was formed to look after
routine affairs of appellant no.1.                  It is an
admitted fact that after the said order the
respondents have appointed Returning Officer
and process of election is on.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4. Respondents filed their reply before the
learned Single Judge and raised preliminary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>

objection that the respondent no.1 is not the
State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_1">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution of India and as such the petition
was not maintainable. Learned Single Judge by
the order impugned sustained the objection and
dismissed the writ petition. Hence this intra-
Court appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5. We have heard the rival submissions at
length.     Perused      the       material   available    on
record.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6. Learned counsel for the appellant placed
reliance into the decisions of the Supreme
Court in the case of Board of Cricket Control
BoardVs      Cricket       Association         Bihar      and
others- (2015) 3 SCC 251. We find that the
Supreme Court held that the Board of Control
of BCCI is an Authority within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_2">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India and as
such amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High
Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India. A careful reading of the judgment shows
that   it   was   an     admitted      position    that   the
respondent        BCCI     does        discharge     several
important public functions and therefore it was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 4</span>

held to be an Authority within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_4">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7. On the other hand, learned counsel for the
respondents have cited several decisions. A few
of them are as under:
</p>
<p id="p_9">(1)     Pradeep       Kumar         Biswas     Vs.    Indian
Institute of Chemical Biology-2002 (5)SCC
</p><p id="p_10">111.

(2)       Federal       Bank        Vs.    Sagar   Thomas-
(2003) 10 SCC 733

(3) Balmer Lawire &amp; Company Vs. Pratha
Sarathi Sen Roy and others-(2013) 8 SCC
345 &amp;

(4)       K.K.      Saxena           Vs.     International
Commission-(2015) 4 SCC 670.
</p>
<p id="p_11">       In the case of Pradeep Kumar Biswas
(supra) it was held by the Supreme Court in
paragraphs 96, 97 and 100 as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "96. The terms instrumentality or agency of the
      State are not to b e found mentioned in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_5">Article 12</a> of
      the Constitution. Nevertheless they fall within the
      ken of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_6">Article 12</a> of the Constitutio n for the simple
      reason that if the State chooses to set up an
      instrumentality or agency and entr usts it with the
      same power, fu nction or acti on which would
      otherwise have been exercised or undertaken by
      itself, there is no reason why such instrumentality
      or agency should not be subject to the same
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             5</span>

constitutional and public law limit ati o ns as the State
would      have    been.      In    different     judicial
pronouncements, some of which we have reviewed,
any company, co rporation, society or any other
entity having a juridical existence if it has been
held to be an instrumentality or agency of the
State, i t has been so held only on having been
found to be an alt er ego, a d ouble or a proxy or a
limb or an offspring or a mini-incarnati on or a
vicarious creature or a surrogate and so on -- by
whatever name called -- of the Stat e. In short, the
material available must justify holding of the entity
wearing a m ask or a veil worn o nly legally and
outwar dly which o n piercing fails to obliterate the
true charac ter of t he State in disguise. Then it is an
instrumentality or agency of the St at e.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">  97. It is this basic and essential distinction
between an "instrumentality or agen cy" of the State
and "other author ities" which has to be borne in
mind. An authority must be an authority sui juris to
fall within the m eaning of the expression "other
authorities" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_7">Article 12.</a> A juridical entity,
though an authori ty, may also sati sfy the test of
being an instrumentality or agency of the State in
which event such authority may be held to be an
instrumentality or agency of the State but no t vice
versa.
</p>
<p id="p_13">  100. We may now examine the characteristics of
CSIR. On a care ful examination of the material
available c onsisting of the m emorandum of
association, rules and regulations and bye-laws of
the Society and i ts budget and st ate ment of receipts
and outgoings,       we proceed to record our
conclusions. The Government does not hold the
entire share capit al of CSIR. It is not owned by the
Government. Presently, the government funding is
about 70% and gr ant by the Government of India is
one out of five c ategories of avenues to derive its
funds. Receipts from other sources such as
research,   development,     consultat ion   activities,
monies received for specific project s and jobwork ,
assets of the society, gifts and donations are
permissible sources of funding of CSIR without any
prior    permission/consent/sanction       from      the
Government of India. Financial assistance from the
Government does not meet almost al l expenditure of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              6</span>

   CSIR and appare ntly it fluctuates too depending
   upon variation fro m its own sources of income. It
   does not enjoy any monopoly stat us, much less
   conferred or pro t ected by the Go vernment. The
   Governing Body does not con sist entirely of
   government nominees. The membership of the
   Society and the manning of its Go verning Body --
   both consist substanti ally of private individuals of
   eminence and independence who canno t be
   regarded as the hands and voice of the State. There
   is no provision in the rules or the bye-laws that the
   Government can issue such directives as it deems
   necessary to CSIR and the latter is bound t o c arry
   out the same. T he functions of CSIR cannot be
   regarded as g overnmental or of essential public
   importance or as closely related to governmental
   functions or being fundamental to the life of the
   people or duties and obligations t o the public at
   large. The functio ns entrusted to C SIR can as well
   be carried out by any private person or
   organiz ation. Historically, it was no t a depar tment
   of the Government which was transferred to CSIR.
   There was a Bo ard of Scientific and Industri al
   Research and an Industrial Research Utilisation
   Committee. CSIR was set up as a s ociety registered
   under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_8">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860 to
   coordinate and g enerally exercise administrative
   control over the two or ganiz atio ns which would
   tender their advice only to CSIR. T he membership
   of the Society and the Governing Body of the
   Council may be terminated by the President, not by
   the Government of India. The Go verning Body is
   headed by the Dir ector General of C SIR and no t by
   the President of the Society (i.e. the Prime
   Minister). Certainly the Board and the Committee,
   taken over by CSIR, did not disch arge any regal,
   governmental or sovereign functions. CSIR is not
   the offspring or the blood and bon es or the voice
   and hands of the Government. CSIR does not and
   cannot m ake law."
</p>
<p id="p_14">  In the case of Federal Bank (supra) it was
held by the Supreme Court in para 27 as
under:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 7</span>

<p id="p_15">      "27. Such private companies would normally not
   be amenable to t he writ jurisdictio n under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_9">Article
   226</a>     of   the   Constitution.     But   in   certain
   circumstances a writ may issue to such private
   bodies or persons as there may be statutes which
   need to be c ompli ed with by all con cerned including
   the private comp anies. For example, there are
   certain legislations like the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_10">Industrial Disputes Act</a>,
   the Minimum Wag es Act, the F act o ries Act or fo r
   maintaining pro p er environment, say the Air
   (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 or
   the Water (Prevention and Control o f <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Pollution) Act</a>,
   1974 etc. or statut es of the like nature which fasten
   certain duties and responsibilities statu torily upon
   such private bodie s which they are bound to c omply
   with. If they viol ate such a statut ory provision a
   writ would cert ainly be issued for compliance with
   those provisions. For instance, if a pr ivate employer
   dispenses with the service of its employee in
   violation of the provisions contained under the
   <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_13">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in innumerable cases the
   High Court interfered and has issued the writ to the
   private bo dies and the com panies in that reg ard.
   But the difficulty in issuing a writ m ay arise where
   there may not be any non-compliance with or
   violation of any s tatu tory pr ovision by the priv ate
   body. In that event a writ may no t b e issued at all.
   Other remedies, as may be availabl e, may have to
   be resorted to. "
</p>
<p id="p_16">  In the case of Balmer Lawire &amp; Company
(supra) it was held by the Supreme Court in
para-28 as under:-
</p>

</p>

<p id="p_18">  In the case of K.K. Saxena (Supra) it was
held by the Supreme Court in paragraphs-49,
50, 51 and 53 as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_19">       "49. There is yet another very significant aspect
   which needs to be highlighted at this juncture. Even
   if a body performi ng public duty is amenable to writ
   jurisdiction, all it s decisions are not subject t o
   judicial review, as already pointed o ut above. Only
   those decisions which have public element therein
   can be judici ally r eviewed under writ jurisdiction. In
   Praga To ols Corp n. v. C.A. Imanu al, as already
   discussed above, this Court held that the action
   challenged did no t have public element and w rit of
   mandamus could not be issued as the action was
   essentially of a pr ivate charac ter. T hat was a case
   where the employee concerned was seeking
   reinstatement to an office.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               9</span>


<p id="p_20">      50. We have also pointed ou t above that in Sak a
   Venkata Rao th is Court had observed that
   administrative law in India has been shaped on the
   lines of English law. There are a catena of
   judgments in English courts t aking same view,
   namely, contractu al and commercial obligations are
   enforceable only by ordinary ac tio n and no t by
   judicial review. <a href="/doc/117218345/" id="a_14">In R. (Hopley) v. Liverpool Health
   Authority</a> (unrepor ted)(30-7-2002), Justice Pitchford
   helpfully set out three things that had to be
   identified when considering whether a pu blic bo dy
   with statut ory powers was exercising a public
   function amenable to judicial review or a private
   function. They are : (i) whether the d efendant was a
   public body exercising statutory powers; (ii)
   whether the function being perf ormed in the
   exercise of those powers was a pub lic or a private
   one; and (iii) whether the defendant was
   performing a publ ic duty o wed to t he claimant in
   the particular circ umstances under consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_21">      51. Even in Andi Mukta Sadguru, which took a
   revolutionary turn and departure fr om the earlier
   views, this Court held that "any other authority"
   mentioned in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Article 226</a> is not confined to statutory
   authorities or inst rumentalities of th e State defined
   under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_16">Article 12</a> of the C onstit ution, it also
   emphasised that if the rights are purely of a private
   charac ter, no m andamus could issue.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      53. In the present case, though w e have held
   that ICID is not d ischarging any public duty, even
   otherwise, it is clear th at the impug ned action does
   not involve public law element and no "public l aw
   rights" have accr ued in favour of the appellant
   which are infringed. The service conditions of the
   appellant are not governed in the same manner as
   was the position in Andi Mukta Sadgu ru .
</p>

<p id="p_23">8. From       the     various     authorities       of       the
Supreme Court the following tests would be
applicable      for      determining         whether          a

<p id="p_24">  (i)      Whether the entire share capital is
           held by the Government.</p><pre id="pre_2">
  (ii)     Whether    the   corporation      enjoys
           monopoly   status conferred      by the
           State.
  (iii)    Whether     the  functions    of   the

</pre><p id="p_25">           functions or functions closely related
           thereto.
</p><p id="p_26">  (iv)     If a department of the Government has
           been transferred to the corporation.
</p><p id="p_27">  (v)      The volume of financial       assistance

  (ix)     A private institution does not become
           an   instrumentality   of    the   State
</pre><p id="p_31">           because of the mere fact that it has
           received recognition or affiliation from
           the State.

<p id="p_32">9.   On the parameter of above tests laid down by the
Supreme Court and in absence of relevant data and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                             11</span>

material, it cannot be held that respondent no.1 is an
Authority within the meaning or the ambit of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_17">Article 12</a>
of the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_33">10. Mere fact that it had received certain amounts
from the Government or Olympic Association does not
confer any right because those amounts were paid for
specific events not for the general functioning of
federation.   The dispute between the appellants and
the respondents is in-house dispute and in our
considered opinion does not partake the character of
an Authority within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_18">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution of India and as such the writ petition filed
by the appellants was rightly dismissed by the learned
Single Judge.
</p><p id="p_34">11. Moreover in a writ appeal, we do not sit as an
Appellate Authority over the order of Single Judge but
the object of writ appeal is to correct factual mistake if
any, committed by the learned Single Judge.
</p><p id="p_35">12. Thus we find no merit and substance in the
appeal. The same is accordingly dismissed summarily.
</p><p id="p_36">13. Ordered accordingly.
