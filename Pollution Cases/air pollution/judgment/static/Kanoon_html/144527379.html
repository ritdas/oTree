<p id="p_1">1.         The Applicant - Nashik Fly Ash Association claims to

be an Association working on issues related to the fly ash and

has filed this Application being aggrieved due to non-

implementation of MoEF Notifications, related to fly ash

utilization, issued from time to time. The Applicant claims

that the Respondents have individually and collectively failed

in effectively implementing these Notifications, resulting in

inadequate utilization of fly ash which has resulted into over

exploitation of natural top soil of earth, causing damages to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">(J) Appln.. No.16 of 2013                                            2</span>
 the environment. It is also pleaded that due to non-utilization

of fly ash for brick manufacturing, the traditional red bricks

are continued to be used and though there are norms for use

of fly ash, even for manufacturing of the red bricks, yet same

are not followed. The brick kilns manufacturing red bricks

are also polluting activities as they emit air pollutants.


</p><p id="p_2">2.                The Applicant submits that the Respondent 1 is

Ministry of Environment and Forest, Govt. of India which has

issued the Fly Ash notifications and is overall responsible for

protection of environment in the country. Respondent No.2

and 3 are operating Nashik Thermal Power Station which is

one of the major fly ash generator and needs to comply with

the provisions of fly ash Notifications issued from time to

time. Respondent 4 and 5 are responsible for urban

development activities in Nashik Municipal areas including

the regulating construction activities, where fly ash bricks

are required to be used as per the Notification. Respondent 6

is Collector, who is responsible for regulating the fly ash use

in brick manufacturing units. The Respondent No.7, i.e.

Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, (MPCB), has given

consent to operate to the Respondent Nos.2 and 3, under the

provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution)

Act</a> 1974 and the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control Pollution) Act</a>

1981, and has stipulated that the Respondent No. 3 shall

provide full-fledged mechanized arrangements for collection,

transportation, loading and unloading of fly ash generated

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">(J) Appln.. No.16 of 2013                                     3</span>
 from various activities in the premises and to achieve 100%

fly ash utilization on or before 31st March, 2013.


</p><p id="p_3">3.        The Applicant also submits that the Chief Engineer,

Public Works Department (PWD), Nasik Region, vide

circulation dated 20th May, 2000, has clearly instructed that

from 1st July, 2000, onwards while constructing the Govt.

buildings use of fly ash bricks has been made mandatory in

the limits of Nasik, Bhusaval, Jalgaon Municipal areas and

within radius of 50 kms from these limits. It is the case of

Applicant that in spite of such clear directions issued under

the fly ash notification, the construction activities in Nashik

area are undertaken without mandatory use of fly ash bricks,

and the Respondents are not regulating these activities for

the compliance of the Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">4.              The Applicant submits that the MoEF Notification

dated 3rd November, 2009, in <a href="/doc/181903687/" id="a_3">Section 11</a> (1) (ii) stipulates that

at least 20% dry ESP fly ash should be made available free of

charge to the Units manufacturing fly ash or clay-fly ash

bricks, blocks and tiles etc. on priority basis over other users.

If demand from such Agencies fall short of 20% of quantity,

the balance quantity can be sold or disposed of by the Power

Station, as may be possible. The Applicant submits that in

spite of such mandatory provisions, the Respondent Nos.2

and 3, have not adhered to the stipulated norms and are not

complying with the obligations stipulated in the fly ash

Notifications, particularly making at least 20% of dry ESP fly

 ash available to the Units manufacturing fly ash or clay-fly

ash bricks, blocks and tiles on priority basis. The Applicant

further submits that even the traditional brick kilns which

are operational in the area, are also not using fly ash as per

fly ash Notifications and the concerned Authority - the

Collector has failed to take any action against these red brick

manufacturing Units.

not been filed with clear hands. It is submitted that as per fly

ash Notification of 2009, the thermal power stations are free

to sale 80% dry ESP fly ash and at least 20% fly ash should

be provided to the brick kilns manufacturers. It further

mentions              that       the   Respondent   No.2   published    an

advertisement on 31st March 2013, for distribution of 20% of

fly ash on free basis to the brick kilns and other users, as per

the Notification. This advertisement was cancelled in view of

policy decision of the Respondent No.2, dated 14 th October

2013 and fresh advertisement was published on 27.10.2013.

Respondent 3 further issued advertisement on 3rd May, 2013

for sale/disposal of balance 80% dry ESP fly ash. Applicant,

on 19th January 2014, and submit that the Respondent No.3,

has published advertisement dated 27th October, 2013 for

distribution of 20% ESP fly ash on free basis and after due

scrutiny, total 29 successful applicants were issued orders

dated 10th December 2013 to lift total 20% dry ESP fly ash,

including M/s Trimurti Industries, in which the Applicant is

a partner. The affidavit further goes on to submit that various

initiatives are taken by the Respondents to increase fly ash

utilization. It is further submitted that the Respondent Nos.

2 and 3 are acting as per the directions given vide MoEF vide

various Notifications for utilization of fly ash and as such,

any decision regarding utilization of fly ash and its

management is policy decision and as such, it would not be

proper for this Tribunal to interfere in the same.


</p><p id="p_19">10.            Shri. Kulkarni, learned Advocate for the Respondent

Nos. 2 and 3 vehemently argued the matter and highlighted

that fly ash management at a coal fired thermal power station

is a complex and skilled job and the Respondent Nos. 2 and

3 are efficiently performing their duties as per the fly ash

notification. He admits that before last ten (10) years, the fly

ash utilization was not a priority issue and most of thermal

power stations were storing fly ash in the ash ponds as a final

disposal method. However, since the fly ash notification of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">(J) Appln.. No.16 of 2013                                        8</span>
 1999, thermal power plants have started prioritizing of fly

ash utilization which in fact helped the power station to

reduce the fly ash storage and also, the area for such storage

within the power plant complex and also, generated a new

source of revenue for the power plants. He mentioned that

with the increased awareness about beneficial use of fly ash

in various ways like fly ash bricks, clay-fly ash bricks, fly ash

construction products, use in cement manufacturing,

embankments/land-filling etc., the demand of fly ash has

increased significantly and therefore, the MoEF has amended

the notification keeping in view increased use of fly ash and

also, difficulties and constraints faced by thermal power

stations, through amendments of 2003 and 2009. He further

argued that Nashik Thermal Power Plant is under the

Maharashtra                 State   Power   Generation   Co.   Ltd.

(MAHAGENCO) and Mahagenco has taken a policy decision

regarding 20% fly ash allocation to the units manufacturing

fly ash or clay-fly ash bricks, blocks and tiles at thermal

plants of Mahagenco on 14th October, 2013, which are

comprehensive and self-explanatory. The Mahagenco has

laid down a procedure for allotment of 20% fly ash allocation

to these units on free basis, following certain due diligence,

as envisaged in the notification itself. He further submits the

ash generated and utilization of data of Nashik Thermal

Power Station for the year 2013, which is as under:

No.12295 of 2011 and M.P.No.1 of 2011, regarding providing
fly ash on free basis to various units as stipulated in the
notification. He referred to paragraph 30 of said Judgment
which is as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">             " 30. Similarly, fly ash, which can be equated to
              a by-product in the process of generation of

              company. While what can be curtailed by the
              Ministry of Environment and Forests is the
              discharge of that pollutant into the atmosphere,

 the partners in a proprietary firm, called "Ash king

Enterprises", who have also submitted the bid for fly ash

generated at the Respondent No.3 unit. However, he failed in

bidding in the said bid. He further argued that tender notice

dated 3rd May, 2013, was related to the sale/disposal of 80%

of fly ash. Subsequently, the Respondent No.3, has published

advertisement on 27.10.2013 for distribution of 20% ESP dry

fly ash to the eligible manufacturers as per the notification.

In this tender process, the Respondent No.3, has also issued

orders to 29 successful Applicants for lifting 20% ESP dry fly

ash including M/s Trimurti Industries, in which the

Applicant is a partner. The Applicant has already paid

security deposit and has started lifting of fly ash as per the

tender conditions. The Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 further

submit that they had taken all the necessary pro-active steps

for increasing utilization of fly ash and had contacted the

potential users, as well as the Govt. Agencies for increased

utilization of fly ash. The learned Counsel for Respondent

Nos.2 and 3, therefore submits that they have complied with

</p><p id="p_31"> 16.            We may first proceed with summarization of the

important aspects of fly ash                  notifications for better

understanding of the dispute raised in the Application. Fly

ash, which causes enormous amount of air pollution and

which is considered to be hazardous to the environment, is

generated in huge quantity by coal or lignite based thermal

power plants. In order to reduce the impact of fly ash on the

environment, the Government of India issued a Notification

dated 14.9.1999, in exercise of the powers conferred by Sub-

Section (1) read with Clause (v) of Sub-Section (2) of <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_5">Section

3</a> and <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_6">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

<p id="p_34">18.            The          first part of the Notification imposed a

prohibition upon any person carrying on the activity of

manufacturing clay bricks or tiles or blocks for use in

construction activities, without mixing at least 25% of fly ash,

if the activity is carried on within the radius of 50 km from

the thermal power stations. The second part of the Final

Notification contains direction to every coal or lignite based

thermal power plant to make available ash for at least ten

 (10) years from the date of publication of the Notification

without any payment or any other consideration, for the

purpose of manufacturing ash based products. The third part

relates to promotion of utilization of fly ash products.


</p><p id="p_35">19.            Subsequently, the Central Government issued an

amendment to the above Notification by yet another

Notification dated 27.8.2003. By the said Notification, a

mandate was issued to all construction agencies engaged in

the construction of buildings within a radius of 50- 100 kms

from a coal or lignite based thermal power plant, to use fly

ash bricks or blocks or tiles or clay fly ash bricks, etc.,

subject to a minimum percentage mentioned in the order

itself. The Amendment Notification preserved intact, the

obligation of coal or lignite based thermal power plants to

make available ash, for the purpose of manufacturing ash

based products for any construction activity. Additionally,

the amended Notification stated that the thermal power

plants have to ensure availability of fair quantity of ash to

each user, including brick kilns.

<p id="p_38">21.            We have gone through various provisions of fly ash

notifications related to the enforcement and monitoring

aspects. Notification dated September 14th, 1999, stipulates

that "the Authority for ensuring the use of satisfied quantity of

ash, shall be the concerned Regional Officer of the State

Pollution Control Board or, the Pollution Control Committee", as

the case may be. It further stipulates that the action plans

prepared by coal or lignite based thermal power plants

annual implementation report, shall be submitted to the

Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), concerned State

Pollution Control Board/Committee and the concerned

Regional office of the MoEF. In the amended              Notification

2009, paragraph 2(II), has been inserted, which stipulates

that "the concerned State Government or Union Territory,

shall be enforcing and monitoring Authority for ensuring

compliance of the provisions of sub para (8) (i) and (a) (ii).

However, it is noted that the para 8, mainly relates to use of

fly ash for stowing of mines and backfilling of open-cast

mines. The Notification further in paragraph 3 (7) has

provision            for    constitution   of   State   Level   Monitoring

Committee for monitoring and facilitating implementation of

carve         out           and   identify    the    Agency    responsible   for

enforcement of fly ash utilization at the thermal power plant

level, though the enforcement Authorities have been defined

at the demand side of fly ash utilization i.e. brick kilns,

mines, fly ash construction products etc. However, the

enforcement Agency at the fly ash generation side for the

effective fly ash utilization, is not clearly defined and,

therefore, we posed this query to the learned Counsel during

the hearing. No clear provision was brought to our notice

which identify the enforcement agency for implementation of

this Notification. In view of this, we are of the considered view

that as this Notification has been issued under provisions of

the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_7">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, the Authorities

responsible for enforcement of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_8">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,

1986, are responsible for enforcement of said Notification

and therefore, the MoEF, CPCB and MPCB, are responsible

Authorities for enforcement of fly ash Notification, as far as

the generation of fly ash and its effective utilization is

concerned. However, we find hardly any efforts or actions

which have been taken either by MoEF or SPCB for effective

enforcement of the Notification.

heads (a) Dry ESP Fly Ash and (b) Pond ash, which is relevant

as utilization patterns have been defined and stipulated

under these two categories vide the said Notification.

However, data submitted by MPCB, surprisingly shows fly

ash generation of two categories, namely, pulverized fly ash

and pond ash. We are not sure about the source and nature

of the pulverized fly ash mentioned in MPCB record. It is,

therefore, necessary that thermal power stations, shall

maintain record of fly ash generation and its utilization as

per categories mentioned in the Notification for effective

enforcement and compliance of the Notification. Apparently,

it is not clearly established that the Respondent No.3, is

providing 20% of dry ESP fly ash on cost free basis to the

</p><p id="p_49">28.            The other areas where fly ash is required to be

utilized is brick kilns, clay-fly ash brick kilns and also the

construction products. There is no document placed on

record by any of the enforcement Agencies i.e. MPCB,

Collector and MoEF to demonstrate that any due diligence or

measures are taken by these agencies for enforcing

provisions of fly ash Notification, than mere mentioning fly

ash utilization in the license/permits issued by them. The

affidavit of District Mining Officer clearly shows that there are

significant variations in the permits granted by the Revenue

Department to the brick kiln owners. In some cases, fly ash

utilization is stipulated while in many cases it is not even

mentioned. Also in many cases, permits/licenses have not

been issued, though the traditional clay brick kilns are

reported to be in operation. It is also noted that there is no

record available regarding number of cases recommended by

SPCB for cancellation of leases on account of non-use of fly

ash and also, any instance whether the Collector or

Municipal Corporation has enforced the use of fly ash bricks

and products in the construction activities in their area. It

goes to indicate lack of seriousness, apathy and negligence

on the part of all these enforcement Agencies in enforcing and

regulating utilization of fly ash at demand site i.e. use in

therefore we record finding on Issue No.2 in the 'Negative'.


</p><p id="p_50">29.            We may now switch over to examine merits of factual

contentions advanced on behalf of the Respondent Nos.2 and

3, as well as submission pertaining to applicability of

decision of Hon'ble Madras High Court. The contention of the

Respondent Nos.2 and 3, is that distribution of fly ash is

being done, in accordance with the MoEF Notification dated

3rd November 2009. It is argued that market demand and

supply of bricks is variable, in accordance with the

construction activities. Therefore, it is contended that the

prayer Clause (C) indicated in the Application is illogical and

hypothetical. Further, it is argued that since dry fly ash is

commercially valuable product and can generate revenue,

the directions were amended by permitting Thermal Power

Plants to sell dry fly ash with rider to provide "at least" free

of cost fly ash to the extent of 20%. It is argued, therefore,

that it is discretion of the Respondent No.2 and 3 to decide

as to how much they intend to give free of cost quantity of fly

ash and to what extent revenue is required to be generated

through sale of fly ash. According to the Respondent Nos.2

and 3, such sale of cost free fly ash is the policy decision and

the word "at least", as used in the Notification in question, is

being wrongly interpreted by the Applicant. It is vehemently

argued that the Respondent Nos.2 and 3, are the owners of

fly ash generated from power plant and, therefore, have

 Authority to decide as to how much quantity they shall

distribute free of cost, when stock of fly ash is to be sold. The

Respondent Nos.2 and 3, even went to the extent of saying

that the Central Government, has exceeded its powers while

giving directions to provide fly ash free of cost, to the brick

manufacturers under the MoEF Notification.

interpreted Section 8 of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales

 purpose of interpretation. Andhra Pradesh High Court, held

that though exemption provided under <a href="/doc/136374950/" id="a_18">Section 8</a>, read with

entry 7, of 4th Schedule of Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax

Act, 1957, was applicable to Tobacco, oil and Tobacco cake,

being forms of Tobacco, yet "Tobacco seed" was not Tobacco

and that only leaf, stalks and stems of Tobacco plants could

be said to be "Tobacco", within meaning of its definition. This

view was confirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The

entire interpretative angle in the given case, depended upon

use of expression "any form of Tobacco", which "Tobacco

seed" of course did not qualify for under the Fiscal Statute.

In that case, there was no question of applying interpretation

by taking into account "inclusive definition" as such. As a

matter of fact, Hon'ble Supreme Court, took into account

intention of Legislature while using the said expression

"Tobacco or any form of Tobacco" in the local <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_19">Sales Tax Act</a>.

At one place, in paragraph 11, Hon'ble Supreme Court, has

observed that:

                 expression means as well as what it includes, is
                 exhaustive. Tobacco seed does not come within
                 the first part of the definition, for the expression
                 "tobacco, cured or uncured, manufactured or
                 unmanufactured" has to be read as a whole and
                 will not take in tobacco seed. It will not come under
                 the second part because it specifically mentions
                 leaves, stalks and stems but leaves out seeds.
                 Since tobacco seeds do not fall within the
                 definition, the oil and cake produced by the
                 crushing of the seeds will not also be covered by
                 the definition or eligible for the consequent
                 exemption."</blockquote><p id="p_55">

</p><p id="p_56">               From above observations, it is amply clear that

interpretation of such expression depends on intention of

Legislature. As stated earlier, in view of the fact that use of

the words "shall have jurisdiction over all civil cases, where

substantial question relating to environment" will encompass

within          its     fold   all   types   of   civil   matters   in   which

environmental issues of substantial nature, are involved.

Obviously, we deem it proper to reject the contention of

Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 that NGT, has no jurisdiction to

deal with issues raked up in the present Application.


</p><p id="p_57">33.            Coming to the case of "M/s Tamil Nadu Power

Generation &amp; Distribution Corporation Ltd vs Union of India &amp;

Ors" (Supra), we may pinpoint that the issue involved in that

case was of different nature . The MoEF by its order dated

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">(J) Appln.. No.16 of 2013                                                   25</span>
 March 18th, 2011, held that any collection of service charges

by the Power Generation Plant, would amount to collection of

cost and, therefore, would constitute violation of the relevant

Notification. The Ministry also observed that expenditure and

freight handling of coal etc., are all part of the regular

expenses in the operation and that they are factored into cost

of power supply to the customers. Therefore, the Power

Generation                  and   Distribution   Corporation   Ltd.,   was

prohibited from recovering collection of service taxes, directly

from Traders/Associations as per the MoEF Notification

dated September 14th,1999. The said order of MoEF, was

held bad in law, by the learned Single Judge of the Hon'ble

Madras High Court. The issue involved in the present case is

not akin to the issue raised before the learned Single Judge

of the Hon'ble Madras High Court. Apart from that, nobody

has come forwarded to claim any cost from the Applicant

under any order of MoEF nor such order is subject matter of

challenge before us. The learned Single Judge of Hon'ble

Madras High Court, had not quashed relevant MoEF

Notification dated November 3rd, 2009. We may make it clear

that legality of said Notification, is not subject matter of

challenge before us and, therefore, such issue cannot be

subject matter of decision in the present Application.


</p><p id="p_58">34.            Learned Advocate for the Applicant, however,

vehemently argued that said Judgment of Hon'ble Madras

High Court will be binding on this Tribunal, for the reason

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">(J) Appln.. No.16 of 2013                                               26</span>
 that it is a Judgment rendered in the exercise of Writ

Jurisdiction and will have binding effect. He contended that

views of Madras High Court, cannot be brushed aside, only

because NGT, is not administratively subordinate to the

supervisory jurisdiction of that High Court. Reliance is

placed on the observations in case of "<a href="/doc/1522103/" id="a_20">Commissioner of Income

Tax vs Godavaridevi Saraf</a>" 1978 (2) ELT 624 Bom. We have

carefully gone through the observations of the Hon'ble High

Court in the given case. What is observed in the given case,

is that the Tribunal constituted under the same Act, has no

jurisdiction to go into the question of constitutionality of the

provisions of that statute. In the said case, provision of the

<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_21">Income Tax Act</a>, was held as unconstitutional, as being

violative of <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_22">Article 19(1) (f)</a> of the Constitution and, therefore

such decision of Madras High Court, it was held could not be

overlooked, by the Income Tax Tribunal, inasmuch as that

provision itself did not exist. This authority has no bearing

on the issue involved in the present case. In our opinion, the

decision of Hon'ble High Court, may have binding effect, if it

is rendered in the same case, in its Writ Jurisdiction. Else,

there is certain gray area, which needs to be legally

expounded at appropriate time. In any case, the Judgment of

learned Single judge of Madras High Court, has no bearing

on the issue involved in the present case and, therefore, we

are not bound to hold that supply of 20% free ash, as per the
