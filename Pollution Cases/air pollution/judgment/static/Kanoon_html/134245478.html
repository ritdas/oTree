<p id="p_3">30/07/2018

           The present petition has been filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a>

Cr.P.C. seeking quashing of Complaint alongwith all proceedings

arising out of Criminal Case No. 1013/2015 titled <a href="/doc/1875748/" id="a_2">State of

Rajasthan vs. M/s. Inven Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>.,

pending in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kota City, Kota.
</p>
<p id="p_4">           Inven Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. are manufacturers of

various drugs.
</p><p id="p_5">                                     (2 of 8)              [CRLMP-4276/2018]



            On 28.2.2011, Drug Control Officer, Kota seized sample

of Injection Entigyl. On the said injection, manufacturing date was

given as December, 2010 and expiry date as November, 2012. The

drug carrying name/brand as Entigyl contained Metronidazole and

Sodium Chloride. As per the certificate of test or analysis by

Government Analyst, under <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_3">Section 25(1)</a> of the Drugs Act, 1940,

the sample was declared of not standard quality because it did not

conform to IP (Indian Pharmacopoeia) standard and it contained

Bacterial Endotoxins.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            Mr. A.K. Sharma, learned Senior Counsel assisted by

Mr. Rachit Sharma appearing for the petitioners has firstly

contended that under rule 46 of Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1940,

Government Analyst is bound to disclose the test and method of

analysis prescribed, and whether same is in consonance with India

Pharmacopoeia or not and whether requisite protocol was followed

or not.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            From the perusal of the report, which is given in FORM

13 in consonance with rule 46 of Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1940

(hereinafter called 'Rules'), it is evident that as per Indian

Pharmacopoeia, test prescribed is called 'Bacterial Endotoxins

Test'. Therefore, the method of analysis has been given in report

as "Bacterial Endotoxins Test". Therefore, there is no breach of

rule 46 of the 'Rules'.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            Secondly, the learned counsel for the petitioners has

submitted that if the sample has been declared as sub-standard, it

will not amount to adulterated drug and therefore, in the

complaint    wrongly      section   qua    adulterated   drug   has   been

mentioned.
</p><p id="p_9">                                   (3 of 8)               [CRLMP-4276/2018]



           Merely on this ground, the entire complaint cannot be

quashed. The petitioners will have the opportunity to argue at the

time of consideration of charges and at that stage while

formulating charge, the court may not frame a charge qua offence

which is not made out.
</p>
<p id="p_10">           Lastly, the learned counsel for the petitioners has

contended that Smt. Manju Patni is lady and she is not in-charge

of, and is not responsible to the conduct of the business of the

company. It is further submitted that so far petitioner no.2 L.C.
</p>
<p id="p_11">Patni is concerned, he is Chief Managing Director, whereas Smt.

Manju Patni is Managing Director of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_12">           In the present petition in Para-3 following averment has

been made:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "3. That it may be relevant to state here that the petitioner
     company is a Private Limited company incorporated under the
     <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_4">Companies Act</a>. Petitioner No.2 was Chief Managing Director of
     the petitioner company and petitioner No.3 happens to be the
     wife of petitioner No.2 and was Managing Director in the

     company at the relevant time."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           The learned counsel for the petitioners has relied upon

<a href="/doc/60342456/" id="a_5">State of Haryana vs. Brij Lal Mittal &amp; Ors</a>, reported as AIR

1998 SC 2327 to contend that Chief Managing Director and

Managing Director cannot be prosecuted. The judgment relied was

rendered in appeal against acquittal. Section 34 of India Drugs

and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_6">Cosmetics Act</a>, 1940 (hereinafter called 'Act') reads as under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     "34. Offences by companies.--

     company, every person who at the time the offence was
     committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to the
     company for the conduct of the business of the company, as
     well as the company shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence
     and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished
                                    (4 of 8)                [CRLMP-4276/2018]

     accordingly: Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section
     shall render any such person liable to any punishment provided
     in this Act if he proves that the offence was committed without
     his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent
     the commission of such offence.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1),
     where an offence under this Act has been committed by a
     company and it is proved that the offence has been committed
     with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to any
     neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other
     officer of the company, such director, manager, secretary or
     other officer shall also be deemed to be guilty of that offence
     and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished

     accordingly."

<p id="p_13">Furthermore, <a href="/doc/1253931/" id="a_9">Section 34(2)</a> in its sweep make Chief Managing

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">     "19. This takes us to the next question under Sub-section (1) of
     <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_12">Section 141</a>, as to (i) who are the persons who are responsible to
     the company for the conduct of the business of the company, and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     (ii) who could be said to be in charge and was responsible to the
     company for the conduct of the business of the company. The
     words "every person who, at the time of the offence was
     committed, was in charge of, and was responsible for the conduct
     of the business of the company" occurs not only in <a href="/doc/1819235/" id="a_13">Section 141(1)</a>
     of the Act but in several enactments dealing with offences by
     companies, to mention a few - <a href="/doc/1417100/" id="a_14">Section 278B</a> of the Income Tax
     Act, 1961, <a href="/doc/1893901/" id="a_15">Section 22C</a> of Minimum Wages Act, 1948, <a href="/doc/259762/" id="a_16">Section 86A</a>
     of the Employees State Insurance Act, 1948, <a href="/doc/7754/" id="a_17">Section 14A</a> of
     Employees Provident Fund and <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_18">Miscellaneous Provisions Act</a>, 1952,
     <a href="/doc/183371/" id="a_19">Section 29</a> of Payment of Bonus Act, 1965, <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_20">Section 40</a> of The Air
     (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_21">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and <a href="/doc/185025414/" id="a_22">Section 47</a> of
                                   (5 of 8)                     [CRLMP-4276/2018]

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_23">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. But neither
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_24">Section 141(1)</a> of the Act, nor the pari materia provisions in other
enactments give any indication as to who are the persons
responsible to the company, for the conduct of the business of the
company. Therefore, we will have to fall back upon the provisions
of <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_25">Companies Act</a>, 1956 which is the law relating to and regulating
companies.
</blockquote><p id="p_16">20. <a href="/doc/1202543/" id="a_26">Section 291</a> of the said Act provides that subject to the
provisions of that Act, the Board of Directors of a company shall be
entitled to exercise all such powers, and to do all such acts and
things, as the company is authorised to exercise and do. A
company though a legal entity can act only through its Board of
Directors. The settled position is that a Managing Director is
prima facie in charge of and responsible for the company's
business and affairs and can be prosecuted for offences by
the company (Empasis Supplied). But insofar as other directors
are concerned, they can be prosecuted only if they were in charge
of and responsible for the conduct of the company's business.
</p>
<p id="p_17">21. A combined reading of <a href="/doc/1230543/" id="a_27">Sections 5</a> and <a href="/doc/1202543/" id="a_28">291</a> of Companies Act,
1956 with the definitions in clauses (24), (26), (30), (31), (45) of
<a href="/doc/1455010/" id="a_29">Section 2</a> of that Act would show that the following persons are
considered to be the persons who are responsible to the company
for the conduct of the business of the company :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">    (a) the managing director/s;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">    (b) the whole-time director/s;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">    (c) the manager;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">    (d) the secretary;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">    (e) any person in accordance with whose directions or
    instructions   the   Board   of   directors    of   the   company   is
    accustomed to act;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">    (f) any person charged by the Board with the responsibility of
    complying with that provision (and who has given his consent
    in that behalf to the Board); and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">    (g) where any company does not have any of the officers
    specified in clauses (a) to (c), any director or directors who
    may be specified by the Board in this behalf or where no
    director is so specified, all the directors.
</blockquote><p id="p_18">It follows that other employees of the company, cannot be said to
be persons who are responsible to the company, for the conduct of
the business of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_19">22. <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_30">Section 141</a> uses the words "was in charge of, and was
responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the
                                   (6 of 8)                [CRLMP-4276/2018]

company" (Emphasis Supplied). It is evident that a person who can
be made vicariously liable under Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_31">Section 141</a> is
a person who is responsible to the company for the conduct of the
business of the company and in addition is also in charge of the
business of the company. There may be many directors and
secretaries who are not in charge of the business of the company
at all. The meaning of the words "person in charge of the business
of the company" was considered by this Court in <a href="/doc/50504/" id="a_32">Girdhari Lal Gupta
v. D.H. Mehta</a> followed in <a href="/doc/443284/" id="a_33">State of Karnataka v. Pratap Chand</a> and
Katta Sujatha v. Fertiliser &amp; Chemicals Travancore Ltd. This Court
held that the words refer to a person who is in overall control of
the day to day business of the company. This Court pointed out
that a person may be a director and thus belongs to the group of
persons making the policy followed by the company, but yet may
not be in charge of the business of the company; that a person
may be a Manager who is in charge of the business but may not be
in overall charge of the business; and that a person may be an
officer who may be in charge of only some part of the business.
</p>
<p id="p_20">23. Therefore, if a person does not meet the first requirement, that
is being a person who is responsible to the company for the
conduct of the business of the company, neither the question of his
meeting the second requirement (being a person in charge of the
business of the company), nor the question of such person being
liable under Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_34">Section 141</a> arises. To put it
differently, to be vicariously liable under Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_35">Section
141</a>, a person should fulfill the 'legal requirement' of being a
person in law (under the statute governing companies) responsible
to the company for the conduct of the business of the company
and also fulfill the 'factual requirement' of being a person in charge
of the business of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_21">24. Therefore, the averment in a complaint that an accused is a
director and that he is in charge of and is responsible to the
company for the conduct of the business of the company, duly
affirmed in the sworn statement, may be sufficient for the purpose
of issuing summons to him. But if the accused is not one of the
persons who falls under the category of 'persons who are
responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the
company' (listed in para 21 above), then merely by stating that 'he
was in charge of the business of the company' or by stating that
'he was in charge of the day to day management of the company'
or by stating that he was in charge of, and was responsible to the
company for the conduct of the business of the company', he
cannot be made vicariously liable under <a href="/doc/1819235/" id="a_36">Section 141(1)</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_22">                                     (7 of 8)                       [CRLMP-4276/2018]

</p><p id="p_23">25. It should, however, be kept in view that even an officer who
was not in charge of and was responsible to the company for the
conduct of the business of the company can be made liable under
Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_37">Section 141</a>. For making a person liable under
<a href="/doc/945233/" id="a_38">Section 141(2)</a>, the mechanical repetition of the requirements
under Section141(1) will be of no assistance, but there should be
necessary averments in the complaint as to how and in what
manner the accused was guilty of consent and connivance or
negligence and therefore, responsible under Sub-section (2) of
<a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_39">Section 141</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_24">26. Another aspect that requires to be noticed is that only a
Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer can be made liable
under Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_40">Section 141</a>. But under Sub-section (1) of
<a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_41">Section 141</a>, it is theoretically possible to make even a person who
is not a director or officer, liable, as for example, a person falling
under categories (e) and (f) of <a href="/doc/1230543/" id="a_42">Section 5</a> of Companies Act, 1956.
When in SMS Pharma (I), this Court observed that

         '10....conversely,    a   person   not    holding     any    office   or
         designation in a company may be liable if he satisfies the
         requirement of being in charge of and responsible for

<p id="p_26">27. The position under <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_44">Section 141</a> of the Act can be summarized
thus :

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">         (i) If the accused is the Managing Director or a Joint
         Managing Director, it is not necessary to make an
         averment in the complaint that he is in charge of, and
         is responsible to the company, for the conduct of the
         business     of   the   company.       It   is   sufficient   if    an
         averment is made that the accused was the Managing
         Director or Joint Managing Director at the relevant
         time. This is because the prefix `Managing' to the
         word `Director' makes it clear that they were in
         charge of and are responsible to the company, for the
         conduct of the business of the company (Emphasis
         Supplied).

         who signed the cheque on behalf of the company, there is
         no need to make a specific averment that he was in charge
         of and was responsible to the company, for the conduct of
         the business of the company or make any specific allegation
         about consent, connivance or negligence. The very fact that
         the dishonoured cheque was signed by him on behalf of the
                                                                       (8 of 8)                 [CRLMP-4276/2018]

                                              company, would give rise to responsibility under Sub-section
