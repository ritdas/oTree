&gt;Head Note: 

?Cases Referred: 

THE HONBLE SRI JUSTICE M.SEETHARAMA MURTI           

WRIT PETITION No.8203 of 2011   

ORDER:  
</pre>        
<p id="p_1">      The relief sought for by the writ petitioner in this writ petition is to
declare that the levy and the collection of the sewerage cess by the
respondents in the monthly bill of the petitioners unit is illegal, arbitrary
and contrary to the provisions of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water
Supply and Sewerage Act, 1989 (the Act, for brevity).
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.      I have heard the submissions of the learned counsel for the writ
petitioner and the learned standing counsel appearing for the 1st
respondent-HMWS &amp; SB.  I have perused the material record. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.      The learned counsel for the writ petitioner would submit that since
the first respondent had not laid any sewerage line to the premises of the
petitioners unit and as the petitioners premises is not directly connected
to any sewerage system of the first respondent, the respondents are not
entitled to collect the sewerage cess from the petitioner; the petitioner is
carrying the effluents from its unit by tankers to Patancheru Enviro-Tech
Limited (PETL, for brevity) for further treatment and discharge of the
effluents; the first respondent is collecting sewerage cess from PETL as
per the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding dated 03.08.2002  
between the PETL and the first respondent; under a separate agreement
dated 11.10.2011 with PETL, the petitioner is paying charges that are
being levied by PETL; therefore, consequential collection of sewerage cess
from the petitioners unit by the respondents would amount to double
taxation.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.      The learned standing counsel for the first respondent would
submit that whether directly or indirectly, when the effluents are being
let out into the sewerage lines of the 1st respondent Board, the Board is
entitled to levy and collect the sewerage cess and that in the case on
hand, the petitioner-company is carrying its effluents to PETL by tankers
and that PETL is treating the effluents to certain level, and that such
partly treated effluents are being let out by PETL into the sewerage
system of the first respondent Board for carrying the same to the plant of
the first respondent Board at Amberpet and that the PETL, before letting
out the effluents into the main sewerage system of the respondent Board,
would treat the effluents to bring down the contents of the effluents to
some tolerable limits and that the plant of the first respondent Board at
Amberpet is further treating the effluents so as to bring down the
industrial effluents to the permissible limits and that the cess is being
collected not only for using the sewerage lines but also for defraying the
capital cost of the sewerage and sewerage treatment work being
undertaken by the Board and for the operation and maintenance of the
sewerage system from time to time and that therefore, the Board is
justified in levying and collecting the sewerage cess on the petitioners
unit.  He would further submit that the subject matter of this writ
petition is covered by an order dated 29.10.2003 passed by the Division
Bench of this Court in W.P.No.4917 of 2000 and batch and also the order
dated 25.06.2014 of a learned Single Judge of this Court passed in
W.P.No.20117 of 2011 filed by the petitioner herein, wherein, the issue of
non-laying of the sewerage line to the pharmaceutical units had also
fallen for consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.      I have gone through the pleadings, the additional and the reply
pleadings of the writ petitioner and the counter affidavits of respondents
1 and 2.  I have gone through the material record.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.      In W.P.No.4917 of 2000, a Division Bench of this Court, while
disposing of the said writ petition by order dated 29.10.2003, observed
as follows:-
</p><p id="p_7">The main contention of the petitioner is that there is no sewerage line
of the Board connecting the petitioner premises to any sewerage system of the
Board. No doubt, it is an admitted fact that there is no sewerage line of the
Board working  connecting the petitioners premises to the sewerage system
of the Board, but the industrial effluents are being carried to J.E.T.L. and
after
treating the industrial effluents to certain extent, the effluents from J.E.T.L.
are being carried to the sewerage treatment plant at Amberpet which is
admittedly under the control of the Board. So, from J.E.T.L., to the Amberpet
sewerage treatment plant, there is a 1000 diameter pipeline connecting these
two treatment plants. The former is being run by the Industries in and around
the Jeedimetla Industrial Estate and the latter is being under the control of
the Board. Though the petitioner is not directly using the sewerage line of the
Board, but after immediately treated the effluents at J.E.T.L. the sewerage
line of the Board is being used to bring the effluents to the permissible
limits.
</p><p id="p_8">The word Sewer is defined under Section 2 (o) of the Act, as meaning a closed
conduct for carrying off sewage, sullage, rain water, polluted water, waste
water or sub-soil water.
</p>        
<p id="p_9">        So, from the above definition it is clear that sewerage line between
J.E.T.L. and Amberpet plant belongs to the Board is also Sewer within the
meaning of the Act, because effluents of the petitioner company are being
carried through this line.
</p>
<p id="p_10">        It is an admitted fact that the industrial effluents of the petitioner
were being carried to J.E.T.L. in closed tankers and after treatment there to
some extent they are let into the Boards sewer. Therefore, the contention
that the petitioner has not been provided with sewer line directly from the
petitioners premises is only untenable and devoid of merits. If really the
effluents of the petitioner-company are being treated at J.E.T.L. alone without
further being treated at the Amberpet plant of the Board to bring the effluents
within the permissible level, certainly the Board is not entitled to issue any
demand notice to pay sewerage cess.  
</p>
<p id="p_11">        With regard to the double payment of sewerage cess if petitioner
proves that he is paying sewerage cess to the J.E.T.L. and also to the Board
then it can be said that it would be a double payment for the single act, which
is not normally allowed under law. Therefore, it must be shown by the
petitioner that he is paying sewerage cess to the J.E.T.L. as well as the Board
for the industrial waste let out by the petitioner company.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        A specific plea has been taken by the Board that the payments made
by the petitioner-company to J.E.T.L. are for treating the effluents to being it
to acceptable quality for transmission through the Boards C.O.S. system but
not for sewer purpose. Further there is no material filed by the petitioner
company to show that the petitioner-company is paying sewerage cess to the 
J.E.T.L.or that the J.E.T.L. in turn is paying sewerage cess to the Board for
using the pipe line from Jeedimetla to Amberpet. Even the letter dated
06.11.1998 addressed by the petitioner to the Board would indicate that the
J.E.T.L. is charging them for treatment purpose. The treatment of industrial
effluents to bring down the contents to some tolerable limits is one thing and
transmission of those contents through the sewerage system of the Board is
another thing. Therefore, whatever J.E.T.L. is charging the industrialists is
only for treating the effluents to bring them to the acceptable quality for
transmission through the sewerage system. Even assuming for a moment that  
the petitioner-company is paying some amounts to the J.E.T.L., it cannot be
said that it is towards sewerage cess.. 
</p>
<p id="p_13">       (Reproduced verbatim)

</p><p id="p_14">7.      In the aforementioned two decisions, this Court considered both
the contentions of the writ petitioners.  While distinguishing the reported
cases on facts of the present case, the learned counsel for the writ
petitioner would contend as follows:  In the case on hand, it was shown
that PETL is paying sewerage cess to the first respondent Board and that
the writ petitioner is paying the charges to the PETL.  However, in the
aforementioned cited cases, which were earlier decided by a Division
Bench and a learned Single Judge of this Court, the above-mentioned
facts, which are established in the present case, were not established.
Therefore, the cited decisions are distinguishable on the established facts
of the present case.  The payments that are being made by the petitioner
to PETL, which are established, would absolve the petitioner of the
liability to once again pay the sewerage cess to the first respondent
Board.  In the facts and circumstances of the present case, any further
levy and collection of the sewerage cess by the Board would amount to
double taxation.  In regard to these submissions, what is to be noted is
that admittedly, there is no sewerage line connecting the petitioners unit
to the sewerage system of the Board and therefore, the effluents are
being carried to PETL from the petitioners unit by tankers; however,
after treating such effluents at PETL to a certain tolerable limits, such
partly treated effluents are being let out by the PETL into the sewerage
system of the Board and the same are being carried through the
sewerage system of the first respondent Board to the sewerage plant of
the first respondent Board at Amberpet, which is admittedly under the
control of the Board.  From PETL to the first respondents plant at
Amberpet, there is a pipeline connecting these two treatment plants.  The
PETL is a central treatment plant being run by the industrialists or the
industries in and around Patancheru and the plant at Amberpet is under
the control of the first respondent Board.  Though the petitioners unit is
not directly using the sewerage line of the first respondent Board to carry
the effluents of its unit, nevertheless, the effluents that are being carried
to PETL from the petitioners unit by tankers are being treated partly to
certain level at PETL; further, the sewerage line of the first respondent
Board is being used to carry such partly treated effluents from PETL to
the treatment plant of the 1st respondent Board at Amberpet.  Therefore,
the contention of the writ petitioner that the 1st respondent Board is not
entitled to levy and collect the cess as the petitioners unit is not directly
connected to any sewerage line/system of the Board appears to be 
untenable.
</p>
<p id="p_15">8.      Further, the specific contention of the first respondent Board is
that the payments that are being made by the petitioner company to
PETL are for treating the effluents of the petitioners unit at PETL to
bring them to acceptable quality for transmission through the first
respondent Boards central sewerage system, but not for sewerage
purpose.  In the facts and circumstances of the case, the contention that
PETL is collecting the charges towards the sewerage cess from the
petitioners unit and that PETL in its turn is paying the sewerage cess to
the first respondent Board is not a ground to hold that the 1st respondent
Board is not entitled to levy and collect sewerage cess from the
petitioners unit as there is no material on record to accept the
contention that the petitioner company is paying any amount towards
sewerage cess to PETL.  The copies of the two agreements filed by the
petitioner are on record.  One agreement dated 11.10.2011 was between 
PETL and the petitioner company and under it the scope of service to be
provided by PETL is limited to treatment of liquid waste of the petitioners
unit at the central effluent treatment plant.  The other is a Memorandum
of Understanding dated 03.08.2002 between the 1st respondent Board 
and PETL  for treating the effluents to an acceptable quality for
transmission through the first respondent Boards sewerage system to
Amberpet plant from PETL.  The material record would only indicate that
the PETL is charging the petitioners unit for treatment of the effluents of
its unit for the purpose of bringing down the effluents to certain tolerable
limits before letting out the effluents into the central sewerage system of
the Board for being carried to the Amberpet Plant of the Board.
Therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that
PETL is collecting certain amounts towards sewerage charges from the 
petitioners unit cannot be countenanced.  The contention of the learned
counsel for the petitioner based on the terms of the MOU to the effect
that  the rate of sewerage charges is subject to increase, time to time
depending upon the maintenance expenditure incurred by the HMWS &amp;    
SB in transmitting, treating and disposing the sewerage and other
effluents collected within the sewerage system and also added into the
sewerage system of HMWS &amp; SB and that PETL, Patancheru agrees to     
accept the rate as such, either increased or varied time to time, finalized
and informed by HMWS &amp; SB and to pay the sewerage charges     
accordingly every month regularly to HMWS &amp; SB is not going to
advance the case of the writ petitioner for the reason that the petitioner
is not contributing any amount towards the sewerage charges but is only
paying to the PETL, as already noted, certain charges towards the
treatment of the effluents by PETL to certain level at Patancheru plaint.
Further, a plain reading of the Section 55 of the Hyderabad Metropolitan
Water Supply &amp; Sewerage Act, 1989, which deals with the charges  
towards use of sewerage cess, would show that it contemplates that every
occupier of both domestic and non domestic premises shall pay to the
Board at the prescribed rate, the sewerage cess to defray the capital cost
of sewerage and sewerage treatment works undertaken by the Board and  
the operation and maintenance of the sewerage system from time to time.
The proviso to the said section also states that no such charges shall be
levied on any premises situated in the areas which are not served by the
sewerage system of the Board.  In the case on hand, the PETL is treating
the effluents of the petitioners unit to certain tolerable limits and is
letting out such partly treated effluents into the sewerage system of the
first respondent Board for further transmission to the Boards Amberpet
plant for treating the same to permissible limits in accordance with the
provisions of the Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution Act</a>, 1974.
Therefore, it cannot be said that the petitioners unit is not being served
with the sewerage system of the Board.  Since the partly treated effluents
of the petitioners unit are ultimately joining the sewerage system of the
Board and are being eventually treated at the sewerage treatment plant
of the Board, though the effluents of the petitioners unit are not being
directly let into the sewerage mains of the 1st respondent Board, the fact
that the petitioners unit is being served by the sewerage system of the
Board is undeniable. Therefore, the fact that the 1st respondent had not
laid any sewerage line directly to the premises of the petitioners unit
would not disable the first respondent Board from levying sewerage cess
on the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_16">9.      In W.P.no.20117 of 2011 earlier filed by this writ petitioner, this
Court having followed the ratio in the order dated 29.10.2003 passed by
the Division Bench of this Court in W.P.No.4917 of 2000 and batch, had
also held as follows:
</p><p id="p_17">It is evident, therefore, that failure to lay a sewerage
line would not disable the HMWS &amp; SB from levying the 
sewerage cess on the petitioner herein.
</p>
<p id="p_18">10.     On careful consideration of the ratio in the order of the Division
Bench of this Court in the aforementioned writ petition and the order of
the learned Single Judge in the earlier writ petition filed by the petitioner
herein and also the facts of the case and on an analysis of the aforesaid
facts and reasons, this Court finds that the two contentions now raised
by the learned counsel for the petitioner are already examined and are
negatived and that there are no new vital facts brought to the notice of
this Court to examine afresh the said two contentions.  Hence, this Court
finds that the writ petition is liable for dismissal.
</p>
<p id="p_19">11.     Before parting with the case, it is necessary to deal with one more
contention of the learned Standing Counsel.  It is urged that though the
petitioner had filed a writ petition in W.P.No.20117 of 2011 before this
Court for the same relief and the said writ petition was dismissed by
order dated 25.06.2014 following the ratio laid down by a Division Bench
of this Court in W.P.No.4917 of 2000 and batch, that fact was not
mentioned in any of the pleadings including the additional and reply
pleadings of the writ petitioner and that the said vital fact was thus
suppressed and that, therefore, on that ground of suppression of
material facts, this writ petition is liable for dismissal.
</p>
<p id="p_20">12.     In reply, the learned counsel for the writ petitioner would submit
that when similar sewerage cess was levied in April 2009 on a different
unit of the petitioner company, they have approached this Court by way
of W.P.no.1066 of 2009 challenging the said levy and that the pendency
of the said writ petition and the interim direction that was granted in a
miscellaneous petition filed in the said writ petition, are stated in the
present writ petition and that the other writ petition in W.P.No.20117 of
2011 was filed on 15.07.2011, i.e., after filing of the present writ petition
in March 2011 and that the said writ petition was disposed of on
25.06.2014 and that by oversight or for some genuine reason, the
dismissal of  the other writ petition is not stated in the petitioners reply
affidavit filed in February 2016 and that therefore, the same cannot be
viewed as wanton suppression of a material fact.  In the well considered
view of this Court, no valid explanation is forthcoming from the petitioner
for not mentioning about the dismissal of the W.P.no.20117 of 2011 in
the reply affidavit filed in February 2016 and not bringing the said fact to
the notice of this Court till the 1st respondent made a mention of the
same by filing a copy of the order of this Court in the said writ petition.
In the absence of valid explanation for not mentioning about the
aforementioned facts, the present writ petition is liable to be dismissed
as the remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is an
equitable one and suppression of a material fact disentitles the writ
petitioner to such a relief.
</p>
<p id="p_21">13.     Having regard to the reasons, this Court finds that the writ petition
is liable to be dismissed.  Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed.
There shall be no order as to costs.
</p><p id="p_22">      Miscellaneous petitions pending, if any, in this writ petition shall
stand closed.
