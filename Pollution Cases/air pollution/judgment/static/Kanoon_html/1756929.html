Present :     Mr. S.K.Rattan, Advocate
              for the petitioner

                               *****
</pre>

<p id="p_1">T.S.Thakur, C.J. (Oral)

              In this petition for a writ of mandamus, the petitioner has

prayed for a direction against respondents No.1 to 5 to take action for

closure of Pottery Unit being run by respondent No. 6 from a residential

premises in Ward No. 12, Kharar, in the district of Mohali. The petitioner's

case is that the Pottery Unit is causing pollution and nuisance to the

residents of the area. In support of his case, reliance has been placed by the

petitioner upon Section 121 of the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911, according

to which no place within a municipality shall be used for any of the

purposes enumerated therein including a pottery, lime kiln, any other

manufactory, engine house, storehouse or place of business from which
 CWP No. 19689 of 2008                                          [2]

offensive or unwholesome smell, gases, noises or smoke arise. It is

submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that the Pottery Unit being

run by respondent No. 6 is in clear violation of the provisions of Section

121 of the Act mentioned above. Reliance is also placed upon <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">Section 31-A</a>

of the Air (Prevention &amp; Control of Pollution)Act, 1981, according to

which, Pollution Control Board is competent to issue directions in writing to

any person, officer or authority, in exercise of its powers and performance

of its functions under the Act. The said power includes the power to direct

closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry, operation or process

carried on by the person to whom the direction is issued. The petitioner's

case is that, although, a legal notice in terms of Annexure P-8 was sent to

the Executive Officer of Municipal Council, Kharar as also to the Chairman

of the Punjab Pollution Control Board, Patiala, the said two officers have

paid no heed to the request made in the notice nor initiated any proceedings

against respondent No.6. It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner

that proceedings ought to be initiated against respondent No.6 and orders

passed on the subject in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            We have given our careful consideration to the submissions

made at the Bar. The provisions of Section 121 of the Punjab Municipal

Act, 1911 and <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_2">Section 31-A</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1981, sufficiently empower the Municipality and the Pollution Control

Board to issue appropriate directions in situations stipulated in the said

provisions. In the circumstances, no sooner, the petitioner had brought to

the notice of the said authorities the alleged violations of the provisions of

Section 121 of the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 and the alleged pollution

being caused by respondent No. 6 on account of the Pottery Unit being run
 CWP No. 19689 of 2008                                           [3]

by him, the said authorities were expected to look into the matter and pass

appropriate orders in accordance with law after issuing proper notice and

hearing to respondent No. 6, in as much as, nothing is said to have been

done by the said authorities,    our intervention in the matter, is clearly

indicated.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             In the circumstances, we deem it just and proper to direct that

the complaint made by the petitioner and legal notice Annexure P-8 shall be

looked into by the competent authorities i.e. Municipal Council, Kharar and

the Punjab Pollution Control Board, Patiala who shall pass appropriate

orders in the matter in accordance with law. We make it clear that the said

authorities shall not in obedience to these directions pass any order against

respondent No.6 without serving upon him a proper notice and affording to

him a full and reasonable opportunity of being heard in the matter. The

needful shall be done by respondents No. 3 and 5 expeditiously but not later

than two months from the date a copy of this order is served upon them.

</p><p id="p_4">             The writ petition is accordingly disposed off with the above

directions and observations leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
