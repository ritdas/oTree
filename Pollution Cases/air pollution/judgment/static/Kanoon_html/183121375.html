</pre>
<p id="p_1">     1.                  By this application, the Applicant has sought

     revocation of consent granted by Respondent no.1 (MPCB) to

     Slaughter House (Deonar Abattoir) run by Respondent no. 2

     (Brihanmumbai                  Municipal   Corporation).    The    Applicant

     further has sought direction to close the Deonar Abattoir

     until compliances of mandatory requirements. The Applicant

     further seeks direction that the Respondent no. 1 shall

     discontinue practice of obtaining Bank guarantee in respect

     of consent for slaughter houses for compliance of the

     conditions prior to commencement of the slaughtering

     activities.

     1930. The Applicant claims that object of its organization is

     to save the live stock of the country. The Applicant is

     concerned with irregular trading in slaughter houses,

     particularly illegal slaughtering of healthy and useful

     animals like cows, buffaloes etc.


</p><p id="p_4">     3.            Bhihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (Respondent

     no. 2 ) established Deonar abattoir somewhere in 1971-

     1972. It is a mega slaughter house in Asia where large

     number             of       animals   including   cattle,   cows   etc   are

     slaughtered. The slaughtered animals are brought to the

     abattoir from various parts of the State and other parts of

      slaughter             house.     The    slaughtering   house   is    run   in

     accordance with certain conditions imposed by MPCB

     (Respondent no.1). The MPCB has renewed the consent to

     operate on 5.7.2013 extending the period for operation up to

     31.10.2015. The MPCB has stipulated one of the conditions

     as furnishing of Bank guarantees to the tune of Rs 5 lacs

     each for compliance of certain mandatory requirements.

     These conditions are incorporated in the consent letter

     including setting up and commissioning of rendering plant

     and Biomethanation plant.

<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">     4.         According        to    the    Applicant,    obtaining    of   Bank

     guarantees will not serve the purpose. For, in case of failure

     to comply the guarantees furnished by Brihanmumbai

     Municipal Corporation those may be invoked and the public

     money will be exchanged from one arm of the semi

     Government to another arm of the Government. Thus, those

     who commit the non compliance will go scot free. Thus, the

     public money will be unnecessarily spent without any

     penalty imposed on the defaulting officials or those who

     commit the environmental damage. In other words, such

     practice causes breach of polluters pay principle. The MPCB

     as a matter of practice overlooks the non-compliance of the

     conditions imposed while granting consent to run the

     slaughter houses and thereby the environmental damage is

     enhanced. The MPCB is, therefore, required to ensure that

     the compliances are duly made by the Deonar Abattoir. The

      absence of rendering plant and biomethanation plant in the

     Deonar Abattoir since 1986 has resulted in generating huge

     sewage, great degree of air and water pollution, Resultantly

     the population living around vicinity of the slaughter house

     is suffering from ill effects of the air and water pollution. The

     adverse impact of air and water pollution has resulted in to

     various health problems in the nearby area of Deonar

     Abattoir. The Respondents have failed to take cognizance of

     the numerous complaints made by the Applicant and others

     to remove the deficiencies. The Applicant, therefore, sought

     closure of the abattoir and restoration of the environment,


</p><p id="p_7">     5.           The Respondent No.1 (MPCB) resisted the application.

     According to MPCB, the area of the slaughter house is

     around 64 acres. The slaughter house has provided separate

     live stock yards for different kinds of animals. It provides a

     centralized slaughtering activity for metro city of Mumbai

     where livestock comprising of sheeps, pigs, buffaloes etc. are

     brought            by       trading   licensees   for   slaughtering.   The

     sanctioned production of quantum of meat, beef, pork is to

     the tune of 3600 MT/M, 2700 MT/M and 360 MT/M

     respectively. The consent to operate has been granted to the

     slaughter house (Deonar abattoir) subject to specific terms

     and conditions in order to ensure pollution prevention and

     compliance of environmental norms. The slaughter house is

     required to comply with the conditions which include outer

     cap on production quantity and generation of trade wastes.

      The effluents are to be adequately treated, recycled to

     maximum extent and balance effluent to be disposed by

     connecting to the sewerage system provided by MCGM after

     disinfection. The Respondent no. 2 is under obligation to

     provide comprehensive treatment system so as to achieve

     environmental standards. Another condition is that the

     slaughter house shall adopt solid waste management for

     processing, utilisation and disposal of solid waste generated

     from the slaughter house by installation of Biomethanation

     and rendering plant.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">     6.          According to MPCB, visit to the slaughtering house on

     21.10.2013 revealed that mechanized slaughtering house

     was in dilapidated condition. It was also found that the

     vegetable waste generated such as rumen, waste from

     intestinal contents, dung, agricultural residues was being

     disposed off by deep burial method in a dumping ground

     instead of biomethanation which was in breach of the

     consent condition. So also it was found that Deonar

     slaughtering house failed to install the rendering plant. Thus

     waste generated like animal matter viz tissues, meat

     trimmings, condemned meat, bones etc were not being

     properly            disposed   off.   Waste   water   generated   from

     slaughtering and washing activities contaminated with blood

     was found entering in to the storm water drain carrying

     effluent connected to the ETP. It was noticed that separate

     pipe lines were necessary for storm water and industrial

      waste water. The abattoir had not maintained proper

     account of by-products generated from the slaughter house

     such as skin, hides, tallos, guts, hooves, horns hair, as

     collected           under    respective   trade   licences.   The   MPCB

     therefore, came out with a case that directions have been

     issued under section 33A of the Water (P&amp;CP) Act 1974 and

     section 31A of the Air (P &amp; CP) Act 1981 to the various

     slaughter house of the Respondent no. 2. The MPCB further

     submits that the Bank guarantees were obtained in order to

     ensure compliance of the stipulated conditions enumerated

     in the consent letter.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">     7.                The Respondent no. 2 resisted the application by

     filing affidavit-in-reply of the General Manager of Deonar

     Abattoir. In his affidavit, Shri Pramod Dethe, the General

     Manager of the abattoir, states that the application is pre-

     mature and is liable to be dismissed in view of section 14(3)

     of the NGT Act, 2010. The Respondent no. 2 further alleges

     that NGT has no jurisdiction to entertain the Application, in

     as much as the dispute does not fall within the purview of

     section 14 of the NGT Act. The Respondent no 2 alleges that

     the consent to operate granted to the slaughter house is

     legal and valid and due compliances are being made as per

     the conditions enumerated in consent letter issued by

     MPCB. It is further alleged that if so required appropriate

     action           would      be   taken    to   ensure    installation   of

     biomethanation and rendering plant for treatment of type II

      waste         generated         from   the   abattoir.   According   to   the

     Respondent no.2, the question of violation of such conditions

     is yet not finally decided by MPCB and as such it                     is pre

     postureous                  to assume that there is non-compliance of

     conditions by Respondent no.2. In any case, the closure of

     the abattoir is not called for. It is denied that the practice of

     obtaining the Bank guarantee for ensuring compliances is

     illegal and uncalled for. On these premises, the Respondent

     no. 2 sought dismissal of the Application.


</p><p id="p_12">     8.            Having regard to the rival pleadings of the parties,

     following issues emerge for deciding the application. They

     are :
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">     1.     Whether the application is barred by Limitation ? Or
     otherwise falls outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal in
     view of section 14 of the NGT Act and as such is liable to be
     dismissed ?
</p>
<p id="p_15">     2.     Whether the applicant has made out a acceptable case
     to hold that the slaughter house ( Deonar Abattoir ) is being
     run without following valid conditions and therefore, said
     activity is harmful to the environment and causes
     degradation of the environment particularly on account of
     water pollution due to contamination and untreated waste
     water ?
</p>
<p id="p_16">     3.     Whether the Respondent no. 2 is liable to pay
     compensation to the Applicant or the victims of the pollution
     ? If so to what amount and to what extent ?
</p>
<p id="p_17">     4.     Whether the practice of seeking Bank guarantees from
     the slaughter houses run by Municipal council or Municipal
     Corporations as a condition for the compliances stipulated
     by the MPCB in consent order is legal and proper ?




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                                 7</span>
(J) Appea; No.170 of 2013 (wz)
</p><p id="p_18">      9.               We have heard learned counsel for the parties. We

     have carefully gone through the documents placed on

     record. We may pin point that environment related issues

     are involved in the application on account of non compliance

     noticed by the MPCB as reflected from its inspection notes.

     It is nobody's case that the biomethanation plant and

     rendering plant have been installed at the work site of the

     abattoir. The Respondent no. 2, time and again stated that

     said condition will be duly complied with.


</p><p id="p_19">     10.             Before we proceed to consider the rival contentions,

     it is significant to note the guidelines issued by the Central

     Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for management of solid

     waste in slaughtering houses. A copy of the guidelines is

     placed on record. It goes to show that the slaughter houses

     are classified in three categories. The slaughter houses

     having capacity of live weight killed -over and above 70 tons

     per day are large, those which have capacity between 15 -

     70 tons of live weight killed per day are medium and those

     having capacity below 70 tons live weight killed are small.

     Ruminal, stomach and intestinal contents essentially form

     sold waste. Horn and hooves are generally collected for sale.

     Some particles left over may be used for manufacturing

     poultry feed. The solid waste of slaughter house can be

     composted by stack making in bunkers. The biomethanation

     plant can be constructed in two ways. The gas is produced

     in or more bio-digesters and then it can be stored in a

      separate gas holder from where it is drawn, as and when

     required. The other alternative is that the bio-digester and

     gas holder are built so as to form one single unit. The gas is

     produced in the lower part of the structure, while the upper

     tank serves as a gas holder. While the second option is

     extremely simple and cheap in construction, but it has the

     disadvantage                that   gas   production   is   affected   during

     recharge. On the other hand, with a separate gas holder,

     continuous supply of gas can be assured even when one or

     more digesters are being charged. It is therefore, more

     practicable for larger units to have separate gas holders.

     rimmings, waste and condemned meat and bones can be

     processed in rendering system. The main constituents of

     animals matter are fat, water and solids. The objective of

     rendering process is to physically separate the fat, the water

     and the solids. Rendering is carried out either in dry

     rendering or wet rendering plants. In both the processes,

     large pieces such as head bones etc are reduced in size by

     shredders or other machinery. Large soft offals are also cut

     to size before processing. Intestines, stomach and similar

     soft materials contain manure and therefore, they are

     opened and cleaned before feeding to rendering plant.

             Large slaughter houses are mostly in cities located in
     congested areas. They generate substantial quantity of solid
     wastes, which have to be processed in environmentally
     acceptable manner. For the large slaughter houses,
     biomethanation of type -I waste and rendering for type -II
     are suggested. Biomethanation requires less space which is
     advantageous for the slaughter houses with land
     constraints.
</p><p id="p_23">          Biomethanation for type I waste and rendering for type

     account of recovery and use or sale of secondary by-

     required to be materially changed, which is more so in a big

 Corporation through General Manager of Deonar Abattoir in

 response to the above show cause notice. The reply to the

 show cause notice, as given by the General Manager of Deonar

 Abattoir,            indicates   that   the   statutory   requirement   of

 Biomethanation plant and rendering plant for treatment of

 solid waste had not been informed earlier to the consent of

 5/7/2013 and therefore steps were not taken to implement the

 same. It is also noticed from the correspondence available in

 records that MPCB has already communicated the abattoir, on

 26/4/2012, to comply the requirement of pollution control and

 management system as per CPCB guidelines.                   We are of the

 opinion that such a stand is without any substance. The

 conditions imposed while granting the consent to operate,

  clearly stipulated such pre-requirement to be complied with by

 Deonar Abattoir Management. It is stated in the reply of the

 Deonar             Abattoir     that   process   for   installation   and

 commissioning of Biomethanation plant is in progress. It is

 also stated that the process for installation, commissioning

 and rendering plant is in progress. These are rather evasive

 replies. We do not know what is the actual stage of progress

 made by the Abattoir for installation of the said facilities? The

 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has not placed on

 record any material to show the budget allocation made for

 such purpose.

</p><p id="p_39"> 16.            We have pointed out from the show cause notice dated

 23.10.2013 that the MCPB found various lapses committed by

 the Municipal Corporation in operation of the Deonar Abattoir

 The response of General Manager of the Deonar Abattoir is not

 only evasive but on certain points there appears clear

 admission about such lapses. For example, the show cause

 notice of the MPCB reveals : "Waste water generated from

 slaughtering and washing activities contaminated with blood

 found entering in the storm water drain. These storm water

 drain carry effluent, observed in the ETP but there is need of

 dedicated separated pipe line for storm water and industrial

 water". The response of General Manager of Deonar Abattoir

 on this point is thus :

  water drain and also a new separate storm water                  and
 industrial waste water pipe line will be laid at the earliest"

 Another point on which explanation was called is that there

 was no effective blood collection system on traditional

 slaughtering of cattle thereby blood finding its way along with

 waste water to the ETP. The response of General Manager of

 Deonar Abattoir is that on temporary basis the blood is

 collected manually. Needless to say, the management of

 Deonar Abattoir is not only being handled without following

 regular norms but in casual manner, carelessly and in

 unhygienic way. It goes without saying that such perfunctory

 management of the slaughter house is harmful to the

 environment. That will not only cause contamination of by

 products and the drained water which will be mixed with waste

 blood or other material but it will trigger epidemic diseases in

 the nearby area.

 of MPCB which are practically undisputed, the analysis results

 of January 2012 annexed with the revival of consent vide letter

 dated 5.7.2013 does not reflect any abnormality. There

 appears internal contradiction in the actions of MPCB. The

 analysis results cannot be normal where admittedly the blood

 was found entering in to the storm water drain and was not

 segregated by means of separate waste water pipe line. It could

 not be normal when there was no effective blood segregation

 system in the place of traditional slaughtering of cattle. And

  therefore waste                 blood was drifted along with waste water to

 the ETP. The analysis report could not be normal when the

 solid waste was being improperly treated. In any case, the

 record of MPCB must be kept straight. Nobody can deny that

 there must be probity in the governance of all organs of the

 Government including the semi Governmental organization

 like Municipal Corporation.

copies of the consent and also, correspondence submitted by

the parties. It is observed that MPCB had issued consent to the

abattoir on 16/6/2012 which was valid up to 31.10.2012 for

the production of meat, beef and pork to the capacity of 45

MT/day, 76MT/day and 4 MT/day respectively, with industrial

effluent generation of 900 cum/day. MPCB further granted the

consent           on 5/7/2013 which is valid up to 31.10.2015, for

production of meat, beef and pork to the capacity of 3600

MT/month, 2700 MT/month and 360 MT/month respectively,

with industrial effluent generation of 942 cum/day. It can be

seen from the production quantities in these two consent

documents that MPCB has approved the consent to the abattoir

for a significant increase in production capacity. This approval

has been granted with the clear information available with

MPCB that the abattoir is not meeting the norms set out by the

CPCB. Considering the above, it is not clear how the MPCB has

decided to grant consent of 5/7/2013 with the increased

 Corporation is found running the large scale slaughtering

 activities           without     proper    management.      The    large   scale

 slaughtering of animals must be undertaken with due care and

 ought to be done in hygienic conditions. The Deonar Abattoir is

 a service Abattoir of Greater Mumbai. There cannot be duality

 of opinion that the Mumbai Municipal Corporation is legally

 bound to maintain, operate and regulate the slaughter house .

 We are aware that Section 61(h) of the Mumbai Municipal

 Corporation               Act,   1988     provides   that   the   construction,

 maintenance, operation and regulation of such slaughter

 house is an obligatory duty of MCGM. We also are aware of the

 fact that Deonar Abattoir was constructed in 1971. Still,

 however, we cannot appreciate that the slaughter house could

 not have been technically equipped in accordance with the

 developed scientific methods to maintain hygienic condition

 and particularly when the number of animals brought for

 slaughtering is ever increasing. According to the MCGM, the

 first ETP was installed in 2004. That is not, however, sufficient

 equipment to take care of the activities which are on going. The

 revamping of biogas plant, installation and commissioning of

 biomethanation and rendering plant, segregation of blood pipe

 the regulations of markets and slaughtering houses. This kind

 of      apathy          on      the   part   of   the   Government   agency   is

 reprehensible. We have no hesitation in holding that in

 absence of proper hygienic condition and valid authority under

 the bye laws of the Municipal Corporation the Export of meat

Applicant has sought protection of environment as well as

enforcement of provisions of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,

triggered afresh cause of action for the purpose. In our opinion,

where there is continuity of environmental degradation, the

limitation continues with the time till the nuisance, degradation

maintainable. It does not fall outside scope of Section 14 of the
