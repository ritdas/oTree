HON'BLE MS.JUSTICE HIMA KOHLI


HIMA KOHLI, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.    The petitioner No.1, a company registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>,
2013, had started the construction of Rajpur Hydro Electrical Project in
Rajpura Village, Tehsil Shimla, District Himachal Pradesh in December,
2011. On 28.3.2013, the petitioner No.1/company entered into an
agreement with the respondent, M/s PTC India Financial Services Ltd. for
sanction of a term loan of Rs.60 crores, out of the total project cost of
Rs.85.75 crores, for a period of 30 months reckoned from 31.03.2013. In


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C)8031/2016                                               Page 1 of 23</span>
 lieu of the term loan, the petitioner No.1/company created a first charge by
way of mortgage in favour of the respondent over all the immovable and
movable properties and assets in respect of the project site. The petitioners
state that by 01.11.2015, the respondent had disbursed a sum of Rs.47
crores. By then 80% of the project was already complete but the balance
loan amount was not being released by the respondent for completion of
the project. Instead, the respondent served a notice dated 17.06.2016 on
the petitioners threatening to acquire 100% equity shares of the promoters
in the petitioner No.1/company.
</p><p id="p_2">2.    Alleging that the respondent has failed to disburse the loan amounts
on time despite several requests, which resulted in bringing the project to a
grinding halt, the petitioners have filed the present petition praying inter
alia that a writ of mandamus be issued to the respondent directing it not to
proceed against the petitioner No.2, Director of the petitioner
No.1/company and petitioner No.3, wife of the petitioner No.2, by
acquiring their 100% equity share capital, or take any coercive steps
against the assets of the petitioner No.1/company. Additionally, the
petitioners seek directions to the respondent to disburse the complete
sanctioned credit facilities and provide for overall costs of the project on
account of the alleged non-disbursal of the sanctioned loan as per the
Agreement dated 28.3.2013.
</p><p id="p_3">3.    Notice was issued on the present petition on 15.09.2016. Counsel
for the respondent was present on the said date and had sought time to file a
counter affidavit, which was duly filed. On 11.11.2016, Mr. Rajeeve



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C)8031/2016                                                   Page 2 of 23</span>
 Mehra, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the respondent had
questioned the maintainability of the present petition on the ground that the
respondent is neither a „State‟ nor a „public authority‟ or a „government
agency‟ and also on the ground that the petition as filed, is not maintainable
in law. In view of the aforesaid preliminary objections, the parties were
first directed to address arguments on the maintainability of the present
petition.
</p><p id="p_4">4.    Mr. Rajeeve Mehra, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the
respondent argued that the present petition is not maintainable against the
respondent. He sought to throw light on the constitution of the respondent
to urge that it is a private entity, not involved in any public function or
duty; that it is not an „authority‟ within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India; that it is not a „State‟ within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_3">Article
12</a> of the Constitution of India; that it does not fall in the ambit of an
"instrumentality of the State" or a "public authority"; that it is not a
government owned or controlled bank; that no shares in the respondent are
held by the Central Government of the State Government; that the
respondent is not a nationalized bank/scheduled bank/public financial
institution or created under the Statute; that it does not discharge any public
function or public duty in its usual course of business operations and that
its activity of granting loans to several entities is a purely commercial
activity, which is private in character. The writ petition was also opposed
on behalf of the respondent on the grounds that it is a secured lender under
the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C)8031/2016                                                    Page 3 of 23</span>

under the Statute and not by seeking prerogative writs under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_5">5.    To fortify the aforesaid submissions, the following decisions were

</blockquote><p id="p_6">6.    Per contra, Mr. Muneesh Malhotra, learned counsel for the
petitioners controverted the stand taken by the respondent that it is not an
authority or a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_13">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of
India and it is not amenable to writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_14">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India. He contended that on the contrary, the
respondent/company is directly controlled by the Government being a

Corporation of India Ltd.); that four Central Government Public Sector
Undertakings promote the respondent‟s parent company, which is
completely controlled by the Government of India as an IRS Officer was
appointed the Chairman of M/s PTC India Ltd. by the Government of India
on deputation basis in the year 2003 and a serving Joint Secretary in the
Ministry of Power, Government of India is presently working as a Director
of M/s PTC India Ltd, who also happens to be a nominee Director of the
Ministry of Power; that the Directors/independent Directors/nominee
Directors of M/s PTC India Ltd. are also Ex-Technocrats and former
Secretaries in the Government of India and have been working with Public
Sector Undertakings; that as per the statement of shareholding pattern of
the respondent, M/s PTC India Ltd. holds 60% shares and other Central
Government/State Government Undertakings namely, NTPC, PFC, NHPC,
Power Grid Corporation etc. collectively hold 16.22% shares.
</p><p id="p_7">7.    It was therefore urged on behalf of the petitioners that the
Government of India exercises a deep and pervasive control over the affairs
of the respondent through its Public Sector Undertakings and the officials
appointed as Directors in the respondent/company play a vital role in the
affairs of the respondent; that the Government being involved in the
formation of the respondent, its management, control and financial
assistance extended to the respondent, makes it amenable to writ
jurisdiction and resultantly, the contractual obligations cast on the

 respondent can well be examined under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India.
</p><p id="p_8">8.       To fortify the aforesaid pleas, reliance was placed by Mr. Malhotra,
learned counsel for the petitioner on the following decisions:-

                 5 SCC 577

</blockquote><p id="p_9">9.       This Court has given its thoughtful consideration to the arguments
advanced by the counsels for the parties and carefully examined the
decisions cited by both sides.
</p><p id="p_10">10.      <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_21">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India that deals with the powers of
the High Courts to issue certain writs, orders or directions is meant to
enforce any of the rights that are conferred under Part III of the
Constitution of India and for any other purpose. There are several
authoritative judicial pronouncements that have held that a writ petition can
be filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_22">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India for invoking the
extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court not only against a



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">W.P.(C)8031/2016                                                      Page 6 of 23</span>
 government/authority that falls within the definition of a „State‟ or „any
other person or authority', but also for "any other purpose". A writ under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_23">Article 226</a> can also lie against any "person" if it is a statutory body or
performs a public function or discharges a public or statutory duty. (Refer:
<a href="/doc/1080534/" id="a_24">Praga Tools Corpn. vs. C.V. Imanual</a>; (1969) 1 SCC 585, <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_25">Shri Anadi
Mukta Sadguru Trust vs. V.R. Rudani</a>; (1989) 2 SCC 691 and <a href="/doc/1620518/" id="a_26">VST
Industries Ltd. vs. Workers</a>‟ Union; (2001) 1 SCC 298). Further, a writ
petition would be maintainable against an authority that is treated as a
„State‟ within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_27">Article 12</a>, for enforcement of fundamental
and other rights.
</p><p id="p_11">11.   It is equally well settled that the term "authority" used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_28">Article 226</a>
must receive a wider meaning than the term used in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_29">Article 12</a> and it cannot
be confined only to statutory authorities and instrumentalities of the State,
but may also cover any other person or body performing a public duty and
such a duty must be judged in the light of the positive obligations owed by
the person or the authority to the adversely affected person. In the case of
Federal Bank (supra), the Supreme Court had carved out eight categories of
bodies/persons in para 18 of the said judgment, who were held to be
amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court, as below:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">      "18. From the decisions referred to above, the position that
      emerges is that a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_30">Article 226</a> of the
      Constitution of India may be maintainable against (i) the State
      (Government); (ii) an authority; (iii) a statutory body; (iv) an
      instrumentality or agency of the State; ( v) a company which is
      financed and owned by the State; (vi) a private body run
      substantially on State funding; (vii) a private body discharging
      public duty or positive obligation of public nature; and (viii) a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">W.P.(C)8031/2016                                                   Page 7 of 23</span>
        person or a body under liability to discharge any function under
       any Statute, to compel it to perform such a statutory function."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">12.    On a glance at the categories carved out above, it is clear that the
Supreme Court has recognized the fact that a writ petition can lie against
three sets of bodies as mentioned at Sr.No.(vi), (vii) and (viii) above. The
logic of including a private body/entity was explained in the case of Binny
Ltd. (supra), where the Supreme Court had observed that it is the nature of
the duty performed by such person or body, which is the determinative
factor and such a duty can be statutory or non-statutory but the underlying
condition is that the action of that body must entail an element of public
law.
</p><p id="p_13">13.    On a conspectus of the case law relating to the maintainability of a
writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_31">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India and drawing a
distinction between public law vis-à-vis private law obligations of the
State/public authorities, the Supreme Court had opined in the case of K.K.
Saksena (supra) as below:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">       "43. What follows from a minute and careful reading of the
       aforesaid judgments of this Court is that if a person or authority
       is a "State" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_32">Article 12</a> of the
       Constitution, admittedly a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_33">Article 226</a> would
       lie against such a person or body. However, we may add that
       even in such cases writ would not lie to enforce private law
       rights. There are a catena of judgments on this aspect and it is
       not necessary to refer to those judgments as that is the basic
       principle of judicial review of an action under the
       administrative law. The reason is obvious. A private law is
       that part of a legal system which is a part of common law
       that involves relationships between individuals, such as law

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">W.P.(C)8031/2016                                                    Page 8 of 23</span>
       of contract or torts. Therefore, even if writ petition would
      be maintainable against an authority, which is "State"
      under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_34">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, before issuing any
      writ, particularly writ of mandamus, the Court has to
      satisfy that action of such an authority, which is challenged,
      is in the domain of public law as distinguished from private
      law." (emphasis added)



</blockquote><p id="p_14">14.   It is also settled law that writ proceedings are not a remedy for
enforcing contractual obligations and under the law, an aggrieved party
must approach the court of competent jurisdiction for appropriate relief for
breach of a contract. No doubt, the existence of an alternate remedy does
not bar the jurisdiction of the High Court to issue a writ but ordinarily, that
would be a good ground to refuse to exercise its discretion under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Article
226</a> as disputed questions or rival claims of the parties with regard to
breach of a contract are required to be determined on the basis of evidence
led before an appropriate forum and not by issuance of writs. [Refer: Jain
Plastics and Chemicals (supra) and Binny Ltd. (supra)]

</p><p id="p_15">15.   In the case of Satyawati Tondon (supra), referring to the case of
<a href="/doc/1059476/" id="a_36">Mardia Chemicals Ltd. and Ors. vs. UOI and Ors</a>. reported as (2004) 4
SCC 311, the Supreme Court had held that the self-imposed restraint
placed by the High Courts in entertaining a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_37">Article 226</a> of

following words:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">      "43. Unfortunately, the High Court overlooked the settled law
      that the High Court will ordinarily not entertain a petition
      under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_38">Article 226</a> of the Constitution if an effective remedy is
      available to the aggrieved person and that this rule applies with
      greater rigour in matters involving recovery of taxes, cess, fees,
      other types of public money and the dues of banks and other
      financial institutions. In our view, while dealing with the
      petitions involving challenge to the action taken for
      recovery of the public dues, etc., the High Court must keep
      in mind that the legislations enacted by Parliament and
      State Legislatures for recovery of such dues are a code unto
      themselves inasmuch as they not only contain
      comprehensive procedure for recovery of the dues but also
      envisage constitution of quasi-judicial bodies for redressal
      of the grievance of any aggrieved person. Therefore, in all
      such cases, the High Court must insist that before availing
      remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_39">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, a person
      must exhaust the remedies available under the relevant
      statute." (emphasis added)

      control of Reserve Bank of India and the Central Government is
      all-pervasive over the banking companies: they can cause an
      inspection to be made, can make scrutiny of the working and
      accounts of the banking company, can remove the Chairman or
      appoint additional Directors; the functioning of the banking
      company can also be suspended, the undertaking can also be
      acquired. It is further submitted that Reserve Bank of India has
      been constituted to regulate issue of banknotes and for keeping
      reserves with a view to secure and maintain monetary stability
      in the country. It is with that end in view that powers have been
      vested in Reserve Bank of India to keep proper check on the
      working and functioning of the banking companies as also in
      the interest of the depositors and the own interest of the banking
      company. Such a nature of control indicates that the banking
      companies discharge functions of public nature.

      enterprise to earn livelihood and to make profits out of such
      activities. Banking is also a kind of profession and a
      commercial activity, the primary motive behind it can well be
      said to earn returns and profits. Since time immemorial, such
      activities have been carried on by individuals generally. It is a
      private affair of the company though case of nationalized banks
      stands on a different footing. There may well be companies,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">W.P.(C)8031/2016                                                  Page 11 of 23</span>
       in which majority of the share capital may be contributed
      out of the State funds and in that view of the matter there
      may be more participation or dominant participation of the
      State in managing the affairs of the company. But in the
      present case we are concerned with a banking company
      which has its own resources to raise its funds without any
      contribution or shareholding by the State. It has its own
      Board of Directors elected by its shareholders. It works like
      any other private company in the banking business having
      no monopoly status at all. Any company carrying on banking
      business with a capital of five lakhs will become a scheduled
      bank. All the same, banking activity as a whole carried on by
      various banks undoubtedly has an impact and effect on the
      economy of the country in general. Money of the shareholders
      and the depositors is with such companies, carrying on banking
      activity. The banks finance the borrowers on any given rate
      of interest at a particular time. They advance loans as
      against securities. Therefore, it is obviously necessary to
      have regulatory check over such activities in the interest of
      the company itself, the shareholders, the depositors as well
      as to maintain the proper financial equilibrium of the
      national economy. The banking companies have not been
      set up for the purposes of building the economy of the State;
      on the other hand such private companies have been
      voluntarily established for their own purposes and interest
      but their activities are kept under check so that their
      activities may not go wayward and harm the economy in
      general. A private banking company with all freedom that it
      has, has to act in a manner that it may not be in conflict
      with or against the fiscal policies of the State and for such
      purposes, guidelines are provided by Reserve Bank so that a
      proper fiscal discipline, to conduct its affairs in carrying on
      its business, is maintained. So as to ensure adherence to
      such fiscal discipline, if need be, at times even the
      management of the company can be taken over.

       measures to keep a check and provide guideline and not a
      participatory dominance or control over the affairs of the
      company. For other companies in general carrying on other
      business activities, maybe manufacturing, other industries or
      any business, such checks are provided under the provisions of
      the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_44">Companies Act</a>, as indicated earlier. There also, the main
      consideration is that the company itself may not sink because of
      its own mismanagement or the interest of the shareholders or
      people generally may not be jeopardized for that reason.
      Besides taking care of such interest as indicated above,
      there is no other interest of the State, to control the affairs
      and management of the private companies. Care is taken in
      regard to the industries covered under the Industries
      (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_45">Regulation) Act</a>, 1951 that their production
      which is important for the economy, may not go down, yet the
      business activity is carried on by such companies or

      entrepreneurs/companies.

<blockquote id="blockquote_21">      27. Such private companies would normally not be
      amenable to the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_46">Article 226</a> of the
      Constitution. But in certain circumstances a writ may issue
      to such private bodies or persons as there may be statutes
      which need to be complied with by all concerned including
      the private companies. For example, there are certain
      legislations like the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_47">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_48">Minimum
      Wages Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_49">Factories Act</a> or for maintaining proper

      Act</a>, 1981 or Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_51">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
      1974 etc. or statutes of the like nature which fasten certain
      duties and responsibilities statutorily upon such private bodies
      which they are bound to comply with. If they violate such a
      statutory provision a writ would certainly be issued for
      compliance with those provisions. For instance, if a private
      employer dispenses with the service of its employee in violation
      of the provisions contained under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_52">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in

       innumerable cases the High Court interfered and has issued the
      writ to the private bodies and the companies in that regard. But
      the difficulty in issuing a writ may arise where there may
      not be any non-compliance or violation of any statutory
      provision by the private body. In that event a writ may not
      be issued at all. Other remedies, as may be available, may
      have to be resorted to." (emphasis added)


</blockquote><p id="p_17">17.   Applying the tests laid down in its earlier decisions to the facts
of the case brought out in Federal Bank (supra), the following
conclusion was drawn by the Supreme Court:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">      "28. The six factors which have been enumerated in the case of
      <a href="/doc/1186368/" id="a_53">Ajay Hasia vs. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi</a>; (1981) 1 SCC 722
      and approved in the later decisions in the case of <a href="/doc/1281050/" id="a_54">Ramana
      Dayaram Shetty vs. International Airport Authority of India</a>;
      (1979) 3 SCC 489 and the seven Judges Bench in the case of
      <a href="/doc/471272/" id="a_55">Pradeep Kumar Biswas vs. Indian Institute of Chemical
      Biology</a>; (2002) 5 SCC 111 may be applied to the facts of the
      present case and see whether those tests apply to the appellant
      Bank or not. As indicated earlier, share capital of the appellant
      Bank is not held at all by the Government nor is any financial
      assistance provided by the State, nothing to say which may
      meet almost the entire expenditure of the company. The third
      factor is also not answered since the appellant Bank does not
      enjoy any monopoly status nor can it be said to be an institution
      having State protection. So far as control over the affairs of the
      appellant Bank is concerned, they are managed by the Board of
      Directors elected by its shareholders. No governmental agency
      or officer is connected with the affairs of the appellant Bank nor
      is any one of them a member of the Board of Directors. In the
      normal functioning of the private banking company there is
      no participation or interference of the State or its
      authorities. The statutes have been framed regulating the
      financial and commercial activities so that fiscal

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">W.P.(C)8031/2016                                                  Page 14 of 23</span>
       equilibrium may be kept maintained and not get disturbed
      by the malfunctioning of such companies or institutions
      involved in the business of banking. These are regulatory
      measures for the purpose of maintaining a healthy
      economic atmosphere in the country. Such regulatory
      measures are provided for other companies also as well as
      industries manufacturing goods of importance. Otherwise
      these are purely private commercial activities. It deserves to
      be noted that it hardly makes any difference that such
      supervisory vigilance is kept by Reserve Bank of India
      under a statute or the Central Government. Even if it was
      with the Central Government in place of Reserve Bank of India
      it would not have made any difference, therefore, the argument
      based on the decision of <a href="/doc/1781810/" id="a_56">All India Bank Employees' Assn. vs.
      National Industrial Tribunal</a>; AIR 1962 SC 171 does not
      advance the case of the respondent. It is only in case of
      malfunctioning of the company that occasion to exercise such
      powers arises to protect the interest of the depositors,
      shareholders or the company itself or to help the company to be
      out of the woods. In times of normal functioning such occasions
      do not arise except for routine inspections etc. with a view to
      see that things are moved smoothly in keeping with fiscal
      policies in general.

<blockquote id="blockquote_23">      29. There are a number of such companies carrying on the
      profession of banking. There is nothing which can be said to
      be close to the governmental functions. It is an old
      profession in one form or the other carried on by
      individuals or by a group of them. Losses incurred in the
      business are theirs as well as the profits. Any business or
      commercial activity, maybe banking, manufacturing units
      or related to any other kind of business generating
      resources, employment, production and resulting in
      circulation of money are no doubt, such which do have
      impact on the economy of the country in general. But such
      activities cannot be classified as one falling in the category


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">W.P.(C)8031/2016                                               Page 15 of 23</span>
       of discharging duties or functions of a public nature. Thus
      the case does not fall in the fifth category of cases
      enumerated in the case of Ajay Hasia (supra). Again we find
      that the activity which is carried on by the appellant is not one
      which may have been earlier carried on by the Government and
      transferred to the appellant company. For the sake of
      argument, even if it may be assumed that one or the other
      test as provided in the case of Ajay Hasia (supra) may be
      attracted, that by itself would not be sufficient to hold that
      it is an agency of the State or a company carrying on the
      functions of public nature. In this connection, observations
      made in the case of Pradeep Kumar Biswas (supra) quoted
      earlier would also be relevant." (emphasis added)

</blockquote><p id="p_18">18.   It was thus concluded in the captioned case that simply because the
RBI lays down the banking policy, does not mean that private companies
that carry on business or the commercial activity of banking, discharge any
public function or public duty. Therefore, it cannot be stated that such
companies are amenable to writ jurisdiction unless and until they are
enforcing statutory obligations of a public nature, casting positive
obligations on them. Holding that in a case where disciplinary action has
been taken by the Bank against an employee and his services have been
terminated, the employee is not trying to enforce any statutory duty cast on
the bank by filing a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_57">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India, the Supreme Court had allowed the appeal filed by Federal Bank.

limited company, promoted by M/s PTC India Ltd., another public limited
company. It is a Non-Banking Financial Company (in short „NBFC‟) duly

 Infrastructure Finance Company by the RBI. The respondent does not
accept any deposits from the public. It is listed on both, the Bombay Stock
Exchange Limited and the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. The
purpose of incorporation of the respondent has been declared in the „Main
Objects‟ clause of its Memorandum of Association, which discloses that the
focus is on carrying out commercial activity of making investments in and
financing all kinds of projects, industry, companies and persons engaged in
various activities in the energy sector. Clause A.1 of the Memorandum of
Association of the respondent/company throws light on the objects of the
respondent and states as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">      "1. To carry on and engage in the business in India or abroad

<p id="p_20">20.   A glance at the shareholding pattern of the respondent/company
reveals that 60% of its shares are held by M/s PTC India ltd. and the
balance 40% shares are held by other entities, including Mutual Funds/UTI,
Financial Institutions and Banks, Insurance Companies, Body Corportes,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">W.P.(C)8031/2016                                                  Page 17 of 23</span>
 Qualified Foreign Investors and individual shareholders. From the
shareholding pattern of the respondent/company, it is apparent that the
Central Government or the State Government does not hold any shares in
the company. It is also an admitted position that the respondent is not a
creation of the Statute, but a public limited company registered with the
RBI. The activities of the respondent are purely commercial and private in
nature. It does not enjoy any monopoly status; nor does it have any State
protection. It does not discharge any public function or statutory function,
which has been sought to be enforced in the present petition. Simply
because the activities of the respondent are regulated by the RBI, it being in
the business of lending money on commercial terms, will not make it
amenable to writ jurisdiction. The arguments advanced by learned counsel
for the petitioners that 60% of the shares of the respondent/company are
held by M/s PTC India Ltd., which is a Public Sector Undertaking, cannot
be a determinative factor when it comes to examining the character and
functions discharged by the respondent. Nor can the fact that M/s PTC India
Ltd. is headed by bureaucrats or that its Board of Directors include
bureaucrats/technocrats be of any relevance when the structure of the
respondent/company is to be examined. In the normal functioning of the
respondent, clearly, there is no participation by the State or its authorities.
</p><p id="p_21">21.   As noted earlier, the shareholding capital of the respondent/company
is not held by the Government. The petitioners have not been able to
demonstrate that financial assistance of any nature is being provided by the
State or its authorities to the respondent/company. The Board of Directors



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">W.P.(C)8031/2016                                                     Page 18 of 23</span>
 of the respondent/company are elected by its shareholders without any
interference by the State or the Public Sector Companies. The petitioners
have also miserably failed to demonstrate that the respondent is performing
any public function or it participates in social and economic affairs in
public interest or works for the collective benefit of a section of the public.
Merely because the respondent/company has entered into a Loan
Agreement with the petitioners in the course of conducting commercial
transactions, will not make it amenable to writ jurisdiction when the said
loan has been extended as a part of its business activity.
</p><p id="p_22">22.   The judgments cited by learned counsel for the petitioners would also
not be of any avail. In the case of Mysore Paper Mills (supra), the Supreme
Court had held that the nature of the duty imposed on the body to be
adjudged in the light of the positive obligation owed by it to the affected
party, would be determinative of the question of issue of a writ of
mandamus to compel its performance and had gone on to observe that there
cannot be a straight-jacket formula for adjudging as to whether any person
or authority answers the description of „State‟ within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_59">Article
12</a>, for which it would be necessary to look into the constitution of the
body, the purpose for which it had been constituted, the manner of its
functioning including and the mode of its funding. Having applied the
aforesaid tests to the respondent herein, quite clearly, it is not amenable to
writ jurisdiction. The deep and pervasive control over the affairs of the
respondent, as alleged by learned counsel for the petitioners, is sorely

 missing in the present case. Therefore, the decision in the case of Radhey
Shyam Rai (supra) cannot have any application to the facts of this case.
</p><p id="p_23">23.   While there can be no quarrel with the legal principles on the
maintainability of a writ petition, as laid down by the Supreme Court in
ABL International Ltd. (supra), the caveat issued in the said case to the
High Courts with regard to imposition of certain restrictions on their
plenary powers to issue prerogative writs under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_60">Article 226</a>, cannot be lost
sight of. In any case, this Court has concluded that the respondent herein is
not a „State‟ or „any other person or authority‟. For the very same reason,
the underlying principles of the doctrine of promissory estoppel enunciated
by the Supreme Court in the case of Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills (supra)
and referred to by the petitioners cannot be invoked against the respondent.
Nor does the decision in Gujarat State Financial Corporation (supra) have
any application to the facts of the case at hand.
</p><p id="p_24">24.   The inevitable conclusion is that the petitioners are not entitled to
invoke <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_61">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India for relief against the
respondent. Instead, they ought to exhaust the alternate efficacious remedy
available to them under the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_62">SARFAESI Act</a>, as contemplated in Mardia
Chemicals (supra) and Satyawati Tondon (supra). Being a borrower, if the
petitioners have a grievance against the creditor, then they have a right to
ventilate same, but only before the forums that are available to them in law.
The term "authority" cannot be given such a wide meaning so as to take in
its ambit, the respondent herein, when the petitioners have failed to
demonstrate the nature of public function being discharged by it.

failure to do so, it shall exercise its rights to acquire 100% shares of the

<a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_66">Section 13(4)</a> of the SARFAESI Act. The court may hasten to clarify here
that after issuance of the notice under <a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_67">Section 13(4)</a> of the SARFAESI Act,
the Statute does not specify any timeline within which further action must

 be taken. In the case of Devi Ispat Ltd. vs. SBI reported as (2014) 5 SCC
762, it has been held that the remedy of a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_68">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution of India is in any case not available against a notice under
<a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_69">Section 13(2)</a> of the SARFAESI Act for the reason that an alternate remedy
of making a representation is available to the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_27">27.   In the present case, the petitioners had made a representation to the
respondent vide letter dated 27.10.2016, but the respondent/creditor has
rejected the same under <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_70">Section 13(3A)</a> of the SARFAESI Act.              The
reasons   for   rejecting   the   petitioners‟   representation   have   been
communicated by the respondent vide its reply dated 17.11.2016. In the
case of Mardia Chemicals (supra), it was clarified that a borrower "may not
be entitled to challenge the reasons communicated or the likely action of
the secured creditor at that point of time unless his right to approach the
Debt Recovery Tribunal as provided under <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_71">Section 17</a> of the Act, matures
on any measure having been taken under sub- section (4) of <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_72">Section 13</a> of
the Act". This being the legal position, as and when the respondent takes
any steps under <a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_73">Section 13(4)</a> of the SARFAESI Act, the petitioners will be
entitled to approach the Debt Recovery Tribunal for relief under <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_74">Section 17</a>
of the SARFAESI Act.
</p><p id="p_28">28.   Given the fact that the Statute lays down a step-by-step procedure for
the creditor to take action thereunder and remedies have been provided to
the debtor against such action, judicial prudence demands that this Court
must refrain from exercising its jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_75">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India. Any view to the contrary shall derail the procedure

 contemplated under the Statute and seriously impact the rights of financial
institutions like the respondent herein, to recover its dues.
</p><p id="p_29">29.   In view of the aforesaid fact and circumstances, the plea of the
petitioners that the respondent is amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High
Court is repelled. It is held that the present petition is not maintainable
against the respondent under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_76">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India as it is
neither a "State", or "any other person or authority" and nor is it
discharging any public or statutory duty. If they have a grievance against
the respondent, then the petitioners must seek recourse to proceedings under
the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_77">SARFAESI Act</a>, which provides for a special procedure for recovery of
debts due to the Banks and financial institutions, to be moved at the
appropriate stage.
</p><p id="p_30">30.   The present petition is accordingly dismissed as not maintainable,
alongwith the pending application, but with no orders as to costs.
