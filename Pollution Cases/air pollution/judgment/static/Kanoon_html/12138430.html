:COMMON ORDER

V.RAMASUBRAMANIAN,J
	All these writ petitions question the correctness of the orders passed
by the Southern Regional Bench of the National Green Tribunal dated
24.2.2014.
	2. We have heard Mr.T.Mohan and Mrs.U.Nirmala Rani, learned counsel
appearing for the petitioners, Mr.A.L.Somayaji, learned Advocate General
appearing for the State, Mr.R.Muthukumarasamy, learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority
(hereinafter referred to as the SEIAA), Mr.K.K.Senthilvelan, learned
Assistant Solicitor General appearing for the Union of India and Mr.M.Subash
Babu and Mr.V.Karuna learned counsel appearing for the parties, who seek to
implead themselves in the writ petitions.
	3. After intensive quarrying in the volumes and volumes of papers filed
before us, the factual matrix unearthed could be summarized as follows :
	(a)  In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) and clause
(v) of
sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_19">section 3</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, read
with clause (d) of sub-rule (3) of rule 5 of the Environment (Protection)
Rules, 1986, the Central Government issued The Environment Impact Assessment
(hereinafter referred to as the EIA) Notification, on 14.9.2006, directing
that on and from the date of its publication, the construction of new
projects or activities or the expansion or modernization of existing projects
or activities listed in the Schedule to the notification entailing capacity
addition with change in process and or technology, shall be undertaken in any
part of India only after the prior environmental clearance from the Central
Government or as the case may be, by the State Level Environment Impact
Assessment Authority, duly constituted by the Central Government under sub-
section (3) of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_20">section 3</a> of the said Act, in accordance with the procedure
specified hereinafter in this notification.
	(b) On 27.2.2012, the Supreme Court passed an order in Deepak Kumar and
Others Vs. State of Haryana &amp; Others [2012 (4) SCC 629]  holding that leases
of minor minerals as well as their renewal, be granted by the States/Union
Territories in certain cases only after getting environmental clearance.
	
	(c) On 3.8.2012, this Court passed an order in a batch of cases in W.P.
No.4699 of 2012 etc., mandating environmental clearance before commencement
of sand mining. The SEIAA was also directed to pass orders within 2 months on
the project proposal of the Public Works Department of the State Government.
	(d) Therefore, on 28.8.2012, a joint meeting was convened between the
SEIAA and the State Experts Appraisal Committee on formulation of interim
guidelines.
	(e) Thereafter, the SEIAA filed a petition for extension of time for
processing the proposal of the PWD. However, it was not effectively pursued.
	(f) But on 27.09.2012, the SEIAA issued a set of adhoc interim
guidelines for processing applications/project proposals, till the MOEF
issued revised guidelines. On the basis of those guidelines, the SEIAA also
granted Environmental Clearances to the Public Works Department of the State
of Tamilnadu on 30-11-2012 valid for a period of 5 years.
	(g) Consequently, the review applications filed by the Government
before this court, seeking a review of the order dated 3-8-2012 were
dismissed on 12.12.2012 and the copies of the environment clearances were
handed over to the concerned writ petitioners.
	(h) Challenging the said environment clearances, appeals were filed
before the National Green Tribunal, South Zone at Chennai in February 2013.
	(i) During the pendency of the appeals, the Ministry of Environment and
Forests (hereinafter referred to as the MoEF) issued revised guidelines on
24.12.2013 on sub-categorisation of B projects.
	(j) On 24.2.2014, the National Green Tribunal, Southern Regional Bench
disposed of all the appeals holding that after the issue of the revised
guidelines by the MoEF, the Public Works Department of the State has to get
clearance only under those guidelines and that since it would take time, the
State Government can continue to quarry for 6 months (that is upto 24-8-2014)
on the basis of the Environmental Clearances granted by the SEIAA.
	(k) As against the order of the Southern Regional Bench of the National
Green Tribunal dated 24.2.2014, the petitioners have come up with the above
writ petitions.
	4. The first batch of writ petitions were admitted on 23.4.2014 and we
ordered notice in the petitions for stay. After notice, we passed a very
limited order on 30.4.2014 in all the above writ petitions, (i) restraining
the respondents from carrying on in-stream mining and (ii) also restraining
the respondents from carrying on mechanized mining.
	5. As against the said order, the State filed civil appeals in Civil
Appeal Nos.5531 to 5548 of 2014. On 9.5.2014, the Supreme Court disposed of
the civil appeals, vacating the interim orders passed by us and directing the
High Court to dispose of the writ petitions finally. Therefore, the writ
petitions were taken up for hearing and we have heard all parties concerned.
	6. Before proceeding to consider the rival contentions on merits, it is
necessary to deal with the question of maintainability first.
MAINTAINABILITY :
	7. The National Green Tribunal was constituted in terms of the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_21">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010, with the object of
providing for the establishment of a Tribunal for the effective and
expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and
conservation of forests and other natural resources, including enforcement of
any legal right relating to environment. The Tribunal is supposed to consist
of (i) a full time Chairman; (ii) not less than 10 but subject to a maximum
of 20 full time Judicial Members; and (iii) not less than 10 but subject to a
maximum of 20 full time Expert Members.
	8. Under <a href="/doc/65335095/" id="a_22">Section 5(1)</a> of the Act, a person shall not be qualified for
appointment as the Chairperson or Judicial Member of the Tribunal unless he
is or has been a Judge of the Supreme Court or Chief Justice of a High Court.
However, the proviso to <a href="/doc/65335095/" id="a_23">Section 5(1)</a> states that a person, who is or who has
been a Judge of the High Court shall also be qualified to be appointed as a
Judicial Member.
	9. The Tribunal is conferred with both Original as well as Appellate
jurisdiction. Under <a href="/doc/174072768/" id="a_24">Section 14(1)</a>, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over all
civil cases where a substantial question relating to environment is involved
and such question arises out of the implementation of the Enactments
specified in Schedule-I. <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_25">Section 16</a> also confers Appellate jurisdiction on
the Tribunal, over the orders passed either by the Board or by the Appellate
Authority or by the State Government under the provisions of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_26">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. The Appellate jurisdiction
extends to any order passed under the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_27">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_28">Control of Pollution) Act</a> as well as the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_29">Environment
(Protection) Act</a>. The nature of the reliefs that could be granted by the
Green Tribunal is indicated in <a href="/doc/77055124/" id="a_30">Sections 15</a> and <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_31">17</a>. <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_32">Section 19</a> indicates that
the Tribunal shall not be bound by the procedure laid down by the Civil
Procedure Code, but shall be guided by the principles of natural justice. The
Tribunal can regulate its own  procedure and it is not bound by the rules of
evidence contained in the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_33">Evidence Act</a>. <a href="/doc/95877183/" id="a_34">Section 20</a> states that while passing
any order or taking any decision, the Tribunal should apply the principles of
sustainable development, precautionary principle and the polluter pays
principle.
	10. <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_35">Section 22</a> of the Act provides for a remedy of appeal to the
Supreme Court as against an order of the Tribunal. It reads as follows :
	"Any person aggrieved by any award, decision or order of the Tribunal,
may file an appeal to the Supreme Court, within ninety days from the date of
communication of the award, decision or order of the Tribunal, to him, on any
one or more of the grounds specified in Section 100 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) :
	Provided that the Supreme Court may entertain any appeal after the
expiry of ninety days, if it is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by
sufficient cause from preferring the appeal."
	 11. <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_36">Section 25</a> makes an award or order or decision of the National
Green Tribunal, executable as a decree of a civil court. <a href="/doc/159582911/" id="a_37">Section 29</a> bars the
jurisdiction of the civil court and it reads as follows :
	"(1) With effect from the date of establishment of the Tribunal under
this Act, no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any appeal in
respect of any matter, which the Tribunal is empowered to determine under its
appellate jurisdiction.
	(2) No civil court shall have jurisdiction to settle dispute or
entertain any question relating to any claim for granting any relief or
compensation or restitution of property damaged or environment damaged which
may be adjudicated upon by the Tribunal, and no injunction in respect of any
action taken or to be taken by or before the Tribunal in respect of the
settlement of such dispute or any such claim for granting any relief or
compensation or restitution of property damaged or environment damaged shall
be granted by the civil court."
	12. <a href="/doc/96367367/" id="a_38">Section 33</a> contains a declaration to the effect that the provisions
of the Act will have overriding effect and it reads as follows :
	"The provisions of this Act, shall have effect notwithstanding anything
inconsistent contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any
instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act."
	13. In the light of the above provisions, it is contended by the
learned Advocate General and Mr.R.Muthukumarasamy, learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the SEIAA that the writ petitions are not maintainable.
However, Mr.A.L. Somayaji, learned Advocate General also brought to our
notice that another Division Bench of this Court has held at least prima
facie that a writ petition challenging the order of the National Green
Tribunal is maintainable.
	14. This decision was in Vijayalakshmi Shanmugam Vs. Secretary to
Government [W.P.SR.Nos.7001, 7004 and 7006 of 2014] dated 4.2.2014. In the
said decision, the Division Bench relied upon the decision of the
Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in L.Chandrakumar Vs. Union of India
[1997 (3) SCC 261] and a decision of the Full Bench of this Court in Sanjos
Jewellers Vs. Syndicate Bank [2007 (5) CTC 305]. Moreover, in an order passed
by the Supreme Court in S.L.P.(Civil) Nos.27886 -27887 of 2012 arising out of
the orders of the Armed Forces Appellate Tribunal, the Supreme Court made it
clear that the pendency of the special leave petitions will not be an
impediment for the High Courts to entertain the writ petitions against the
orders of the Armed Forces Tribunal.
	15. Therefore, the learned Advocate General stated that the issue of
maintainability is not so far finally decided, either by this Court or by the
Supreme Court. Hence, we may have to deal with it in extenso, which we shall
do at present.
	16. The creation of every Tribunal or an alternative forum and the
exclusion of jurisdiction of normal civil courts have always given rise to a
vexed question about the nature and extent of ouster of jurisdiction of
courts. So long as the ouster of jurisdiction was confined only to the normal
civil courts, the issue did not assume larger proportions. But, the moment
the creation of a Tribunal led to the bar of jurisdiction of the
Constitutional Court itself, the question assumed greater significance.
	17. Part XIV-A with the heading "Tribunals" was inserted in The
Constitution, under The Constitution (42nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_39">Amendment) Act</a>, 1976. This part
comprises of two Articles namely 323A and 323B. While <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_40">Article 323A</a> empowered
the Parliament to create Administrative Tribunals, by law, for the
adjudication or trial of disputes and complaints with respect to recruitment
and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services and posts
in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any State or any local or
other authority, <a href="/doc/1249292/" id="a_41">Article 323B</a> empowers the Parliament to create Tribunals for
the resolution of any disputes, complaints or offenses with respect to
taxation, foreign exchange, labour dispute, land reforms, elections,
essential goods, etc.
	18. In pursuance of the power so vested under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_42">Article 323A</a>, the
Parliament enacted the <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_43">Administrative Tribunals Act</a>, 1985. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_44">The Act</a> created
the Tribunal as a substitute for the High Court and ousted the jurisdiction
of all courts including that of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_45">Article 226.</a> Therefore,
a challenge to the vires of the Act was made before the Supreme Court under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_46">Article 32</a> in S.P.Sampathkumar Vs. Union of India &amp; Others [1987 (1) SCC
124]. While upholding the validity of the Act, the Supreme Court pointed out
in S.P.Sampathkumar that to create a Tribunal as an additional forum, from
where the parties could go to the High Court, would certainly have been a
retrograde step. The only silver-lining indicated by the Supreme Court in
S.P.Sampathkumar was that certain things have to be done for making the
Administrative Tribunal a real substitute for the High Court, not only in
form and de jure, but also in content and de facto.
	19. After S.P.Sampathkumar, the next case to come up before the Supreme
Court was the one in R.K.Jain Vs. Union of India [1993 (4) SCC 119].  In the
said decision, K.Ramaswamy,J, in his independent opinion, indicated in
paragraph 67 that the Tribunals set up under Articles 323A and 323B of The
Constitution or under an Act of Legislature are creatures of the Statute and
that in no case can they claim the status of Judges of the High Court or
parity or claim to be substitutes. It would be of interest to note that the
learned Judge referred to the decision of the Constitution Bench in
S.P.Sampathkumar and still pointed out in paragraph 66 that what was meant by
the Court in S.P.Sampathkumar was that the Tribunals are created as an
institutional alternative mechanism to adjudicate service disputations. The
learned Judge held towards the end of paragraph 66 of the report in R.K.Jain
that ?this Court did not appear to have meant that the Tribunals are
substitutes of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of The
Constitution.? Consequently, the Bench pointed out in paragraph 70 that ?
judicial review is the basic and essential feature of the Indian
Constitutional Scheme entrusted to the Judiciary? and that ?it cannot be
dispensed with by creating a Tribunal under Articles 323A and 323B of The
Constitution.? The Court further held that ?any institutional mechanism or
Authority in negation of a judicial review is destructive of basic
structure.?
	20. An argument was advanced before the Supreme Court in R.K.Jain that
many of the Statutes creating such Tribunals either in terms of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_47">Article 323A</a>
or in terms of <a href="/doc/1249292/" id="a_48">Article 323B</a>, provided for a right of appeal to the Supreme
Court and that therefore, the High Court cannot exercise the power of
judicial review under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_49">Article 226.</a> But, the said argument was rejected in
clear terms by K.Ramaswamy,J in paragraph 76 of the report in R.K.Jain. The
relevant portion of paragraph 76 of the report in R.K.Jain reads as follows :
	?The remedy of appeal by special leave under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_50">Article 136</a> to this Court
also proves to be costly and prohibitive and far-flung distance too is
working a constant constraint to litigant public who could ill afford to
reach this Court. An appeal to a Bench of two Judges of the respective High
Courts over the orders of the Tribunals within its territorial jurisdiction
on questions of law would assuage a growing feeling of injustice of those who
can ill afford to approach the Supreme Court.?
Therefore, the argument that a remedy of appeal is available to the Supreme
Court was clearly rejected in R.K.Jain. A careful look at the majority
opinion rendered in R.K.Jain would show that they did not express any dissent
on the views expressed by K.Ramaswamy,J with regard to the availability of
the power of judicial review under Articles 226/227.
	21. After R.K.Jain came the decision of the Supreme Court in
L.Chandrakumar. In L.Chandrakumar, the Supreme Court held that the power of
judicial review over legislative action vested with the High Courts under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_51">Article 226</a> and the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_52">Article 32</a> is an integral and
essential feature of The Constitution, constituting part of its basic
structure. In paragraph 79, the Supreme Court specifically held that ?the
power vested in the High Courts to exercise judicial superintendence over the
decisions of all Courts and Tribunals within their respective jurisdictions
is also part of the basic structure of The Constitution.? As a consequence of
the aforesaid conclusion, the Larger Bench of the Supreme Court struck down
as unconstitutional, in L.Chandrakumar, Clause (2)(d) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_53">Article 323A</a> and
Clause (3)(d) of <a href="/doc/1249292/" id="a_54">Article 323B</a>, to the extent they excluded the jurisdiction
of the High Courts and the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court also declared as
unconstitutional, <a href="/doc/1290303/" id="a_55">Section 28</a> of the Administrative Tribunals Act, to the
extent that it excluded the jurisdiction of the High Court. More
specifically, the Larger Bench held in paragraph 99 as follows :
	?<a href="/doc/1290303/" id="a_56">Section 28</a> of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 and the
'exclusion of jurisdiction' Clauses in all other legislations enacted under
the aegis of Articles 323A and 323B are, to the same extent,
unconstitutional.?
	22. The Supreme Court emphasized in L.Chandrakumar that ?the
jurisdiction conferred upon the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 and
upon the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_57">Article 32</a> is a part of the inviolable basic
structure of The Constitution.?   In paragraphs 91 and 92, the Supreme Court
held as follows :
	"We may first address the issue of exclusion of the power of judicial
review of the High Courts. We have already held that in respect of the power
of judicial review, the jurisdiction of the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_58">Article 226</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_59">/227</a>
cannot wholly be excluded. It has been contended before us that the Tribunals
should not be allowed to adjudicate upon matters where the vires of
legislations is questioned and that they should restrict themselves to
handling matters where constitutional issues are not raised. We cannot bring
ourselves to agree to this proposition as that may result in splitting up
proceedings and may cause avoidable delay. If such a view were to be adopted,
it would be open for litigants to raise constitutional issues, many of which
may be quite frivolous, to directly approach the High Courts and thus subvert
the jurisdiction of the Tribunals. Moreover, even in these special branches
of law, some areas do involve the consideration of constitutional questions
on a regular basis; for instance, in service law matters, a large majority of
cases involve an interpretation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of The
Constitution. To hold that the Tribunals have no power to handle matters
involving constitutional issues would not serve the purpose for which they
were constituted. On the other hand, to hold that all such decisions will be
subject to the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Articles 226/227 of The
Constitution before a Division Bench of the High Court within whose
territorial jurisdiction the Tribunal concerned falls will serve two
purposes. While saving the power of judicial review of legislative action
vested in the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_60">Article 226</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_61">/227</a> of The Constitution, it will
ensure that frivolous claims are filtered out through the process of
adjudication in the Tribunal. The High Court will also have the benefit of a
reasoned decision on merits which will be of use to it in finally deciding
the matter.
	It has also been contended before us that even in dealing with cases
which are properly before the Tribunals, the manner in which justice is
dispensed by them leaves much to be desired. Moreover, the remedy provided in
the parent statutes, by way of an appeal by special leave under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_62">Article 136</a>
of The Constitution, is too costly and inaccessible for it to be real and
effective. Furthermore, the result of providing such a remedy is that the
docket of the Supreme Court is crowded with decisions of Tribunals that are
challenged on relatively trivial grounds and it is forced to perform the role
of a First Appellate Court. We have already emphasised the necessity for
ensuring that the High Courts are able to exercise judicial superintendence
over the decisions of Tribunals under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_63">Article 227</a> of The Constitution. In
R.K.Jain's case, after taking note of these facts, it was suggested that the
possibility of an appeal from the Tribunals on questions of law to a Division
Bench of a High Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the Tribunal
falls, be pursued. It appears that no follow-up action has been taken
pursuant to the suggestion. Such a measure would have improved matters
considerably. Having regard to both the afore-stated contentions, we hold
that all decisions  of Tribunals, whether created pursuant to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_64">Article 323A</a> or
<a href="/doc/1249292/" id="a_65">Article 323B</a> of The Constitution, will be subject to the High Court's writ
jurisdiction under Articles 226/227 of The Constitution, before a Division
Bench of the High Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the particular
Tribunal falls."
	23. It should be noted that though the Supreme Court was mainly
concerned with the scope of judicial review of the orders of the
Administrative Tribunals, the Supreme Court declared as unconstitutional, all
the 'exclusion of jurisdiction' clauses in all similar enactments. This is
perhaps the reason why the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_66">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, does not specifically
exclude the jurisdiction of the High Courts. <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_67">The National Green Tribunal Act</a>
specifically excludes the jurisdiction of the civil courts under <a href="/doc/115054998/" id="a_68">Section 29</a>,
but, it does not exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court. It nevertheless
provides for a right of appeal under <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_69">Section 22</a> to the Supreme Court. But,
this right of appeal provided to the Supreme Court has to be understood in
the context of the observations made in paragraph 76 of the decision in
R.K.Jain.
	24. After L.Chandrakumar, which emanated from Madras Bar, it was the
turn of the Delhi Bar in Union of India Vs. Delhi High Court Bar Association
[2002 (4) SCC 275]. The said case related to the challenge to the
constitutional validity of the Recovery of Debts due to Banks and Financial
Institutions Act, 1993. While upholding the validity of the Act, the Supreme
Court pointed out in paragraph 25 that the 1993 Act provided for a remedy of
appeal to an Appellate Tribunal, whose decision was also not final in view of
the fact that the same could be subjected to judicial review by the High
Court under Articles 226 and 227. In other words, one of the grounds, on
which the 1993 Act was saved was that the power of judicial review of the
High Court was not taken away by the creation of the Tribunal.
	25. In State of Karnataka Vs. Vishwabharathi House Building Cooperative
Society [2003 (2) SCC 412], the Supreme Court was concerned with the
constitutionality of the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_70">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986. After taking note of
various provisions of the Act, the Supreme Court pointed out in paragraph 41
that ?by reason of the provisions of the Act, the power of judicial review of
the High Court, which is a basic feature of The Constitution, has not been
nor could be taken away.? In paragraph 53 of its decision in Vishwabharathi,
the Supreme Court pointed out as follows :
	?The provisions relating to power to approach the   Appellate Court by
a party aggrieved by a decision of the Forums/State Commissions as also the
power of the High Court and this Court under Articles 226/227 of The
Constitution of India and <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_71">Article 32</a> of this Court apart from <a href="/doc/103424754/" id="a_72">Section 23</a> of
the Act provide for adequate safe-guards.?
	26. Therefore, it is clear from the decision of the Three Member Bench
of the Supreme Court in Vishwabharathi that the provision of a three tier
mechanism, the first at the District Level, the second at the State Level and
the third at the National Level, did not take away the power of judicial
review of this Court under Articles 226 and 227. This decision is of
significance, in view of the fact that the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_73">Consumer Protection Act</a> 1986
provides for a remedy of appeal to the State Consumer Commission against an
award of the District Consumer Forum and it also provides for a remedy of
further appeal against the order of the State Commission to the National
Commission. The provision of such a three tier mechanism alone was not taken
by the Supreme Court as sufficient to uphold the validity of the Act. The
availability of the power of judicial review to the High Court under Articles
226 and 227 was also taken as a factor by the Supreme Court for upholding the
validity of the Act.
	27. The next decision of the Supreme Court was that of a Nine Member
Bench in I.R.Coelho (dead) by L.Rs. Vs State of Tamilnadu [2007 (2) SCC 1].
What led to a reference to the Nine Judges Bench was the question as to
whether the protection afforded by <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_74">Article 31B</a> of The Constitution, was
available to the laws added to the 9th Schedule by way of amendments issued
after 24.4.1973, the date on which, the decision in Kesavananda Bharati Vs.
State of Kerala  [AIR 1973 SC 1461]  came. The necessity for such a reference
arose in view of the attempts made by the Parliament to include several laws
in the 9th Schedule, so as to get over the difficulty posed by the basic
structure theory propounded and accepted in Kesavananda Bharati. In
paragraphs 135 and 136 of its decision in I.R.Coelho, the Supreme Court dealt
with the question as to whether the exclusion of judicial review was
compatible with the doctrine of basic structure. It was held in paragraphs
135 and 136 as follows :
	?Exclusion of Judicial review if compatible with the doctrine of basic
structure ? concept of judicial review :
	135. Judicial review is justified by combination of 'the principle of
separation of powers, rule of law, the principle of constitutionality and the
reach of judicial review' (Democracy Through Law by Lord Styen, p.131).
	136. The role of the judiciary is to protect fundamental rights. A
modern democracy is based on the twin principles of majority rule and the
need to protect fundamental rights. According to Lord Styen, it is job of the
judiciary to balance the principles ensuring that the Government on the basis
of number does not override fundamental rights.?
	28. Though the decision of a Five Judges Bench of the Supreme Court in
State of West Bengal &amp; Others Vs. Committee for Protection of Democratic
Rights, West Bengal &amp; Others [2010 (3) SCC 571] arose in a different context
with regard to the power of the High Court to order an investigation by the
Central Bureau of Investigation, the Supreme Court considered in that case,
the question whether the power under Articles 226/227 was part of the basic
structure. In paragraph 39 of its decision, the Supreme Court pointed out
that the power of judicial review stands on a different pedestal and that
being part of the basic structure of The Constitution, it cannot be ousted or
abridged even by a Constitutional amendment. Again in paragraph 51, the Court
pointed out that the power of judicial review vested in the Supreme Court and
the High Courts is an integral part and essential feature of The
Constitution, constituting part of its basic structure. While eliciting the
conclusions that the Constitution Bench reached in the said decision, the
Supreme Court held in paragraphs 68(iii) and (v) as follows :
	?In view of the constitutional scheme and the jurisdiction conferred on
this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_75">Article 32</a> and on the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_76">Article 226</a> of The
Constitution the power of judicial review being an integral part of the basic
structure of The Constitution, no Act of Parliament can exclude or curtail
the powers of the constitutional courts with regard to the enforcement of
fundamental rights. As a matter of fact, such a power is essential to give
practicable content to the objectives of The Constitution embodied in Part
III and other parts of The Constitution. Moreover, in a federal constitution,
the distribution of legislative powers between Parliament and the State
Legislature involves limitation on legislative powers and therefore, this
requires an authority other than Parliament to ascertain whether such
limitations are transgressed. Judicial review acts as the final arbiter not
only to give effect to the distribution of legislative powers between
Parliament and the State Legislatures, it is also necessary to show any
transgression by each entity. Therefore, to borrow the words of Lord Steyn,
judicial review is justified by combination of 'the principles of separation
of powers, rule of law, the principle of constitutionality and the reach of
judicial review.'	
	....
</pre><p id="p_1">	Restriction on Parliament by The Constitution and restriction on the
Executive by Parliament under an enactment do not amount to restriction on
the power of the Judiciary under Articles 32 and 226 of The Constitution.?
</p>	
<p id="p_2"> 	29. In A.K.Behera Vs. Union of India &amp; another [2010 (11) SCC 322], the
decision of the Government of India to abolish the post of Vice Chairman of
the Central Administrative Tribunal and the insertion of <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_77">Section 10A</a> into the
<a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_78">Administrative Tribunals Act</a>, 1985 was under challenge. By a 2:1 majority,
the Supreme Court rejected the challenge. However, in his dissenting opinion,
Dalveer Bhandari,J indicated in paragraph 74 of the decision that the power
of judicial review is a basic and essential feature of The Constitution and
that no law passed by the Parliament can abrogate it or take it away. The
learned Judge pointed out that if the power of judicial review is abrogated
or taken away, The Constitution will cease to be what it is.
</p><p id="p_3">	30. In Indra Das Vs. State of Assam [2011 (3) SCC 380], the Supreme
Court was concerned with the conviction of a person under Section 3(5) of
Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act. In paragraph 24 of the
said decision, it was pointed out by the Court that the Constitution is the
highest law of the land and that no statute can violate it. If there is a
statute, which appears to violate The Constitution, the Court can either
declare it unconstitutional or read it down to make it constitutional.
</p><p id="p_4">	31. Therefore, from all the above decisions, it is quite clear that the
power of judicial review conferred upon this Court under Articles 226/227, is
part of the basic structure of The Constitution, which cannot be taken away
even by a law enacted by the Parliament. As a matter of fact, the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_79">National
Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 does not expressly exclude the jurisdiction of this
Court under Articles 226/227. Though it excludes the jurisdiction of the
normal civil courts under <a href="/doc/115054998/" id="a_80">Section 29</a>, there is no express exclusion of the
jurisdiction of this Court. The respondents seek to read into <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_81">Section 22</a> of
the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, an implied exclusion of the
jurisdiction of this Court. As we have pointed out earlier, <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_82">Section 22</a>
provides for a remedy of appeal to the Supreme Court, to any person aggrieved
by any award, decision or order of the Tribunal. As seen from the language of
<a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_83">Section 22</a>, the appeal is almost like a second appeal on a substantial
question of law.
</p><p id="p_5">	32. As we have pointed out earlier, the National Green Tribunal
exercises both Original jurisdiction (under <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_84">Section 14</a>) as well as Appellate
jurisdiction (under <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_85">Section 16</a>). Irrespective of whether an order passed by
the National Green Tribunal was in its Original or Appellate jurisdiction,
the right of appeal to the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_86">Section 22</a> is put to the same
tests as that of a Second Appeal under Section 100 of the Civil Procedure
Code.
</p><p id="p_6">	33. As a matter of fact, <a href="/doc/115054998/" id="a_87">Section 29</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act,
bars the jurisdiction of the civil courts. It can be compared with the
language of <a href="/doc/1290303/" id="a_88">Section 28</a> of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 as it stood
before the decision of the Supreme Court in L.Chandrakumar. <a href="/doc/1290303/" id="a_89">Section 28</a> of the
Administrative Tribunals Act, read as follows  :
</p><p id="p_7">	?Exclusion of jurisdiction of courts except the Supreme Court under
<a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_90">Article 136</a> of The Constitution :
</p><p id="p_8">	On and from the date from which any jurisdiction, powers and authority
becomes exercisable under this Act by a Tribunal in relation to recruitment
and matters concerning recruitment to any service or post or service matters
concerning members of any service or persons appointed to any service or
post, no court except, (a) the Supreme Court; or (b) any Industrial Tribunal,
Labour Court or other authority constituted under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_91">Industrial Disputes
Act</a>, 1947 (14 of 1947) or any other corresponding law for time being in
force, shall have or be entitled to exercise any jurisdiction, powers or
authority in relation to such recruitment or matters concerning such
recruitment or such service matters.?
</p><p id="p_9">	34. As we have pointed out earlier, the Supreme Court not merely struck
down Clause (2)(d) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_92">Article 323A</a> and Clause (3)(d) of <a href="/doc/1249292/" id="a_93">Article 323B</a>, but
also struck down <a href="/doc/1290303/" id="a_94">Section 28</a> of the Administrative Tribunals Act, to the
extent it excluded the jurisdiction of this Court under Articles 226/227. The
Constitution Bench did not stop there. The Supreme Court went to the extent
of declaring all 'exclusion of jurisdiction' clauses in all similar
enactments also as unconstitutional.
</p><p id="p_10">	35. Therefore, if the Parliament had actually included in <a href="/doc/115054998/" id="a_95">Section 29</a> of
the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, a specific exclusion of the
jurisdiction of the High Courts under Articles 226/227, the same would have
been hit by the express declaration made in L.Chandrakumar. If an express
exclusion could have been burnt to ashes in the fire ignited in
L.Chandrakumar, we do not know how an implied exclusion could survive.
</p><p id="p_11">	36. However, Mr.R.Muthukumarasamy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for
the SEIAA, relied upon two decisions of the Supreme Court, one in T.Sudhakar
Prasad Vs. Government of A.P. [2001 (1) SCC 516] and another in R.Mohajan Vs.
Shefali Sengupta [2012 (4) SCC 761].
</p><p id="p_12">	37. In T.Sudhakar Prasad, the Supreme Court was concerned with two
fundamental questions. One was as to whether the Administrative Tribunals
have the power to punish a person for its contempt. The second question was
whether, after the decision in L.Chandrakumar, <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_96">Section 17</a> of the
Administrative Tribunals Act survived or had been rendered otiose.
</p><p id="p_13">	38. The facts leading to the decision of the Supreme Court in
T.Sudhakar Prasad are note worthy. In that case, an application was filed
before the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal under <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_97">Section 17</a> of the
Administrative Tribunals Act, invoking its contempt jurisdiction. The
Tribunal issued notice and the State of Andhra Pradesh challenged before the
High Court, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to take cognizance of the
alleged contempt. In yet another matter, a contempt petition was filed
directly on the file of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, complaining of
willful disobedience of the order of the Andhra Pradesh Administrative
Tribunal, ignoring <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_98">Section 17</a> of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985. When
both the matters were taken up together by a Division Bench of the Andhra
Pradesh High Court, the High Court held that after the decision of the
Supreme Court in L.Chandrakumar, <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_99">Section 17</a> of the Administrative Tribunals
Act did not survive and that consequently the Administrative Tribunals cannot
exercise contempt jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_100">Section 17</a>. The High Court further held
that a person, complaining of disobedience of the orders of the
Administrative Tribunal, could as well approach the High Court under the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_101">Contempt of Courts Act</a>, 1971, which empowers the High Court
to punish a person for contempt of orders of the Subordinate Courts.
</p><p id="p_14">	39. Aggrieved by the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, the
employee went on appeal to the Supreme Court. After taking note of the
discussion in L.Chandrakumar, the Supreme Court held in paragraph 17 as
follows :
</p><p id="p_15">	?The Supreme Court in the case of L.Chandrakumar has nowhere said that
orders of the Tribunal holding the contemner guilty and punishing for
contempt shall also be subject to judicial scrutiny of the High Court under
Articles 226/227 of The Constitution in spite of remedy of statutory appeal
provided by <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_102">Section 19</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act being available. The
distinction between orders passed by the Administrative Tribunal on matters
covered by <a href="/doc/1215634/" id="a_103">Section 14(1)</a> of the Administrative Tribunals Act and orders
punishing for contempt under <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_104">Section 19</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act read
with <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_105">Section 17</a> of the Administrative Tribunals Act, is this : as against the
former there is no remedy of appeal statutorily provided, but as against the
latter statutory remedy of appeal is provided by <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_106">Section 19</a> of the Contempt
of Courts Act itself.?
</p><p id="p_16">	40. The aforesaid decision rendered by a Three Member Bench in
T.Sudhakar Prasad was followed by the Supreme Court in R.Mohajan. After
extracting the decision in T.Sudhakar Prasad, the Supreme Court held in
R.Mohajan that as against a notice issued by the Central Administrative
Tribunal in exercise of its contempt jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_107">Section 17</a> of the
Administrative Tribunals Act, an appeal to the Supreme Court would directly
lie.
</p><p id="p_17">	41. Therefore, it is contended by Mr.R.Muthukumarasamy, learned Senior
Counsel for the SEIAA that cases where a statutory remedy of appeal is
provided, would stand on a different footing than cases where no such
statutory remedy of appeal is provided. According to the learned Senior
Counsel, a statutory remedy of appeal to the Supreme Court is provided by
<a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_108">Section 22</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 and that therefore, the
ratio laid down in L.Chandrakumar may not apply to orders passed by the
National Green Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_18">	42. But, we do not think that it is the correct way of understanding
the decision in T.Sudhakar Prasad. In paragraph 19 of its decision in
T.Sudhakar Prasad, the Supreme Court clarified that ?jurisdiction should not
be confused with status and subordination.? After drawing such a fine
distinction, the Supreme Court nevertheless pointed out towards the end of
paragraph 19 that there is no anathema to the Tribunal exercising the
jurisdiction of the High Court and in that sense, being supplemental or
additional to the High Court, but at the same time not enjoying the status
equivalent to the High Court and also being subject to judicial review and
judicial superintendence of the High Court.
</p><p id="p_19">	43. If we have a careful look at <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_109">Sections 17</a> and <a href="/doc/1290303/" id="a_110">28</a> of the
Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, it would be clear that any order passed
by the Administrative Tribunal under <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_111">Section 17</a>, would have been amenable to
the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/1290303/" id="a_112">Section 28</a>, before L.Chandrakumar
read down <a href="/doc/1290303/" id="a_113">Section 28</a>. The only difference brought forth by L.Chandrakumar was
that if a person had been punished under <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_114">Section 17</a> of the Administrative
Tribunals Act, 1985, he could have challenged the same under Articles 226/227
of The Constitution, without invoking the remedy under <a href="/doc/1962259/" id="a_115">Section 19</a> also.
</p><p id="p_20">	44. What the Supreme Court took exception to, in T.Sudhakar Prasad was
the decision reached by the Andhra Pradesh High Court that <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_116">Section 17</a> of the
Administrative Tribunals Act had also been rendered otiose by the decision in
L.Chandrakumar. In L.Chandrakumar, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme
Court merely struck down two Sub-Clauses of Articles 323A and 323B and read
down <a href="/doc/1290303/" id="a_117">Section 28</a> of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985. The Supreme Court
did not hold in L.Chandrakumar that the power under <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_118">Section 17</a> was not
available to the Administrative Tribunals. But, the Andhra Pradesh High Court
read into the decision of the Supreme Court in L.Chandrakumar that <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_119">Section 17</a>
had also been rendered redundant. This is why the Supreme Court clarified in
T.Sudhakar Prasad that <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_120">Section 17</a> survived despite L.Chandrakumar and that if
<a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_121">Section 17</a> survived, the remedy of appeal under <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_122">Section 19</a> of the Contempt of
Courts Act also survived. If the power under <a href="/doc/359317/" id="a_123">Section 17</a> of the Administrative
Tribunals Act survived despite L.Chandrakumar and if the right of appeal
under <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_124">Section 19</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act also survived as a
consequence, then there was only one question left open to be decided. It was
as to whether a person can directly go to the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_125">Section 19</a>
of the Contempt of Courts Act or should first go before the High Court under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_126">Article 226.</a> On this question, the answer is too obvious to state. The
statutory remedy of appeal under <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_127">Section 19</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act,
provided a larger scope for canvassing the correctness of an order punishing
a person for contempt. The jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 is
confined only to the parameters, on which, a judicial review is permissible
under The Constitution. Therefore, the Supreme Court came to the conclusion
in T.Sudhakar Prasad that it is not possible to exclude the availability of a
larger right statutorily conferred, on the ground of availability of a lesser
right in terms of the power of superintendence conferred upon this Court.
</p><p id="p_21">	45. For understanding the decision of the Supreme Court in T.Sudhakar
Prasad, it is necessary to have a look at <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_128">Section 19</a> of the Contempt of
Courts Act, 1971 and have the same compared with <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_129">Section 22</a> of the National
Green Tribunal Act, 2010. <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_130">Section 19</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act reads as
follows :
</p><p id="p_22">	?Appeals. (1) An appeal shall lie as of right from any order or
decision of High Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction to punish for
contempt-
</p><p id="p_23"> 	(a) where the order or decision is that of a single Judge, to a Bench
of not less than two Judges of the Court ;
</p><p id="p_24"> 	(b) where the order or decision is that of a Bench, to the Supreme
Court :
</p><p id="p_25"> 	Provided that where the order or decision is that of the Court of the
Judicial Commissioner in any Union territory, such appeal shall lie to the
Supreme Court.
</p><p id="p_26">	(2) Pending any appeal, the appellate court may order that-
</p><p id="p_27">	(a) the execution of the punishment or order appealed against be
suspended ;
</p><p id="p_28"> 	(b) if the appellant is in confinement, he be released on bail and
</p><p id="p_29">	(c) the appeal be heard notwithstanding that the appellant has not
purged his contempt.
</p><p id="p_30"> 	(3) Where any person aggrieved by any order against which an appeal may
be filed satisfies the High Court that he intends to prefer an appeal, the
High Court may also exercise all or any of the powers conferred by sub-
section (2).
</p><p id="p_31"> 	(4) An appeal under sub-section (1) shall be filed-
</p><p id="p_32">	(a) in the case of an appeal to a Bench of the High Court, within
thirty days ;
</p><p id="p_33"> 	(b) in the case of an appeal to the Supreme Court, within sixty days,
from the date of the order appealed against.?
</p><p id="p_34">	46. We have already extracted <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_131">Section 22</a> of the National Green Tribunal
Act, 2010. We have also pointed out that the right of appeal under <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_132">Section 22</a>
of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 is subject to a very serious
restriction namely that it should pass the same test as stipulated in Section
100 of the Civil Procedure Code namely the existence of a substantial
question of law. But, an appeal under <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_133">Section 19</a> of the Contempt of Courts
Act, 1971 is as a matter of right. As can be seen from the language employed
in <a href="/doc/1220932/" id="a_134">Section 19(1)</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, an appeal shall lie ?as
of right?.
</p><p id="p_35">	47. Therefore, the distinction between cases arising under <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_135">Section 19</a>
of the Contempt of Courts Act and those arising under <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_136">Section 22</a> of the
National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, is too easy to be seen and deciphered.
What is conferred by <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_137">Section 19</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 is a
right, the exercise of which does not depend upon any discretion in the
matter of admission of the appeal. In contrast, what is conferred by <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_138">Section
22</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 , is only a remedy, the
availability of which is subject to very serious restrictions and discretion.
The availability of a remedy, which is subject to serious restrictions,
cannot be equated to a right conferred by the Statute. In T.Sudhakar Prasad,
the Andhra Pradesh High Court interpreted the decision of the Supreme Court
in L.Chandrakumar in such a manner as to extinguish a statutory right and
elevate a discretionary remedy. This is why the Supreme Court stepped in to
clear the air of confusion.
</p><p id="p_36">	48. As we have pointed out earlier, the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_139">National Green Tribunal Act</a>,
2010 contains two provisions, one in <a href="/doc/943860/" id="a_140">Section 22</a> and another in <a href="/doc/248520/" id="a_141">Section 29</a>,
with the former providing for a remedy of appeal and the latter barring the
jurisdiction of civil courts and not Constitutional Courts. What the
respondents want us to do is to read into <a href="/doc/943860/" id="a_142">Section 22</a>, an exclusion of
jurisdiction of this Court under Articles 226 and 227. <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_143">If the National Green
Tribunal Act</a> itself had contained a specific provision excluding the
jurisdiction of this Court under Articles 226 and 227, the same would have
been obviously invalid in view of the specific declaration made in
L.Chandrakumar. If an express exclusion, assuming that it had been provided,
cannot be saved, we do not know how an implied exclusion could be saved. In
view of the above, we reject the objections made by the respondents to the
maintainability of the writ petitions.
</p><p id="p_37">ON MERITS :
</p><p id="p_38">	49. Having settled the question of maintainability of the writ
petitions, let us now move on to the merits.
</p><p id="p_39">	50. At the cost of repetition, the brief facts that led to the impugned
order of the National Green Tribunal, are summarized with reference to
certain historic facts, as follows :
</p><p id="p_40">	(a) By an order dated 26.7.2002 passed in a contempt petition in
Cont.P.No. 561 of 2001, arising out of a writ petition in W.P.No.985 of 2000,
this Court directed the State Government to constitute a Committee of Experts
comprising of Geologists, Environmentalists and Scientists to study the river
and river beds in the State with particular reference to the damage caused on
account of indiscriminate sand quarrying operations;	
</p><p id="p_41">	(b) Accordingly, the Government constituted a Six Member High Level
Committee. On the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee, the
Government inserted Rule 38A of the Tamilnadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules,
whereby all existing leases for quarrying sand in Government lands and the
permissions granted in ryotwari lands ceased to be effective from 2.10.2003.
The right to quarry sand vested with the Government. Therefore, on and from
2.10.2003, all sand quarries in Government lands started getting operated
only by the Public Works Department;
</p><p id="p_42">	(c) The validity of Rule 38A was upheld by the Supreme Court in State

</p><p id="p_44">	(e) In the year 2010, a batch of writ petitions came to be filed on the
file of the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court in W.P.(MD).No.11182 of
2010 batch of cases, with regard to indiscriminate sand quarrying operations
in the river Tamirabarani. By a common order dated 2.12.2010, a Division
Bench of this Court issued certain directions, which were applicable also to
the quarrying of sand in the other rivers of the State of Tamilnadu. One of
the directions issued in paragraph 86 of the said decision was that no
poclain or other heavy machinery should be used for sand quarrying and that
an amendment in this regard should be made to the Rules within six months;
</p><p id="p_45">	(f) The Government came up with an application for review of the order.
Considering the request, the Division Bench of this Court, by an order dated
10.1.2011, modified its earlier order dated 2.12.2010 and permitted two
poclains to be used, during restricted timings.
</p><p id="p_46">	(g) Thereafter, a batch of writ petitions came to be filed in
W.P.(MD).Nos. 4699 of 2012 etc. cases, praying for the issue of Writs of
Mandamus to forbear the respondents from carrying on sand quarrying
operations along side the stretches of the rivers of Cauvery and Kollidam in
Karur, Trichy, Thanjavur, Nagapattinam and Thiruvarur Districts. In the
course of hearing of those writ petitions, the Government pointed out that
there were about 42 sand quarrying operators operating in the river Cauvery
across five districts namely Karur, Trichy, Thanjavur, Thiruvarur and
Nagapattinam. Therefore, this Court directed the District Collectors of those
five districts to file independent reports giving details about the quarries
in operation. Accordingly, those details were filed by the District
Collectors. 	
</p><p id="p_47">	(h) Thereafter, the Division Bench of this Court disposed of the said
writ petitions by a common order dated 3.8.2012. The effect of the order of
the Division Bench was that permission for fresh sand quarrying operations in
the river Cauvery could be granted by the State Government only after getting
environmental clearance from the SEIAA, as per the Notification on the EIA
dated 14.9.2006 and the Office Memorandum of the MoEF dated 18.5.2012. The
Bench directed some of the existing quarries to be either stopped for ever or
to be started after getting environmental clearance. The Bench also directed
that quarrying operations are to be carried out only between 7 AM and 5 PM,
in areas specifically earmarked by the Public Works Department. The Bench
further directed the SEIAA to consider the applications of the State
Government/Public Works Department for appropriate permission and to pass
orders within a period of two months from the date of receipt of the
applications.
</p><p id="p_48">	(i) It appears that in pursuance of the said order, the Public Works
Department started filing project proposals before the SEIAA. Since the
Division Bench granted only two months' time to the SEIAA for processing
those applications and for passing orders, the SEIAA appears to have sent a
letter to the Secretary to Government, MoEF, Government of India on
21.8.2012, requesting them to issue guidelines for processing the
applications and project proposals. It was followed by another letter dated
30.8.2012 making a similar request on the ground that the time fixed by the
High Court was running out.
</p><p id="p_49">	(j) By a communication dated 27.9.2012, the SEIAA informed the MoEF
that in the absence of any guidelines issued by the MoEF, the SEIAA itself
would adopt certain guidelines. The guidelines sought to be adopted by the
SEIAA as an interim measure and which were indicated in their letter dated
27.9.2012 to the MoEF, are as follows : 	
</p><p id="p_50">	"(i) All mining projects wherein the boundary of the proposed mining
area is at least 1.0 KM away form the human habitation/other sensitive areas
will be considered for sanction of Environmental Clearance subject to
satisfaction of other guidelines.
</p><p id="p_51">	(ii) If the boundary of the proposed mining area is less than 1.0 KM,
the SEAC will inspect the site and assess the various environmental impacts
and then recommend/ reject with specific conditions/reasons.
</p><p id="p_52">	(iii) In case, if the proposed mining area is less than 25.0 Hec, it
will be considered as B2 category with Environmental Management Plan, and
processed further.
</p><p id="p_53">	(iv) In case, if the proposed mining area is more than 25.0 Hec, it
will be considered as B1 category, which will require preparation of the EIA
as per revised model TORs issued by MoEF, Government of India and Public
Hearing will be undertaken and the same will be examined in detail for taking
a decision on the issue of Environmental Clearance, strictly adhering to
Government of India guidelines."
</p><p id="p_54">Thereafter, finding no response from the MoEF, the SEIAA granted
environmental clearances on 30.11.2012, on the basis of the above adhoc
guidelines.
</p><p id="p_55">	(k) These clearances granted on 30.11.2012 by the SEIAA to the
Executive Engineer of the Public Works Department of the Government of
Tamilnadu were challenged by various Farmers' Associations and
Environmentalists by way of appeals in Appeal Nos.64 to 69, 73 to 76 and 78
to 89 of 2013, under <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_144">Section 16</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.
During the pendency of these appeals, the MoEF issued a fresh Notification
dated 24.12.2013. Therefore, these guidelines were placed before the National
Green Tribunal, in the course of hearing.
</p><p id="p_56">	(l) Thereafter, the National Green Tribunal disposed of all the appeals
by a common order dated 24.2.2014, holding that in view of the guidelines
issued by the MoEF on 24.12.2013, the guidelines issued by the SEIAA and the
environmental clearances granted on the basis of those guidelines actually
lapsed. However, considering the economic and social needs and public
interest at large, the National Green Tribunal allowed the State Government
to continue quarrying operations for a period of six months on the basis of
the environmental clearances granted by the SEIAA and on the basis of the of
the guidelines framed by them on 27.9.2012.
</p><p id="p_57">	(m) In the meantime, the Public Works Department was directed by the
Tribunal to make fresh applications to the MoEF as per the guidelines dated
24.12.2013 and obtain clearances in accordance with law. The operative
portion of the order of the Southern Regional Bench of the Green Tribunal
requires reproduction. Hence, it is reproduced as follows :
	"In view of the economic and social needs and public interest at large,
the environmental clearances originally granted by the 2nd respondent/State
Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority based on the adhoc guidelines
shall continue for a period of six months with a direction to the 4th
respondent to make necessary applications for obtaining environmental
clearances based on the new guidelines issued by the MoEF which have come
into force from 24.12.2013. The Authorities issuing environmental clearances
are directed to process the applications following the new guidelines cited
above as per law for the grant of environmental clearances.
	During the period of six months, the adhoc arrangements have to
continue and the 4th respondent are directed to strictly follow and ensure
the compliance of conditions attached to the environmental clearances. This
order will apply only to the sand quarries which are in operation pursuant to
the grant of impugned environmental clearances."
</p><p id="p_58">	51. Neither the Executive Engineer of the Public Works Department nor
the SEIAA nor the Lorry Owners' Association, which has come up with an
application for impleading, probably as a co-sponsor, have come up with any
writ petition against the order of the National Green Tribunal dated
24.2.2014. None of them have also gone to the Supreme Court by way of an
appeal under <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_145">Section 22</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. Therefore,
it is clear that the State Government, the SEIAA as well as the Lorry Owners'
Association have accepted the verdict of the Southern Regional Bench of the
National Green Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_59">	52. The consequence of the State Government and the SEIAA not
challenging the order of the Green Tribunal dated 24.2.2014 is of great
significance. The significance is that the State Government as well as the
SEIAA are now bound by the order of the Green Tribunal. By the said order,
the National Green Tribunal allowed the Executive Engineer of the Public
Works Department to carry on sand quarrying operations, as per the
environmental clearances granted by the SEIAA, only for a period of six
months. This period of six months will expire on 23.8.2014. Before the said
date, namely 23.8.2014, the Public Works Department is supposed, by the order
of the Green Tribunal, to approach the MoEF for environmental clearances
afresh.
</p><p id="p_60">	53. But, according to the learned Advocate General, the Public Works
Department has not so far filed any application before the MoEF for
environmental clearances in terms of the guidelines issued by them on
24.12.2013. Therefore, it is admitted by Mr.R.Muthukumarasamy, learned Senior
Counsel appearing for the SEIAA that the Public Works Department of the State
cannot continue quarrying operations as per the order of the Green Tribunal,
beyond 24.8.2014.  This date is hardly one month away from now.
</p><p id="p_61">	54. In other words, out of the total period of six months granted by
the National Green Tribunal (perhaps as a moratorium) to the Public Works
Department, a period of five months has already expired. The Public Works
Department of the State has enjoyed the fruits of the order of the National
Green Tribunal for five months out of the period of six months granted by
them and they have not taken any steps to get environmental clearance beyond
24.8.2014 in accordance with the new guidelines.
</p><p id="p_62">	55. Mr.A.L.Somayaji, learned Advocate General contended that though
with the issue of the guidelines dated 24.12.2013 by the MoEF of the
Government of India, the adhoc guidelines issued by the SEIAA on 27.9.2012
would have lapsed, the environmental clearances granted by the SEIAA in terms
of those adhoc guidelines would not lapse. In other words, he tried to
contend that the environmental clearances granted on 30.11.2012 by the SEIAA
in terms of their adhoc guidelines would survive for a full period of five
years (upto 31-10-2017), despite the adhoc guidelines themselves facing a
natural death.
</p><p id="p_63">	56. But, Mr.R.Muthukumaraswamy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for
the SEIAA did not agree with the above contention. In response to a pointed
query made by us, the learned Senior Counsel conceded that such an argument
as advanced by the learned Advocate General was not raised before the
National Green Tribunal. The National Green Tribunal did not opine that the
environmental clearances granted by the SEIAA on 30.11.2012 would survive. As
a matter of fact, the National Green Tribunal was of the view that the
environmental clearances granted on 30.11.2012 by the SEIAA in terms of its
own adhoc guidelines dated 27.9.2012, perished, the moment the MoEF issued
the guidelines dated 24.12.2013. This is why the National Green Tribunal
assumed to itself the power to grant a new lease of life to the already dead
licenses, for a period of six months from 24.2.2014 upto 23.8.2014, to enable
the State to make applications in terms of the MoEF notification dated 24-12-
2013. Since the State Government has accepted the order of the National Green
Tribunal, it is not open to the State Government to contend that despite the
order of the Green Tribunal, the environmental clearances obtained by them
will survive upto the year 2017.
</p><p id="p_64">	57. Before we proceed to test the correctness of the order of the
National Green Tribunal, we may have to take note of one more development
that had taken place in the recent past. It appears that certain applications
were filed before the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal, sitting
in Circuit at Shimla, challenging the Notification of the MoEF dated
24.12.2013. The Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal appears to
have passed an order on 28.3.2014, staying the operation of the Office
Memorandum dated 24.12.2013. The order of the Principal Bench of the National
Green Tribunal reads as follows :
</p><p id="p_65">	"We have heard learned counsel appearing for the parties.
	The Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) has not been able to
explain as to how the Office Memorandum dated 24th December 2013 is in
conformity with the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's
case, order of the NGT and the Notification dated 9th September 2013 issued
by the MoEF itself. We do not think that the MoEF could have issued such
memorandum.
</p><p id="p_66">	The Notification issued by the MoEF is an act of subordinate
legislation and was issued in exercise of statutory powers. The Office
Memorandum is an administrative order and cannot frustrate the legislative
act. In fact, it falls beyond the scope of administrative powers.
Consequently, we stay the operation and effect of the order of Office
Memorandum dated 24th December 2013. In so far as it relates to the minor
minerals like sand etc., list these matters on 30th May 2014 for hearing."
</p><p id="p_67">	58. Therefore, on the basis of the order of the Principal Bench of the
National Green Tribunal staying the operation of the MoEF Notification dated
24.12.2013, it was contended that the environmental clearances cannot be
obtained as per the order of the Green Tribunal impugned in these writ
petitions.
</p><p id="p_68">	59. But, we do not think that we can resolve the said problem. If the
State Government is of the opinion that they may not be now able to apply for
environmental clearances as per the Notification of the MoEF dated 24.12.2013
and in pursuance of the order of the Green Tribunal dated 24.2.2014, they
should only take it up with the Principal Bench of the National Green
Tribunal, for vacating the order of stay. Therefore, as things stand today,
there is no escape from the conclusion that once we dismiss all the writ
petitions, the order of the Green Tribunal dated 24.2.2014, which is impugned
in all these writ petitions, will continue to bear fruit for the State
Government only upto 23.8.2014 and not thereafter.
</p><p id="p_69">CONTENTIONS ON MERITS :
</p><p id="p_70">CONTENTION 1:
</p><p id="p_71">	60. It is contended by Mr.T.Mohan, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner in the first batch of writ petitions, that as per the EIA
Notification dated 14.9.2006, issued by the MoEF, in exercise of the powers
conferred by Sub-Section (1) and Clause (v) of Sub-Section (2) of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_146">Section 3</a>
of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, environmental clearances for
mining minor minerals in an area of more than 50 hectares, classified as
category A projects, have to be obtained from the MoEF. If the area in
question is of the extent of more than 5 hectares but less than 50 hectares,
the project for mining minor minerals in those areas are classified as
category B projects, for which, environmental clearances could be obtained
from the SEIAA.
</p><p id="p_72">	61. Though the Notification on EIA dated 14.9.2006 came into force on
14.9.2006, the State of Tamilnadu did not take care to obtain environmental
clearances, till this Court issued a mandate on 3.8.2012 in a batch of writ
petitions in W.P.Nos.4699 of 2012 etc.cases. Thereafter, the Public Works
Department applied for clearances to the SEIAA. Under the pretext of
complying with this Court's directions, SEIAA framed draft guidelines on
27.9.2012. Under these draft guidelines, the SEIAA sub-classified category B
projects into B1 and B2 projects. Quarries in an area of less than 25
hectares were categorized as B2 projects and quarries in an area of more than
25 hectares were classified as B1 projects. Therefore, in essence, the
contention of Mr.T.Mohan, learned counsel for the petitioner is that SEIAA
usurped the power of the MoEF.
</p><p id="p_73">	62. The usurpation powers by the SEIAA are sought to be defended on two
grounds, namely
</p><p id="p_74">	(a) that they were racing against the time limit of 2 months fixed by
this Court in its common order dated 3.8.2012 for framing guidelines and
examining the proposals of the State Government; and
</p><p id="p_75">	(b) that the SEIAA of the Andhra Pradesh as well as other States have
issued similar adhoc guidelines.
</p><p id="p_76">	63. But, we do not think that the SEIAA can, under any pretext,
actually usurp the powers not conferred upon it. This can be well appreciated
only if we have a look at the source of power for the SEIAA. The SEIAA was
actually constituted in terms of paragraph 3 of the Notification on EIA dated
14.9.2006 issued by the Central Government in exercise of the power conferred
under <a href="/doc/1284544/" id="a_147">Section 3(1)(v)</a> and <a href="/doc/68770664/" id="a_148">Section 3(2)</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act,
1986 read with Clause (d) of Sub-Rule 3 of Rule 5 of the Environment
(Protection) Rules, 1986. Since the SEIAA is a creature of the Notification
on EIA, the source of power flows only out of the Notification and not
otherwise.
</p><p id="p_77">	64. It is under the very same Notification on EIA dated 14.9.2006
(paragraph 4) that all projects and activities are broadly classified into A
and B categories, based on (i) the spatial extent of potential impacts and
</p><p id="p_78">(ii) potential impacts on human health and natural and man made resources.
The Schedule to the Notification on EIA dated 14.9.2006 contains a Table that
lists out (i) the projects or activities; (ii) the category to which, each of
them belongs; and (iii) the conditions that would apply. In so far as the
mining of minerals is concerned, it is covered by S.No.1(a) of the Table
given in the Schedule to the Notification on EIA dated 14.9.2006.
</p><p id="p_79">	65. In Column Nos.3 and 4 of the Table under the Schedule to the
Notification on EIA, it is indicated as against S.No.1(a) that mining of
minerals in a lease area of 50 hectares and above would be categorized as A
projects and mining of minerals in a lease area of 5 hectares and above, but
below 50 hectares would be categorized as B projects. In Column No.5 of the
same Table, it is made clear that general conditions would apply to both A
and B category projects. Below the Table, under the Schedule to the
Notification, there is a note, which indicates general condition as well as
specific condition. The general condition reads as follows :
	"Any project or activity specified in Category B will be treated as
Category A, if located in whole or in part within 10 Kms from the boundary of
</p><p id="p_80">(i) protected areas notified under the <a href="/doc/1781078/" id="a_149">Wild Life (Protection) Act</a>, 1972; (ii)
critically polluted areas as notified by the Central Pollution Control Board
from time to time; (iii) notified eco-sensitive areas; (iv) Inter State and
International boundaries."
</p><p id="p_81"> 	66. Paragraph 4(iii) of the Notification on EIA dated 14.9.2006 makes
it clear that all projects or activities included as Category B in the
Schedule will require prior environmental clearances from the SEIAA and that
the SEIAA should base its decision on the recommendations of a State Level
Expert Appraisal Committee (hereinafter referred to as the SEAC). This
paragraph makes it clear that in the absence of a duly constituted SEIAA or
SEAC, a Category B project shall be treated as a Category A project. But,
this portion of the Notification on EIA dated 14.9.2006 [last line of
paragraph 4(iii)], was amended by a Notification dated 1.12.2009 to enable
the Category B projects to be considered at the Central Level, in the absence
of SEIAA or SEAC.
</p><p id="p_82">	67. Under paragraph 7 of the Notification on EIA dated 14.9.2006, as
amended by the Notification dated 1.12.2009, the environmental clearance
process for new projects will comprise of a maximum of four stages, in the
sequential order as follows :
</p><p id="p_83">	(i) Screening (only for Category B projects);
</p><p id="p_84">	(ii) Scoping;
</p><p id="p_85">	(iii) Public Consultation; and
</p><p id="p_86">	(iv) Appraisal.
</p><p id="p_87">	68. Paragraph 5 of the Notification on EIA dated 14.9.2006 makes it
clear that the Expert Appraisal Committee at the Central Level and the SEAC
at the State Level shall screen, scope and appraise the projects or
activities in Category A as well as Category B respectively. It is of
interest to note that under paragraph 5(e) of the Notification on EIA, the
Expert Appraisal Committees at the Central level and those at the State level
(SEACs) are obliged to function on the principle of collective
responsibility.
</p><p id="p_88">	69. In other words, they are supposed to work in tandem. But
unfortunately, in the case on hand, they have worked at cross purposes. The
Central Government has taken a stand both before the National Green Tribunal
and before this Court that the environmental clearances granted by the SEIAA
in accordance with the adhoc guidelines, are contrary to law. But, the SEIAA,
which is actually a creature of the Central Government, has gone against its
own creator and contested the case, both before the National Green Tribunal
and before this Court, like a private party would do, virtually advancing the
cause of the lorry owners engaged in the transportation of sand.
</p><p id="p_89">	70. The fact that the SEIAA overreached its mandate and went against
the very purpose of its creation, can be appreciated from the very adhoc
guidelines framed by the SEIAA on 27.9.2012 on the specious plea that the
MoEF had not issued any guidelines. At the risk of repetition, the guidelines
issued by the SEIAA on 27.9.2012 are again extracted as follows :
	"(i) All mining projects wherein the boundary of the proposed mining
area is at least 1.0 KM away form the human habitation/other sensitive areas
will be considered for sanction of Environmental Clearance subject to
satisfaction of other guidelines.
</p><p id="p_90">	(ii) If the boundary of the proposed mining area is less than 1.0 KM,
the SEAC will inspect the site and assess the various environmental impacts
and then recommend/ reject with specific conditions/reasons.
</p><p id="p_91">	(iii) In case, if the proposed mining area is less than 25.0 Hec, it
will be considered as B2 category with Environmental Management Plan, and
processed further.
</p><p id="p_92">	(iv) In case, if the proposed mining area is more than 25.0 Hec, it
will be considered as B1 category, which will require preparation of the EIA
as per revised model TORs issued by MoEF, Government of India and Public
Hearing will be undertaken and the same will be examined in detail for taking
a decision on the issue of Environmental Clearance, strictly adhering to
Government of India guidelines.
</p><p id="p_93">	It is also informed that the above said guidelines will cease to be in
force from the date of Notification/ Memorandum to be issued by the MoEF, GOI
on the subject."
</p><p id="p_94">	71. The above adhoc guidelines issued by the SEIAA would shock the
conscience of any person, as it goes far beyond the Notification on EIA dated
14.9.2006 and the directions issued by the Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar. The
above adhoc guidelines issued by the SEIAA actually tend to over-reach and
also destroy the requirements of the Notification on EIA, as seen from the
following :
</p><p id="p_95">	(i) These guidelines divide mining projects first into two categories,
one located at least 1.0 KM away from human habitation and another located
within a distance of 1.0 KM from human habitation. Such a classification is
not to be found in the Notification on EIA dated 14.9.2006. We do not know
where from the SEIAA, which derives its powers from the Notification on EIA,
got the power to create one more classification based upon the distance or
the location from human habitation. No residual powers have been conferred
upon the SEIAA by the Notification on EIA; and
</p><p id="p_96">	(ii) The adhoc guidelines of the SEIAA classify B category projects
into B1 and B2 category projects. Projects on proposed mining area of less
than 25 hectares are classified as B2 and projects on a proposed mining area
of more than 25 hectares are classified as B1 category projects. After doing
so, the adhoc guidelines issued by the SEIAA dated 27.9.2012 have completely
dispensed with the requirements of paragraph 7 read with paragraph 5 of the
Notification on EIA dated 14.9.2006, in respect of projects on proposed
mining area of less than 25 hectares. Therefore, the adhoc guidelines dated
27.9.2012, on the basis of which, the SEIAA granted the environmental
clearances in the cases on hand, were completely contrary to the Notification
on EIA dated 14.9.2006, as amended by the Notification dated 1.12.2009. They
were also completely contrary to the dictum of the Supreme Court in Deepak
Kumar.
</p><p id="p_97">	72. In paragraphs 25 and 26 of its judgment in Deepak Kumar, the
Supreme Court observed as follows :
</p><p id="p_98">	"Quarrying of river sand, it is true, is an important economic activity
in the country with river sand forming a crucial raw material for the
infrastructural development and for the construction industry but excessive
in-stream sand and gravel mining causes the degradation of rivers. In-stream
mining lowers the stream bottom of rivers which may lead to bank erosion.
Depletion of sand in the stream-bed and along coastal areas causes the
deepening of rivers which may result in destruction of aquatic and riparian
habitats as well. Extraction of alluvial material as already mentioned from
within or near a stream-bed has a direct impact on the stream's physical
habitat characteristics.
</p><p id="p_99">	We are of the considered view that it is highly necessary to have an
effective framework of mining plan which will take care of all environmental
issues and also evolve a long term rational and sustainable use of natural
resource base and also the bio-assessment protocol. Sand mining, it may be
noted, may have an adverse effect on biodiversity as loss of habitat caused
by sand mining will affect various species, flora and fauna and it may also
destabilize the soil structure of river banks and often leaves isolated
islands. We find that, taking note of those technical, scientific and
environmental matters, MoEF, Government of India, issued various
recommendations in March 2010 followed by the Model Rules, 2010 framed by the
Ministry of Mines which have to be given effect to, inculcating the spirit of
<a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_150">Article 48-A</a> and <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_151">Article 51-A(g)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_152">Article 21</a> of The Constitution."
</p><p id="p_100">	73. But, the adhoc guidelines issued on 27.9.2012 by the SEIAA
completely overlooks the above observations of the Supreme Court, as it tends
to grant environmental clearances blind-fold, if the proposed mining area is
less than 25 hectares.
</p><p id="p_101">	74. Therefore, the first contention of Mr.T.Mohan, learned counsel
appearing for the petitioner in the first batch of writ petitions, that the
environmental clearances issued by SEIAA on the basis of the adhoc guidelines
dated 27-9-2012 that were completely contrary to the Notification on EIA,
ought to be upheld. The Notification on EIA dated 14.9.2006, as amended by
the Notification dated 1.12.2009, empowered the SEIAA to process the
proposals for projects in a mining area of 5 hectares and above, but below 50
acres. The EIA Notifications dated 14-9-2006 and 1-12-20009 did not empower
the SEIAA to annul the effect of paragraphs 5 and 7 of the Notification dated
14.9.2006 and grant environmental clearances, without screening, scoping,
public consultation and appraisal to projects where the proposed mining area
is less than 25 hectares. In as much as the adhoc guidelines of the SEIAA
permit the grant of clearances to projects on proposed mining area of less
than 25 hectares without screening, scoping, public consultation and
appraisal, they are completely contrary to the Notification, by which, the
SEIAA was created. Even the Union of India, in the counter filed before the
National Green Tribunal, clearly admitted that the SEIAAs are not empowered
to sub-categorize B projects into B1 and B2 categories.
CONTENTION NO.2 :
</p><p id="p_102">	75. In Deepak Kumar, the Supreme Court issued three directives. They
are (i) the Central Government should take steps to bring into force The
Minor Minerals Conservation and Development Rules, 2010 at the earliest; (ii)
the State Governments should take immediate steps to frame necessary rules
under <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_153">Section 15</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_154">Regulation) Act</a>,
1957, taking into consideration the recommendations of the MoEF in its report
of March 2010; and (iii) in the meanwhile, the leases of minor minerals
including their renewal for an area of less than 5 hectares be granted by the
States/Union Territories only after getting the environmental clearances from
the MoEF. Therefore, the second contention of the petitioners is that the
SEIAA is neither competent to issue adhoc guidelines nor competent to grant
environmental clearances for areas equivalent to or more than 5 hectares.
</p><p id="p_103">	76. In order to test the correctness of the above contention, it is
necessary to have a look at paragraphs 28 and 29 of the decision of the
Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar. They read as follows :
</p><p id="p_104">	"The Central Government also should take steps to bring into force the
Minor Minerals Conservation and Development Rules, 2010 at the earliest. The
State Governments and UTs also should take immediate steps to frame necessary
rules under <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_155">Section 15</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_156">Regulation)
Act</a>, 1957 taking into consideration the recommendations of MoEF in its report
of March 2010 and model guidelines framed by the Ministry of Mines,
Government of India. Communicate the copy of this order to MoEF, Secretary,
Ministry of Mines, New Delhi, Ministry of Water Resources, Central Government
Water Authority; the Chief Secretaries of the respective States and Union
Territories, who would circulate this order to the Departments concerned.
	We, in the meanwhile, order that leases of minor minerals including
their renewal for an area of less than five hectares be granted by the
States/Union Territories only after getting environmental clearance from
MoEF."
</p><p id="p_105">	77. In pursuance of the decision of the Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar
rendered on 27.2.2012, the MoEF issued certain directions on 18.5.2012.
Paragraph 3 of the Office Memorandum dated 18.5.2012 issued by the MoEF reads
as follows :
</p><p id="p_106">	"In order to ensure compliance of the above referred order of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 27.2.2012, it has now been decided that all
mining projects of minor minerals including their renewal irrespective of the
size of the lease would henceforth require prior environment clearance.
Mining projects with lease area up to less than 50 hectares including
projects of minor mineral with lease area less than 5 hectares would be
treated as category 'B' as defined in the EIA Notification, 2006 and will be
considered by the respective SEIAAs notified by MoEF and following the
procedure prescribed under EIA Notification, 2006."
</p><p id="p_107">	78. Therefore, the second contention of the petitioners that the SEIAA
granted environmental clearances, contrary to the judgment of the Supreme
Court in Deepak Kumar, is too obvious.
</p><p id="p_108">CONTENTION NO.3 :
</p><p id="p_109">	79. The third contention of Mr.T.Mohan, learned counsel, is that it was
not within the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal to compare the
adhoc guidelines dated 27.9.2012 issued by the SEIAA with the guidelines
issued by the MoEF dated 24.12.2013 and come to a conclusion that those
issued by SEIAA were far better.
</p><p id="p_110">	80. We are in agreement with the above contention of Mr.T.Mohan,
learned counsel. In paragraph 41 of its order dated 24.2.2014, the National
Green Tribunal presented in a tabular form, a comparative statement of the
adhoc guidelines issued by the SEIAA and those issued by the MoEF. Even a
bare perusal of the very same tabular statement would show that as per the
Notification of the MoEF, mining activity is to be done only manually. But,
the environmental clearances granted by the SEIAA, permit mining activity
even mechanically. We do not know how such a prescription in the adhoc
guidelines could be taken to be more stringent than the guidelines issued by
the MoEF, restricting mining only to manual operations.
</p><p id="p_111">	81. As a matter of fact, the National Green Tribunal ought to have
tested the adhoc guidelines dated 27.9.2012 on the touchstone of the parent
Notification dated 14.9.2006. If so done, it would have become very clear
that the adhoc guidelines actually overreached and even nullified the effect
of the original Notification. Another important aspect omitted to be taken
note of by the Green Tribunal, while making a comparison, is that in the
latest guidelines dated 24.12.2013 issued by the MoEF, the requirement of
public hearing is dispensed with, only due to the fact that it permitted
manual mining alone for such projects. The National Green Tribunal has not
appreciated this most crucial aspect. Therefore, the third contention of the
petitioners is also to be upheld.
</p><p id="p_112">CONTENTION NO.4 :
</p><p id="p_113">	82. The fourth contention of the petitioners is that even as per the
environmental clearances granted by the SEIAA on 30.11.2012, the project
proponent (Public Works Department of the State in this case) should
undertake adequate safeguard measures during extraction of river bed material
and ensure that due to this activity, the hydro geological regime of the
surrounding area is not affected. But, this study has not been undertaken and
no report so far submitted to the MoEF. Hence, it is contended by Mr.T.Mohan,
learned counsel that in any case, the respondents cannot continue to quarry
sand from the river beds, as they are guilty of violating the conditions for
the grant of clearance.
</p><p id="p_114">	83. For an assessment of the above contention, it is essential to have
a look at the environmental clearance granted by the SEIAA on 30.11.2012. The
environmental clearance is actually for quarrying 2,28,453 cubic meters of
sand, at the rate of (i) 44,608 cubic meters in the first year; (ii) 50,000
cubic meters per annum for the years 2013-2016; and (iii) 33,843 cubic meters
for the years 2016 and 2017. Paragraph 6 of the environmental clearance dated
30.11.2012 contains general conditions, subject to which, the clearance was
granted. Clauses (ix) and (x) of paragraph 6 of the environmental clearance
dated 30.11.2012 read as follows:
</p><p id="p_115">	"The project proponent shall undertake hydro geological study through
reputed institution/organization within six months. The proponent shall
undertake adequate safeguard measures during extraction of river bed material
and ensure that due to this activity the hydro geological regime of the
surrounding area shall not be affected.
</p><p id="p_116">	Regular monitoring of ground water level and quality shall be carried
out around the mine lease area by establishing a network of existing wells
and installing new piezometers during the mining operation. The periodic
monitoring [(at least four times in a year - pre- monsoon (April-May),
monsoon (August), post-monsoon (November) and winter (January); once in each
season)] shall be carried out in consultation with the State Ground Water
Board/Central Ground Water Authority and the data thus collected may be sent
regularly to the Ministry of Environment and Forests and its Regional Office
Bangalore, the Central Ground Water Commission and the Regional Director,
Central Ground Water Board. If at any stage, it is observed that the
groundwater table is getting depleted due to the mining activity, necessary
corrective measures shall be carried out, which includes immediate stopping
of mining."
</p><p id="p_117">	84. We do not know whether the respondents have complied with the above
conditions. But this question has become one of mere academic importance in
view of the fact that even according to the SEIAA, the environmental
clearances granted by them will not survive beyond 23.8.2014. Therefore, we
do not wish to go into that question.
</p><p id="p_118">CONTENTION NO.5 :
</p><p id="p_119">	85. The next contention raised by Mr.T.Mohan, learned counsel appearing
for the petitioner, is that the environmental clearance granted by the SEIAA
was on the basis of the consent given by the Tamilnadu Pollution Control
Board. But, the consent has actually expired.
</p><p id="p_120">	86. In response to the above contention, the respondents produced two
consent orders bearing Nos.669 and 630 dated 1.4.2013. The consent orders are
normally valid for one year. We do not know whether the consent orders were
extended beyond 1.4.2014. But, we do not wish to attach too much of a
significance to this aspect, in view of our finding (i) that the very
guidelines of the SEIAA, on the basis of which, they granted the
environmental clearances, are ultra vires the Notification on EIA; and (ii)
that in any case, the environmental clearances now in favour of the
respondents would automatically expire, by virtue of the order of the
National Green Tribunal, on 23.8.2014.
</p><p id="p_121">CONTENTION NOS.6 and 7 :
</p><p id="p_122">	87. Mrs.U.Nirmalarani, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in
the second batch of writ petitions, contended (i) that a mining plan in
accordance with Annexure I of the draft rules, which received a seal of
approval from the Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar, was not prepared by the
Competent Authority in the format prescribed and hence, the environmental
clearances were illegal; and (ii) that even according to the studies
conducted by the Government of Tamilnadu themselves, the ground water level
in the areas, in which, mechanized mining is now permitted, has reached a
critical stage, threatening to explode like a time bomb at any time.
</p><p id="p_123">	88. We will now take up these contentions one after another.
</p><p id="p_124">	88. According to Mrs.U.Nirmalarani, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner in the second batch of writ petitions, the concept of preparing a
mining plan was evolved in paragraph 4.5 of the recommendations made by the
MoEF, on the basis of the report of the Core Group constituted by an order
dated 22.3.2009. This recommendation of the MoEF finds a place in paragraph
19 of the decision of the Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar and it reads as
follows :
</p><p id="p_125">"Requirement of mine plan for minor minerals :
</p><p id="p_126">	At present, most of the State Governments have not made it mandatory
for preparation of mining plan in respect of minor minerals. In some States
like Rajasthan, eco-friendly mining plans are prepared, which are approved by
the State Mining Department. The eco-friendly mining plans so prepared,
though conceptually welcome, are observed to be deficient and need to be made
comprehensive in a manner as is being done for major minerals. Besides, the
aspects of reclamation and rehabilitation of mined out areas, progressive
mine closure plan, as in vogue for major minerals could be introduced for
minor minerals as well.
</p><p id="p_127">	It is recommended that provision for preparation and approval of mine
plan, as in the case of major minerals may appropriately be provided in the
rules governing the mining of minor minerals by the respective State
Governments. These should specifically include the provision for reclamation
and rehabilitation of mined out area, progressive mine closure plan and post
mine land use."
</p><p id="p_128">	90. In paragraph 20 of its judgment in Deepak Kumar, the Supreme Court
recorded with approval that as per the report of the MoEF, the operation of
mines of minor minerals needs to be subjected to strict regulatory parameters
as that of mines of major minerals. The Supreme Court specifically stated in
paragraph 20 of its judgment as follows :
</p><p id="p_129">	"The necessity of the preparation of 'comprehensive mines plan' for
contiguous stretches of mineral deposits by the respective State Governments
may also be encouraged and the same be suitably incorporated in the Mineral
Concession Rules, 1960 by the Ministry of Mines."
</p><p id="p_130">	91. The Supreme Court also recorded in paragraph 22 of its judgment in
Deepak Kumar, the letter dated 1.6.2010 issued by the Minister of Environment
and Forests to the Chief Ministers of all States, so that the recommendations
made in the report could be incorporated in the Mineral Concession Rules for
the mining of minor minerals.
</p><p id="p_131">	92. In Annexure-I to the Draft Minor Minerals Conservation and
Development Rules, 2010, issued by the Ministry of Mines, Indian Bureau of
Mines, by the proceedings bearing No.296/7/2000/MRC dated 16.5.2011, a
particular format is prescribed for applying for a mining plan. Rule 13 of
the Draft Rules stipulates that a mining plan shall not be approved unless it
is prepared by a qualified person recognized by the State Government or
authorized by the State Government or by a recognized person under Rule 22B
of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960.
</p><p id="p_132">	93. According to Mrs.U.Nirmalarani, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner, the mining plan submitted by the Public Works Department was (i)
neither in the format as specified in Annexure I to the Draft Rules (ii) nor
approved by a person as stipulated in Rule 13 of the Draft Rules. In this
case, the mining plan was prepared by the Executive Engineer of the Public
Works Department. Moreover, as per the circular issued by the Commissioner of
Geology and Mining in Rc.No.3868/LC/2012 dated 19.11.2012, the Draft Mining
Plan should be prepared by a qualified person recognized by the State
Government or Indian Bureau of Mines. In this case, the respondents prepared
a mining plan only on 15.2.2013 and got it approved by the District Collector
rather than by the Assistant Director of Mines, as seen from their own
statement. Therefore, it is contended by the learned counsel that the very
basis, on which the environmental clearance was granted by the SEIAA, was
contrary to (i) the Draft Rules issued by the MoEF; and (ii) the directions
issued by the Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar to follow the prescription
contained in the Draft Rules.
</p><p id="p_133">	94. In response to the above contention, it is claimed by the learned
Advocate General that the circular of the Commissioner of Geology and Mining
dated 19.11.2012 came only after applications were filed before the SEIAA by
the Public Works Department and that therefore, the instructions issued
therein cannot affect the applications already made. The learned Advocate
General also submitted that on facts, the date of submission of mining plan
was not 15.2.2013 as claimed by Mrs.U.Nirmalarani, learned counsel, but was
actually 13.8.2012.
</p><p id="p_134">	95. We have carefully considered the rival contentions.
</p><p id="p_135">	96. We are prepared to go by the submissions made by the learned
Advocate General (a) that the mining plan was submitted on 13.8.2012 and not
on 15.2.2013; and (b) that the circular of the Commissioner of Geology and
Mining dated 19.11.2012 cannot have retrospective effect, so as to affect the
applications already submitted by the Public Works Department. But still, the
learned Advocate General has no answer to one fundamental question. As per
Rule 13 read with Annexure I of the Draft Rules, approved by the Supreme
Court in Deepak Kumar, the mining plan should be in a prescribed format and
approved by a qualified person recognized in this behalf by the State
Government. We do not know how the State Government authorized the Executive
Engineer of the Public Work Department to approve the mining plan.
</p><p id="p_136">	97. The proposals for the grant of environmental clearances were made
by the Executive Engineer, Public Works Department, Water Resources
Organization, River Conservancy Division, Trichy. If the mining plan is
approved by another Executive Engineer of a different wing of the very same
Department, the sanctity of Rule 13 of the Draft Rules is completely lost.
When the Public Works Department is the proponent of the project for the
grant of environmental clearance, the State Government could not have
recognized one of the officers of the very same Department to be a recognized
qualified person in terms of Rule 13 of the Draft Rules. Therefore, the
applications submitted by the Executive Engineer, Public Works Department for
environmental clearances to the SEIAA were obviously not in accordance with
the mandate of the Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar.
</p><p id="p_137">	98. The next contention of Mrs.U.Nirmalarani, learned counsel appearing
for the petitioner is that even according to the Government Orders, the
ground water resources in the panchayat union blocks, within which areas, the
environmental clearances have been granted, are now classified as over
exploited. But, this has not been taken into consideration.
</p><p id="p_138">	99. It is seen from G.O.Ms.No.51 Public Works Department dated
11.2.2004 that based on the development of ground water resources, the
panchayat union blocks in Tamilnadu were categorized into dark and grey
areas. Blocks with more than 85% ground water development were categorized as
dark blocks. Blocks with ground water development between 65% to 85% were
categorized as grey blocks. Thereafter, a State Level Working Group was
constituted for the assessment of the ground water potential in Tamilnadu. On
the basis of the report submitted by them, the Government approved and
categorized all panchayat union blocks in Tamilnadu as (i) over exploited;
</p><p id="p_139">(ii) critical; (iii) semi critical; and (iv) safe blocks. After such
categorization, the Government ordered in paragraph 6 of the said Government
Order, that no schemes shall be formulated in over exploited and critical
blocks.
</p><p id="p_140">	100. Thottiyam is one of the villages, which fell within the category
of 'safe area' in the year 2004, under G.O.Ms.No.51 Public works Department
dated 11.2.2004. But, within a period of ten years, it has now gone from
"safe zone" to the over exploited region. This is one of the villages, in
respect of which, the environmental clearance is now granted. But, this has
not been taken note of either by the Public Works Department, when proposing
a project or by the SEIAA while granting clearance. Hence, Mrs.U.Nirmalarani,
learned counsel is right in contending that the environmental clearance
granted by the SEIAA was not in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_141"> 	101. As a matter of fact, there was no mechanical mining of sand in the
State of Tamilnadu, upto the year 2003. It was started only in the year 2003
and contrary to the original order of this Court dated 3.8.2012, large scale
mechanized mining appears to be taking place.
</p><p id="p_142">	102. Though it is submitted by the respondents that mechanized mining
is taking place only with two poclains and that no in-stream mining is taking
place, the said claim appears to be false. That it is false, could not have
been realized by this Court, but for the fact that the lorry owners'
association has come with a petition for impleading themselves as parties. In
W.P.(MD).No.7146 of 2014, the Tamilnadu Sand Lorry Owners Federation has come
up with M.P.(MD).No.3 of 2014 for impleading themselves as a contesting
respondent in the writ petition.
</p><p id="p_143">	103. It is claimed in paragraph 2 of the affidavit in support of the
impleading petition that the federation was registered as an association in
the year 2010 and that the federation has a membership of about 1000. The
members of the federation, as per the affidavit, own 75,000 lorries in the
State and all these lorries are specially built for the transportation of
sand and that they cannot be used for any other purposes. It is further
claimed in the impleading petition that the members of the federation employ
about 2,00,000 workers, who are engaged only in the transportation of sand.
It is also claimed that the members of the federation and about 2,00,000
workers depend entirely upon the transportation of sand for their livelihood.
In paragraph 5 of the affidavit in support of the impleading petition, the
federation claims that the capacity of the lorries depends upon the laden
weight of each vehicle ranging from 2 units to 3 units and that therefore,
sand cannot be loaded manually.
</p><p id="p_144">	104. The federation claims that unless there are two stand-by poclains
in each quarry, it is not possible to load sand and retrieve the vehicles,
whenever a vehicle is stuck. In paragraph 5 of the affidavit in support of
the impleading petition, it is also claimed by the federation that it is
impossible to quarry 7,000 lorry loads of sand per day manually.
</p><p id="p_145">	105. These statistics make it clear (i) that there has been
indiscriminate mechanical mining carried out by the State of Tamilnadu,
perhaps under pressure from the lorry owners; and (ii) that the quantities of
sand quarried are not correctly projected by the Department. The actual
statistics appear to have been buried deep into the very same sand. The
pressure exerted by the sand lorry owners federation upon the Government and
the SEIAA appears to have increased, in geometric portions, the pressure
exerted on environment and ecology. Otherwise, we see no reason as to why the
SEIAA should actually take a stand contrary to the stand taken by the Central
Government in this case.
</p><p id="p_146">CONCLUSION:
</p><p id="p_147">	106. Therefore, we are of the view that the environmental clearances
granted by SEIAA are actually contrary to law. But, today, there is no point
in setting aside the same, for the reasons stated below:
</p><p id="p_148">	(i) The National Green Tribunal has held by its impugned order that
based upon the environmental clearances, the State Government can continue to
quarry only up to 23.8.2014 (six months from the date of the order of the
National Green Tribunal dated 24.02.2014). This period is coming to an end
soon;
</p><p id="p_149">	(ii) The order of the National Green Tribunal dated 24.02.2014,
permitting the State Government to make use of these environmental clearances
only for a period of six months, came to be challenged in these writ
petitions, only after two months. The writ petitions were filed and they came
up for hearing for the first time only on 23.4.2014, by which time, a period
of two months out of the total period of six months had already expired;
</p><p id="p_150">	(iii) By an interim order passed on 30.4.2014, we granted an interim
stay of the order of the Tribunal. But, our order dated 30.4.2014 was set
aside by the Supreme Court, by an order dated 09.5.2014 and the Supreme Court
directed us to take up the impugned writ petitions and dispose them of within
a period of one month. Therefore, the writ petitions were taken up for
hearing after the Court re-opened after summer recess on 04.6.2014. But, the
respondents took time to file counter affidavit and the counter affidavit was
filed on 16.6.2014. Thereafter, the arguments were heard on 25.6.2014 and
26.6.2014 and judgment reserved by us on 26.6.2014. Thereafter, written
submissions were circulated on 03.7.2014. By this time, a period of four
months, out of the total period of six months granted by the Tribunal had
already expired;
</p><p id="p_151">	(iv) Therefore, we do not find any useful purpose being served in
setting aside the impugned orders, at this distance of time. Therefore, these
writ petitions are dismissed. No costs.
</p><p id="p_152">	(v) The petitions for impleading, filed by the Tamil Nadu Sand Lorry
Owners Federation and by one M.Anand are also liable to be dismissed, for the
reason that what is challenged before us are the orders of the National Green
Tribunal, relating to the validity of the environmental clearances granted in
favour of the State Government. These persons are neither necessary nor
proper parties. Therefore, M.P.Nos.3 and 3 of 2014 in W.P.Nos.7146 and 7147
of 2014 are dismissed. Other connected M.Ps. are closed.
