<p id="p_1">1.              This Application has been filed by one, Smt. Mithlesh Bai Patel who

claims that she is an elected Sarpanch of Village Pratappur, Tehsil Siroha, District

Jabalpur and she is filing this Application in larger public interest on behalf of the

villagers of Pratappur. She says that she is challenging the order dated 15th May,

2013 in Reference No. F3-7/07/12/2 (Annexure P/8) issued by the Under

Secretary, Department of Mines, Government of Madhya Pradesh whereby a

Prospecting License (in short referred to as 'PL') for prospecting laterite mineral

has been granted in favour of Respondent No. 6 over an area of 5.42 hectares out

of the total extent of 9.85 hectares land in Khasra No. 413 of village Pratappur,

Tehsil Siroha, District Jabalpur. It is stated that this is a government land under the

control of the Revenue Department and there is a dense tree growth with

approximately 397 Mahua trees standing in the area allotted for PL and the

villagers are having Nistar rights over the land. It falls under the definition of

'Forest' as given under <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_1">Section 2</a> of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. She

further states that No Objection Certificate (in short referred to as 'NOC') was not


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                    Page 2 of 20</span>
 obtained from the Forest Department before granting the PL.            Initially an

application for granting PL for mining iron ore, filed by one, M/s Anand Mining

Corporation was recommended by the Government of Madhya Pradesh and PL

was granted in their favour but having objected by the villagers, the lease holder

could not commence any mining work. Subsequently an application was filed

seeking grant of Mining Lease (in short referred to as 'ML') for mining of iron ore

over a period of 30 years by M/s Ind Synergy Ltd. However, as the villagers

objected, that application was not considered by the Government of Madhya

Pradesh for recommending the case to the Central Government and in this regard a

Public Interest Litigation (in short referred to as 'PIL') by way of Writ Petition

No. 830/2009 was filed by one, Shri Anadilal Sen before the Hon'ble High Court

of Madhya Pradesh (Annexure P/1) wherein the Hon'ble High Court vide order

dated 4th March, 2009 (Annexure P/2) issued notice to the Respondents and

ordered that in case the Central Government grants approval for ML, the Petitioner

is at liberty to move the Court for appropriate interim relief.

</p><p id="p_2">2.           The Applicant further stated in her application that under Mahatma

Gandhi NREGS, the Gram Panchayat Pratappur has planted approximately one

thousand trees in the said piece of land in Khasra No. 413 during the year 2011 by

investing an amount of about Rs.1.48 lakhs. But the Respondent No.6 uprooted

the plants and a complaint in this regard was made before the District Collector,

Jabalpur vide complaint dated 13th September, 2011(Annexure P/4) but no action

was taken by the Collector and it was informed by the office of the Collector that

no such application is pending in their office in respect of the aforesaid land for

mining purpose (Annexure P/5). The Divisional Forest Officer, Jabalpur vide his

letter dated 1st May, 2007 informed the District Collector that 397 Mahua trees are

standing in part of Khasra No. 413 in an area of 5.42 hectares (Annexure P/5).

When the matter was referred to the SDM, Siroha, it was reported that the land

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                 Page 3 of 20</span>
 situated in Khasra No. 413 is not fit for mining activities. (Annexure P/6). When

NOC was sought from the Forest Department for granting mining lease in Khasra

No. 413 and a letter dated 29th October, 2011 was addressed to the Secretary,

Mining Department, Government of Madhya Pradesh that this particular piece of

land is not a forest land (Annexure P/4)

</p><p id="p_3">3.           Thus the Applicant has stated that the issue of granting ML for iron ore

was taken up twice in the above piece of land and the PIL filed is still pending

before the Hon'ble High Court and no NOC was issued by the Forest Department

for granting ML. She contended that in order to by-pass the orders of the Hon'ble

High Court subsequently an application was moved seeking PL for mining laterite

mineral instead of iron ore and accordingly the aforesaid order dated 15-5-2013

was issued by the Government of Madhya Pradesh granting PL to the Respondent

No. 6. She further states that earlier vide memo dated 3 rd February, 2007 the then

District Collector, Jabalpur had submitted a report to the Secretary, Mining,

Government of Madhya Pradesh stating that there are 694 Mahua trees standing in

Khasra No. 413 and it is not suitable for granting ML (Annexure P/7). Thus, the

Applicant lamented that due to negative reports sent from the office of the District

Collector, Jabalpur and inspite of the fact that the land in question is having such

large number of Mahua trees, the Government of Madhya Pradesh granted PL over

an extent of 5.42 hectares in Khasra No. 413 for laterite mining in favour of

Respondent No. 6 (Annexure P/8). It was further stated by the Applicant that a

close look at the order dated 15th May, 2013, gives an impression that the mineral

limestone is expected to be found rather than laterite and there is neither leterite

nor limestone deposits in the said piece of land except iron ore but to circumvent

the Hon'ble High Court order, the PL was granted for prospecting laterite since it

is only the Central Government which is competent to grant ML in case of iron ore

mining and thus an incorrect and false mineral has been mentioned in the order

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                   Page 4 of 20</span>
 granting PL and there is no clear NOC issued from the Forest Department. The

Applicant expressed her concern that if mining activity is taken up in the said piece

of land, it will not only lead to removal/damage of the huge number of existing

Mahua trees but it will also affect the ecology and environment in the area besides

robbing the livelihood opportunities of the villagers as they are presently collecting

the Minor Forest Produce (MFP) from the Mahua trees. In support of her claim,

she filed photographs depicting tree growth in the said piece of land (Annexure

P/9). She further alleged that though the Respondent applied for iron ore mining

surprisingly PL was granted for laterite mining and this is a deliberate act on the

part of Respondent government to bypass the law. It was further stated that the

land in question bears approximately 5.13 million tons of iron ore deposits as per

the survey conducted by the Geological Survey of India and ultimately it is not the

laterite or limestone but the iron ore that will be mined from the area. She prayed

that though the land is a Government land, the Respondent No. 6 should not have

been granted PL for mining brushing aside the objections raised by the villagers

and thus she had no alternative except to approach this Tribunal seeking justice.

She pleaded that the impugned order dated 15th May, 2013 should be quashed

immediately.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.        Upon registration of the Application, notices were issued to the

Respondents and interim stay was granted on 18th July, 2013 on the operation of

the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.        The Respondent Nos. 1 to 5 in their reply have stated that the land in

question in Khasra No. 413 is not a forest land. In view of the orders of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 12th December, 1996 in the matter of <a href="/doc/1725193/" id="a_2">T.N.

Godavarman vs. Union of India</a> (1997) 2 SCC 267 and as per the Circular No.

16610/7/1-A dated 13th January, 1997 (Annexure RI-1) issued by the Revenue

Department, Govt. of Madhya Pradesh wherein on the recommendation of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                   Page 5 of 20</span>
 Expert Committee the following criteria has been fixed to declare the tree clad

areas in the state as 'Forest' but not yet notified as 'Forest' under any Act and not

recorded as 'Forest' in Government records : -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      i.   The extent of area should be 10 hectares or more ;

     ii.   On an average the area should consist atleast 200 naturally growing trees

           per hectare;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">6.           The Respondent Nos. 1 to 5 further stated that the govt. land in Khasra

No. 413 is less than 10 hectares in extent and it was further divided into restricted

and unrestricted parts. The restricted part is of 4.43 hectares while the unrestricted

part is 5.42 hectares and the Respondent No. 6 has been sanctioned PL for mining

over the unrestricted area. Therefore the contention of the Applicant that the land is

a forest land, is misconceived and it does not qualify to be brought under the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_3">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980. The unrestricted area where the

PL for mining was granted, consists 303 Mahua trees which becomes on an

average 56 Mahua trees per hectare. It was further stated in the reply that the State

Government has not sanctioned the PL in favour of the Respondent No. 6 in

suppression of earlier orders but the PL was sanctioned in accordance with law

within the purview of <a href="/doc/1791701/" id="a_4">Section 11(2)</a> of the Mines &amp; Minerals (Development &amp;

<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_5">Regulations) Act</a>, 1957 considering the preferential rights of the Respondent No. 6

after giving opportunity of hearing to all the parties. The relief sought by the

Applicant is premature because it is only the PL that has been granted in favour of

the Respondent No. 6 and no permission was granted for cutting the Mahua trees

as prospecting of mineral does not require cutting of trees. It was further stated in

the reply that MLs were sanctioned in the areas adjacent to the land in question and

this application was filed on the instigation of those mine owners whose mines are

located adjacent to Khasra No. 413.

</p><p id="p_8"> 7.           As directed by the Tribunal, the counsel for the State of Madhya

Pradesh filed the report of the Expert Committee constituted in pursuance of the

directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1725193/" id="a_6">T.N. Godavarman vs.

Union of India</a> (supra) copy of which has been furnished to the learned counsel

for the Respondent No. 6 as well as to the Applicant. A perusal of the report of the

Expert Committee indicates that Government lands measuring a total of 16,616.80

hectares are outside the control of the Forest Department but having tree growth

and falling in 295 nos. of Khasras located in 146 villages in Jabalpur District and

they meet the aforesaid criteria and qualified to be declared as 'Forest'. Thus they

are eligible to be brought under the definition of 'Forest' irrespective of their

ownership. However, the Khasra no. wise and village wise details were missing in

the report. Therefore, the learned counsel for the State of Madhya Pradesh was

directed to produce particulars of villages and Khasra numbers where such 'Forests'

were identified by the Expert Committee to know whether this particular Khasra

No. 413 in village Pratappur finds place in the list or not. The District Collector,

Jabalpur in his affidavit dated 28th February 2014 stated that village Pratappur

does not find place within the list of 146 villages where 'Forest' was identified by

the Expert Committee and therefore the govt. land in Khasra No. 413 is only a

revenue land and does not fall under the definition of 'Forest' and therefore <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_7">Forest

(Conservation) Act</a>, 1980 is not applicable in this case. The Collector further

stated that as per the provisions under Section 2 of the Madhya Pradesh Adim

Janjatika Sanrankshan (Vrikshonka hith) Adhiniyam, 1999 which lays down the

list of special category trees including Mahua tree at Entry No. '7' and Section 240

of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code, 1969 confer powers to the District

Collectors to permit cutting of any standing tree including that of Mahua tree. The

Collector further stated that the Mahua trees existing in Khasra No. 413 are not the

exclusive source of livelihood for the tribals in the area and the PL for mining was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                  Page 7 of 20</span>
 granted by the Government of Madhya Pradesh taking into account of the above

facts and as mining of minerals is essential for the development of the State of

Madhya Pradesh and the country as a whole.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.          The Divisional Forest Officer, Jabalpur was present before the Tribunal

and filed an affidavit dated 1st March, 2014 stating that the land in question is a

revenue land and not a forest land.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.          The Respondent No. 4 i.e. Madhya Pradesh State Pollution Control

Board (MPPCB) filed their reply stating that no application has been received from

the Respondent No. 6 for granting any permission for mining and if any such

application is required for granting permission under the Water (Prevention &amp;

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1981 it will be examined after inspection of the site. It was further stated by the

MPPCB that under the EIA Notification dated 14th September, 2006 under the

schedule of projects or activities requiring Environment Clearance (EC) the

activity of prospecting of minerals is exempted and therefore no EC is required for

granting PL in this case. However, the Officer-in-Charge of the area of the MPPCB

inspected the site and observed that few pits/holes have been dug up in the site and

neither there is any damage caused to the environment nor is any activity going on

there. It was further stated that the MPPCB has specifically directed the

Respondent No. 6 that without obtaining written consent from the PCB no mining

activity shall be undertaken in the area.

</p>
<p id="p_12">11.          The Respondent No. 6 filed his reply dated 19th September, 2013 stating

that the adjudication of the matter as to whether the PL has been rightly granted or

not, is outside the purview of this Tribunal as the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_12">National Green Tribunal Act</a>,

2010 provides that this Tribunal shall have jurisdiction over all the civil cases

where substantial question relating to environment is involved and such question

arises out of implementation of the enactments specified under schedule-I of the

National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. In this particular application no civil case

involving substantial question relating to environment has been raised by the

Applicant. It was further stated that the Applicant is under the wrong notion that

because the land in Khasra No. 413 is having Mahua trees it falls within the

definition of 'Forest' and PL has been granted in          violation of the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_13">Forest

(Conservation) Act</a>, 1980. The Respondent No. 6 averred that the land in question

is not a Reserved Forest and as per the recommendations of the Expert Committee

constituted consequent to the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

T.N. Godavarman (supra) this particular piece of land has not been declared to

come under the definition of 'Forest' and hence <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_14">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980 is

not applicable. It was further stated in the reply that PL was granted only over an

area of 5.42 hectares in Khasra No. 413 and not for the entire area of 9.85 hectares

and it was also denied that the villagers have got any Nistar rights over the land

which is a revenue land and no Mahua usufruct is being collected by the tribals

from the trees occurring in the said piece of land. It was further stated by the

Respondent No. 6 that presently it is not sure whether the land in question has got

any iron ore deposits and no PL was granted in favour of M/s Anand Mining

Corporation for iron ore mining. However, the Government of Madhya Pradesh

recommended the case of M/s Ind Synergy Limited to the Government of India for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                  Page 9 of 20</span>
 granting lease for 30 years for mining of iron ore in Khasra No. 413 over an extent

of 5.42 hectares but the said recommendation was not confirmed by the

Government of India as the Government of India came to the conclusion that there

is no material on record to suggest that iron ore deposits occur in the area and no

prospecting of mineral has been done earlier for the purpose of iron ore. It was

mentioned as virgin area and thereafter the Central Government directed the State

Government to look into the matter and take a fresh decision. Orders dated 8th

November, 2010 passed by the Central Government under <a href="/doc/698051/" id="a_15">Section 30</a> of the Mines

&amp; Minerals (Development &amp; <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_16">Regulations) Act</a>, 1957 are annexed by the

Respondent at Annexure R-6/2 and R-6/3. Thereafter, the State Government duly

considering all the relevant facts decided to grant PL to Respondent No. 6. It was

further stated by the Respondent No. 6 that M/s Ind Synergy Limited filed Writ

Petition No. 12062/2011 and 12063/2011 before the Hon'ble High Court of

Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur challenging the order of remand made by the Central

Government and vide order dated 16th May, 2012 the Hon'ble High Court

dismissed the above petitions (Annexure R6/4). With regard to the PIL filed by Sri

Anandilal Sen, it is stated that the PIL was filed in the year 2009 against the order

dated 4th October, 2008 of the govt. of Madhya Pradesh by which it was

recommended for granting ML for iron ore in favour of Ind Synergy Ltd.

However, the Hon'ble High Court has not granted any stay as agreed by the

Applicant herself. The Respondent No. 6 averred that perhaps the writ petition

must have been rendered infructuous as the Central Government remanded the

matter back to the State Government by not accepting the recommendation of the

state Government.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.       The Respondent No. 6 further denied that the villagers have planted trees

in the land in question under NREGS and no such plantation is existing at the site.

The alleged filing of the complaint by the Applicant to the District Collector is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                  Page 10 of 20</span>
 only a motivated one and the allegations made therein by her are incorrect. It was

further stated that SDM, Siroha only wrote a note sheet on the objections raised by

the villagers and not recommended to the Collector that ML should not be granted.

Nevertheless, the said objections raised by the villagers were not accepted by the

District Collector. Thus ML was recommended by the State Government in favour

of M/s Ind Synergy Ltd. in the year 2008 and though the Applicant is aware of it,

she has deliberately hidden this fact. Respondent No. 6 further contended that

without prospecting of mining being taken up the question of concluding that the

said land is harbouring iron ore deposits does not arise and accordingly the

Government of India has mentioned in its order that there is no evidence on record

to show that the land in question has got iron ore deposits. Therefore, considering

all the aspects, the State Government has granted PL for laterite mining to the

Respondent No.6. Therefore, only after prospecting is done, it can be ascertained

whether the land has got laterite deposits or not. Therefore, it is incorrect on the

part of the Applicant to say that the land in question does not consist laterite

deposits. The Respondent No. 6 in his application for granting PL clearly stated

that it is for prospecting laterite only and just because that few trees are existing on

such piece of land which does not qualify to be brought under the definition

'Forest', such activity of granting PL cannot be denied. Any piece of land lying

idle for a long period will allow tree growth to come up and simply because few

trees have come up on the site in question the plea that no permission shall be

granted there for mining activity, is not correct. Moreover prospecting of mine

does not require cutting of trees. It was also stated that the Forest Department has

not raised any objection and based on the recommendations of the District

Collector, the PL was granted by the government and no public places of worship

are located in the said piece of land as revealed from the report of the District

Collector. Only after the prospecting is completed, application for granting ML

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                    Page 11 of 20</span>
 shall be made and Government at that time would examine all the aspects and

would impose the terms and conditions including compensatory afforestation if

required in lieu of the cutting of trees and presently it is only for the purpose of

prospecting of mineral and no tree is required to be cut and after prospecting is

done, the Government would take a conscious decision as to whether it is

necessary to allow mining of the mineral if found located and if required, take up

compensatory afforestation on alternate site to compensate the loss of trees existing

on the land in question. It was also averred that it is incorrect to say that the

aforesaid Mahua tree are the only source of livelihood for the villagers. In the

circumstances the Respondent No. 6 prayed for dismissal of the OA.

</p><p id="p_14">13.         In response to the reply dated 19th September, 2013 of the Respondent

No. 6, the Applicant filed rejoinder dated 9th October, 2013 stating that she is

challenging the government order on the grounds of disturbance of ecological

balance which may occur due to felling of such large number of grown up Mahua

trees which are more than 100 years old and it involves a substantial question

relating to environment and if the prospecting of mineral is permitted it may lead

to subsequent granting of ML and therefore it may be inevitable to fell such large

number of trees. It was wrongly stated by the Respondents that the area does not

qualify to be declared as 'Forest'. It contains about 397 Mahua trees and the orders

of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of T.N. Godavarman (supra) dated 12th

December, 1996 are applicable to this particular piece of land and it does qualify to

be recorded as 'Forest' where no non-forest activity can be permitted to be taken

up.    The Applicant further stated that to favour the Respondent No. 6 the

authorities deliberately bifurcated the land in Khasra No. 413 to demonstrate that

the trees in that particular portion of land where PL is granted in Khasra No. are

less in number. PL for mining was granted over 5.42 hectares though initially

Respondent No. 6 applied the PL over the entire 9.85 hectares of land in Khasra

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                  Page 12 of 20</span>
 No. 413. It was further stated that the contention of the Respondent No. 6 that there

is no material on record to suggest occurrence of iron ore deposits in the said

land, is not correct and in fact the Government of Madhya Pradesh while

addressing the Secretary, Department of Mines, Government of India stated that as

per the estimates made by the Geological Survey of India, the availability of minor

mineral laterite and major mineral iron ore over the said piece of land has been

established and the expected quantity of iron ore deposits is approximately 5.13

million tons and the Central Government has only remanded back the matter to the

State Government to comply with the norms of principles of             natural justice

without commenting upon the minutes of the case whether existence of iron ore

deposits as stated by the Government, was proved or not. It was further contended

by the Applicant that in case of granting PL for a minor mineral Madhya Pradesh

Minor Minerals Rules, 1996 come into play and as per Rule 18 of the said rules on

receipt of any application the details shall be first circulated on the notice board of

Zila Panchayat, Janpad Panchayat and Gram Sabha but in this case this mandatory

provision has been not followed. It was also stated that in Madhya Pradesh Minor

Minerals Rules, 1996 it is provided that no lease shall be sanctioned without

obtaining opinion of the concerned Gram Sabha but in the instant case no such

exercise has been done.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.       The counsel for the Applicant in his objections on behalf of the Applicant

in response to the Miscellaneous Application No. 140/2013 filed by the

Respondent No. 6, has contended that Madhya Pradesh (Prohibition or Cutting of

Trees) Rules, 2002 prohibit cutting of trees on hilly grounds. As per rule 5 cutting

of Mahua trees without permission of the District Collector in consultation with

Gram Panchayat is prohibited and in the instant case the trees are standing on hilly

terrain. It was also stated that as per the Scheduled Tribes and other <a href="/doc/121302/" id="a_17">Traditional

Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act</a>, 2006 the tribes consisting

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                   Page 13 of 20</span>
 about 100 families residing in the village come under the category of forest

dwelling tribes and the said Mahua trees are the source of their livelihood and

therefore no permission shall be granted for mining.

<p id="p_16">Discussion

</p><p id="p_17">15.    Having gone through the averments made by the Applicant and replies

submitted by the Respondents and having heard the learned counsel for the parties

at length and after persuing the record placed before us it is required to examine

the following questions in detail : -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (i)       Whether the State Government is competent to grant PL for mining of

                 minor mineral laterite in the Government land where it has earlier

                 recommended to the Central Government for granting ML for iron ore

                 which is a major mineral and why initial granting of iron ore mining

                 over a period of 30 years to M/s Ind Synergy Ltd. was cancelled by

                 the Government ?

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       (iii)     Whether there are any Rules/Orders/Notifications prohibiting cutting

                 of Mahua trees as they are one of the important sources of collection

                 of MFP by the tribals and other traditional forest dwellers irrespective

                 of their location on the Government lands other than notified forests

                 or private lands and objections raised by the villagers for granting PL

                 in government land has any legal validity?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       We may examine each of the above 3 points in detail as follows.

</blockquote><p id="p_18">16.          Point No. (i) : -
</p>
<p id="p_19">       Initially the Applicant filed this OA challenging the impugned order dated

15th May, 2013 granting PL for prospecting of laterite mineral over Khasra No. 413

in Pratappur village over an extent of 5.42 hectares. Later on, in the MA and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                     Page 14 of 20</span>
 rejoinders filed by        her, the Applicant contended that as the issue involves

substantial question relating to environment she is challenging the order and she is

not just challenging the order granting PL per se. This Tribunal can go into the

issues concerning the environment and if any decision taken or order issued by the

Government or any other authority under any of the existing Acts or Rules that

affects the environment, it can be examined and in this particular case the PL is

granted by the state government under MP Minor Mineral Rules 1996. However

the fact is that initially the State Government recommended to the Government of

India for granting of ML for iron ore mining over the same piece of land in Khasra

No. 413 but the proposal was returned back to the State Government and it clearly

reveals that the State Government took a decision to grant the PL for latetrite

which is a minor mineral and comes under the purview of the State Government

and the Respondent/Government Authorities could not explain convincingly as to

why it was agreed to grant PL for laterite mining when initially ML was proposed

to be granted for iron ore mining to M/s Ind Synergy Ltd. However, this issue

doesn't come under the purview of this Tribunal

       The main issue to be considered here is whether there is any violation of

environmental laws in granting the PL. Therefore, this Tribunal need not go into

the correctness or otherwise of the decision of the state government in granting PL

for laterite over the same piece of land where initially it recommended granting of

ML for iron ore mining which is a major mineral. Nevertheless, the concern raised

by the Applicant that mining activity over the said piece of land involves

substantial question        relating to environment will not get altered irrespective

whether it is mining of iron ore or laterite. Therefore, this Tribunal need not go into

the merits of granting PL for laterite mining or ML for iron ore mining. The

Applicant may raise this issue with the appropriate authority/ court of law if she



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                   Page 15 of 20</span>
 finds violation of any Act/rules concerning granting of mining leases by the state

government.
</p>
<p id="p_20">17.        Point No. (ii) : -
</p>
<p id="p_21">       The record placed before us reveals that the land in question is neither a

notified forest nor recorded as 'Forest' in revenue/village records. It is a revenue

land consisting tree growth. As per the recommendation of the Expert Committee,

constituted by the state government in consonance with the Hon'ble Supreme

Court orders in the case of T.N.Godavarman (supra), the land is not qualified to

be defined as 'Forest' since it did not fulfil the criteria recommended by the Expert

Committee constituted in terms of the order dated 12.12.1996 of the Hon'ble Apex

Court. Therefore it can be safely concluded that the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_19">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>,

1980 is not applicable to the land in Khasra No. 413. The contention of the

Applicant that as per the Hon'ble Supreme Court order            the meaning of the

definition of 'Forest' shall ipso facto be applied to this particular piece of land, is

not agreed to since on the basis of the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court the

State Government has constituted the Expert Committee which identified areas

outside the purview of the Forest Department and which are not recorded as

'Forest' in revenue/village records but bear tree growth and it is found that this

particular Khasra No. does not fulfil the criteria and therefore not included in the

recommendation of the Expert Committee. Thus the question of application of

<a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_20">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980 does not arise in this case.
</p>
<p id="p_22">18.        Point No. (iii) : -
</p>
<p id="p_23">         In exercise of the powers conferred by Sub-Section (1) and Clause LXI of

sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_21">Section 258</a> read with sub-section(1) of Section 240 of the

Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code, 1959 the State Government issued Madhya

Pradesh (Prohibition or Regulation of the Cutting of Trees) Rules, 2007 wherein

certain restrictions have been imposed on cutting of trees. The trees shall not be cut

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                   Page 16 of 20</span>
 without the permission of concerned Tehsildar on the recommendation of Gram

Panchayat level committee. However, the rules prescribe that the trees standing on

unoccupied Government land shall not be cut without granting permission in

writing by the District Collector and there is no provision of complete ban of

cutting Mahua trees standing on Government lands as per the above Rules. The

District Collector is having powers to accord permission to cut the Mahua trees

under the said Rues. As per the Madhya Pradesh Lokvaniki Adhiniyam, 2001 there

is a provision to regulate and facilitate management of tree clad private and

revenue lands in the State of Madhya Pradesh wherein felling of trees shall be

permitted if management plan is prepared and approved by the competent authority

and there is no ban on cutting of Mahua trees. The Applicant did not produce any

other order/notification or rule either in the OA or in the subsequent additional

applications or rejoinders filed during the course of hearing to the effect that there

is a total ban on cutting of standing Mahua trees or any restrictions imposed in the

state of Madhya Pradesh. No document was placed before us to the effect that rules

have been enacted by the state of Madhya Pradesh declaring the Mahua trees under

the category of 'Reserved trees' and they are prohibited from being cut. The rules

placed before us reveal that there is a provision of granting permission for cutting

Mohua trees. However, in this particular case only PL for mining laterite was

granted and no permission was sought or granted for cutting of trees existing on

the said piece of land. PL involves only digging holes/small pits on the ground for

extracting the mineral samples to arrive at the nature of mineral deposits and their

quantity and no felling of trees is required for the purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_24">19.    With regard to application of Scheduled Tribes and other <a href="/doc/121302/" id="a_22">Traditional Forest

Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act</a>, 2006 in this case it is found that this

Act is not applicable here as the land in question is located neither in a notified

scheduled area nor any individual or community rights accrue to the villagers for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                  Page 17 of 20</span>
 granting forest rights over a piece of land which is not notified as forest and the

land in question doesn't qualify to be brought under the definition 'Forest'.

</p><p id="p_25">20.    Therefore, mere sanctioning of PL ipso facto does not entail the lease holder

to undertake regular mining by clearing the vegetation. The apprehension of the

Applicant in this regard is unfounded. Eventually if cutting of trees is required at

the time of regular mining, if permitted subsequent to prospecting, it is for the

authorities to examine whether it is required to sacrifice such large number of

Mahua trees and if so what measures can be taken to compensate the loss of trees.

So far no evidence is produced before us that the Respondent-6 resorted to cutting

of trees and inspection by the officials of PCB also revealed that no such activities

have been taken up. The photographs placed before us also reveal that the said

land in Khasra No. is not located on a hilly terrain but it is more or less plain.

</p><p id="p_26">21.    In conclusion we may observe that though it is for the State Government to

examine the issues in totality including the resolutions passed by the Gram Sabha

and objections raised by the villagers before granting the PL it is left to the

authorities to take the aforesaid observations into account if subsequently ML is

granted based on the result of the prospecting of mineral. But in the existing

circumstances since it does not come under the category of 'Forest' there is no law

prohibiting PL in the said piece of land in Khasra No. 413. Further no information

was produced before us as to how much quantity of usufruct is being obtained

from the Mahua trees by the villagers and how much dependence they have on

these trees for their livelihood and it is for the authorities to examine how to

compensate in case the villagers' livelihood is going to be affected if in future

these trees are permitted to be cut at the time of granting ML, if granted. The EIA

Notification, 2006 requires the Applicant to seek Environmental Clearance (EC)

from MoEF/SEIAA at the time of seeking granting of ML and therefore

Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) study may be required to be conducted and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">Original Application No. 41/2013 (CZ)                                     Page 18 of 20</span>
 all the aspects related to the environment and ecology including the existence of

Mohua trees on the land in question will have to be examined by the concerned

authorities which will take care the concern of the Applicant.

</p><p id="p_27">22.    While the objective of granting PL for mining is for systematic development

of minerals which forms part of the development process of the country, it is the

duty of the Central Government and the State Government to take steps to protect

the environment and maintain the ecological balance and prevent damage that may

be caused by prospecting and mining operations. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in

the case of <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_23">M.C.Mehta vs. Union of India</a>, {2009) 6 SCC 142} while stressing the

need for regulating the mining activities in a sustainable way in view of the large

scale environmental concerns raised across the county and also to prevent further

environmental degradation, inter alia, held that;
</p>
<p id="p_28">       "......Mining within the principles of sustainable development comes within
the concept of 'balancing' whereas mining beyond the principle of sustainable
development comes within the concept of 'banning'. It is a matter of degree.
Balancing of the mining activity with environment protection and banning such
activity are two sides of the same principle of sustainable development".


</p><p id="p_29">23.    Thus it is mandatory on the part of the authorities to apply the principle of

Sustainable Development and therefore any person applying for undertaking

mining operations for both major and minor minerals is required to take prior EC

from the authority concerned i.e. MoEF at the central level or State Environment

Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) at the State level. Hence in future if ML is

going to be granted over the land in question after the prospecting is done, the

authorities shall take into account of the issues raised by the Applicant in this OA

along with the EIA report.
</p>
<p id="p_30">24.    With the above observations we have no hesitation to dismiss the OA and

accordingly the OA stands dismissed. In the facts and circumstances of the case we

direct no order as to costs.
