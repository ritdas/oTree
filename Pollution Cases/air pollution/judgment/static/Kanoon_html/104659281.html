                                deal with appeal:-
</p>
<p id="p_23">                                1. Appellate Court will interfere with judgment of acquittal if
                                judgment was found to be perverse- The findings of fact
                                recorded by a court can be held to be perverse if the findings
                                have been arrived at by ignoring or excluding relevant
                                material      or     by      taking      into      consideration
                                irrelevant/inadmissible material- A finding may also be said
                                tobe perverse if it is 'against the weight of evidence', or if the
                                finding so outrageously defies logic as to suffer from the vice
                                of irrationality. 2009 (4) RCR (Crl.) 638 : 2009 (6) RAJ 349,
                                2010 (1) RCR (Crl.) 851 relied.
</p>
<p id="p_24">                                2. Even though the appellate court is entitled to consider,
                                whether in arriving at a finding of fact, the trial Court had
                                placed the burden of proof incorrectly or failed to take into
                                consideration any admissible evidence and/or had taken into
                                consideration evidence brought on record contrary to law;
                                the appellate court should not ordinarily set aside judgment
                                of acquittal in a case where two views are possible, though
                                the view of the appellate court may be the more probable
                                one.
</p>
<p id="p_25">                                3. Trial Court which has the benefit of watching the
                                demeanor of the witnesses is the best judge of the credibility
                                of the witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_26">                                4. Every accused is presumed to be innocent unless his guilt
                                is proved - The presumption of innocence is a human right.

</p><p id="p_27">                                5. The appellate court should bear in mind the presumption
                                of innocence of the accused, and further, that the trial
