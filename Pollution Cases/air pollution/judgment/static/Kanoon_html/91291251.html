     which have been filed in the public interest, reveals an alarming state
     of affairs within the jurisdiction of Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal




                                                 
     Corporation (`PCMC'). Unauthorized constructions have been made
     brazenly without building permissions. Even according to the PCMC,
     there are over 66,000 unauthorized constructions. The PCMC has




                                                
     been lax in enforcing its obligations as a planning authority apart
     from issuing notices and lodging FIRs in certain cases.                    The
     Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (`MPCB') which is vested with




                                    
     statutory powers of enforcing the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of
                      
     Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution)
     Act</a>, 1981, has also stood by and besides issuing notices, failed to
                     
     exercise its statutory powers for enforcing compliance with law.
</p>

<p id="p_5">     3.    The Pawna River flows through the PCMC area and is a vital
      


     source of water in the area. The grievance of the Petitioner is that
   



     several unauthorized constructions have been carried out in the green
     belt of Pawna River. Many of the unauthorized constructions have





     been carried out on the river bed or on the banks of the river. One of
     them is a school named New Millenium English Medium School
     which has been constructed in the green zone. In response to a query
     under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_3">Information Act</a>, the Petitioner was informed by





     the Information Officer of PCMC that no building permission has
     been granted to construct the New Millenium English Medium
     School. The Fourth Respondent who has been brought on record is
     Pratibha Mahila Pratisthan, which conducts the New Millenium
     English Medium School on survey no.72/part.

     petition is in fact in the green belt and a part of which falls within the
     Blue Flood Line. Hence, the structure is not only unauthorized but is
     also in violation of environmental norms.           The affidavit of the




                                                  
     Executive Engineer states that there are 66,324 illegal structures
     within the municipal area; that the PCMC had issued nearly 66,324
     notices and commenced demolition of illegal structures, as a result of




                                      
     which 243 structures have been demolished. It has been stated in the
                       
     affidavit-in-reply that 863 FIRs have been lodged against the
     owners/occupiers of such unauthorized structures.              However, the
                      
     PCMC has on the ground that the number of unauthorized
     constructions is large, submitted a proposal on 2 August 2011 to the
     State Government to regularize all illegal constructions prior to 31
      


     March 2011. Subsequently, by another proposal dated 7 August 2012,
   



     the PCMC has sought the permission of the State Government to
     regularize all unauthorized constructions prior to 31 March 2012.

<p id="p_8">     5.    The Fourth Respondent has filed an affidavit-in-reply raising a
     grievance in regard to the locus of the Petitioner on the ground that
     the building where the Petitioner is residing, has been constructed in





     an unauthorized manner.       We are not inclined to entertain this
     objection. If the Petitioner has violated the law, she will be dealt with
     stringently. Learned counsel for the Petitioner denies the allegation
     and submits that her structure was regularized. Be that as it may, the

     the allegation against the structure of the Petitioner and the Fourth

     alternate accommodation within the limits of PCMC where it plans to

     Pawna River. The MPCB in its affidavit-in-reply has stated that when




                                                                          
     the site was visited on 15 April 2013 and 17 April 2013, it was found
     that two garages and one restaurant were found to be in operation in




                                                  
     close proximity to the school. MPCB called upon the PCMC by a
     letter dated 22 April 2013 to disclose the details of the action taken by
     the PCMC in respect of the four structures. The PCMC has not




                                                 
     responded thereto. Thereafter the MPCB issued a notice on 22 April
     2013 under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_4">Section 33A</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of
     Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 calling upon the concerned units to show cause




                                     
     why the water and electricity connections should not be disconnected
                      
     and effective steps should not be taken for the cessation of the
     unauthorized activities. The MPCB has indicated in its notice that the
                     
     units were operated without its consent; that they were located on the
     banks of Pawna River and that hazardous waste has been disposed off
     in an unscienitific manner.
</p>      
   



<p id="p_16">     9.    The material which has been placed on the record leaves no
     manner of doubt that there is a complete breakdown of governance in





     the enforcement of urban planning legislation within the jurisdiction
     of PCMC. The PCMC is a planning authority within the meaning of
     the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act, 1966 and is duty bound
     to enforce those provisions. As many as 66,324 structures are found





     to be unauthorized. Even after issuing notices of demolition, the
     PCMC has taken action only against 225 structures. The illegalities
     are compounded by a proposal for regularization en masse. This is a
     virtual negation of the rule of law. Learned counsel for PCMC states
     that PCMC lacks adequate infrastruture and is dependent on the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                  ::: Downloaded on - 27/11/2013 20:23:22 :::</span>

     Police authorities to support its enforcement measures.               What is




                                                                          
     disturbing is the complete absence of administrative will on the part
     of the authorities of the State including the planning authority to take




                                                  
     cognizance of the serious dimensions of the unauthorized structures
     within the limits of PCMC. PCMC has compounded the illegalities
     by now proposing to regularize initially all structures which had come




                                                 
     up prior to 31 March 2011 and subsequently all structures which have
     come up prior to 31 March 2012. The consequence of these proposals
     does not require any stretch of imagination to appreciate. What the




                                      
     PCMC has proposed to do in fact acts as an incentive for those who
                       
     carry out unauthorized constructions, since the violaters of the law
     can be sanguine in that belief that their structures will not be
                      
     demolished and in fact would be tolerated at a future date.                  We
     emphatically disapprove of the conduct and the decisions of the

     the unauthorized structures to which a reference has been made in the





     affidavit-in-reply of the PCMC in accordance with law.                      The

     building permission and totally in violation of law.            We find no




                                                  
     justification in the contention of the Fourth Respondent that no action
     be proceeded against it because a large number of students have been
     admitted. Such illegalities are sought to be justified by adverting to




                                                 
     the human aspects involved. Having due regard to the aforesaid
     position of which the Court cannot be oblivious, we have recorded the
     assurance of the counsel for the Fourth Respondent, on instructions,




                                     
     that all the trustees of the Fourth Respondent shall file their personal
                      
     affidavits undertaking that the unauthorized construction shall be
     removed voluntarily and completely on or before 31 May 2014. We
                     
     direct the Fourth Respondent to restore the site to its original
     condition to the satisfaction of MPCB on or before 31 May 2014.
     The affidavits containing undertakings to be filed by all the trustees
      


     shall also specify that all the costs, charges and expenses that may be
   



     required by the MPCB or any other agency for restoring the site to its
     original condition, shall be borne and met by the Fourth Respondent.

<p id="p_19">     MPCB shall for that purpose call upon the Fourth Respondent to
     place at its disposal such funds as may be necessary for taking
     suitable remedial measures to restore the environment. We also direct
     the PCMC to take due steps to ensure, in the event that the structure





     of the Fourth Respondent is not removed by 31 May 2014, the
     removal of the unauthorized structure. The Commissioner of Police
     shall render all necessary assistance to the PCMC for that purpose.
