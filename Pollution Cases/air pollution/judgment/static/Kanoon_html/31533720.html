<p id="p_1">             Petitioner-Sanjeev Kumar by way of the present petition under

Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India seeks quashing of the order

through its Member Secretary, Punjab State Pollution Control Board,

Vatavaran Bhawan, Nabha Road, Patiala (respondent no.1) ('Board' - for short)

to establish and start business/industry of poultry farm in the name and style of

'M/s A-One Poultry Farm'. The permission was granted to the petitioner vide

NOC     G16PTACTE410442 dated 24.05.2016 (Annexure P-2), which was

issued vide letter dated 25.05.2016. The petitioner got the construction of

infrastructure started in the poultry farm in question. According to the

petitioner, the construction had been got stopped by notorious persons as they

did not want the poultry farm to continue probably for their own self motive.

Therefore, threats were held out to the petitioner and also to the labour

working at the site of construction. The matter was also reported to the

concerned police post in terms of a complaint dated 17.06.2016 (Annexure

P-3). Since, the threats had continued, the petitioner filed CRM-M-23398 of

2016 titled as "Sanjeev Kumar Vs. The Sr. Superintendent of Police, Patiala

and others" in this Court for providing protection to his life and liberty. The

said petition was disposed of by this Court vide order dated 22.07.2016

(Annexure P-4) directing the Senior Superintendent of Police, Patiala to look

into the contents of the complaint dated 17.6.2016 submitted to the concerned

police in-charge and to take necessary action thereon in accordance with law.

According to the petitioner, notorious persons who belong to the ruling

party/State Govt. had their personal interests and had got the construction of

the poultry farm stopped.

             The said reply is taken on record.

</pre><p id="p_5">             A short reply of Sh. Rakesh Kumar Nayar, Environment Engineer

of the Board has already been filed on behalf of respondents No.1 and 2.

According to the said reply a complaint was received from the office of the

Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Rajpura regarding nuisance caused by poultry

farms existing at villages Bathonia Kalan, Bathonia Khurd, Suhron and

Jakhepal etc. The Sub Divisional Magistrate, Rajpura, it is submitted, called a

meeting on 01.04.2016 and it was decided that the Board Officers would visit

six poultry farms at the aforesaid villages along with representatives of the

villages and would submit their report to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate. The

poultry farms were visited on 01.04.2015 (sic. 2016) and again on 02.05.2016

and detailed reports of the Environmental Engineer of the Board were sent to

the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Rajpura.           Meanwhile, residents of villages

gathered at village Bathonia and started agitation against the authorities

demanding that the poultry farms be shut down immediately. The agitation of

the villages continued for more than a week. The roads leading to the poultry

farms were blocked. The District Administration made different committees to

assess the situation and also take preventive measures to control the nuisance

caused from the operation of the poultry farms.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             It is further submitted that the petitioner had applied for 'consent

to establish' (NOC) from the pollution angle for the establishment of poultry

farm for 1,00,000 birds (Eggs @ 70,000 nos./day) at village Shambu Kalan,

Tehsil Rajpura, District Patiala. The poultry farm submitted the requisite

documents and fee along with its application form. The site was visited by an

officer of the Board on 16.05.2016. The proposed site met with the general

guidelines to establish the unit as per the Board's policy dated 30.04.2013 and

environmental guidelines for poultry farm issued by CPCB vide letter dated

                                   3 of 8

 CWP No. 18381 of 2016(O&amp;M)                  [4]

20.10.2015. Therefore, after considering the application of the petitioner,

'consent to establish' (NOC) from pollution angle with certain conditions was

granted vide letter 25.05.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             The Board then received a letter dated 06.06.2016 (Annexure

R-2/1) from the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Rajpura stating that in case the

consent was granted for setting up a poultry farm, it would lead to a law and

order situation as the residents of the village/Panchayat had expressed their

disapproval for setting up a new poultry farm in the area and near to the land

owned by the Gurudwara Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Therefore, it was addressed

to the Board that the 'consent to establish' should not be granted to the poultry

farm without the permission of the residents of the village and the Gram

Panchayat. In the light of the aforesaid letter, the competent authority of the

Board decided to revoke the NOC already granted to the poultry farm in terms

of the advise of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Rajpura because there was

public resentment against the establishment of the poultry farm. It is also

mentioned that vide communication dated 11.11.2016 (Annexure R-2/2) the

Sub Divisional Magistrate again informed the Board that in case permission

was granted for the establishment of a poultry farm, it would lead to serious

law and order situation. The 'consent to establish' (NOC) granted to the

poultry farm had been cancelled by the Board keeping in view the

recommendations/directions of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Rajpura in

order to avoid a serious law and order situation in the said area. It is, however,

submitted that the Board had no objection in granting the NOC if the District

Administration has no reservation in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             In terms of the reply of respondent No.3, it is stated that the

petitioner after obtaining NOC from the Sr. Environmental Engineer of the

Board (respondent no.2), started construction work at the site at village

                                   4 of 8

Shambu Kalan, Tehsil Rajpura, District Patiala. However, residents of the

neighboring village as also the Gram Panchayat raised protests against the said

construction. The predecessor of the present Sub Divisional Magistrate,

Rajpura vide letter dated 06.06.2016 (Annexure R-3/1) sent a request

accompanied by applications of the Gram Panchayat of villages Basmah,

Sharnbu Kalan, Shambu Rajputa, Lohad, Nandgarh, Sarai Mugal, Ghadama

Kalan/Khurd, Nosahara, Ram Nagar Sainiya, Nanhera, Tepla, Ragarh and

Gurudwara Sahib Shambu Kalan to the State Government through Member

Secretary of the Board and the Senior Environmental Engineer of the Board

(respondents no.1 and 2). It was submitted that 'M/s A-One Poultry Farm'

Shambu Kalan wanted to start a poultry farm in the land in Khewat Khata

No.620/753 and 804/944. The said land was in the ownership share and

possession of Guru Granth Sahib, Shambu Kalan. Its boundary ridge ('watt')

adjoins the land of the Gurudwara Sahib. In case the petitioner succeeds in

setting up a poultry farm in the said land, then there would be great difficulty

with respect to the above referred Gurudawara Sahib and other residents of

village Shambu Kalan. The Gram Panchayat of Village Shambu Kalan had also

passed a resolution dated 17.05.2016 for stopping the above referred poultry

farm to be operational. It is submitted that in case, without the consent of the

Panchayat, the poultry farm was allowed in the vicinity of the adjoining

Gurudwara Sahib, then feelings of the people would be hurt and there would

be danger to law and order. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Rajpura

(respondent No.3) sought a fresh report regarding law and order from the

Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ghanour vide letter dated 14.10.2016

(Annexure R-3/2). This was sought after letter dated 06.10.2016 (Annexure

R-3/3) was received from the Environmental Engineer of the Board

(respondent No.2). The Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ghanour vide letter

dated 10.11.2016 (Annexure R-3/4) submitted if the construction of M/s A-

One Poultry Farm was started or it was allowed to function, then the residents

of the area would raise strong protests and there would be an apprehension of

breach of peace and law and order.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             In short, the case of the petitioner is that for setting up a poultry

farm by the name of M/s A-One Poultry Farm in village Shambu Kalan, he

was granted 'consent to establish' an industrial unit under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_1">Section 24</a> of the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of the

Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 vide communication dated

24.05.2016 (Annexure P-2). The said consent was granted by the Sr.

Environmental Engineer of the Board (respondent no.2). However, now the

said consent had been revoked vide letter dated 12.07.2016 (Annexure P-12).

The said revocation of the licence of the petitioner is without hearing or even

issuing a show cause notice to him.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             We have given our thoughtful consideration to the matter. We are

of the view that the rule of audi alteram partem is a well accepted facet of the

principles of natural justice as enshrined by the provisions of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_5">Article 21</a> of the

Constitution of India and a person has a right to be heard before any order

adverse to him and affecting his rights is passed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">             In National Textile Workers' Union etc. v. P.R.Ramakrishnan and

others, AIR 1983 SC 75 it was observed that the audi alteram partem rule

which mandates that no one shall be condemned unheard is one of the basic

principles of natural justice and if this rule is held to be applicable in a quasi-

judicial or even in an administrative proceeding involving adverse civil

consequences, it would a fortiori apply in a judicial proceeding such as a

petition for winding up of a company. It was further observed that it would

indeed be strange that the workers who had contributed to the building of the

                                   6 of 8

enterprise as a centre of economic power should have no right to be heard

when it is sought to demolish that centre of economic power.

</p><p id="p_12">             In the circumstances, no order involving adverse civil

consequences is liable to be passed against any person without giving him an

opportunity to be heard against the order that is to be passed and this rule of

natural justice applies to quasi-judicial and administrative proceedings. The

Senior Environmental Engineer of the Board (respondent no.2), in the present

case, passed the order dated 12.07.2016 (Annexure P-12) without notice and

without hearing the petitioner. The Senior Environment Engineer of the Board

(respondent no.2) who passed the impugned order may or may not be justified

in doing so; however, the right of hearing to an aggrieved person, who has got

the NOC/consent to operate the poultry farm after complying with all the

necessary conditions was not liable to be dispensed with. Therefore, the

petitioner was not liable to be non-suited on the ground as had been stated in

the impugned order (Annexure P-12). We are of the view that the order dated

12.07.2016 (Annexure P-12) is to be invalidated and an opportunity of hearing

is liable to be given to the petitioner so as to explain his position and satisfy

the authorities of his case.
</p>
<p id="p_13">             Accordingly, the civil writ petition is allowed and the order dated

12.07.2016 (Annexure P-12) is set aside and quashed and the matter is

remitted back to the Board for passing a fresh order after hearing the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_14">             Learned counsel for the petitioner states that till such time the

matter is heard and decided, he shall maintain status quo at the site. However,

it is prayed that the Board may expedite the hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_15">             In the circumstances, status quo with regard to the position at the

site shall be maintained by the petitioner. However, the Board shall consider

and decide the case of the petitioner as expeditiously as possible and

preferably within three months from the receipt of the copy of the order. It is

also submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the NOC is up till

May, 2017 and in case the NOC is to be continued, the same may also be

considered for extension of period.
</p>
<p id="p_16">             The Board at the time of consideration of the case of the petitioner

for grant of consent to operate in case it decides to grant the necessary consent,

it shall also consider the extension of time to the petitioner to a date beyond

May 2017, keeping in view the present litigation.</p><pre id="pre_3">
