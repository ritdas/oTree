06-05-2015


Shri Vikas Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioner.
Shri N.S. Ruprah, learned counsel for respondent nos. 2, 4,</pre>
<p id="p_1">5 &amp; 7.
</p><p id="p_2">Shri Kunal Thakre, learned counsel for respondent no.8.
Grievance of the petitioner in this petition is that the
respondents have started a coal dumping in open area
besides a source station in an open ground, which is
creating environmental pollution and it is hazardous to the
residents of the area. On notice being issued, respondents
have filed reply and from the reply filed by the railway
administration it seems that the railway siding has been
constructed for transportation of coal to the thermal power
plant in various areas. That apart, they have indicated that
on complaint made by the villagers the Collector and SDO
had conducted an enquiry and they have given reports
which do not show any nuisance or hindrance to the
villagers. Be it as it may, the Pollution Control Board
respondent 9 has filed a detailed reply and in para 3 of the
reply following assertions are made by the Pollution
Control Board.
</p><p id="p_3">         â3.(a). The respondent submits that the
         respondent no.8 Vardha Power, Varora, is
         located in Chandrapur Distt. of State of
         Maharashtra. Coal is supplied to the plant
       from Western Coalfields Ltd., in Distt.
      Chhindwara, State of Madhya Pradesh.
      Presently, it is transported from Coal Mines
      to the Power Plant through dumpers, trucks
      i.e. public transport system.
</p><p id="p_4">      (b) The Railways have constructed railway
      siding near Khirsadoh for purposes of
      loading and unloading of all sorts of goods
      (except Petrol and Iron-ores). It is on the
      land belonging to the Railways and is
      available for use by one and all. The Senior
      Divisional      Commercial   Superintendent,
      Nagpur, has assured the Board vide
      communication dated 10/2/2015 (Annexure
      R-9/1) that the following precautions would
      be taken whenever the process of unloading
      and loading of coal at the said railway siding
      takes place:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          a) The trucks carrying coal from mines
          to the Khirsadoh railway siding would
          be covered by tarpolins;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">          b) The trucks carrying coal would be
          driven at a speed less than 10 Km per
          hour;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">c. The transporters would be asked to sprinkle
  water on approach road and coal depot
  regularly.
</p><p id="p_6">  It was stated that so far the work of transporting
     coal by railways and loading and unloading of
    coal on the railway siding has not commenced.
</p><p id="p_7">    (c) The respondent Board officials also made
    inspection of railway siding on 26/2/2015
    (Annexure R-9/2). It was found that the railway
    station Khirsadoh has been developed; the
    railway siding is to the opposite side of the
    railway station on the land belonging to the
    Railways. Coal from Western Coalfields Ltd.
    Parasiya coal mines would be supplied to the
    power station and that unloading and loading of
    coal would be done on the siding. Reluctantly,
    there is possibility of coal dust emissions for
    which presently there is no arrangement. The
    railway siding is open from both sides. There is
    neither boundary wall nor shed provided to the
    railway siding nor there is any provision for
    sprinkling of water. Plantation of trees is also not
    there. On the date of inspection, about four
    trucks carrying coal about 100 tonnes were
    unloading on railway siding.â

The aforesaid assertion made by the Pollution Control
Board in para 3 of the return clearly goes to show that all
steps for preventing environmental pollution have been
taken by the Pollution Control Board and respondent
railway administration and the Coal Company are directed
to ensure that all the preventive measures indicated by the
Pollution Control Board are undertaken by them and
 strictly complied with. That apart, in case the petitioner
feels any violation of the regulations made under the
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Pollution Control Act</a> which is creating environmental
pollution in area, they may represent in the matter to the
Pollution Control Board and it would be for the Pollution
Control Board to consider the representation of the
petitioner and pass such orders and take such preventive
steps as may be permissible.
</p><p id="p_8">For the present, in the light of aforesaid no further
directions are required in the matter.
The petition is disposed of with the aforesaid.</p><pre id="pre_2">
