VINEET SARAN, CJ.,           The petitioners, who are the local residents of

         village Bidyadharpur, have filed this application in the nature of

         Public Interest Litigation seeking direction for cancellation of lease

         granted in favour of "Sri Sri Ravishankar University Trust" on the

         ground that the trust is misusing the land by violating the terms
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>


of the lease and consequentially the government is losing huge

revenue towards lease premium and that the trust has acquired

excess land beyond the lease area.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">2.         The factual matrix of the case is that "Sri Sri

Ravishankar University Trust" approached the Government to

take some land on lease for the purpose of education by

establishing a University. Consequentially, for establishment of

Sri Sri Ravishankar University in Odisha by law and to confer the

status of University thereon and for matters connected therewith

or incidental thereto, the legislature of the State of Odisha in the

60th year of the Republic of India enacted an Act called "<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_1">The Sri

Sri University Act</a>, 2009" which received assent of the Governor

on 01.12.2009 and was published in the official gazettee on

26.12.2009   and    known   as   Orissa   Act   18   of   2009.   For

establishment of such University, application for grant of lease

land was submitted and accordingly the Government decided to

grant lease of land for the interest of students who will get free

and   qualitative   education.       Accordingly,    Lease    Cases

No.1(R)/2007, 2(R)/2007 and 3(R)/2007 were initiated before the

Tahasildar, Baranga, who, on consideration of such applications,

issued RoR in the name of opposite party no.7 relating to Khata
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 3</span>


No.94-D1 of area 105 acres, Khata No.2-D1 of area 32 acres, and

Khata No.19-D1 of area 48 acres, in total 185 acres, indicating

the lease cases respectively and fixed 1% ground rent and 75%

cess in respect of the lease land. As per 1% ground rent the lease

holder was to pay per year a sum of Rs.57,32,451/- in respect of

area 105 acres, Rs.64,380/- in respect of 32 acres and

Rs.3,01,313/- in respect of 48 acres in total Rs.60,98,144/-. But

subsequently, the said ground rent was reduced from 1% to

0.25% and fixed the rent of Rs.14, 33, 112.75. Similarly, cess of

Rs.26,67,937.25 per annum was determined.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
2.1        The lease holder-opposite party no.7 has not been

paying the rent as fixed since last 10 years, causing huge loss to

the Government, as well as the public. Further, the lease holder

has failed to use the lease land for which purpose it was acquired.

As per the Memorandum of Understanding dated 12.12.2006,

executed between the Government of Odisha, Higher Education

Department and opposite party no.7, the trustee was to set up

Multi Disciplinary University in a phased manner to accommodate

15,000 students and 155 faculty members. More than 12

disciplines were to be set up in the University and more than 10

number research centres were to be opened. For this purpose the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      4</span>


lease holder required 200 acres of land for which the Government

had agreed to provide the land. More so, the MoU was valid for a

period of 3 years and it was to be extended if necessary and on

that basis further mutual agreement was to be made between the

parties. Though such MoU has expired on 12.12.2009, the same

has not been extended.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
2.2         At the time of granting of lease there was strong

protest by the villagers, including the petitioners, as such lease

was going to affect their day to day life, as the lease hold land was

basically used for grazing of cows and goats, the collection of

minor forest produce, seasonal cultivation in periphery area of

Pahad and also used for communal functions and open play

ground. Over the lease land the villagers and petitioners were

approaching to the main road for their convenience, which was

shortest route. The grievance of the villagers was considered and

consequently a meeting was held on 08.12.2010 between the

villagers   and   opposite   party       no.8   in   presence   of   District

Magistrate, Cuttack and local representatives of Cuttack and

Banki and decisions were taken to provide certain facilities to the

villagers. In compliance of the said decision, no action has been

taken. The petitioners claim for cancellation of lease and to set up
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5</span>


Government Offices, medical, schools etc. on the lease land which

will be beneficial to the periphery villages. Hence this application.


</p><p id="p_9">3.          Mr. S. Mohanty, learned counsel for the petitioners

strenuously urged that the lands which have been granted to

opposite parties no.7 and 8 on lease, having not achieved the

objectives and there being gross violation of the conditions of

discussion held on 08.12.2010 and the Government has been

loosing its revenue for the last 10 years and more so the MoU

executed on 12.12.2006 (which was to be extended after three

years), having been expired on 12.12.2009, has not been extended

further, there is every justifiable reason to cancel the lease.

Therefore, the petitioners, being the local villagers, have filed this

public interest litigation seeking aforesaid relief.


</p><p id="p_10">4.          Per contra, Mr. B.P. Pradhan, learned Additional

Government Advocate appearing for the State opposite parties

contended that if opposite parties no.7 and 8 have not paid their

dues admissible to the Government as per the terms of the lease

deed, it is the Government which will take action and not the

petitioners. So far as implementation of the decision taken in the

meeting held on 08.12.2010 is concerned, the aggrieved party has

to approach the appropriate authority instead of filing the instant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    6</span>


application. He thus contended that the instant writ petition filed

by the petitioners is in the form of a private interest litigation but

not public interest litigation, and as such is liable to be

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">5.           We have heard Mr. S. Mohanty, learned counsel for

the   petitioners   and   Mr.   B.P.   Pradhan,   learned   Additional

Government Advocate for the State opposite parties and perused

the records.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">6.           Undisputedly, for establishment of "Sri Sri University",

by way of legislation the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_2">Sri Sri University Act</a>, 2009 has been

enacted. For the purpose of establishment of such institution, 185

acres of land has been allotted on consideration of lease

application filed by opposite party no.7.         The said lease was

granted by following due procedure of law. As per terms and

conditions of the lease deed, opposite parties no.7 and 8 are liable

to pay the ground rent, as well as cess mentioned therein. If such

amount has not been paid, as alleged in this application, it is

open to the authority, which is aggrieved thereby, to approach the

appropriate forum for realization of said amount, but the

petitioners have no locus standi to raise such question, that too

in the shape of a public interest litigation. In the name of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      7</span>


"protector" of the property of the Government, the petitioners

cannot and could not approach this Court by filing this public

interest litigation.

</p><p id="p_16">7.          <a href="/doc/45508/" id="a_3">In Chhetriya Pardushan Mukti Sangharsh Samkiti

v. State of U.P</a>., 1990(4) SCC 449 the apex Court held as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "A public interest litigation was initiated alleging
      environmental pollution caused by a factory exposing the
      population to health hazards and life risk. After closely
      examining the facts, circumstances and nature of
      allegations in the light of long history of enmity it was
      found that Public Interest Litigation was a result of rivalry
      between the petitioners and factory owners. Prima facie
      too there was compliance with <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Air Pollution Control Act</a>.
      Hence, it was held that there was no contravention of
      fundamental right. Petition creating bottleneck in the
      Court amounted to abuse of legal process and the Court
      must protect the society from the so-called "protectors".
      The application was found to be legally devoid of any
      merit or principles of public interest and public protection.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            Sabyasachi Mukherjee, C.J., observed:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             "While it is the duty of this Court to enforce
      fundamental rights, it is also the duty of this Court to
      ensure that this weapon under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_5">Article 32</a> should not be
      misused or permitted to be misused creating a bottleneck
      in the superior Court preventing other genuine violation of
      fundamental rights being considered by the Court."

1989 Supp (1) SCC 251, the apex Court observed as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "A Public Interest Litigation was filed concerning
      mismanagement of a public trust (museum continuing
      priceless articles) run by the Chairman of Sawai Man Singh
      II Museum Trust. The petitioners relying on Articles 49 and
      51-A(f) called upon State to protect the museum by replacing

     Chairman. Meanwhile disputes and litigation were going on
     between the petitioners and respondents. It was held by the
     Supreme Court that the petition does not seek to advance
     any public right. Invocation of jurisdiction of Supreme Court
     as a Public Interest Litigation in the background of
     allegations was wholly unjustified. Public Interest Litigation
     does not mean settling disputes between individual parties.
     It is imperative to lay down clear guidelines and outline the
     correct parameters for entertaining Public Interest Litigation
     petitions."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_18">9.         In view of law discussed above, it is made clear that it

is the duty of the Court to enforce fundamental rights and also it

is the duty of the Court to ensure that the weapon under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article

226</a> should not be exercised and should not be permitted to be

misused, creating a bottleneck for any development work to be

undertaken. In the present case, since by enactment of legislation

the University has been established, if there is contravention of

any provision of lease deed so executed, it is the appropriate

authority to take action but not the petitioners by way of filing

public interest litigation. It is not understood as to how the

petitioners would be directly or indirectly affected by such

acquisition which has been validly done more than a decade back

and it is admitted by the petitioners that the University has been

established. Therefore, the public interest litigation jurisdiction

should   not   be   utilized   for   hampering     the   progress     and

development work. The purpose for which the land was given to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                               9</span>


        the opposite parties no.7 and 8 is being admittedly fulfilled by

        establishing the University in a phased manner. It is not the duty

        of the Court to go into the various technical details in the case of

        this kind.    Therefore, the jurisdiction of this Court should not be

        utilized for personal interest, as has been attempted to be done in

        the present case.
