          DATED THIS THE 16th DAY OF JUNE 2020

                        BEFORE

                                       ...RESPONDENT

(BY SMT: M R VANAJA, ADVOCATE)
                                 2



     THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED U/S.482 CR.P.C
PRAYING TO QUASH THE ENTIRE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE
PETR. IN C.C.NO.526/2015 ON THE FILE OF THE PRL. CIVIL
JUDGE AND JMFC, HOSADURGA, CHITRADURGA DISTRICT.

     THIS CRIMINAL PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR ORDERS ON 05.06.2020 AND COMING ON FOR
PRONOUNCMENT OF ORDER THROUGH VIDEO CONFERENCE
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-

                              ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      The relief claimed in the petition is to quash the entire

proceedings pending against the petitioner in C.C.No.526/2015

on the file of Prl. Civil Judge and JMFC, Hosadurga, Chitradurga.


</p><p id="p_2">      2. Essential facts necessary for consideration of the

petition are as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">      The respondent herein, namely, The Karnataka State

Pollution Control Board instituted a complaint proceedings

against Hosadurga Town Municipal Council, Hosadurga by its

Chief Officer (N. Chandrashekar) petitioner herein under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">section

200</a> Cr.P.C. r/w <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_2">section 44</a> and <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_3">49</a> of Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Water

Act</a>' for short). On service of process, petitioner filed an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   3</span>



application under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">section 245(2)</a> Cr.P.C. praying to discharge

him of the alleged offences, on the ground that the complainant

did not issue statutory notice to him as required under <a href="/doc/1650626/" id="a_7">section

49(1)</a> (b) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water Act</a> before instituting the private

complaint; secondly, the complainant did not obtain previous

sanction from the Government as required under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_9">section 197</a>

Cr.P.C. and that there was no material to frame charge against

the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">        3. Before the learned magistrate, petitioner relied on the

decision of this Court in the case of Sri. D.H. Raya Vs. Karnataka

State    Pollution   Control   Board   and   another   rendered   in

Crl.P.No.831/2007 dated 18.01.2012 in support of his contention

that institution of criminal action without previous sanction under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">section 197</a> Cr.P.C. and without issuance of statutory notice as

contemplated under <a href="/doc/1650626/" id="a_11">section 49(1)</a> (b) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">Water Act</a> is bad in

law. However, the learned magistrate by its order dated

27.06.2016 dismissed the application holding that as per <a href="/doc/1577175/" id="a_13">section

48</a> of the Water Act, complaint against the petitioner/accused is

maintainable without previous sanction from the Government
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>



and it is for the petitioner/accused to show before the Court that

the offence was committed without his knowledge or that he

exercised all due diligence to prevent commission of such

offence.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      4. On dismissal of this application, the petitioner/accused

has preferred the instant petition under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_14">section 482</a> Cr.P.C.

seeking to quash the entire proceedings on the very same

grounds. In the course of argument, learned counsel has

strongly placed reliance on the decision rendered by this Court in

Shri D.H. Raya Vs. Karnataka State Pollution Control Board

referred above as well as the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court In Re:Bhavani River Vs. Sakthi Sugars Ltd., (1998) 2 SCC

601 and emphasized that in the light of the proposition laid down

in the above decision and for non-compliance of statutory

requirement contemplated under <a href="/doc/1650626/" id="a_15">section 49(1)</a> (b) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_16">Water

Act</a>, the proceedings initiated against the petitioner amount to

abuse of process of Court and therefore the same is liable to be

quashed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  5</span><p id="p_9">



</p><p id="p_10">      5. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent however

argued for dismissal of the petition contending that in view of

clear provision of <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_17">sections 44</a> and <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_18">49</a> of the Water Act, continued

act of Hosadurga Town Municipal Council to discharge untreated

sewage into natural drain and low lying area without subjecting

to treatment clearly attract the penal provisions under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_19">sections

44</a> r/w 25 of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_20">Water Act</a> and that prior to initiation of the

proceedings, a statutory notice was also issued to Chief Officer,

Hosadurga under the provision of <a href="/doc/1965082/" id="a_21">section 31(2)</a> of the Water Act

and therefore, there is no illegality whatsoever either in the

institution of the proceedings or in the matter of taking

cognizance of the alleged offences by the magistrate and thus

sought for dismissal of the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">      6. I have bestowed my careful thought to the contentions

urged by learned counsel for the parties and have carefully

scrutinized the material on record.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      7. The material allegations leveled against the accused is

that the Municipal Council has been discharging sewage from the

entire Town into the natural nalla(canal, stream etc.,) and that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  6</span>



the TMC was bound to adopt/establish proper treatment plant

and after treatment only, it had to allow the sewage to flow into

natural stream. Yet, without treatment and without obtaining

valid consent, the Town Municipal Council has been discharging

the sewage and hence, the complainant issued notice of

intention in Form No.XII to the Chief Officer, Hosadurga under

the provision of <a href="/doc/42433/" id="a_22">section 31(1)</a> of Water Act. Since the accused

failed to abide by the said notice, the petitioner/accused has

rendered himself liable for prosecution under <a href="/doc/1577175/" id="a_23">section 48</a> of the

Water Act.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">     8. Learned counsel for the petitioner has based his

argument     mainly   on   the       decision   of   this   Court   in

Crl.P.No.831/2007 in the case of <a href="/doc/132886811/" id="a_24">Shri D.H. Raya v. Karnataka

State Pollution Control Board and another</a> wherein it has been

held that in view of the legal bar contained in <a href="/doc/1577175/" id="a_25">section 48</a> of the

Water Act, proceedings against the officer of a Government

Department cannot be continued. In laying down the said

proposition, the Single Judge of this Court relied on the earlier

Division Bench judgment of this Court in Crl.A.No.755/2010 in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7</span>



V.C. CHINNAPPA GOUDAR v. KARNATAKA STATE POLLUTION

CONTROL BOARD AND ANOTHER, (2015) 14 SCC 535, arising

out of W.P.(C).No.30610/2008. Both these decisions came up for

consideration of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/84791461/" id="a_26">KARNATAKA STATE POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD v. B. HEERA

NAIK AND OTHERS</a>, 2019, SCC ONLINE SC 1528, wherein the

Hon'ble Supreme Court dealing with the specific issue as to

"Whether the Municipal Commissioner of City Municipal Council

or Chief Officer of City Municipal Council are Head of the

Department of any department of Government so as to answer

the charges for the offences and are liable for the offence under

<a href="/doc/1577175/" id="a_27">section 48</a>, observed that the judgment of this Court in

Crl.A.No.755/2010- V.C. Chinnappa Goudar v. Karnataka State

Pollution Control Board and Another, wherein the Division Bench

judgment of the High Court has been affirmed and has laid down

the ratio to the effect that sanction under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_28">section 197</a> Cr.P.C.

was not required for proceeding under <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_29">section 49</a> of the Water

Act. Although reference under <a href="/doc/1577175/" id="a_30">section 48</a> has been made in the

said judgment, but there was no further consideration with

regard to <a href="/doc/1577175/" id="a_31">section 48</a>, whereas the Patna High Court in Criminal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  8</span>



Misc No.7268 of 2005- <a href="/doc/1445791/" id="a_32">ARUN KUMAR SINGH v. THE STATE OF

BIHAR</a> while noticing <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_33">section 141</a>, specifically held that the

definition of Company as given therein is wider than the

definition in the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_34">Companies Act</a> and includes the body corporate.

This view has been affirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

above decision and ultimately it has held that <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_35">section 47</a> could

be resorted to for offences by body corporate and Karnataka

State Pollution Control Board by filing a complaint before the

Magistrate for taking cognizance of the offence under <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_36">section 49</a>

did not commit any error.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">      In the light of this decision, the legal contention urged by

the learned counsel for the petitioner that the prosecution

instituted against him is legally untenable is liable to be rejected.

Insofar as the factual contention urged by learned counsel for

the petitioner with regard to issuance of notice is concerned, on

perusal    of    copy     of   the     complaint     produced     at

Annexure-A, it is noticed that clear averments are made in para

7 of the complaint, wherein it is stated that the complainant

issued a notice in form No.XII to the Chief Officer, Town
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 9</span>



Municipal Council, Hosadurga under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1965082/" id="a_37">section

31(2)</a> of the Water Act. As such, even this ground is not

available to the petitioner to challenge the action initiated

against him in his capacity as the head of the Department at the

relevant time. As a result, the petition fails and is accordingly

dismissed.
