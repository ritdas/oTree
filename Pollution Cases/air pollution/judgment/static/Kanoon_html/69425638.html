JUDGMENT :            (PER A.S. OKA, J.)

                             MANGROVES                                                    
1             This Public Interest Litigation (PIL) concerns the issue of
destruction of mangroves in the entire State of Maharashtra. The word
"Mangrove" is considered to be a combination of the Portuguese word
"Mangue"   and   the   English   word   "grove".   Mangroves   are   salt-tolerant
plants of tropical and subtropical intertidal regions of the world. The
specific   regions   where   these   plants   occur   are   termed   as   'mangrove
ecosystem'.   These   are   highly   productive   but   extremely   sensitive   and
fragile. It is said about the mangroves that they are living life on the
edge, with one foot on land and one in the sea.   They survive in a harsh
environment,   adapting   well   to   the   scorching   heat,   deep   mud   and
saltwater that would otherwise kill other plants. Yet they are tenacious
and very useful for the environment.   The occasion  for filing the main

                                                                                  2 of 83
                                                                      pil-87.06 final.doc

PIL is that the importance of very tenacious mangroves for the benefit of
the mankind is ignored and mangroves are being destructed in the State
on a very large scale.

<p id="p_2">            FACTUAL ASPECTS AND PRAYERS IN PIL 87 OF 2006
2                  The   first   petitioner   is   a   society   registered   under   the
Societies' <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_1">Registration Act</a>, 1860.  It is the case of the first petitioner that
it   is   committed   to   protection   and   preservation   of   environment.   It   is
pointed   out   that   the   State   of   Maharashtra   has   a   coastline   of   720
kilometers   which   is   indented   by   numerous   rivers,   estuaries,   creeks,
small bays, rocky shores and muddy beaches. It is pointed out in the
petition   that   there   are   18   major   estuaries   along   with   coastline   of
Maharashtra   harboring   some   of   the   biologically   richest   patches   of
mangroves along the entire western coast of India. It is stated that there
are   52   creeks   in   the   State   along   the   coast   which   are   covered   by
mangroves. The petitioners have relied upon a map annexed at Exhibit-
A   which   is   titled   as   "Mangroves   Status   1997"   which   is   said   to   be   a
satellite image of coast of Greater Mumbai in the year 1997.  Basically,
the petition is filed for inviting attention of the Court to the large scale
destruction   or   denudation   of   mangroves.   The   petition   seeks   a
declaration   that   the   areas   covered   by   mangroves   in   the   State   of
Maharashtra in addition to those covered by mangroves forest should be
declared as mangroves protection area. 
</p>

<p id="p_3">3                  In   paragraph   (i)4   of   the   petition,   mangroves   have   been
described.  Paragraph (i)4 reads thus :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "(i)  What are 'mangroves'?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">         4.        Mangroves are intertidal (growing between the high
                   tide and low tide line) evergreen forests growing on
                   the soft marshy lands of a creek, estuary or a bay in
                   the tropical and sub tropical regions. The expression

                                                                                    3 of 83
                                                                        pil-87.06 final.doc

                    'mangrove'   does   not   apply   to   a   single   species   of
                    plants,   but   to   a   complete   ecosystem   which   is   a
                    conglomeration of several species of flora, fauna and
                    biotic features in an area, and their interaction with
                    each other.  Mangroves are a peculiar habitat because
                    they are found on the boundary between the land and
                    the sea. They are found almost entirely in the tropical
                    and   sub   tropical   regions,   that   is,   between   30   degrees
                    north   and   30   degrees   south   latitude,   and   are   an
                    extension  of  the  tropical  rain  forests towards the  sea.
                    They are found largely in the estuarine regions where a
                    river   meets   the   sea,   the   intertidal   regions   of   shallow
                    bays   and   creeks.   As   extensions   of   the   tropical   rain-
                    forests   in   to   the   sea,   mangroves   are   functionally   as
                    important   as   the   tropical   rain-forests.   Moreover,   they
                    are   additionally   important   for   the   protection   of   the
                    seashores   from   erosion,   wave   action,   high-winds   and
                    cyclones. Mangroves being intertidal forests are equal to
                    tropical forests, however their importance is not merely
                    in their forest value but due to their strategic location
                    between the land and the sea. Mangroves are the life
                    line   of   any   coastal   area   and   perform   invaluable
                    protective   functions   for   the   environment.   The
                    importance of mangroves is set out below:"
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                                       (emphasis added)


4               The   petition   sets   out   the   functions   and   importance   of
mangroves which can be briefly summarized as under :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">         A]     The   mangroves   play   important   role   in   protecting   sea
                shores from erosion, high winds and cyclone;
         B]     Mangroves   are   strategically   located   between   the   land
                and sea and therefore, their importance is not merely in
                their forest value. The mangroves act as a buffer between
                the   land   and   sea   and   play   a   very   important   role   in
                fighting tidal erosion. The presence of mangroves does
                away with the need for expensive sea walls. The loss of

is   a   systematic   pattern   adopted   in   destruction   of   mangroves.   It   is
pointed out that the mangroves are either set on fire or cut down and
the  areas occupied by mangroves are cleared for settlements. The other
method is by blocking water supply to mangroves by dumping debris
and   constructing   embankments.   If   water   supply   to   mangroves   is
blocked, it ensures that the mangroves do not survive. It is pointed out
in  the  petition  that though large number complaints are being made

        THE STATUS OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTERIM
        DIRECTIONS IN THE ORDER DATED 6TH OCTOBER 2005

10              For reporting compliance with the said directions, the State
Government has filed an affidavit of Shri Milind Panditrao, Divisional
Forest Officer, Mumbai Mangrove Conservation Unit. The said affidavit
records   that   by   a   circular   dated   21 st  October   2005,   the   State
Government issued various directions in terms of the orders dated 6 th
October   2005.   Under   the   said   circular,   the   Divisional   Commissioner,
Konkan Division was appointed as the officer responsible to oversee the
implementation  of  the  aforesaid  directions issued  by  this  Court.  It is
pointed out that from the year 2005, the Divisional Commissioner has
submitted   147   monthly   "Action   Taken   Reports"   to   this   Court.   It   is
pointed   out   that   695   complaints   were   received   by   the   Divisional
Commissioner   for   various   violations   out   of   which   575   have   been
disposed of and 120 are pending. It is pointed out that the Maharashtra
Remote Sensing and Satellite Application Centre (for short "MRSAC")
carried   out   the   mapping   of   mangroves   areas   of   Mumbai   and   Navi
Mumbai.   Based   on   this   exercise,   5469   Hectares   of   mangroves   on
Government   land   in   Mumbai   were   notified   as   forests   and   the   said
notified forest areas have been handed over to the Forest Department. It
is stated that similar exercise of mapping of mangroves in the remaining
coastal areas of Maharashtra was carried out by MRSAC. It is stated that
in   7   coastal   districts   (Mumbai,   Mumbai   Suburban,   Thane,   Palghar,
Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Raigad), 15,087.57 Hectares of mangroves
on Government lands have been notified as "Reserved Forests" under
<a href="/doc/1169217/" id="a_3">Section   4</a>   of   the   Indian   Forest   Act,   1927   (for   short   "the   said   Act   of
1927"). Out of this area, total area of 12,263.72 Hectares constituting
approximately 81.28% of the total area declared as a Reserved Forest


                                                                                     12 of 83
                                                                  pil-87.06 final.doc

has been transferred to the Forest Department. It is stated that in case
of Thane and Mumbai Districts, the said percentage is 100% and in case
of Mumbai Suburban and Ratnagiri Districts, it is more than 99%. It is
pointed out that mangroves area of 1775 Hectares on private lands in
Mumbai Suburban District has been declared as a "forest". In the said
affidavit,   certain   difficulties   have   been   expressed   about   the
implementation of the direction of this Court to notify mangroves on
private land as forests. We are dealing with the said issue in detail in
the   subsequent   part   of   the   judgment.   It   is   submitted   that   the
mangroves, irrespective of their ownership, receive protection under the
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986 (for short "the said Act of 1986") and
the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_5">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980 (for short "the said Act of 1980").
Therefore, it was submitted that the failure to declare private lands as
private  forests within  the meaning of the  Maharashtra  Private Forest
(Acquisition) Act, 1975 (for short "the Private Forest Act") has not led
to any adverse consequences.

<p id="p_37">                                   SUBMISSIONS
14             The   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   for   the   petitioners
has taken us through the averments made in the petition, the affidavits
on record as well as other material on record. He has taken us through
a chart containing the details of the extent of the implementation so far
made with the directions contained in the order dated 6 th October 2005.
As   regards   the   direction   to   transfer   mangroves   areas   to   the   Forest
Department, it is pointed out that the City and Industrial Development
Corporation   of   Maharashtra   Limited   (for   short   "CIDCO")   and   the
Mumbai   Metropolitan   Region   Development   Authority   (for   short
"MMRDA") have not transferred mangroves land in their possession to
the Forest Department. He also pointed out various aspects set out in
the action taken reports. He pointed out that due to the failure in taking
immediate action in respect of the destruction of mangroves,  violators
have   not   been   identified   and   First   Information   Reports   (for   short
"FIRs") have been filed  against unknown persons. He also pointed out
from   the   action   taken   reports   that   there   is   a   frequent   and   rampant
destruction of mangroves and dumping of garbage as well as debris in
the  mangroves area. He  has relied upon  statements  made  in  various
affidavits on record. 
</p>

<p id="p_38">15             He   further   submitted   that   the   FIRs   are   not   taken   to   its
logical end as the procedure under <a href="/doc/45135/" id="a_6">Section 19</a> of the said Act of 1986 is
not being followed in most of the cases. He pointed out that as per the
direction issued in clause 8(vi), MCZMA has not submitted any report.
He stated that copies of the maps referred in the affidavit dated 16 th

                                                                                  15 of 83
                                                                  pil-87.06 final.doc

August   2005   of   Shri   Gajanan   Varade   have   not   be   supplied   to   the
petitioners.   He   pointed   out   that   there   is   no   compliance   with   the
direction contained in clause (xiii).
</p>

<p id="p_39">16            The   learned   senior   counsel   submitted   that   a   direction
should   be   issued   to   hand   over   all   Reserved   forests   to   the   Forest
Department within a time bound schedule. He submitted that remaining
action of notifying mangroves areas as forests should be also completed
in a time bound schedule. He submitted that there are certain mangrove
areas   which   are   vulnerable   to   encroachment.   Such   areas   must   be
protected by constructing a fencing/ boundary wall at a distance of 50
meters of the mangroves on its landward side. He invited our attention
to wetland maps of Maharashtra prepared by MRSAC which are very
useful for detection of destruction of mangroves. He pointed out several
violations of the directions issued by this Court on 6 th October 2005. He
submitted that penal provisions under the said Act of 1986 have been
rarely invoked. He also addressed the Court on the need for restoration
and   re-forestation.   He   submitted   that   there   is   a   need   to   show
mangroves   areas  in   all   Development  Plans  and   Regional   Plans   along
with   50   buffer   zones.   He   made   various   suggestions   as   regards   the
working   of   the   mangroves   cell.   He   invited   our   attention   to   CRZ
notifications as well as order of the Central Government approving the
Coastal Zone Management Plan of Maharashtra (for short "CZMP"). The
learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has also addressed us on
the contents of the affidavit of Shri Milind Panditrao. 
</p>

<p id="p_40">17            He invited our attention to the Judgment and Order dated
29th  July   2015   in   Chamber   Summons   No.172   of   2007   and   other
connected   Notices   of   Motion.   His   basic   submission   is   that   the   said
Judgment   and   order   does   not   lay   down   any   proposition   of   law   and

                                                                             16 of 83

considering the peculiar facts of the case, certain plots in the layout in
respect of which environmental clearance was granted in the years 2003
to 2005 were exempted from the operation of 50 meters buffer zone
requirement.   He   urged   that   while   approving   CZMP,   a   condition   was
imposed by the Central Government of keeping 50 meter buffer zone
and therefore, the said condition was in existence from the year 1996.
He submitted that it is not correct to say that the requirement of having
50 meter buffer zone was brought into picture for the first time by the
interim order dated 6th October 2005. He also pointed out as to how the
condition of maintaining the buffer zone was in existence even prior to
the order dated 6th October 2005.

<p id="p_41">18                    The learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner also
addressed us on implementation of the directions contained in clause
</p><p id="p_42">(ix) regarding declaring privately owned lands having mangroves   as
forests in accordance with law. He also invited our attention to the issue
of implementation of the directions contained in last part of clause (xi)
as well as last part of clause (xii). Firstly, he invited our attention to the
decision   of   the   Apex   Court   in   the   case   of  <a href="/doc/1725193/" id="a_7">T.N.   Godavarman
Thirumulkpad vs Union Of India &amp; Ors</a>. 1.  He submitted that the Apex
Court   has   given   purposive   interpretation   to   the   said   Act   of   1980   by
holding that any forest irrespective of its ownership or its classification
is entitled to protection of the provisions of the said Act of 1980. He
pointed out that the Apex Court while recording the said finding has
held   that   the   word   "forest"   must   be   understood   according   to   its
dictionary meaning and the term "forest land" occurring in <a href="/doc/998995/" id="a_8">Section 2</a> of
the said Act of  1980 will not only include  the  word "forest land" in
dictionary   sense   but   also   any   area   recorded   as   a   forest   in   the

                                                                       pil-87.06 final.doc

Government record. He urged that considering the dictionary meaning
of "forest" it will cover lands with mangroves and therefore, effect will
have to be given to the the directions issued by the Apex Court in the
case of <a href="/doc/1725193/" id="a_9">T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad vs. Union Of India &amp; Ors</a>. in
case of privately owned lands having mangroves. He submitted that on
such lands, non-forest activity is completely prohibited without seeking
permission of the requisite authorities. 
</p>

<p id="p_43">19              Thereafter, he invited our attention to the provisions of the
Private forest Act and definition of "forest" in clause (c-i) of Section 2 of
the   Private   Forest   Act.   He   pointed   out   that   the   said   definition   is   an
inclusive definition. Inviting our attention to the definition of "private
forest" in clause (f) of <a href="/doc/998995/" id="a_10">Section 2</a>, he urged that even the said definition
is inclusive which includes any forest which is not the property of the
State   Government.   He   would,   therefore,   submit   that   private   lands
having mangroves will be a private forest within the meaning of the
Private Forest Act. He would, therefore, submit that by virtue of sub-
section (1) of section 3 of the Private Forest Act, all such lands will vest
in the State of Maharashtra irrespective of any other provisions of law. 
</p>

<p id="p_44">20              He   also   made   submissions   on   the   basis   of   the   Wetlands
(Conservation   and   Management)   Rules,   2017   and   definition   of
wetlands. He urged that in addition to the interim orders issued which
are already in force, directions as contended by him may be issued apart
from issuing direction regarding setting criminal law in motion against
the offenders.

Divisional   Forest   Officer,   Mumbai   Mangrove   Conservation   Unit   and
submitted that almost all interim directions have been complied with in
substance. As regards the direction sought by the learned senior counsel
appearing for the petitioner as regards the mangroves on private forests,
she submitted that recourse will have to be taken to Section 21 of the
Private   Forests  Act   which   will  involve  acquisition  of   privately  owned
properties having mangroves. She pointed out that <a href="/doc/220510/" id="a_11">Sections 34</a> to <a href="/doc/361823/" id="a_12">37</a> of
the  Forest  Act  which provide  for  Control  and  Management  of  Forest

State of Maharashtra on coming into force of the Private Forest Act. She
submitted   that   except   the   said   direction,   the   State   Government   has
shown willingness to implement all the other directions. We have also
heard   the   various   learned   counsel   representing   various   respondents
including   MCZMA   as   well   as   the   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the
parties   in   the   connected   petitions.   Though   we   are   disposing   of   Writ
Petition 2741 of 2017 by a separate order, we have heard the learned
counsel   appearing   in   the   said   petition   on   certain   issues   especially
relating   to   the   buffer   zone.   The   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the
Petitioners in Writ Petition 2741 of 2017 made submissions in support
of the   order dated 29th  July 2015 in Chamber Summons No. 172 of
2007. He pointed out that the said order finally concludes the issue of
50   meter   buffer   zone.   He   pointed   out   that   the   said   order   has   been
confirmed by the Apex Court by order dated 20 th  January 2016.     He
pointed out the circular issued by the State Government  on the basis of
the order dated 29th July 2015.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">       "4.     <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_29">The Forest Conservation Act</a>, 1980 was enacted with
               a   view   to   check   further   deforestation   which
               ultimately   results   in   ecological   imbalance;   and

               conservation   of   forests   and   for   matters   connected
               therewith, must apply to all forests irrespective of the

               word   "forest"   must   be   understood   according   to   its
               dictionary   meaning.   This   description   covers   all
               statutorily recognised forests, whether designated as

               Government   record   irrespective   of   the   ownership.
               This is how it has to be understood for the purpose of
               <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_32">Section  2</a> of the Act.  The  provisions enacted in the

32             If   a   reference   is   made   to   Cambridge   dictionary,   the
meaning of forest   therein is "a large area of land covered with trees
and plants usually larger than the wood or trees and plants themselves".
Considering the wide meaning given to "forest" by the Apex Court, a
land   covered   by   mangroves   irrespective   of   its   ownership   is   a   forest
within   the   meaning   of   the   said   Act   of   1980.   Hence,   the   embargo
imposed by <a href="/doc/998995/" id="a_39">Section 2</a> of the said Act of 1980 and the directions issued

                                                                               27 of 83

by the Apex Court will apply with all the force to mangroves areas. It
will apply to mangrove areas irrespective of the fact that the lands are
privately   owned.   That   is   very   clear   from   paragraph   5(i)   above.
Therefore, it is obvious that prior approval of the Central Government is
required for doing any non-forest activity within the area of mangroves.
In accordance with <a href="/doc/998995/" id="a_40">Section 2</a> of the Act, all ongoing non-  forest activity
within any   mangroves area without the prior approval of the Central

               Their preachings contained in vedas, upanishads, smritis,

48               In the case of  M.C. Mehta Vs. Kamal Nath and Ors.3,  in
paragraph 34 and 35, the Apex Court held thus :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_115">        "34. Our legal system - based on English common law -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_116">             includes   the   public   trust   doctrine   as   part   of   its
             jurisprudence. The State is the trustee of all natural
             resources which are by nature meant for public use
             and enjoyment. Public at large is the beneficiary of
             the   sea-shore,   running   waters,   airs,   forests   and
             ecologically   fragile   lands.  The   State   as   a   trustee   is
             under a legal duty to protect the natural resources. These

<blockquote id="blockquote_117">        35.      We are fully aware that the issues presented in this case
                 illustrate the classic struggle between those members of
                 the public who would preserve our rivers, forests, parks
                 and open lands in their pristine purity and those charged
                 with   administrative   responsibilities   who,   under   the
                 pressures   of   the   changing   needs   of   an   increasingly
                 complex society, find it necessary to encroach to some
                 extent upon open lands heretofore considered inviolate
                 to  change.  The   resolution  of   this   conflict  in  any  given
                 case is for the legislature and not the courts. If there is a
                 law   made   by   Parliament   or   the   State   Legislatures   the
                 courts   can   serve   as   an   instrument   of   determining
                 legislative intent in the exercise of its powers of judicial
                 review under the Constitution. But in the absence of any
                 legislation,   the   executive   acting   under   the   doctrine   of
                 public   trust   cannot   abdicate   the   natural   resources   and
                 convert them into private ownership, or for commercial
                 use.  The aesthetic  use and the pristine glory  of the
                 natural   resources,   the   environment   and   the
                 ecosystems of our country cannot be permitted to be
                 eroded   for   private,   commercial   or   any   other   use
                 unless the courts find it necessary, in good faith, for
                 the   public   good   and   in   public   interest   to   encroach
                 upon the said resources."</blockquote>

57            The Apex Court observed that the mangroves forests are of
great   ecological   importance   and   are   also   ecologically   sensitive.   This
observation   is   made   after   observing   that   mangroves   falls   squarely
within   the   ambit   of   CRZ-I.   Thus,   even   if   the   area   abutting   the
mangroves which were in existence when 1991 notification came into
force was already developed, the mangroves area will fall in CRZ-I and
not in CRZ-II. If there are mangroves in existence between the shoreline

the CRZ notifications.   The Apex Court, therefore, did not permit salt
harvesting activity on the mangroves areas. The Apex Court proceeded
to issue several directions including the direction to restore  status-quo
ante against the appellant. It can be seen from the said decision that the
Apex   Court   virtually   approved   the   direction   given   by   this   Court   in
clause   8(xii)   regarding   mangroves   areas   on   the   Government   owned
lands to be declared as protected forests.

<p id="p_103">58               We   must   note   here   that   none   of   the   respondents   have
ventured to deny this factual statements made in the petition about the
important role played by the mangroves eco-sytems. On the contrary,
the   affidavit   of   the   State   of   Shri   Milind   Panditrao,   Divisional   Forest
Officer shows that except for the directions regarding the mangroves on
private   lands,   the   State   Government   claims   to   have   made   a   sincere
effort to implement the directions issued by this Court under the order
dated   6th  October   2005.   Whether   the   State   has   implemented   all   the
directions   issued   or   not   is   an   altogether   a   different   issue.   What   is
important is that the State has shown willingness to abide by almost all
directions including the direction regarding keeping buffer zone of 50
meters . Considering the applicability of the public trust doctrine and
the statutory and constitutional duty of the State, the said direction for
stopping all construction taking place within 50 meters on all sides of
all mangroves will have to be maintained as this direction will protect
the mangroves. If construction activity is permitted in the said buffer
zone,   it   will   inevitably   cause   damage   to   the   mangroves.   No
construction/development permission can be granted in the buffer zone
of     50   meters   of   mangroves   having   an   area   less   than   1000   square
meters, unless the concerned development authorities are fully satisfied
that even if  development is carried out, no damage whatsoever will be

caused to the  mangroves.  As pointed out earlier, in case of mangrove
area of 1000 square meters or more, 50 meter buffer zone will be a part
of CRZ-I and such a buffer zone will be subject to all the restrictions
provided in CRZ Regulations.

<p id="p_104">59                 Therefore, there is no difficulty in continuing the directions
issued   in   the   order   dated   6th  October   2005   as   final   directions   with
certain modifications. As far as the directions contained in relation to
mangroves on private properties are concerned, we propose to deal with
the same separately.

60                 Now, we turn to the issue of mangrove areas forming a part
of the private lands. For that purpose, it will be necessary to make a
reference to the provisions of the Private Forest Act. We have already
held that a mangroves forest on a private land will be a forest within
the   meaning   of   the   said   Act   of   1980   and   therefore,   necessary
consequences will follow.   The question is whether such areas can be
transferred to the Forest Department and for that reason, it is necessary
to make a reference to the provisions of the Private Forest Act.

<p id="p_123">66             Under <a href="/doc/848202/" id="a_80">Section 21</a>, a private land not covered by clause (f)
of  <a href="/doc/998995/" id="a_81">Section  2</a> can  be declared  as a  private  forest. Thus, if  a privately
owned mangrove land is to be declared as private forest, the procedure
under  <a href="/doc/848202/" id="a_82">Section  21</a>  will  have   to be  undertaken.  It cannot  be   said  that
every private land containing trees and shrimps or pasture lands should
be declared as a private forest by exercising power under <a href="/doc/848202/" id="a_83">Section 21</a>.  It
is ultimately left to the State Government to take recourse to Section
</p><p id="p_124">21. Therefore, a writ of mandamus cannot be issued directing the State
Government   to   exercise   the   power   under   Section   21   of   the   Private
Forest   Act   of   declaring   every   privately   owned   mangrove   area   as   a
private forest. However, as held earlier, whether such area is declared
as a private forest under <a href="/doc/848202/" id="a_84">Section 21</a> or not, it is a forest as held by the
Apex Court in the case of T.N. Godavarman (supra) and therefore, the
same   cannot   be   used   by   the   owner   thereof   for   non-forest   purposes.
There is one more aspect of the matter. In case of a private forest which
vests in the State Government under sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the
Private   Forest   Act,   certain   amounts   become   payable   to   the   owners
under Section 7 of the Private Forest Act as compensation. Therefore, in
case of a land in respect of which the power under Section 21 of the
Private   Forest   Act   is   exercised,   compensation   will   be   payable   by   the
State   Government.   Therefore,   we   are   of   the   view   that   a   blanket
direction to declare private mangrove areas as a private forest under the
Private Forest Act cannot be issued. However, the Government will have

72             Thus, in a Development Plan, mangroves areas and buffer
zones will have to be specifically shown in view of clause (c) of section
</p><p id="p_139">22. The Regulations framed as per clause (m) must provide for ban on
construction   on   mangroves   area   and   its   buffer   zones   as   laid   down
earlier. Mangroves areas have been already identified by using MRSAC.
In any event, in view of <a href="/doc/848202/" id="a_90">Section 21</a>, preparation of land use map is a
condition precedent for preparation of a Development Plan. <a href="/doc/1269877/" id="a_91">Section 14</a>
deals   with   contents   of   a   Regional   Plan.   Clause   (b)   of   <a href="/doc/1269877/" id="a_92">Section   14</a>   is
similar to clause (c) of <a href="/doc/1730703/" id="a_93">Section 22</a> which provides for reservation for
gardens,   nature   reserves   etc.   Therefore,   The   in   a   Regional   Plan,
mangroves areas and buffer zones will have to be specifically shown.
The  State Government will have to issue a direction under section 154
of  the  MRTP Act  to all  concerned Planning Authorities and  Regional
Boards, as the case may be, to implement the aforesaid directions while
making or amending or revising Development Plans/Regional Plans.

<p id="p_140">               RESTORATION OF MANGROVE AREAS
73             One   more   important   issue   is   to   restore   mangroves   areas

original   condition.   That   is   the   legal   obligation   of   the   State.   In   what
manner restoration should be done should be decided by the Committee
headed by the Divisional Commissioner after consulting experts in the
field.   It   is   necessary   that   the   Committee   identifies   the   vulnerable
mangroves areas in the State  and direct its constant surveillance either
by the Police or Forest Guards or Security Guards   of the Maharashtra
Security Corporation. The Committee shall ensure that barricades are
erected   for   entry   of   vehicles   in   such   vulnerable   area   for   preventing
illegal dumping. The Committee shall also consider of installing CCTVs
along the vulnerable stretches to keep a vigil. The Committee shall also
cause to undertake satellite mapping of mangroves area at periodical
intervals of not more than six months by using resolution as suggested
in paragraph no.28 of the note submitted by the learned senior counsel
appearing for the petitioner. Any changes seen shall be considered by
the Committee and remedial measures shall be immediately taken. The
State Government shall sanction necessary funds for that purpose.

<p id="p_141">        EFFECT OF THE ORDER DATED 29th JULY 2015
        IN CHAMBER SUMMONS NO.172 OF 2007 

74              Now we must refer to the order dated 29 th July 2015. The
prayer made before this Court  was that certain plots be excluded from
the applicability of the direction contained in clause 8(iii) in the order
dated 6th  October 2005 regarding buffer zone of 50 meters.   The said
order dated 29th July 2015 is confirmed by the Apex Court. The order of
the Apex Court dated 2oth January 2016 shows that it is a summary
dismissal. Therefore, the issue whether the said order of this Court  is a
binding precedent remains open.   We find that on the   plots   subject
matter  of  the said order, permissions were  granted prior  to the year
1996   for   making   public   housing.   Environmental   clearances   were
granted prior to the order dated 6th  October 2005. Before passing the

                                                                                   62 of 83
                                                                     pil-87.06 final.doc

said order, the attention of the Court was not invited to the condition
</p><p id="p_142">(xiii)   imposed   in   the   letter/order   dated   27 th  September   1996   of   the
Central Government by which CZMP of the State of Maharashtra was
sanctioned. The condition is that in case of  mangroves with an area of
1000 square meters and more, a buffer zone of 50 meters will form a
part   of   CRZ-I.     Moreover,   the   CRZ   notification   of   2011   specifically
provides that in case of  mangroves with an area of 1000 square meters,
a buffer zone of 50 meters will form a part of  CRZ-I.  Interim direction
in  clause  8(iii) is  applicable  to  all  mangroves area  irrespective of  its
area. One of the reasons set out by us for confirming the said interim
direction is that if construction activity  is permitted within 50 meters of
mangroves   area,   it   will   cause   damage   to   the   mangroves   it   being   an
ecologically fragile area.  The area of 50 meters around mangroves area
of less than 1000 square meters will not be a part of CRZ-I though such
mangrove area will be a part thereof under the both 1991 and 2011
notifications.  Only in case of mangroves lands having an area of  1000
square meters or more , it's 50 meter buffer zone will also be a part of
CRZ-I. 
</p>

<p id="p_143">75             The said order dated 29th July 2015 deals with the projects
approved   prior   to   the   year   1996.     The   order   ignores   the   provision
regarding   50   meter   buffer   zone   which   was   introduced   on   27 th
September   1996.     The   said   order   dated   29th  July   2015   was   passed
considering the peculiar facts in respect of the plots subject matter of
the said order. By the said order,  the issue of protecting mangroves was
not   finally   decided.     Hence,   the   said   order   cannot   be   held   to   be   a
binding   precedent   finally   deciding   the   issue   of   buffer   zone   and   CRZ
classification.  There is a circular/  order dated 5 th March 2018 issued by
the Department of Environment of the State Government on the basis of
the order dated 29th July 2015. The learned Counsel for the Petitioners

                                                                                  63 of 83

in the connected writ petition has placed on record the said circular.
However,   now   what   will   prevail   is   this   Judgment   and   not   the   said
circular  which is based on the legal opinion of the Law Department.

          an offence under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_124">Section 379</a> IPC does not arise
          because the said Act makes illegal mining as an

          such extraction and a complaint in this regard is

             Rishbud and Inder Singh Vs. State of Delhi 7. Paragraphs 9
             and 10 of the said decision read thus :-
</p><p id="p_168">             "9. The   question   then   requires   to   be   considered
                  whether and to what extent the trial which follows
                  such   investigation   is   vitiated.   Now,   trial   follows
                  cognizance   and   cognizance   is   preceded   by
                  investigation. This is undoubtedly the basic scheme<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_132">
                  of the Code</a> in respect of cognizable cases.  But it
                  does   not   necessarily   follow   that   an   invalid
                  investigation   nullifies   the   cognizance   or   trial
                  based thereon. Here we are not concerned with
                  the   effect   of   the   breach   of   a   mandatory
                  provision   regulating   the   competence   or
                  procedure of the Court as regards cognizance or
                  trial. It is only with reference to such a breach
                  that the question as to whether it constitutes an
                  illegality   vitiating   the   proceedings   or   a   mere
                  irregularity   arises.   A   defect   or   illegality   in
                  investigation,   however   serious,   has   no   direct
                  bearing   on   the   competence   or   the   procedure
                  relating to cognizance or trial. No doubt a police
                  report   which   results   from   an   investigation   is
                  provided   in   <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_133">Section   190</a>   of   the   Code   of   Criminal
                  Procedure as the material on which cognizance is
                  taken. But it cannot be maintained that a valid and
                  legal   police   report   is   the   foundation   of   the
                  jurisdiction of the Court to take cognizance. <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_134">Section
                  190</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure is one out of
                  a group of sections under the beading "Conditions
                  requisite   for   initiation   of   proceedings.   The
                  language of this section is in marked contrast with
                  that of the other sections of the group under the
                  same  heading,  i.e.   <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_135">Sections  193</a>   and  <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_136">195</a>  to   <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_137">199</a>.
                  These   latter   sections   regulate   the   competence   of
                  the Court and bar its jurisdiction in certain cases
                  excepting in compliance therewith. But <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_138">Section 190</a>
                  does not. While no doubt, in one sense, clauses (a),
</p><p id="p_169">                  (b)   and   (c)   of   <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_139">Section   190(1)</a>     are   conditions
                  requisite for taking of cognizance, it is not possible
                  to say that cognizance on an invalid police report is
                  prohibited   and   is   therefore   a   nullity.   Such   an
                  invalid report may still fall either under clause (a)

or (b) of <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_140">Section 190(1)</a>, (whether it is the one or
the other we need not pause to consider) and in
any case cognizance so taken is only in the nature
of error in a proceeding antecedent to the trial. To
such   a   situation   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_141">Section   537</a>   of   the   Code   of
Criminal Procedure which is in the following terms
is attracted:
</p><p id="p_170">   "Subject   to   the   provisions   hereinbefore
contained, no finding, sentence or order passed by
a Court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed
or altered on appeal or revision on account of any
error,   omission   or   irregularity   in   the   complaint,
summons,   warrant,   charge,   proclamation,   order,
judgment   or   other   proceedings   before   or   during
trial or in any enquiry or other proceedings under
this   Code,   unless   such   error,   omission   or
irregularity,   has   in   fact   occasioned   a   failure   of
justice".
</p><p id="p_171">If,   therefore,   cognizance  is  in  fact   taken,   on  a
police   report   vitiated   by   the   breach   of   a
mandatory   provision   relating   to   investigation,
there can be no doubt that the result of the trial
which follows it cannot be set aside unless the
illegality   in   the   investigation   can   be   shown   to
have   brought   about   a   miscarriage   of   justice.
That   an   illegality   committed   in   the   course   of
investigation   does   not   affect   the   competence
and the jurisdiction of the Court for trial is well
settled as appears from the cases in  <a href="/doc/1492390/" id="a_142">Prabhu V.
Emperor</a> and <a href="/doc/1569728/" id="a_143">Lumbhardar Zutshi V. King</a>.  These
no   doubt   relate   to   the   illegality   of   arrest   in   the
course of investigation while we are concerned in
the present cases with the illegality with reference
to the machinery for the collection of the evidence.
This distinction may have a bearing on the question
of prejudice or miscarriage of justice, but both the
cases   clearly   show   that   invalidity   of   the
investigation has no relation to the competence of
the Court. We are, therefore, clearly, also, of the
opinion that where the cognizance of the case
has   in   fact   been   taken   and   the   case   has
proceeded to termination, the invalidity of the
precedent   investigation   does   not   vitiate   the
result,   unless   miscarriage   of   justice   has   been

                                                               70 of 83

    caused thereby.
</p><p id="p_172">10. It does not follow, however, that the invalidity of
    the investigation is to be completely ignored by the
    Court   during   trial.   When   the   breach   of   such   a
    mandatory provision is brought to the knowledge
    of the Court at a sufficiently early stage, the Court,
    while  not declining cognizance, will have  to take
    the necessary steps to get the illegality cured and
    the   defect   rectified,   by   ordering   such
    reinvestigation   as   the   circumstances   of   an
    individual case may call for. Such a course is not
    altogether outside the contemplation of the scheme<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_144">
    of   the   Code</a>   as   appears   from   <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_145">Section   202</a>   under
    which   a   Magistrate   taking   cognizance   on   a
    complaint   can   order   investigation   by   the   police.
    Nor   can   it   be   said   that   the   adoption   of   such   a
    course is outside the scope of the inherent powers
    of   the   Special   Judge,   who   for   purposes   of
    procedure at the trial is virtually in the position of a
    Magistrate   trying   a   warrant   case.   When   the
    attention of the Court is called to such an illegality
    at   a   very   early   stage   it   would   not   be   fair   to   the
    accused not to obviate the prejudice that may have
    been caused thereby, by appropriate orders, at that
    stage but to leave him to the ultimate remedy of
    waiting   till   the   conclusion   of   the   trial   and   of
    discharging   the   somewhat   difficult   burden   under
    <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_146">Section 537</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure of
    making   out   that   such   an   error   has   in   fact
    occasioned a failure of justice. It is relevant in this
    context   to   observe   that   even   if   the   trial   had
    proceeded   to   conclusion   and   the   accused   had   to
    make out that there was in fact a failure of justice
    as   the   result   of   such   an   error,   explanation   to
    <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_147">Section   537</a>   of   the   Code   of   Criminal   Procedure
    indicates that the fact of the objection having been
    raised   at   an   early   stage   of   the   proceeding   is   a
    pertinent   factor.   To   ignore   the   breach   in   such   a
    situation when brought to the notice of the Court
    would   be   virtually   to   make   a   dead   letter   of   the
    peremptory provision  which has been enacted on
    grounds of public policy for the benefit of such an

    itself allows an officer of a lower rank to make the

                                                                      71 of 83
                                                                    pil-87.06 final.doc

                   investigation   if   permitted   by   the   Magistrate.   But
                   this is not any indication by the Legislature that an
                   investigation by an officer of a lower rank without
                   such permission cannot be said to cause prejudice.
                   When a Magistrate is approached for granting such
                   permission   he   is   expected   to   satisfy   himself   that
                   there   are   good   and   sufficient   reasons   for
                   authorising an officer of a lower rank to conduct
                   the investigation. The granting of such permission
                   is   not   to   be   treated   by   a   Magistrate   as   a   mere
                   matter of routine but it is an exercise of his judicial
                   discretion having regard to the policy underlying it.
                   In   our   opinion,  therefore,  when   such  a  breach  is
                   brought to the notice of the Court at an early stage
                   of the trial the Court have to consider the nature
                   and   extent   of   the   violation   and   pass   appropriate
                   orders for such reinvestigation as may be called for,
                   wholly or partly, and by such officer as it considers
                   appropriate with reference to the requirements of
                   <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_148">Section 5-A</a> of the Act. It is in the light of the above
                   considerations that the validity or otherwise of the
                   objection as to the violation of <a href="/doc/1041685/" id="a_149">Section 5(4)</a> of the
                   Act has to be decided and the course to be adopted
                   in these proceedings, determined."
</p>
<p id="p_173">        12 Thus, in cases where charge sheets have been filed and the
           Courts have taken cognizance on the basis of Charge sheets,
           the proceedings of criminal case or trial will not per se stand
           vitiated.   The   same   will   stand   vitiated   only   if   there   is   a
           miscarriage of justice.

<p id="p_175">79             There   is   a   need   to   hold   regular   awareness   programs    in
schools and colleges and various educational institutions for making the
students aware about the drastic effects of destruction of mangroves.
The State shall take steps in that behalf for  making the students aware
about   the   dangers   which   may   be   caused   to   the   ecology   and
environment in case the mangroves forests are destructed or  damaged.
To reiterate, the failure of the State and its agencies/ instrumentalities
to maintain and conserve the  mangrove areas will amount to violation
of rights of the citizens under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_154">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India
apart from other consequences.   Though we are not issuing a writ, we
hope and trust that the State Government will take such initiatives.

                 SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT FINDINGS
83                       The summary of   some of the important conclusions read
thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_191">        (i)     A land regardless of its ownership on which there are
                mangroves, is a forest within the meaning of the said
                Act of 1980 and therefore, the provisions of <a href="/doc/998995/" id="a_155">Section 2</a> of
                the said Act of 1980 and the law laid down by the Apex
                Court   in   the   case   of  T.N.   Godavarman  will   squarely
                apply to such land;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_192">        (ii)    A mangroves area on a Government land is liable to be
                declared as a protected forest or a reserved forest, as the
                case   may   be,   within   the   meaning   of   the   said   Act   of
                1927;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_193">        (iii)   All mangroves lands irrespective of its area will   fall in
                CRZ-I   as   per   both   the   CRZ   notifications   of   1991   and
                2011;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_194">        (iv)    In   1991   CRZ   notification,   it   is   provided   that   all
                mangrove   areas   will   fall   in   CRZ-I.       By   virtue   of   the
                order dated 27th  September 1996, in case of mangrove
                areas of 1000 square meters or more, 50 meter buffer
                zone abutting it was also included in CRZ-I.   By order
                dated 9th  January 2000, it was provided that 50 meter
                buffer   zone   will   not   be   required,   provided   a   road
                abutting   the   mangroves   was   constructed   prior   to
                February   1991.   Under   the   2011   notification,   all
                mangroves lands  fall in CRZ-I and in case the  area of
                such land is  1000 square meters or more, even a buffer
                zone of 50 meters along the said area shall be a part of

       provisions of orders or directions issued under the said
       Act of 1986. The conditions imposed in the the letter
       dated 27th September 1996 as amended will have to be
       construed as an order or direction under the said Act of
       1986 as CZMP is required to be approved by the Central
       government   in   view   of   the   clause   3(i)     in   the   CRZ
       notification   of   1991   which   is   an   order   or   direction
