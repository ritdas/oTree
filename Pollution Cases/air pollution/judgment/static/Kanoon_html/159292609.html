             Dated this the 15th day of March, 2018

                           JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      The petitioner has approached this Court aggrieved by Ext.P7

order, whereby, a consent granted by the Kerala State Pollution

Control Board to the unit of the petitioner was withdrawn.     Although

various contentions are raised in the writ petition, in its challenge

against Ext.P7 order, I find that, against Ext.P7 order, the petitioner

has an effective alternate remedy by way of an appeal before the

Appellate Authority under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. Accordingly, without prejudice to the right of the

petitioner to move the Appellate authority, the writ petition, in its

challenge against Ext.P7 order, is dismissed.



</p><p id="p_2">      Taking note of the submission of the learned senior counsel for

the petitioner that the petitioner is willing to operate the unit without

the offending generator, I direct that the operation of, and further

proceedings, pursuant to Ext.P7 order, shall be kept in abeyance till

such time as the Appellate authority considers the appeal preferred by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C).No.8904/2018                2</span>




the petitioner on merits. I make it clear that the petitioner shall file

the appeal before the Appellate authority within a period of two weeks

from today, and on receipt of the appeal, the Appellate authority shall

consider and pass orders in the appeal within a period of two months

from the date of receipt of the appeal from the petitioner.         The

petitioner shall produce a copy of the writ petition together with a

copy of this judgment, before the respondents and also the Appellate

authority, for further action.
