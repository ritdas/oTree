                                        JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                   Dated this the 14th day of November 2019

   S.Manikumar, CJ.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          Heard learned counsel appearing for the appellants and the learned Government

   Pleader.
</p>
<p id="p_3">          2.      Both the writ appeals are taken up for disposal. Writ Court directed the

   appellant in W.A.No.2095 of 2019 to pursue his appeal filed before the Appellate

   Authority under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_1">Section 31</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981,

   challenging a closure order passed by the Environmental Engineer of the Kerala State

   Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_4">          3.      On this day, Mr.Praveen K.Joy, learned counsel for the appellant in

   W.A.No.2095 of 2019, submitted that by order dated 18.10.2019 the Appellate Authority

   has stayed the operation of the closure order. Thus, it is evident that the impugned

   judgment (judgment in W.P.(C).No.12366 of 2019) dated 10.06.2019 before us, has

   been pursued, and in such circumstances, W.A.No.2095 of 2019 has become

   infructuous.
</p>
<p id="p_5">          4. Consequently, Writ Appeal No.2315 of 2019 has also become infructuous. If

   the appellant Sri.K.G.Rajappan is aggrieved, he can take recourse to the remedies

   permitted in law before the appellate authority and obtain a stay.

</p><p id="p_6">          Accordingly, these writ appeals are dismissed as infructuous.
