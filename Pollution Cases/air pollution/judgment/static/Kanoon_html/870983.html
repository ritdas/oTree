     fairly submitted that if the Unit is inspected by the

      Rs.one lac will be paid. The amount of Rs.one lac which
      is required to be paid for NEERI inspection, will be
      deposited within one week. Accordingly, time of one week
      is granted as aforesaid.
</p>

<p id="p_4">      Mr.Baxi learned Advocate pointed out that fresh
      consent application is     not   given   by   the   Unit.
      Mr.Nanavati   states that the application is already
      forwarded but in case it is not forwarded, the Unit will
      forward the same immediately.
</p>

<p id="p_5">      Learned Counsel submitted that the petitioner
      shall file undertaking within the time stipulated to the
      effect that the amount of Rs.9 lacs and the amount of
      Rs.1 lac towards the inspection of NEERI shall be paid as
      aforesaid and the unit shall make consent application, if

      of all past dues.

      conditions and on condition that the amount as aforesaid
      is deposited and the application for consent is made to
      the GPCB immediately. The GPCB will process the consent
