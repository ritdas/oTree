</pre><p id="p_1">                     {06th January, 2015}


Per: A.M. Khanwilkar, Chief Justice:
</p>
<p id="p_2">          The petitioner asserts that he is a well-known social

worker and actively associated with many NGOs fighting for the

cause of human dignity, civil liberty and social justice. He has
                                                W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>

filed this public interest petition for direction to the State

Authorities to prevent the environmental noise pollution caused

during the festive seasons, religious and social ceremonies

spread over the year, by use of various sound amplifiers and

other devices besides the noise pollution by factories, trains and

aeroplanes. Further direction is sought to prevent other atrocities

committed on the society in the name of religious festivals such

as (a) traffic hazards by putting Pandals on busy streets (the

number proliferating each year) in an indiscriminate manner, (b)

theft of electricity with impunity for lighting and decoration of

Pandals, resulting in loss to public exchequer and (c) extortion

and intimidation of public by unscrupulous elements in the name

of donation for the Pandals.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.         According to the petitioner, the citizens have a right to

a decent environment and to live peacefully which includes right

to sound sleep at night, to leisure and free locomotion during the

day time. These are essential ingredients of the right to life

guaranteed under Articles 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution of

India. The petitioner asserts that the mandate of <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_1">Article 51A(g)</a>

obligates every citizen to protect and improve the environment.

Reliance is placed on the exposition of the Apex Court in
                                                   W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>

Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar and others1. In Paragraph 7,

the Court held that right to live is a fundamental right under

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2">Article 21</a> and it includes the right of enjoyment of pollution free

water and air for full enjoyment of life. It is contended that the

use of various sound amplifiers during the festivals, social and

cultural gatherings and, more particularly, if unregulated,

inevitably causes health hazards and nuisance to the public. It

entails in infringment of basic human rights and also fundamental

rights of the captive listeners in the concerned locality.            The

petitioner has then placed reliance on the decision of the Calcutta

High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/738693/" id="a_3">Moulana Mufti Syed Md. Noorur

Rehman Barkati v. State of West Bengal2</a> wherein the issues

raised by the petitioner have been squarely dealt with in the

context of right to practice and propagate one's own religion.

After analysing the gamut of decisions, it is held that right does

not give licence to anyone to create noise pollution and muchless

force the captive listeners to suffer the same. That, none can claim

an absolute right to suspend others rights or disturb their basic

human rights and fundamental rights. The petitioner has also

placed reliance on another decision of the Apex Court in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">1</span>
     (1991) 1 SCC 598 = AIR 1991 SC 420
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">2</span>

                                                  W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  4</span>

Church of God (Full Gospel) in <a href="/doc/88766/" id="a_4">India v. K.K.R. Majestic

Colony Welfare Association</a> and others3 wherein it is held that

sleep is restorative time of life and sound night's sleep is crucial

to good health. The Court held that no religion prescribes that

prayers should be performed by disturbing the peace of others nor

does it preach that they should be through voice amplifiers or

beating of drums. Further, in a civilised society in the name of

religion, actitvities which disturb old or infirm persons, students

or children having their sleep in the early hours or during daytime

or other persons carrying on other activities cannot be permitted.

Rights of others are also required to be honoured. The Court also

highlighted that the problem of noise has become a very serious

issue - having many evil effects including danger to health. It

may cause interruption of sleep, affect communication, loss of

efficiency, hearing loss or deafness, high blood pressure,

depression, irritability, fatigue, gastro-intestinal problems, allergy,

distraction, mental stress and annoyance etc. It also affects

animals alike. Sometimes it lead to serious law and order

problem. Further, in a civilised society, rights are related with

duties towards others including neighbours.

                                                W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 5</span>

</p><p id="p_5">3.         To buttress the argument that noise pollution should

not be countenanced, the petitioner has placed reliance not only

on <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_5">Article 21</a> but also Articles 48A and 51A(g) of the

Constitution of India. The petitioner has also placed reliance on

the provisions of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1982 (in short "the Act of 1982") and the Noise Pollution

(Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as

"the Central Rules of 2000"). These Rules oblige the State

Authorities to take certain measures for enforcement of the

restrictions specified therein. Rule 3 prescribes for the ambient

air quality standards in respect of noise for different areas/zones,

which are specified in the Schedule annexed to these Rules.

Rule 4, read with Rules 5 and 8 obliges the State Authorities to

ensure that the restrictions on the use of loud speakers/public

address system are observed without any exception.

</p><p id="p_6">4.         Reference is also made to the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7"> of Indian

Penal Code</a>. <a href="/doc/209076/" id="a_8">Section 268</a> of IPC makes noise pollution an

actionable cause as 'public nuisance'. <a href="/doc/1099867/" id="a_9">Section 290</a> of IPC

provides for punishment for such public nuisance. <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_10">Section 133</a> of

the Criminal Procedure Code empowers the Magistrate to make

conditional order requiring the person causing nuisance including
                                                 W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 6</span>

that of noise to remove such nuisance. <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_11">Section 30</a> of the Police

Act, 1861 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act of 1861") provides

for Authorities to specify Rules for conduct of all assemblies or

processions on public road or public streets. This provision also

requires   prior   procurement       of   licence/permission     before

organizing the event. The Police Authorities are competent to

exercise power of stopping, dispersion or declaring the assemblies

or processions as unlawful, which violate the conditions of

licence, by virtue of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Section 30-A</a> of that Act of 1861. <a href="/doc/29853635/" id="a_13">Section 32</a>

of the said Act provides for penalty upon conviction for the

violation of licence conditions or breach of any provision of Law

governing the subject.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">5.         The petitioner has also referred to the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_14">Motor Vehicles Act</a>, 1939 and, in particular, <a href="/doc/95877183/" id="a_15">Section 20</a>, <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">21J</a>, <a href="/doc/185463094/" id="a_17">41</a>,

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">68</a>, <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_19">68I</a>, <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_20">70</a>, <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_21">91</a> and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_22">111A</a>, which empowers the State Government

to frame Rules to regulate equipment and maintenance of motor

vehicles and trailers. <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_23">Section 70(2)(i)</a> of the said Act provides for

reduction of noise emitted or caused by vehicles while <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_24">Section

70(2)(k)</a> prohibits the carrying of appliances likely to cause

annoyance or danger; whereas <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_25">Section 70(2)(l)</a> envisages

periodical testing and inspection of vehicles by prescribed
                                               W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                7</span>

Authorities and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_26">Section 70(2)(n)</a> of the said Act deals with the use

of trailers with motor vehicles. According to the petitioner, the

provisions of the Motor Vehicle Rules framed by various States

do not contain any effective control measures in relation to noise

pollution except to certain extent, use of horns and silencers. The

petitioner has also adverted to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_27">Motor

Vehicles Act</a>, 1988, which in turn, had repealed the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_28">Motor

Vehicles Act</a>, 1939. Referring to <a href="/doc/1037209/" id="a_29">Section 110</a> and <a href="/doc/32624072/" id="a_30">190</a> of the Act of

1988 and the provisions in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules,

1989 it is asserted that the issue of noise pollution caused due to

vehicles has been redressed to some extent.



</p><p id="p_9">6.         Reliance is then placed on the provisions of Madhya

Pradesh Kolahal Niyantran Adhiniyam, 1985 (in short "the

Adhiniyam of 1985"). According to the petitioner, this enactment

envisages mechanism for dealing with complaints relating to

noise pollution caused inter alia due to loud speakers and other

such appliances. However, the provisions in this Adhiniyam are

not only negation of fundamental rights of the common man and

the citizen but also against the spirit of the Noise Pollution

(Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. In that, Section 13 of the

Adhiniyam of 1985 exempts the control of use of loudspeakers
                                                  W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                  8</span>

during the festivals adumbrated under that Section. Thereby, it

grants unfettered and untrammeled right in the hands of few

religious fanatics so as to interfere with the rights of the residents

in the locality to have noise free environment during festivals.

Accordingly, it is asserted that that Section is ultra vires the

Central Rules of 2000.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.         By amending this petition, the petitioner has

specifically articulated grounds on which Section 13 of the

Adhiniyam of 1985 should be declared ultra vires the

Constitution as well as the Central Rules of 2000. The petitioner

has accordingly prayed for the following reliefs:


</p><p id="p_11">            "I. to issue a writ           of   mandamus       to
            respondents to restrict:-
</p><p id="p_12">            (a) installation of religious Pandals only to
                open areas/exhibition grounds to eliminate
                traffic hazards and ease of control;
</p><p id="p_13">            (b) Decibel level of the sound systems in
                accordance with the schedule to the Noise
                Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules,
                2000. For ease of execution, it is prayed
                that use of horn type loudspeakers be
                banned and only box type speakers be
                allowed within Pandals subject to decibel
                levels prescribed by the aforementioned
                Central Rules of 2000.
</p><p id="p_14">            (c) Theft of electricity by Pandals, by making

nuisance and obstruction caused to the public because of

installation of Puja Pandals, the petitioner asserts that it is

obligatory for the State Administration to regulate the same so as

to ensure that Pandals are not installed in congested areas and

further do not become the source for extortion from the public.

Moreover, the Puja Pandals permitted by the Authorities should

not be allowed to use free electricity and to cause loss to public

exchequer. This can be ensured by providing disqualification for

anti-social elements/history-sheeters from being member of

Pandal Committees or to act as agents of the Pandal

Committees. Instead, the Pandals should be permitted and must

be under the complete control of the elected Representatives such

as Municipal Councillors/Corporators/ Panchayat Members etc.

person/Institution/Society/Association             responsible         for

installation of Pandals and causing noise pollution. It is for the

other   Authorities   such    as        District   Magistrate,     Police

Board is not providing any free electricity to Pandals installed

with or without permission. Any person interested in installing

Pandal, even for a short duration, is required to apply for

temporary connection to the Electricity Board through its

Committee and pay for the actual electricity consumed during

such period as per the meter reading.

rendered by a Division Bench of this Court in
the said writ petition, which has since been
reported in Noise Pollution (II), In re-[(2005)
5 SCC 733]. Several guidelines had been
issued therein by this Court in exercise of its
jurisdiction under Articles 141 and 142 of the
Constitution of India. Therein, the decision of
the Calcutta High Court in <a href="/doc/1347766/" id="a_34">Om Birangana

Noise Pollution (V), In re was clarified. This
Court noticed that the constitutional validity of
sub-rule (3) of Rule 5 of the Rules had been
upheld by the Kerala High Court by an order
dated 14.03.2003 whereagainst an appeal was
filed. The hearing of the civil appeal was,
therefore, directed to be reopened. An interim
order was passed that until further orders, Rule
5 of the Rules, as reproduced therein, would
continue to remain in operation. The said
appeal was thereafter taken up for hearing by a
Bench of this Court. It was disposed of on
28.10.2005. This Court held that the Rules
framed by the Central Government were not

   districts. It can be reasonably expected that
   the State Government would exercise the
   power with due care and caution and in the
   public interest. However, we make it clear
   that the scope of the exemption cannot be
   widened either by increasing the number of
   days or by increasing the duration beyond

provisions of the Adhiniyam of 1985 are ultra vires the

Constitution and/or the Central enactment on the subject and, in

particular, the Central Rules of 2000? Going by the principles

restated by the Apex Court in the aforesaid decisions, right to

make unregulated noise inheres in no one. Rather, there are

ample provisions in the Central Legislation as well as the Rules

framed thereunder and including the Adhiniyam of 1985, which

provide for restriction on the use of amplifiers and other

electronic devices to the extent of permissible limits. It must be

presumed that the noise level upto those limits are within the

tolerable limits and therefore, permissible. If the noise limit

specified by law is exceeded or breached, that would be an

actionable cause.

</blockquote><p id="p_73">23.         Be that as it may, the validity of Section 13 of the

Adhiniyam of 1985 will have to be tested in the context of

Rule 5 of the Central Noise Pollution Rules of 2000. No doubt,

the Central Noise Pollution Rules of 2000 have come into

force much after the Adhiniyam of 1985 was introduced. At

the same time, being Central Rules framed under the Central

enactment, will have to prevail. Indisputably, the entire subject

regarding the use of loudspeakers and public address system

and sound producing instruments is now regulated by Rule 5

of the Central Rules of 2000. Besides the time limits for use of

such devices is specified in Rule 5, even the sound level

generated by the loud speakers/public address system and

sound producing instrument has been restricted.

</p><p id="p_74">24.         The only relaxation in that behalf can be noticed

from Sub-Rule (3) of Rule 5 of Central Rules of 2000 subject

to the outer limit of duration not exceeding 15 days in all

"during a calendar year" and which the State Government is

obliged to specify in advance. In Noise Pollution (VII) case7

the Apex Court in para 8 has expounded that the power to

grant exemption confered on the State Government cannot be

further delegated. That power must be exercised by reference

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">7</span>
      (2005) 8 SCC 796
                                                 W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                 27</span>

to the State as a unit and not by reference to districts, so as to

specify different dates for different districts. Further, the power

must be exercised with due care and caution in the public

interest and that it is not open to widen the exemption by

increasing the number of days or by increasing the duration

beyond two hours. The State Government, must specify the

exemption in advance. In any case, no exemption can be

granted to silence zone areas.
</p>
<p id="p_75">25.         The exemption to use of loud speakers or public

address system and the like during night hours between 10.00 P.M.

to 12.00 midnight on or during any cultural or religious festival,

must, therefore, be limited to 15 days in all "during a calendar

year". Whereas, Section 13(1) of the Adhiniyam of 1985 refers to

29 days in a calendar year for social and religious festivals; and at

any religious place or premises where it is being made as a

tradition. The exemption so provided in the Adhiniyam of 1985 is

ex facie in conflict with the outer limit specified by Sub-Rule (3)

of Rule 5 of the Central Noise Pollution Rules of 2000. To that

extent, Sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Adhiniyam of 1985

will have to be declared as ultra vires being repugnant to the

Central Noise Pollution Rules of 2000 on the same subject. We are

concious of the fact that the opening part of Sub-section (1) of
                                                   W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                  28</span>

Section 13 of the Adhiniyam of 1985 overrides only the provisions

contained in that Adhiniyam. However, the number of days

referred to in <a href="/doc/145949/" id="a_40">Section 13</a> (1) (i) and (ii), far exceed the outer limit

of in all fifteen days during a calendar year specified by Rule 5 (3)

of the Central Rules. It is not open to save the said provision by an

interpretative process. To do so, would require us not only to

rewrite that provision but inevitably preempt the State Government

from identifying the fifteen days in a calendar year, which,

according to the State Government, can be reckoned for granting

stated exemption. As observed by the Apex Court in Noise

Pollution (VII) (supra), the power has to be exercised by reference

to State as a unit and not by reference to districts.


</p><p id="p_76">26.         Indeed, Sub-section (2) of Section 13 of the

Adhiniyam of 1985 gives power to the prescribed Authority to

grant exemption from the provisions of <a href="/doc/8820/" id="a_41">Section 4</a> to <a href="/doc/992009/" id="a_42">7</a> for such

period, occasions and in such areas, as may be specified in the

permission. However, that exemption cannot be de hors the

restriction specified by Rule 3 read with Rule 5 of the Central

Noise Pollution Rules of 2000. Any infringement of those

restrictions or non-adherence by the Authority must be viewed

seriously - not only as violation of statutory restrictions but as
                                                    W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                  29</span>

abridgement of basic human rights and also the Fundamental

Rights of the residents in the concerned locality. It can also give

rise to an actionable claim against the law breakers as also against

the officials of the State for having failed to discharge their duty

to stop the public nuisance caused, by resorting to civil as well as

criminal action. In addition, the officials responsible to prevent

such unauthorized activity, can be proceeded by way of

departmental action for misconduct and dereliction of duty.

</p><p id="p_77">27.         Since the substantive exemption provision, <a href="/doc/145949/" id="a_43">Section 13</a>

(1) as a whole, cannot be preserved or saved, for the same reasons,

even the procedural provision in the form of <a href="/doc/145949/" id="a_44">Section 13</a> (2) of the

Adhiniyam cannot be saved. For, the exemption must be by

reference to the State as a unit and not left to the discretion of the

prescribed Authority by reference to districts. For that, the State

Government may have to specify in advance, which of the fifteen

days in a calendar year must be reckoned for grant of exemption,

at the beginning of the calendar year for the entire State. A priori,

the petition must succeed in terms of prayer Clause I (e) - to

declare Section 13 of the Adhiniyam as ultra vires.

</p><p id="p_78">28.         Indubitably,    sound      producing     devices     having

potential to produce sound noise in excess of the limit specified

in Rule 3 read with Rule 5 of the Central Rules cannot be used
                                               W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)

by anyone unilaterally. Prior permission in writing of the

appropriate Authority is a must - even on the excepted days.

Section 4 of the Adhiniyam of 1985 prohibits production of loud

music between 10.00 P.M. to 6.00 A.M., which timing is

consistent with the night time specified in the Schedule to

Central Noise Pollution Rules of 2000. Section 5 of the

Adhiniyam of 1985 also provides for restriction against the use

of loud speakers between 10.00 P.M. to 6.00 A.M., which again

is consistent with the Central Rules. Section 6 of the Adhiniyam

of 1985 provides for restrictions on the use of horn-type loud

speaker and <a href="/doc/992009/" id="a_45">Section 7</a> about the operation of loud speaker. None

of these provisions are in conflict with the timing, place or the

noise limits specified in the Central enactment and Rules framed

thereunder.
</p>
<p id="p_79">29.           As regards the use of loudspeakers at any religious

place or premises where it is being used as a tradition, the sound

level restrictions provided under the Central Legislation will

have to be adhered to without any exception. The noise level at

the boundary of the public place, where loud speakers or public

address system or any other noise source is being used, has been

specified as not exceeding 10 dB(A) above the ambient noise

standards for the area or 75 dB(A), whichever is lower. Whereas,
                                                W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                31</span>

the peripheral noise level of a privately owned sound producing

system or instrument has been specified as not exceeding more

than 5 dB(A) at the boundary of the private place above the

ambient noise standards specified for the area in which it is so

used. The State Authorities are, therefore, obliged to adhere to

these norms without any exception in future. The Commissioner

of Police/Superintendent of Police and the Collector of the

concerned District shall be personally responsible to regulate

these matters. The State Authorities, however, shall not grant

permission/licence for use of sound producing instruments

beyond the permissible limits and also ensure that any violation

of the Central Rules of 2000 should be proceeded strictly and in

accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_80">30.        Notably, the legal position about the right to use of

sound producing system for religious activities has already been

considered by the Apex Court in the case of Church of God

(Full Gospel) in India (supra). It is held that no religion

prescribes that the prayers are required to be performed through

voice amplifiers and by beating of drums. This judgment also

addresses the issue about causing of obstructions to public

thoroughfare and public roads for any religious activities.

</p><p id="p_81">31.        That takes us to the issue regarding traffic hazards
                                               W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                32</span>

caused due to permitting Pandals on busy streets during the

festival season, in particular. As aforesaid, the issue has been

dealt with by the Apex Court in the case of Church of God

(Full Gospel) in India (supra) and also in A. Abdul Farook

Vs. Municipal Council, Perambalur and others8 as well as K.

K. Road Merchants, E.A.R.W.A., T.N. Vs. District Collector,

T. N. And another9. We may, therefore, observe that the

officials - be it Police, Revenue, Municipal or Local

Government Authorities - must entertain application/request for

installation of Pandals on public streets not only keeping in

mind the statutory provisions and restrictions but also the dictum

of the Apex Court in the aforesaid decisions. Thus, when any

application for permission to put up a Pandal on a busy street is

received, that must be considered with utmost circumspection

and should not be granted mechanically. The competent

Authority, before granting permission, must keep in mind the

extant Regulations and must consider all aspects including the

period for which the Pandal will be put up, the likelihood of any

inconvenience to public and in particular obstruction to smooth

traffic flow and also about the security and safety of the nearby

residents, pedestrians and vehicle operators. The competent

Authority must be fully satisfied about all these and related

matters before accepting the request for installation of Pandal

on a busy street. It would be appropriate for the competent

Authority to notify the locations for putting up Pandals on

public places in advance, by issuing public notice. In the event,

grant of permission for any other public place or a busy public

street is unavoidable, utmost care should be taken to adhere to

the restrictions specified under the extant Regulations. In any

case, that permission should be for a limited duration on strict

conditions and including under vigilance of the local police so as

to minimize the inconvenience to the public. As far as possible,

such permission should be granted well in advance, preferably

not less than one week in advance of the proposed event. In

addition, sufficient publicity of permission granted in area other

than the notified area must be put up on the official website

contemporaneously, so that any person, aggrieved by such

permission, will be free to take recourse to remedy, as may be

permissible in law. In those proceedings the justness of such

permission can be examined.
</p>
<p id="p_82">32.        Be that as it may, if any Authority (duty holder)

comes across any unauthorised Pandal on a busy street, must
                                                    W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                34</span>

immediately move into action and remove the same by

following due process forthwith - lest face action of dereliction

of duty.
</p>
<p id="p_83"> 33.       Reverting to the grievance of theft of electricity with

 impunity for lighting and decoration in the Pandals permitted

 by the Authorities and which results in loss to public

 exchequer, the Electricity Board in its return has denied of any

 such incidents within its knowledge. The Electricity Board in

 its return has asserted that when permission to install Pandal is

 given,    contemporaneously,        application     for    temporary

 electricity connection is made to the Electricity Board through

 the Committee Members and that request is accepted on

 condition of installation of temporary meter for the relevant

 period. In that case, the Committee will be obliged to pay the

 actual electricity consumed during the relevant period as per

 the meter reading. However, if any specific instance of

 noninstallation of temporary meter or tampering of the

 temporary meter or otherwise comes to the notice of the

 officials of the Electricity Board, immediate action of

 disconnecting the illegal connection should be resorted to. In

 addition to that, the officials of Electricity Board must not only

 recover the loss suffered due to such illegal connection but
                                                W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                   35</span>

 also register criminal action against the members of the

 Committee for drawing electricity without proper electricity

 connection given by the Electricity Board and take those

 proceedings to its logical end.
</p>
<p id="p_84">34.     The relief claimed by the petitioner to direct the

respondents to make the elected representatives of local bodies

in-charge of the Pandals, which are permitted by the competent

Authority, in our opinion, cannot be coutenanced. For, it would

tantamount to interference with the rights of the registered

Society to administer its own affairs within the frame work

of the concerned Regulations. The autonomy of registered

Societies or the rights of Association of persons cannot

be interfered with, in absence of any reasonable restriction

imposed by a law made by the legislature in that behalf. It is,

however, open for the duty-holders to form a joint broad based

Committee to act as a watchdog for enforcement of the

Environmental laws in which the elected representatives can

play a significant role. Besides this, we do not wish to dilate any

further on this issue and make it amply clear that we may not be

understood to have expressed any final opinion in that behalf. In

fact, this relief was not seriously pressed during the arguments

advanced before us and the arguments essentially were to
                                               W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                36</span>

persuade the Court to strike down Section 13 of the Adhiniyam

of 1985 as ultra vires.
</p>
<p id="p_85">35.        We may also observe that if violation of noise levels

is brought to the notice of the police, Revenue or Municipal

Authorities, they must report that matter to the Electricity Board

with recommendation to disconnect the electricity connection

forthwith. In any case, all the duty-holders must work in tandem

to ensure that the nuisance caused on account of such noise

pollution or because of theft of electricity is not ignored, but

proceeded against the members of the Committee individually

and vicariously in accordance with law - for recovery of

damages /compensation for such unauthorized activity, in

addition to criminal action.
</p>
<p id="p_86">

</p><p id="p_87">36.        As regards the grievance of petitioner regarding

extortion and intimidation of public by unscrupulous elements in

the name of donation for the Pandals, even that is a matter

which must be brought to the notice of the local administration -

be it police or Revenue or Municipal officials, who in turn must

take immediate corrective action to redress such complaints. It

may be desirable for all the duty-holders to provide for one

common telephone helpline to ensure immediate response for
                                                          W.P. No.4792/2005 (PIL)

redressal of such complaints or receiving online complaint and

to deal with such complaints in accordance with law including

by registration of criminal action against the persons indulging

in such unauthorized activity of intimidating the public to force

them to donate involuntarily for the installation of Pandals for

arranging functions.
