Bangalore-560 001.                      ...Respondent

[By Sri.D.Nagaraj, Advocate]

      This Criminal Petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_2">Section 482</a> of the
Cr.P.C. praying to set aside the order issuing process dated
12.09.2006      and      quash       the    proceedings     in
C.C.No.26418/2006 on the file of the VI Additional Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore.

      This Criminal Petition coming for further hearing on
this day, the Court made the following:

                          ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     In this petition filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_3">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C., the

petitioner    arraigned   as       Accused   No.1   in   C.C.

No.26418/2006 on the file of the VI Additional C.M.M.,

Bangalore, has sought for quashing the complaint filed by

the respondent-Karnataka State Pollution Control Board

(For short, 'Board')   seeking prosecution of the petitioner

and another for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_4">Section 15</a> of

the Environment (Protection) Act,1986 (for short, the Act').


</p><p id="p_2">     2)      The allegations made in the complaint filed by

the respondent-Board before the Magistrate are that, the

petitioner-company engaged in construction of residential

complex comprised of 206 flats in land bearing Survey Nos.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3</span>

48/1, 48/2, 49/1, 49/2, 49/3, 49/4, 50 &amp; 51 of

Jailkondanahalli, Sarjapur Road, Bangalore East Taluk,

Bangalore Urban District, without obtaining necessary

consent from the complainant -Board as required by

<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_6">26</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short, <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water Act</a>') and as required

by Environmental Impact Assessment Notification dated

27.01.1994,     which   is   notified    by    the   Ministry   of

Environment and Forest, Government of India, in exercise

of powers conferred under Clause (5) of sub-section (2) of

Section-3 of Environment Protection Act, 1986 (for short,

'E.P.Act') read with Rules and as required by Section-21 of

the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (for

short, '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">Air Act</a>'). That when the officials of the complainant-

Board inspected the said site on 15.12.2004, they found

that   the    project   proponents      have    already   started

construction activities without clearance from the Board

and also without obtaining environment clearance from the

Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India,

New Delhi, though such clearance was mandatory. As the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              4</span>

petitioner's construction project was also one of the

establishments which required obtaining prior clearance

from Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of

India and since without obtaining clearance, the petitioner-

company had commenced the construction, the Board

issued a show-cause notice dated 21.01.2005          to the

petitioner/accused.   However the accused neither applied

for issue of consent clearance for operation of his project

regarding construction of the apartment building nor

submitted any reply to the show-cause notice. Though

subsequently the regional office of the complainant-Board

issued a letter dated 06.04.2005 to the accused calling

upon him to meet in the office of the Environmental Officer

on 12.04.2005 to discuss the technical matters of the

project, the accused failed to attend the meeting. One more

opportunity was granted to the accused to attend the

technical discussion meeting on 13.05.2005, but the

accused failed to attend the said meeting also. Therefore,

an ex-party decision was taken and by letter dated

15.06.2005. the Board informed the Commissioner of BDA
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              5</span>

about the accused having         undertaken the Apartment

Project without applying and obtaining prior consent

clearance and requested the Commissioner of BDA to

withdraw the licence issued to the accused.      In spite of

such letters, the accused failed to apply for clearance and

thereby the accused has committed offences under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_11">Sections

25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_12">26</a> of the Water Act punishable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_13">Section 44</a> of

the said Act, the offence under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_14">Section 21</a> of the Air Act

which is punishable under <a href="/doc/546640/" id="a_15">Section 37</a> of the said Act and

also under Section 15 of the E.P.,Act.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">      3)   The learned Magistrate, who took cognizance of

the offence alleged in the complaint, directed issue of

summons to the petitioners and another arraigned as

accused.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">     4)    On coming to know of the same, the petitioner-

Company presented this petition seeking to quash the said

complaint inter alia on the grounds that, even if allegations

made in the complaint and the documents furnished along

with the complaint are taken on their face value, they do
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    6</span>

not constitute commission of the offence alleged; that the

petitioner-company has obtained clearance certificate from

the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of

India on 07.03.2007 and also obtained permission from the

Board on 18.09.2006,            as such, the petitioner has not

committed      any   offence,     as    such    the     complaint      is

misconceived     one;    that    the    application     for   grant    of

clearance was made to the Government of India on

27.07.2006 and Board on 23.09.2005 and that the

clearance given by the respective authorities would not only

be effective    prospectively,     it   would    also be       effective

retrospectively from the date of application, therefore, the

construction    activities      commenced       after   the   date     of

application cannot be construed as in violation of any

provisions of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">     5) I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the

petitioner as well as the learned counsel for the respondent.

Perused the records secured from the court below.                     The

point for consideration is,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7</span>

             "Whether the compliant lodged against
       the petitioner is liable to be quashed."
</p>
<p id="p_9">       6)    Learned counsel for the petitioner contended

that   the   complaint   of   the   Board   presented   by   its

Environmental Officer for the offence punishable under

<a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_16">Section 44</a> of the Water Act and <a href="/doc/1296808/" id="a_17">Section 37</a> of the Air Act, is

not maintainable for the reason that the person who has

lodged the complaint is not duly authorized by the Board

for lodging such complaint and therefore, the cognizance

taken on such complaint is also bad in law.         It is also

further contended that since the petitioner has not

commenced any industrial plant, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_18">Air Act</a>

is not applicable.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">       7)    As per sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_19">Section 25</a> of the

Water Act, no person shall, without the previous consent of

the State Board, establish or take any steps to establish

any industry,    operation or process, or any treatment and

disposal system or any extension or addition thereto, which

is likely to discharge sewage or trade effluent into a stream

or well or sewer or on land. Section-44 of the Water Act, is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 8</span>

the penal section for contravention of Sections- 25 &amp; 26 of

the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_20">Water Act</a>.    Section-49 of the said Act deals with the

cognizance of offences.      According to sub-section (1) of

<a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_21">Section 49</a>, no court shall take cognizance of any offence

under this Act except on a complaint made by a Board or

any officer authorized in this behalf by it.


</p><p id="p_12">      8)    As per <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_22">Section 21</a> of the Air Act, no person shall,

without the previous consent of the State Board, establish or

operate any industrial plant in an air pollution control area.

Section-37 of the said Act is the penal section for the

contravention of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_23">Section 21</a>. Section-43 of

the Act deals with cognizance of the offence. According to

sub-section (1), no court shall take cognizance of any offence

under this Act except on a complaint made by a Board or

any officer authorized by it. Therefore, in the light of the

provisions of <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_24">Section 49</a> of the Water Act, and <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_25">Section 43</a> of

Air Act, cognizance of any offence under those Acts can be

taken only on a complaint made by the Board or by any

Officer authorized in that behalf.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                9</span><p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">       9)   Perusal of the original records secured from the

jurisdictional Magistrate indicates that along with the

complaint, no material is produced to show that the Board

has passed any resolution to lodge a complaint.           The

complaint is signed by the Environmental Officer of the

Karnataka State Pollution Control Board.       A copy of the

memo dated 05.08.2006 is available in the records which is

duly    signed    by    the   Chairman      authorizing   the

Environmental Officer for filing criminal case against M/s.

Puravankara Projects Ltd.     As per this authorization, the

Environmental Officer is authorized to file the complaint

alleging the offence under Section 15 of the E.P. Act only.

The authorization does not relate to offences either under

the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_26">Water Act</a> or under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_27">Air Act</a>. Therefore, there is no

proper authorization to file a complaint alleging the offence

under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_28">Water Act</a> or <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_29">Air Act</a>. The authorization relates only

to the offence under Section 15 of the E.P. Act. 1996.


</p><p id="p_15">       10) In addition to the above, it is not the case of the

complainant that the petitioner herein has established or

started operating any Industrial Plant. The term 'Industrial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                10</span>

Plant' is defined under <a href="/doc/840666/" id="a_30">Section 2(k)</a> of the Air Act to mean,

any plant used for any industrial or Industrial purposes and

emitting any air pollutant into the atmosphere. <a href="/doc/1169969/" id="a_31">Section 2(a)</a>

defines 'Air Pollutant' to mean, any solid, liquid or gaseous

substance (including noise) present in the atmosphere in

such concentration as may be or tend to be injurious to

human beings or other living creatures or plants or property

or environment. On the face of it, the activity said to have

been started by the petitioner, cannot be termed as an

industrial plant as defined under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_32">Air Act</a>, therefore, in

my considered opinion, the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_33">Air Act</a> are not

attracted.    However,   the    learned   Magistrate   without

applying his mind to these factors and without looking into

the    documents produced along with the complaint

properly, appears to have mechanically taken cognizance of

the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_34">Section 44</a> of the Water Act

and <a href="/doc/1296808/" id="a_35">Section 37</a> of the Air Act, as such, the complaint

alleging offence under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_36">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_37">Air Act</a>, cannot be

sustained.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                     11</span><p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">     11)    There is no serious dispute as to the fact that by

amended notification dated 07.07.2004, the construction

projects were also added as one of the establishments

which require clearance from the Ministry of Environment

and Forest, Government of India, New Delhi, as per the

provisions of the Act. There is also no serious dispute that

the petitioner commenced the project of construction of a

residential apartment complex comprised of 206 flats in the

aforesaid   land.        According       to   the   complainant,    the

construction site was inspected by the officials of the

complainant-Board on 15.12.2004 and at that time, the

proponents of the project had already commenced the

construction and by that time, they had not obtained the

clearance as required by the Act. It is also not in serious

dispute     that    the         petitioner-company      subsequently

approached the competent authority under the Act and the

clearance was accorded to the petitioner by the Ministry of

Environment        and    Forest,       Government     of   India   on

07.03.2007    and        they    have    also   obtained    necessary

permission from the complainant-Board on 18.09.2006. It
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                12</span>

has to be noticed that for the first time, only by notification

dated 07.07.2004, the construction project was added as

one of the establishments requiring such clearance. Earlier

to the date of notification, there was no such requirement

on the part of the construction project. It is not in dispute

that   subsequently,    by    notification   dated    14.09.2006

jurisdiction to grant Environment Clearance was conferred

on the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (for

short, 'SEIAA'). Even according to the complainant, on the

date of inspection, the alleged construction was only at the

stage of digging the earth for foundation and actual

construction had not been commenced. No doubt, in the

notification dated 07.07.2004 the ongoing construction had

been saved, provided the construction had gone beyond the

plinth level as on the date of notification.           Of course

according to the inspection notings, as on 15.12.2004, the

construction had       not   gone   beyond   the     plinth level.

Nevertheless, having regard to the fact that the requirement

of such clearance was introduced in July 2004 and in view

of the fact that subsequently, the petitioner-company has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                  13</span>

obtained   necessary        clearance      from   the   competent

authorities and since the offence under <a href="/doc/591495/" id="a_38">Section 15</a> of the

Act is punishable with imprisonment which may extend to

5 years or with fine which may extend to Rs.1,00,000/- or

with both, in the considered opinion of this court is,

instead of directing the petitioner to face the prosecution,

interest of justice would be served by directing the

petitioner-company to pay maximum fine as provided by

<a href="/doc/591495/" id="a_39">Section 15</a> of the Act. In this regard, I would draw

sustenance from the order passed by this Court in identical

matter in Criminal Petition No.2782/2008 disposed of on

17.07.2008.   In the said case, the petitioner therein was

sought to be prosecuted for the offence punishable under

Section. 15 of the Act. During the course of the trial, the

complainant-Board      by     filing   a   memo    reported   that

subsequently there is no pollution problem in the industry

and since the industry has obtained clearance from the

authority as on the date of lodging of the complaint, it was

submitted by the complainant before the court that the

plea of the accused may be accepted and the matter may be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                 14</span>

closed by directing the accused to pay maximum penalty

prescribed. However, the trial court refused to accept the

said memo and ordered continuation of the proceedings.

The said order was questioned before this Court by

presentation of a petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_40">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C.,

wherein   this   court    having     regard   to   the   fact   that,

subsequently environment clearance had been obtained by

the accused from the State Government and since it was

reported that there is no pollution problem in the industry,

directed that the prosecution against the                petitioner-

company should be closed by accepting the maximum fine

of Rs.1,00,000/- as provided under <a href="/doc/591495/" id="a_41">Section 15</a> of the Act.


</p><p id="p_18">      12) In the case on hand also, though as found by

the officials of the complainant-Board on the date of the

inspection certain construction activities were going on

without   obtaining      the   required   clearance      from    the

competent authority, subsequently, applications were filed

before the competent authority seeking clearance and the

same was granted by the competent authority before filing

of the complaint.     Thus, subsequent grant of clearance
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                   15</span>

would indicate that the project was not in violation of any

of the provisions of the Act. Therefore, having regard to the

above subsequent development, it is just and necessary to

direct closure of the prosecution by directing the petitioner-

company to pay maximum fine provided under <a href="/doc/591495/" id="a_42">Section 15</a>

of the Act.     In this view of the matter, the petition is

disposed   of   directing   the    petitioner   to   pay   fine   of

Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) within four weeks

from today before the complainant-Board. Upon depositing

such fine, the proceedings in C.C. No.26418/2006 on the

file of the VI Additional C.M.M., Bangalore, shall stand

closed.
