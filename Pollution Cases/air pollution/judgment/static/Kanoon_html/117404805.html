THIS CRIMINAL REVISION PETITION HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON
07.12.2018, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 Crl.Rev.Pet.No. 560 of 2018

                                  3

                                 ORDER
</pre>


<p id="p_1">           The first petitioner is a limited company. The

     second petitioner and the second respondent were

     its     Manager    (Pollution           Control)       and        Chief

     Executive (Environment) respectively.                 The company

     had two manufacturing units (Line I and II).                       The

     first    respondent      filed    a     complaint      before       the

     Judicial    Magistrate       concerned,            which     is     now

     pending    as   C.C.No.296       of    2018   in    the    court    of

     Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Chottanikkara.

     One of the allegations is that the company caused

     pollution in the area and it failed to comply with

     the direction of the Pollution Control Board to

     close down the units. The other allegation is that

     without obtaining the sanction of the Pollution

     Control Board the company established and operated

     a third unit (Line III).              After complying with the

     direction given in the Crl.R.P No.293 of 2014 the

     learned Magistrate passed Annexure-B order holding

     that there are no sufficient grounds to discharge
 Crl.Rev.Pet.No. 560 of 2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                         4</span>

     petitioners and the second respondent and a charge

     has   to     be    framed       against       them    for    the    offence

     under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_1">section 37</a> of the Air (Prevention of Control

     and    <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Pollution           Act</a>,         1981).        This        order    is

     challenged.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           2.     Heard the learned senior counsel appearing

     for    the        petitioners       and       the     learned       counsel

     appearing         for     the     first       respondent,          and    the

     learned Public Prosecutor.
</p>
<p id="p_3">           3.     Evidence        of    the        first    respondent         was

     recorded under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">section 244</a> (1) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Cr.P.C</a>. PW1 to PW5

     were examined and Exhibits X1 to X5 were marked on

     the part of the first respondent. Exhibits D1 to

     D9 were marked on the part of the petitioners and

     the    second            respondent           before        the     learned

     Magistrate          decided to frame charge against the

     petitioners and the second respondent.

</p><p id="p_4">           4.     <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_5">Section 244</a> Cr.P.C does not contemplate

     adducing defence evidence. Accused shall not be

     allowed      to     adduce      evidence        at    this    stage.      But

     documents         were    marked        for    the     petitioners        and
 Crl.Rev.Pet.No. 560 of 2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     5</span>

     second respondent only because              this court by the

     order passed in Crl.R.P.No. 293 of 2014 allowed

     them to "produce all the materials, including the

     consent     obtained     from       the   Board".     Ordinarily,

     defence     evidence   cannot        be   looked    into    by   the

     learned Magistrate to decide whether charge should

     be framed or not.
</p>
<p id="p_5">           5.   The first petitioner company had initially

     two   manufacturing      units.      They   allegedly       emitted

     and discharged effluent which caused pollution in

     an    extensive    area.        On    07.04.2001      the   Member

     Secretary of the Kerala State Pollution Control

     Board directed the company to take certain action

     by Annexure R1(e) letter.             The following six facts

     were noted by the Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_6">                1.   A major expansion work is in
                     progress without clearance from
                     the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                2.   There is severe air                pollution
                     caused from the Unit.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                3.   The major source of air            pollution
                     is fugitive emissions.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                4.   There is leakage of carbon
                     particles from various units and
                     leaked material is accumulated
 Crl.Rev.Pet.No. 560 of 2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                6</span>

                    at many places and/or spread   all
                    over both within and outside    the
                    plant.
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">               5.   Packing   area,    loading    bay,
                    warehouse   etc    need    special
                    mention in this regard.

</pre><p id="p_10">               6.   The roads around the plant are
                    not tarred or concreted. These
                    are not wetted also as per the
                    consent condition. As a result
                    the dust pollution from the roads
                    especially during truck  movements
                    is severe.
</p>
<p id="p_11">          6.    There was a proposal for expansion of the

     manufacturing units of the company. It apparently

     applied for the consent of the Pollution Control

     Board on 30.06.2001. By Annexure R1(i) order the

     Board informed the company of its refusal to give

     consent to establish a new unit (Unit III- called

     Line III).
</p>
<p id="p_12">          7.    Annexure R1(c) indicates that inspite of

     the stop order and the refusal of the Board to

     give consent to establish a new unit, the company

     commissioned and operated a new unit. The Member

     Secretary reported that the company violated the

     direction issued to it and it continued to pollute

     the air.
</p><p id="p_13"> Crl.Rev.Pet.No. 560 of 2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                              7</span>

</p><p id="p_14">           8.    On 21.07.2001 the Pollution Control Board

     issued Annexure-R1(b) directions to the company to

     close      down       the     operations            in    the   manufacturing

     units as the operations were being done inspite of

     the    refusal         of     the   Board           to    issue    consent   to

     establish         a    new     unit.         On     27.07.2001      the    Board

     informed       the       company         again       to    close    down     the

     units.
</p>
<p id="p_15">           9.    Genuineness of the above documents is not

     disputed. The documents speak for themselves.                                It

     is    also pertinent            to note             that the      petitioners

     have no case that they had obtained consent of the

     Pollution Control Board before the 3rd unit was

     established.
</p>
<p id="p_16">           10. The learned Senior counsel appearing for

     the petitioners would submit that the consent of

     the Pollution Control Board was obtained later.

     This was the argument before the trial court also.

     The    trial          court    took          the    view    that    obtaining

     consent      subsequent             to        the     commission      of     the

     offence would not erase the offence.                              It took the
 Crl.Rev.Pet.No. 560 of 2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                           8</span>

     view that not only for starting the operations but

     to establish the unit itself previous consent of

     the Pollution Control Board was necessary.

</p><p id="p_17">           11. <a href="/doc/195059463/" id="a_6">Section        21(1)</a>        of    the     Air     (Prevention    &amp;

     <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a> provides that subject to

     the   provisions         in   the         section      no      person   shall

     without the previous consent of the State Board

     establish or operate any industrial plant in an

     air pollution control area.                       There is no dispute

     that the area in which the petitioner company has

     established its units is an air pollution control

     area.      It    is    immaterial          whether        the    industrial

     plant will cause pollution or not. Even if the

     plant      does not cause pollution, consent of the

     Board   is       necessary       to       establish       any    industrial

     plant      in    the    area.             Not   only      to    operate   an

     industrial unit, but to establish it also previous

     consent of the Board is necessary.

</p><p id="p_18">           12. It was not disputed for me that the Unit-

     III   of     the      petitioner          company      was      established

     without         the    consent     of       the     Pollution       Control
 Crl.Rev.Pet.No. 560 of 2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              9</span>

     Board.   Though the Pollution Control Board refused

     to give consent, the petitioner company operated

     the plant.    The subsequent granting of the consent

     by the Board does not erase or efface the offences

     already committed by the company and its officers.

     The learned Magistrate rightly rejected the prayer

     of the petitioners to discharge them.

</p><p id="p_19">           In the result, this Crl.R.P is dismissed.
