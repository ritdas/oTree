 basis of which the accused cannot be held guilty.  It is further submitted by 

counsel for the accused that the cheques in question were never drawn to 

discharge and legally enforceable debt or liability and the same have been 

presented by the complainant without any authority from the accused no. 1 

and therefore, no offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_48">section 138</a> of Act 26 of 1881 is 

made out against the accused persons. It is also submitted by counsel for the 

accused that it was an accepted practice between the complainant and the 

accused no. 1 that all local cheques of Coimbatore issued by the accused no. 

1 were to be latter replaced by demand drafts and, as in the present case, the 

complainant has failed to explain why it never presented the cheques issued 

in its favour on earlier occasion and instead preferred to accept the demand 

draft, therefore, it leads to only one plausible inference that replacement of 

local cheques of Coimbatore with demand draft was the accepted mode of 

payment.  It is further submitted by counsel for the accused that no notice 

was served by the complainant upon the accused before making the present 

complaint   and   therefore,   no   offence   is   made   out   against   either   of   the 

accused.  It is also submitted on behalf of the accused that the accused no. 4 

and 5 have no role to play in the day to day affairs of the accused no. 1 and 

the   offence   has   not   been   committed   with   their   consent,   connivance   or

Financial   Services   Ltd.'s   case  [182   (2011)   DLT   385]   (supra)   having 

discussed and analysed the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 

K. Bhaskaran's case (supra), Shri Ishar Alloy Steels Ltd.'s case (supra) and 

Harman   Electronics's   case  (supra)   declared   the   law   laid   down   by   the 

Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   in  Harman   Electronics's   case  (supra)   as  per 

incurium  and   further   held   that   the   judgment   of   Supreme   Court   in  K.

Court in  G.E. Capital Transportation Financial Services Ltd.'s case  [182 

(2011) DLT 385] (supra) and by the Supreme Court in K. Bhaskaran's case 

(supra) and keeping in view the fact that the demand notice in question in 

the present case was sent from Delhi I do not see any force in the contention 

of   the   learned   counsel   for   the   accused   that   the   court   in   Delhi   has   no 

jurisdiction   to   entertain   the   present   case   and   the   complaint   should   be 

returned.  As the complainant is having its registered office in Delhi and the 

cheque in question was also presented for collection in Delhi, therefore, in 

the light of the law laid down by the Hon'ble High Court in Patiala Casting 


C. C. No. 1086/1/09 (Old No. 203/1/99)                                     Page no. 19 of 43

Capital Transportation  Financial Services' case  [2011 (2) JCC (NI) 105] 

(supra) I hold that this court has jurisdiction to proceed with the matter. 

The objection raised on behalf of the accused in this regard is declined.

</p><p id="p_25">24.             The other objection raised on behalf of the accused is that the 

notice dated 01.12.2000 framed against the accused persons substantiates 

the fact that the case of the complainant was that towards the discharge of 

liability in respect of contract dated 14.4.1997 the cheques in question were 

issued.   According to the accused only cognizance of offence punishable 

under <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_56">section 138</a> of Act 26 of 1881 was taken against the accused persons 

and no cognizance under <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_57">section 141</a> of Act 26 of 1881 has been taken and 

therefore, the notice of accusation framed against the accused no. 2 to 5 is 

invalid and they are liable to be acquitted.  In the considered opinion of the 

court the argument raised on behalf of the accused is misconceived and 

cannot be accepted.

<p id="p_26">25.             Chapter XVII in Act 26 of 1881 was inserted by Act 66 of 

1988 and the same creates only one offence, namely, the offence punishable 

under <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_58">section 138</a> of Act 26 of 1881.  Chapter XVII of Act 26 of 1881 does 

not contain any other offence.  <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_59">Section 141</a> of Act 26 of 1881 also renders

the same has been done by my learned predecessor.   In the present case 

there was no necessity of taking cognizance of offence under <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_64">section 141</a> of 

Act 26 of 1881 for the simple reason that <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_65">section 141</a> does not create any

accused and nothing more.

with the commission of offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_67">section 138</a> of Act 26 of 

1881.  By way of notice of accusation dated 01.12.2000 each of the accused

was supplied with a copy of complaint as well as the documents which

deposed that in pursuance of agreement dated 14.4.1997 the complainant 

had supplied goods to the accused no. 1 and to discharge its liability the 

accused had drawn cheques Ex. PW1/10, Ex. PW1/11 and Ex. PW1/12 out 

of which Ex. PW1/10 was signed by the accused no. 3 in capacity of being 

Joint Managing Director of the accused no. 1 whereas cheques Ex. PW1/11 

and Ex. PW1/12 were signed by the accused no. 2 being Managing Director 

of the accused no. 1.   The factum of issuance of cheques Ex. PW1/10, Ex. 

PW1/11 and Ex. PW1/12 has not been disputed by the accused persons and 

instead   the   accused   no.   3   during   her   examination   under   <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_75">section   313</a>   of 

Cr.P.C. has admitted signing of cheque Ex. PW1/10. The accused no. 5 as 

DW2 during his examination has accepted issuance of letter Ex. PW1/7 

whereby the three cheques were sent to the complainant by the accused no. 

</p><p id="p_44">1.  

</p><p id="p_45">33.             During his examination PW1 Mr. S.S. Sorot also deposed that 

the three cheques were presented by the complainant for encashment but 

the same returned unpaid alongwith memo Ex. PW1/13, Ex. PW1/14, Ex. 

PW1/15,   Ex.   PW1/16   and   Ex.   PW1/17.     To   prove   the   factum   of   the 

dishonour   of   the   cheques   the   complainant   also   got   examined   PW2   Mr. 

Inderjeet   Singh   Kohli   and   PW3   Mr.   Anil   Kumar   Adlakha.     During   the 

cross­examination of PW1 S.S. Sorot it has nowhere been suggested that 

the cheques in question were never presented for encashment and the same

 did not return unpaid due to insufficient funds and stop payment of the 

money against the said cheques.   Thus, in the light of the testimonies of 

PW1 Mr. S.S. Sorot, PW2 Mr. Inderjeet Singh Kohli and PW3 Mr. Anil 

Kumar Adlakaha and documents Ex. PW1/13, Ex. PW1/14, Ex. PW1/15, 

Ex. PW1/16 and Ex. PW1/17 I hold that the complainant has succeeded in 

proving the fact that the three cheques were presented by the complainant 

for   encashment   and   on   such   presentation   the   same   returned   unpaid   on 

25.3.1999 due to insufficient funds in the accounts of the complainant and 

due to stopping of payment by the complainant.

<p id="p_46">34.             During his examination it has also been deposed by PW1 Mr. 

S.S. Sorot that after return of the three cheques as dishonoured a demand 

notice dated 01.4.1999, a copy of which is Ex. PW1/18, was sent by the 

complainant to the accused by way of registered post with AD and UPC and 

the same were received by the accused persons by way of acknowledgment 

card   Ex.   PW1/25   to   Ex.   PW1/29.     During   their   respective   examination 

under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_76">section 313</a> of Cr.P.C. all the accused have denied having received 

any notice.

<p id="p_47">35.             A perusal of documents Ex. PW1/18 to Ex. PW1/29 reveals 

that the notice was addressed and sent to all the five accused persons at 

their   address   473­J,   Ramanuj   Nagar,   Uppilipalayam,   Post   Coimbatore. 

During   their   cross­examination   DW1   Mr.   M.S.R.K.   Iyer   and   DW2   S.

 accused was 473­J, Ramanuj Nagar, Uppilipalayam, Post Coimbatore.  

</p><p id="p_48">36.             Since it is admitted by the accused no. 4 and 5 in capacity of 

DW1 and DW2 respectively that the accused were having their address at 

473­J,   Ramanuj   Nagar,   Uppilipalayam,   Post   Coimbatore   and   as   per   the 

tenor  of  Ex.   PW1/18,  Ex.   PW1/24   and  Ex.   PW1/25   to  Ex.   PW1/29   the 

notice was sent on the same address, therefore, I do not believe the version 

of   the   accused   persons   that   no   notice   dated   01.4.1999   was   sent   by   the 

complainant to them and no such notice was received by them.  In the light 

of the testimonies of PW1 Mr. S.S. Sorot, DW1 Mr. M.S.R.K. Iyer, DW3 

Mr. S. Chandrasekaran and documents Ex. PW1/18 to Ex. PW1/29 I hold 

that after dishonour of the three cheques a demand notice dated 01.4.1999, 

a copy of which is Ex. PW1/18, was sent by the complainant to all the five 

accused persons whereby they were called upon to make payment against 

the three cheques within fifteen days of the receipt of the notice.  

</p><p id="p_49">37.             From the testimony of PW1 Mr. S.S. Sorot it has also been 

proved that despite receipt of the notice dated 01.4.1999, a copy of which is 

Ex. PW1/18, the accused persons failed to make payment of the cheque 

amount within fifteen days of the receipt of the notice.  

</p><p id="p_50">38.             The only point, insofar as commission of offence by accused 

no.   1,   remains   to   be   determined   is   whether   cheques   Ex.   PW1/10,   Ex. 

PW1/11 and Ex. PW1/12 were drawn to discharge any legally enforceable 

debt or liability or not?

</p><p id="p_52"> 39.             It is the contention of the complainant that in pursuance of the 

agreement   dated   14.4.1997,   the   complainant   had   supplied   goods   and 

material to the accused no. 1 and to discharge its part liability the three 

cheques   were   issued   by   the   accused   no.   1   in   its   favour;   whereas   the 

contention of the accused is that the three cheques, although were issued by 

the accused no. 1 in favour of the complainant, but the same were not meant 

to be presented by the complainant for encashment.  It is also the contention 

of the accused no. 1 that the three cheques were not drawn to discharge any 

legally enforceable debt or liability and the same were issued at the request 

of   the   complainant   only   to   satisfy   the   foreign   collaborators   of   the 

complainant.  It is also the defence of the accused no. 1 that there was an 

established practice between the complainant and the accused that at the 

request of the complainant the accused used to issue cheque in favour of the 

complainant upon the understanding that the same would not be presented 

for   encashment   and   to   be   replaced   by   a   bank   draft   which   was   to   be 

encashed.   In the light of the testimony of DW1 Mr. M.S.R.K. Iyer and 

DW2   Mr.   S.   Chandrasekaran   and   the   documents   Ex.   DW1/DA,   Ex. 

DW1/DA1, Ex. DW1/DB, Ex. DW1/DC1, Ex. DW1/DD it is vehemently 

argued by the learned counsel for the accused that from the testimonies of 

DW1   Mr.   M.S.R.K.   Iyer   and   DW2   Mr.   S.   Chandrasekaran   and   the 

documents   proved   by   them   it   has   been   proved   that   there   was   practice 

between the parties in the past that the cheques drawn on the banker of the

 accused no. 1 at Coimbatore were not to be encashed.

PW1/10, Ex. PW1/11 and Ex. PW1/12 have been issued by the accused no.

of the complainant and against the accused no. 1 under <a href="/doc/1109458/" id="a_77">sections 118(a)</a> and 

<a href="/doc/35876/" id="a_78">139</a> of Act 26 of 1881 to the effect that the three cheques were drawn by the

behalf of the accused no. 1 whereby cheques Ex. PW1/10, Ex. PW1/11 and 

Ex. PW1/12 were forwarded to the complainant.  As per the contents of Ex.

towards release of payments subject to condition that all the related advance 

bank guarantees were to be furnished to the accused no. 1 before presenting 

the said cheques with the banker of the accused no. 1.  DW1 Mr. M.S.R.K. 

Iyer   during   his   cross­examination   has   proved   that   in   compliance   of   the 

terms of letter Ex. PW1/7 the complainant had issued a letter Ex. PW1/9 

along with original bank guarantees and the same was received by him. 

Thus,  from  the  testimony   of  DW1  Mr.   M.S.R.K.  Iyer  and  DW2   Mr.  S. 

Chandrasekaran   and   documents   Ex.   PW1/7   and   Ex.   PW1/9   it   has   been 


C. C. No. 1086/1/09 (Old No. 203/1/99)                                     Page no. 28 of 43
 proved that the three cheques were issued by the the accused no. 1 in favour 

of the complainant to discharge its liability and the presentation of the same 

was subject to condition that the related advance bank guarantees were to 

be furnished and the same were actually furnished by the complainant in 

favour of the accused.  
</p>
<p id="p_55">42.             It is deposed by DW1 Mr. M.S.R.K. Iyer and DW2 Mr. S. 

Chandrasekaran that the cheques were not drawn to discharge any liability 

and like the practice in the past the same were issued to satisfy the foreign 

collaborators of the complainant and were to be returned to the accused no. 

1 without presentation.   In proof of the fact that there was an established 

practice to the effect that the cheques issued by the accused no. 1 in favour 

of   the   complainant   were   subsequently   to   be   substituted   by   a   draft,   the 

accused persons have produced documents Ex. DW1/DA, Ex. DW1/DA1, 

Ex. DW1/DB, Ex. DW1/DC1 and Ex. DW1/DD.  The combined effects of 

the   said   documents   is   that   on   one   occasion   a   cheque   bearing   number 

145534 Ex. DW1/DA1 was sent by the accused no. 1 to the complainant 

along   with   letter   dated   Ex.   DW1/DA   which   was   received   by   the 

complainant by way of receipt Ex. DW1/DB and subsequently, by way of 

Ex. DW1/DC1 and Ex. DW1/DD cheque Ex. DW1/DA1 was returned by 

the complainant to the accused no. 1 as the payment against Ex. DW1/DA1 

was made by way of a bank draft.   The accused have not brought to the 

notice of the court any other instance when a cheque was issued by the 


C. C. No. 1086/1/09 (Old No. 203/1/99)                                     Page no. 29 of 43
 accused   no.   1   in   favour   of   the   complainant   which   was   subsequently 

substituted by a bank draft and ultimately returned to the complainant.  On 

the contrary from the perusal of documents Ex. DW1/DC3, Ex. DW1/DC4 

and mark DW2/C it has been established that on other occasions also (three 

instances have been mentioned in document mark DW2/C) the payments 

had been made by the accused no. 1 to the complainant by way of cheques 

which were got encashed by the complainant. In these circumstances the 

court does not believe the version of the accused persons that cheques Ex. 

PW1/10, Ex. PW1/11 and Ex. PW1/12 were not drawn to discharge any 

legally enforceable debt or liability.   This court also does not believe the 

defence of the accused that there was an established practice between the 

complainant   and   the   accused   no.   1   whereunder   the   three   cheques   were 

given on mutual understanding between the complainant and the accused 

no. 1 that the same would not be presented for encashment and eventually 

would be returned by the complainant to the accused no. 1 after substitution 

of the same by bank draft.   In the face of the contents of   document Ex. 

PW1/7, this court has no doubt that the three cheques were issued towards 

release of payment by the accused no. 1 to the complainant.  In the light of 

the evidence led by the parties I am of the considered view that the accused 

have failed to rebut the presumptions under <a href="/doc/1109458/" id="a_79">sections 118</a> (a) and 139 of Act 

26 of 1881. 
</p>
<p id="p_56">43.             In this regard there are other events which occurred during the 


C. C. No. 1086/1/09 (Old No. 203/1/99)                                     Page no. 30 of 43
 trial   and   therefore,   cannot   be   discounted.   As   per   record   on   16.7.2001 

statement was made before the court regarding a compromise between the 

parties and at that moment the accused, in the present case as well as in 

connected case bearing C.C. no. 1087/1/2009 (old no. 204/1/99), admitted 

their  liability   to  pay  Rs.4,73,17,599/­  to  the  complainant  by  30.01.2002. 

Although the said statement was signed by the accused persons "without 

prejudice"   but   since   the   present   proceedings   are   criminal   in   nature, 

therefore, the bar created under <a href="/doc/813048/" id="a_80">section 23</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 

(Act 1 of 1872) is not applicable and consequently, the admission of their 

liability   made   by   the   accused   is   relevant.   Further   in   pursuance   of   the 

statement   made   on   16.7.2001   some   payments   were   also   made   by   the 

accused no. 1 and other accused to the complainant. The conduct of the 

accused in making statement on 16.7.2001 and subsequent payments is also 

relevant under <a href="/doc/272099/" id="a_81">section 8</a> of Act 1 of 1872 and leads to only one inference 

that the cheque were drawn by the accused no. 1 to discharge its legally 

enforceable liability.
</p>
<p id="p_57">44.             From   the   above   discussion   it   has   been   proved   that   to 

discharge its liability towards the complainant the accused no. 1 under the 

signatures of the accused no. 2 had drawn cheques Ex. PW1/11 and Ex. 

PW1/2 in favour of the complainant. It has also been proved to discharge its 

liability towards the complainant the accused no. 1 under the signature of 

the   accused   no.   3   had   drawn   cheque   Ex.   PW1/10,   in   favour   of   the 


C. C. No. 1086/1/09 (Old No. 203/1/99)                                     Page no. 31 of 43
 complainant and when the said cheques were presented by the complainant 

for encashment the same returned unpaid due to insufficient funds in the 

account of the accused no. 1 and due to the reason that the payment against 

the same was stopped by the accused no. 1.  From the material on record it 

has also been proved that after dishonour of the cheques a demand notice 

dated   01.4.1999,   a   copy   of   which   is   Ex.   PW1/18,   was   sent   by   the 

complainant to the accused within fifteen days of the receipt of information 

regarding dishonour of the cheque whereby the accused were called upon to 

make payment against the three cheques and the said notice was received 

by the accused persons by way of acknowledgment cards Ex. PW1/25 to 

Ex. PW1/29.  From the evidence led by the parties it has also been proved 

that despite  receipt of notice  dated  01.4.1999  the  accused  did   not  make 

payment against the three cheques.  The accused have failed to prove their 

defence by leading cogent evidence or by bringing notice of the court any 

material led during the evidence of the complainant.  In these circumstances 

this   court   finds   that   the   complainant   has   succeeded   in   proving   all   the 

ingredients of offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_82">section 138</a> of Act 26 of 1881 and 

the   conditions   precedent  for   making   a   complaint  against   the   accused   in 

respect of the said offence regarding all the three cheques.  Hence, accused 

no. 1 Silcal Metallurgic Ltd. is found guilty of having committed offence 

punishable under <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_83">section 138</a> of Act 26 of 1881 in respect of cheques Ex.

        company's business and affairs and can be prosecuted for offences by the

        It follows that other employees of the company, cannot be said to be persons

        company   for   the   conduct   of   the   business   of   the   company".   (emphasis 
        supplied) It is evident that a person who can be made vicariously liable under 
        sub­section (1) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_116">Section 141</a> is a person who is responsible to the company 
        for the conduct of the business of the company and in addition is also in 
        charge of the business of the company.   There may be many Directors and 
        secretaries who are not in charge of the business of the company at all.  The 
        meaning of the words "person in charge of the business of the company" was 
        considered by this Court in <a href="/doc/50504/" id="a_117">Girdhari Lal Gupta v. D.H. Mehta</a> followed in 
        <a href="/doc/443284/" id="a_118">State   of   Karnataka   v.   Pratap   Chand</a>   and   <a href="/doc/1951626/" id="a_119">Katta   Sujatha   v.   Fertilizers   &amp; 
        Chemicals Travancore Ltd.  This</a> Court held that the words refer to a person 
        who is in overall control of the day­to­day business of the company.   This 
        Court pointed out that a person may be a Director and thus belongs to the 
        group of persons making the policy followed by the company, but yet may 
        not be in charge of the business of the company; that a person may be a 
        manager who is in charge of the business but may not be in overall charge of 
        the business; and that a person may be an officer who may be in charge of 
        only some part of the business.
</p><p id="p_70">        23*. Therefore, if a person does not meet the first requirement, that is, being 
        a person who is responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of 
        the  company,  neither  the  question  of  his  meeting  the  second   requirement 
        (being a person in charge of the business of the company), nor the question 
        of such person being liable under sub­section (1) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_120">Section 141</a> arises.  To 
        put in differently, to be vicariously liable under sub­section (1) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_121">Section 
        141</a>, a person should fulfil the "legal requirement" of being a person in law 
        (under the statute governing companies) responsible to the company for the 
        conduct   of   the   business   of   the   company   and   also   fulfil   the   "factual 
        requirement" of being a person in charge of the business of the company.

</p><p id="p_72">        27. The position under <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_123">Section 141</a> of the Act can be summarised thus:
</p><p id="p_73">                  (i) If  the  accused is the Managing  Director or  a Joint Managing 
        Director, it is not necessary to make an averment in the complaint that he is 
        in   charge   of,   and   is   responsible   to   the   company,   for   the   conduct   of   the 
        business of the company.   It is sufficient if an averment is made that the 
        accused   was   the   Managing   Director   or   Joint   Managing   Director   at   the 
        relevant time.  This is because the prefix "Managing" to the word "Director" 
        makes   it   clear   that   they   were   in   charge   of   and   are   responsible   to   the 
        company, for the conduct of the business of the company.  
</p><p id="p_74">                  (ii)  In  the  case  of  a  Director or  an   officer  of  the  company  who 
        signed the cheque on behalf of the company, there is no need to make a 
        specific   averment   that   he   was   in   charge   of   and   was   responsible   to   the 
        company,   for   the   conduct   of   the   business   of   the   company   or   make   any 
        specific allegation about consent, connivance or negligence.  The very fact 
        that the dishonoured cheque was signed by him on behalf of the company, 
        would give rise to responsibility under sub­section (2) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_124">Section 141</a>.

</p><p id="p_83"> 52.             Insofar   as   liability   of   accused   no.   4   Mr.   M.S.R.K.   Iyer   is 

concerned,   in   the   complaint   Ex.   PW1/30   his   designation   has   been 

mentioned as General Manager, Hydro Projects whereas the designation of 

the   accused   no.   2  and   3  have  been  mentioned   as  Managing  Director  of 

accused no. 1 and Joint Managing Director of accused no. 1 respectively. 

In paragraph no. 1 of the complaint also it has been stated that the accused 

no. 4 has been mentioned as General Manager of the Hydro Projects of the 

accused no. 1 whereas the accused no. 2 and the accused no. 3 have been 

mentioned   as   Managing   Director  of   the   accused   no.   1  and   the   Joint 

Managing Director of the accused no. 1 respectively.  From the testimony 

of   DW1   Mr.   M.S.R.K.   Iyer   it   has   been   proved   that   accused   no.   4   Mr. 

M.S.R.K.   Iyer   was   not   the   General   Manager  of   the   accused   no.   1  and 

instead he was only the Project Manager for the Hydro Electric Project of 

the accused no. 1.  As per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court 

in K.K. Ahuja's case (supra) a Manager of a company can be considered to 

be   a   person   who   is   responsible   to   the   company   for   the   conduct   of   the 

business.  However, for rendering a Manager liable for the commission of 

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_138">section 138</a> of Act 26 of 1881 it is necessary that 

such Manager should be the Manager of the company and not a particular 

unit of the same.  In the present case from the evidence led by the parties it 

has emerged that the accused no.   1 company wanted to establish Hydro 

Projects in the State of Kerala.  Obviously, for erection and maintenance of 


C. C. No. 1086/1/09 (Old No. 203/1/99)                                     Page no. 39 of 43
 such projects the accused no.1 had to require the help of technical persons, 

and it appears that for such purpose the services of Mr. M.S.R.K. Iyer was 

availed of and he was put in place as a Project Manager.  In the considered 

opinion of the court being Manager of only a specialised unit of the accused 

no. 1 cannot be treated being a person in charge of and responsible to the 

conduct of  the   business   of  the   accused  no.  1.     Thus,   the   accused  no.  4 

cannot   be   covered   under   clause   (1)   of   <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_139">section   141</a>   of   Act   26   of   1881. 

Further, in the facts and circumstances of the case as the accused no. 4 had 

no role in drawing of the cheque and its dishonour, therefore, it cannot be 

held that the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_140">section 138</a> of Act 26 of 1881 in 

respect of the three cheques or either of them has been committed with the 

consent or connivance of the accused no. 4 or is attributable to any neglect 

on his part.  Thus, in the face of the evidence led by the parties and the law 

laid   down   by   the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   in  K.K.   Ahuja's   case  (supra) 

accused no. 4 M.S.R.K. Iyer is not liable under <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_141">section 141</a> of Act 26 of 

1881   in   respect   of   the   three   cheques   or   any   of   them.     Accused   no.   4 

M.S.R.K. Iyer is not found guilty of having committed offence punishable 

under <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_142">section 138</a> of Act 26 of 1881 in respect of cheques Ex. PW1/10, Ex. 

PW1/11 and Ex. PW1/12 and he is acquitted.

Director, Director, Manager, Secretary or any person in accordance with 

whose directions or instructions the Board of Directors of the accused no. 1 

was accustomed to act.   In the affidavit of PW1 Mr. S.S. Sorot tendered 

during his examination in chief, the accused no. 5 besides being mentioned 

as authorised signatory of the accused no. 1 has also been mentioned as 

Manager   (Taxation)   of   the   accused   no.   1.     However,   no   corroborative 

material   has   been   placed   on   record   to   suggest   that   at   the   time   of   the 

commission of offence by the accused no. 1, the accused no. 5 was holding 

post of Manager (Taxation) in the accused no. 1.

<p id="p_85">54.             During his examination as DW2 it has been deposed by the 

accused no. 5 that he was posted as a clerk in the accounts department of 

the   accused   no.   1.     During   his   cross­examination   DW2   Mr.   S. 

Chandrasekaran has deposed that in the year 2001 he had resigned from the 

services of the accused no. 1 and at that time he had been working as an 

Assistant in the Finance Account Department of the accused no. 1.  Nothing 

has come on the record to suggest that the accused no. 5 was holding any 

managerial position in the accused no. 1 and was in charge of and was 

responsible to the accused no. 1 for the conduct of its business.  Thus, the 

accused no.  5 is not covered by clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_143">section 141</a> of Act 26 of 1881.

PW1/6 and Ex. PW1/7 it is vehemently argued by the learned counsel for 


C. C. No. 1086/1/09 (Old No. 203/1/99)                                     Page no. 41 of 43
 the complainant that the accused no. 5 being authorised signatory of the 

accused no. 1 was in charge of and responsible to the accused no. 1 and the 

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_144">section 138</a> of Act 26 of 1881 in respect of three 

cheques has been committed by his connivance, consent and neglect.  After 

going through the evidence on record, particularly documents Ex. PW1/5, 

Ex. PW1/6 and Ex. PW1/7, I am unable to agree with the contention of the 

learned counsel for the complainant.  As I have already found the accused 

no. 5 was not holding any managerial position in the accused no. 1 and in 

the documents addressed by him to the complainant he had never claimed 

himself holding such position.  In respect of the three cheques involved in 

this case in respect of which the offence has been committed the only role 

played by the accused no. 5 appears to be that alongwith the three cheques 

he had sent letter Ex. PW1/7 to the complainant wherein it was mentioned 

that the three cheques were being sent towards payment.  Nothing has come 

on record to show that the accused no. 5 was in control of the finances of 

the accused no. 1 and the operation of bank account whereupon the three 

cheques were drawn.   In the considered opinion of the court having sent 

letter Ex. PW1/7 the accused no. 5 cannot be held to be in connivance or a 

consenting party in the commission of offence by the accused no. 1.  Since 

the accused no. 5 is not proved to having control over the finance of the 

accused no. 1, therefore, it cannot be held that the commission of offence 

by  the  accused  no.  1  in  respect of the  three  cheques  or  any  of them is

 attributable to him.  In these circumstances in the light of the evidence led 

by the parties and the law declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in K.K. 

Ahuja's case  (supra) the accused no. 5 cannot be held guilty for having 

committed   offence   punishable   under   <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_145">section   138</a>   of   Act   26   of   1881   in
