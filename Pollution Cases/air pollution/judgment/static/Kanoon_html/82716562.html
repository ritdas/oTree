<p id="p_112">    THESE      PETITIONS   COMING      ON     FOR
ORDERS/PRELIMINARY HEARING THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE
MADE THE FOLLOWING:
</p>
<p id="p_113">                           ORDER

      We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the

petitioners and the learned counsel appearing for the

Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (for short 'KSPCB').
</p>

<p id="p_114">      2.     In W.P.Nos.5847, 5808, 5495, 5562, 5132, 5146,

5502, 5151, 5684, 5755 and 5847 of 2020, there is a challenge

to the notices issued at Annexure-'A' by which, demands for

interim    environmental   compensation       or   environmental

compensation charges based on the orders of the National

Green Tribunal have been made. Similarly, in W.P.Nos.5446

and 5456 of 2020, there is a challenge to Annexures-'Q' and 'L'

respectively wherein the challenge is same.
</p>

<p id="p_115">      3.     The demand of environmental compensation

charges is based on the orders dated 10th July 2019 and 14th

November 2019 in O.A.No.1038/2018 and the order dated 11th
</p><p id="p_116">                                    - 14 -
</p>


<p id="p_117">January 2019 in O.A.No.95/2018. The copies of the said orders

along        with     the   memo    are     placed   on   record   in

W.P.No.5495/2020. After going through the said orders, we

find that no direction has been issued by the National Green

Tribunal against KSPCB or State Pollution Control Boards to

recover or demand environmental compensation whether

interim or otherwise, or environmental compensation charges.
</p>
<p id="p_118">When we called upon the learned counsel appearing for

KSPCB to point out any such direction issued by the National

Green Tribunal or a specific provision under the provisions of

the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for

short 'the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>'), the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (for short 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>')              and the

Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986 (for short 'the said Act of

1986'), which authorizes State Pollution Control Boards to

claim or demand such amount, the learned counsel is unable to

show any provision or direction of National Green Tribunal to

justify the demand for interim environment compensation or

environmental compensation charges.
</p>

<p id="p_119">        4.          In any case, the impugned notices which are

referred above do not state that any statutory power has been

exercised by the KSPCB for making the demands. Therefore,
</p><p id="p_120">                                - 15 -
</p>


<p id="p_121">the demands cannot be sustained. Moreover, no opportunity of

being heard was granted to the petitioners before quantifying

the demands. Hence, impugned demands cannot be sustained.
</p>

<p id="p_122">         5.    However, we must make it clear that if the

petitioners have committed any default in compliance with the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water Act</a> and the said Act of

1986 or any Rules framed under the said statutes, it will be the

obligation of the KSPCB to initiate action in accordance with

law.
</p>

<p id="p_123">         6.    With the above observations and clarification, we

pass the following order:
</p>
<p id="p_124">         (i) The impugned demands for interim environmental

compensation or for environmental compensation charges are

hereby set aside only on the ground of the failure to justify the

demands by referring to any statutory provisions or any binding

order;
</p>
<p id="p_125">         (ii) Notwithstanding the aforesaid direction of setting

aside of the orders of demand, it will be the obligation of the

KSPCB to take action in accordance with law in the event the

petitioners have committed violation of the provisions of the Air

<p id="p_127">Act or the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water Act</a> or the said Act of 1986 or any Rules or

order made under the said statutes;
</p>
<p id="p_128">      (iii) The writ petitions are disposed of on the above

terms.
