<p id="p_1">(Judgment Delivered by the Bench)


This is an application filed under <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_1">Section 14</a> of the National Green
Tribunal Act 2010 challenging the Order dated 16.11.2011 issued by the
Puducherry Pollution Control Committee, Pondicherry under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_2">Section 31-</a>
A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution ) Act, 1981 directing
the Applicant to stop all the manufacturing activities until the three
directions mentioned therein are complied with.
</p>

<p id="p_2">At the outset, we may notice that against the order made under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_3">Section
31-A</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981, an appeal
is provided under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_5">Section 31</a> of the said Act which reads as under:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_6">Section 31</a> -- "Appeals.--(1) Any person aggrieved by an
       order made by the State Board under this Act may, within
       thirty days from the date on which the order is communicated
       to him, prefer an appeal to such authority (hereinafter referred
       to as the Appellate Authority) as the State Government may
       think fit to constitute:
</blockquote>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                Page 2 of 6</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              Provided that the Appellate Authority may entertain the appeal
             after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if such
             authority is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by
             sufficient cause from filing the appeal in time.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             (2) The Appellate Authority shall consist of a single person or
             three persons as State Government may think fit to be
             appointed by the State Government.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             (3) The form and the manner in which an appeal may be
             preferred under sub-section (1), the fees payable for such appeal
             and the procedure to be followed by the Appellant Authority
             shall be such as may be prescribed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">             (4) On receipt of an appeal preferred under sub-section (1), the
             Appellate Authority shall, after giving the appellant and the
             State Board an opportunity of being heard, dispose of the appeal
             as expeditiously as possible."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">Under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_7">Section 31</a> of Air Act, an effective remedy of appeal against the Order
made by the Authority under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">section 31-A</a> of the Air Act is available. When
this Tribunal expressed doubt as to the maintainability of the appeal, the
Learned Counsel for the Applicant drawn our attention to the provisions of
<a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_9">Section 2</a> (m) and 14 of the NGT Act which reads as under:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      "<a href="/doc/171522666/" id="a_10">Section 2(m)</a>-"substantial question relating to environment" shall
      include an instance where, --
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       (i)       there is a direct violation of a specific statutory
                 environmental obligation by a person by which,--
                 (A) the community at large other than an individual or
                         group of individuals is affected or likely to be affected
                         by the environmental consequences; or
                 (B) the gravity of damage to the environment or
                         property is substantial; or
                 (C) the damage to public health is broadly measurable."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      14. Tribunal to settle disputes.--- (1) The Tribunal shall have the
      jurisdiction over all civil cases where a substantial question relating
      to environment (including enforcement of any legal right relating to
      environment), is involved and such question arises out of the
      implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I.
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       Page 3 of 6</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">              (2) The Tribunal shall hear the disputes arising from the
             question s referred to in sub-section (1) and settle such
             disputes and pass order thereon."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">And submitted that this Tribunal has been conferred with vast powers and
the application of this nature is maintainable since a substantial question of
law had arisen for the consideration of the Tribunal. According to him, the
Appellate Authority is not a regular Tribunal which conducts sittings on
day to day basis. The Appellate Authority sits periodically once in a month
or once in two months, therefore, the appeal under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_11">Section 31</a> of the Air Act
is not an effective remedy. Further, Section 14 of the NGT Act contemplates
that this Tribunal can entertain any application and assume jurisdiction
over all civil cases where a substantial question relating to environment
(including enforcement of any legal right relating to environment), is
involved. According to the Learned Counsel, the order passed by the
authority under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_12">Section 31-A</a>, arises under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_13">Air Act</a> which is one of the Acts
enumerated in Schedule 1 of the NGT Act and the order of the authority
under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_14">Section 31-A</a> is arbitrary, atrocious and illegal. If the appeal is not
entertained within a reasonable time say one or two weeks, the Applicant
would suffer irreparable loss and injury. There is no impediment in
entertaining this Application under Section 14 of the NGT Act, since, for the
protection of the Applicant's interest, there is no remedy available.
</blockquote><p id="p_3">Therefore, the factual position of non-availability of an effective remedy
itself is a substantial question of law apart from other legal grounds raised
for assuming jurisdiction by this Tribunal. The Tribunal can at least make
some interim arrangement protecting the interest of the Applicant before an
appeal is entertained by the Authority under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_15">Section 31</a> of the Air Act.
Absolutely, there is no bar for this Tribunal to entertain a Application of this
nature. The jurisdiction of this Tribunal is inclusive and not exhaustive
when <a href="/doc/840666/" id="a_16">Section 2</a> (m) is read with Section 14 of the NGT Act. If the impugned
order is not stayed, the legal rights of the applicant arising under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_17">Air
Act</a> are jeopardized. If the applicant industry is closed for indefinite time, it
will not only suffer economic loss but the hundred and odd employees
working will be put to hardship.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   Page 4 of 6</span>
<p id="p_4"> Further, according to the learned counsel for the applicant, when the matter
was earlier considered by the authority and directed for closure of the
industry, the applicant had to approach the Hon'ble High Court of Madras
by way of filing writ petitions and on both the occasions, the Hon'ble High
Court was pleased to allow the writ petition by setting aside the order
passed by the authority. This is the third time a similar impugned order is
passed. Therefore, the remedy available to the Applicant cannot said to be
both efficacious and alternative remedy. Apart from this, the learned
counsel also raised certain questions virus of the Act on the ground that the
delegation of powers under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_18">Section 31-A</a> of the Act, etc.


We are afraid; we may not be able to agree with the submissions made by
the learned counsel for the Applicant. The National Green Tribunal is a
statutory Tribunal and it cannot examine the virus challenged of any act or
provision thereof. It is for the constitutional courts to examine such matters.
A statutory Tribunal can interpret the provisions of law with which it is
supposed to deal with. Therefore, we cannot go into the questions raised by
the Applicant such as:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">      "Whether essential powers and functions of the Central Pollution
      Control Board under the Act can be delegated to the respondent
      Committee which is constituted under <a href="/doc/181903687/" id="a_19">Section 11</a> of the Air
      (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_20">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981. Whether the
      exercise of such powers by the Respondent Committee under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_21">Section
      31-A</a> amounts to excessive delegation beyond the scope of delegation
      etc."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">Apart from this, against the impugned order, an appeal is provided under
<a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_22">Section 31</a> of the Air Act., as noticed above. Merely because the appellate
authority under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_23">Section 31</a> of the Air Act conducts sittings periodically, this
Tribunal cannot assume jurisdiction under Section 14 of the NGT Act. The
question of entertaining a Application under Section 14 of the NGT Act,
bypassing the effective appeal provided under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_24">section 31</a> of the Air Act does
not arise. In fact, against an order passed by the Appellate Authority under

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   Page 5 of 6</span>
 <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_25">Section 31</a> of the Air Act, an appeal is provided under <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_26">Section 16</a> (f) of the
NGT Act which reads as under:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">      16. Tribunal to have appellate jurisdiction: -- Any person
           aggrieved by.......
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">      (f) "An order or decision made, on or after the commencement of the
           <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_27">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010, by the Appellate Authority
           under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_28">Section 31</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_29">Control of
           Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (14 of 1981)".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">Thus, entertaining an application of this nature amounts to allowing the
Applicant to jump the statutory appeal which is not permissible under the
law. Unless, all the forum available under the Act are exhausted by the
Applicant including the appeal under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_30">Section 31</a> of Air Act, it cannot
approach this Tribunal directly -- whatever, may be the merits and the
questions of Law raised and arise for consideration. This Tribunal being
statutory in its nature, cannot entertain the Applicant of this nature much
less any substantial question of law has arisen under Section 14 of the NGT
Act for consideration. Therefore, we are of the considered opinion that the
Application is not maintainable and being devoid of merits and is liable to
be dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_7">Accordingly, the Application stands dismissed at admission stage itself.</p><pre id="pre_2">
