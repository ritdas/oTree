(BY SRI H V DEVARAJU, ADVOCATE FOR R-1;
 SRI GURURAJ JOSHI, ADVOCATE FOR R-2)


      THESE WRIT APPEALS ARE FILED UNDER SECTION 4
OF THE KARNATAKA HIGH COURT ACT PRAYING TO SET
ASIDE THE ORDER DATED 19/06/2019 PASSED BY THE
LEARNED SINGLE JUDGE IN W.P.NOS.23084-23087/2019
[GM-KEB]     AND     CONSEQUENTLY        ALLOW     THE    ABOVE
APPEALS.

      THESE WRIT APPEALS COMING ON FOR                   ORDERS
THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:

                              JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant, the

learned counsel appearing for the first respondent and the learned

counsel appearing for the second respondent.       The matter is

taken up for final hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2.     The learned counsel appearing for the appellant

submitted that the land in Survey No.72/1 was not the subject

matter of the order dated 27th April 2018 passed by the second

respondent in exercise of the powers under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_1">Section 33(A)</a> of the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     3</span>




</p><p id="p_4">      3.     Today, a memo is filed by the learned counsel

appearing for the first respondent stating that the land in Survey

No.72/1 and other four survey numbers were not incorporated in

the order dated 27th April 2019 by oversight and therefore, the

order dated 27th April 2019 has been corrected by incorporating

the correct survey numbers including the land in Survey No.72/1.


</p><p id="p_5">      4.     The electricity supply to the building on the land in

Survey No.72/1 was disconnected only on the basis of the order

dated 27th April 2019. Now it is an accepted position that the

order dated 27th April 2019 passed by the second respondent did

not relate to the land in Survey No.72/1. Therefore, it follows that

the electricity supply disconnected only on the basis of the order

dated 27th April 2019 will have to be restored.


</p><p id="p_6">      5.     The    learned      counsel   appearing   for   the   first

respondent states that the said respondent will take necessary

action on the basis of the amended order in accordance with law

after notice to the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      6.     The learned counsel appearing for the appellant

states that except for the aforesaid relief of restoration of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4</span>


electricity supply in respect of the building in Survey No.72/1, he is

not pressing for any other relief in the appeals inasmuch as the

remedy of the appellant is elsewhere.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">      7.     Accordingly, we dispose of the appeals by passing

the following order:
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">      (i) The appropriate remedy of the appellant, as observed in

the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Single

Judge, will remain open;
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      (ii) We direct the first respondent to forthwith restore the

electricity supply to the appellant's building in the land bearing

Survey No.72/1 situated at Kasavanahalli Village, Varthur Hobli,

Bengaluru East Taluk, Bengaluru Urban District;


</p><p id="p_15">      (iii) We make it clear that it will be open for the appellant to

challenge the Corrigendum dated 12th July 2019 in accordance

with law;
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">      (iv) It will be also open for the first respondent to take action

on the basis of the said Corrigendum in accordance with law;


</p><p id="p_18">      (v) The appeals are disposed of on the above terms.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span>




      The pending interlocutory application does not survive and

is accordingly disposed of.

</p><p id="p_21">                                         CHIEF JUSTICE
