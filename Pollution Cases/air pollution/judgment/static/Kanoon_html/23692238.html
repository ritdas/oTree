install or run any crusher in any area within the State of Haryana unless he

obtains a licence or gets his licence renewed from the Director under the

Act on such terms and conditions as may be prescribed. He further submits

that <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_16">Section 4</a> of the Act deals with the grant or refusal of a licence and

<a href="/doc/151428175/" id="a_17">Section 12</a> provides that in case of violation of any of the provisions of

<a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_18">Section 3</a> of the Act, the violator shall be punished with imprisonment for a

terms which may extend to two years and shall also be liable to pay a fine to

the extent of `10,000/-. He further argued that the power to grant licence

or its refusal is provided under Rule 4 and terms and conditions of the

licence is provided under Rule 5. Counsel for the petitioner has argued that

Rule 5 has three parts i.e. Rule 5(I) licence has to be issued subject to the

terms and conditions mentioned in the said provision; Rule 5 (2) the

Director has been given powers to impose any other conditions to under

Rule 5(I) and Rule 5(3) in case the licensee commits a breach of any

condition, the Director may cancel the licence but before cancelling the

licence, he shall have to issue notice to the licensee requiring him to remedy

the breach within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice and if the

breach is not remedied within such period, then the licence can be

cancelled. It is argued that in the present case, firstly, letting out of the

stone crusher to an entity having no licence to operate/ run the stone crusher

was not a condition of the licence which could have been otherwise laid

down by the Director, in terms of Rule 5(2), if it was not provided in the

rules in terms of Rule 5(I) and secondly, the petitioner had rectified the

breach of letting out the premises to an entity having no licence, within 30

days from the date of receipt of show cause notice by cancellation of the

rent deed executed in favour of its tenant i.e. M/s Shiv Grit Suppliers. It is

also submitted that once there was no breach, the Director could not have

initiated the proceedings again as it had no jurisdiction much less the power

to review its earlier decision.

<p id="p_17">             He has relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of

Gurjinder Singh and another Vs. State of Punjab and another, 2016(3)

R.C.R. (Civil) 342; and the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Assistant

Commissioner, Income Tax, Rajkot Vs. Saurashtra Kutch Stock

<p id="p_18">             On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

respondent has submitted that the licence was given to the petitioner to run

the stone crusher owned by him and it could not have let it out to somebody

not holding a valid licence which is required in terms of <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_19">Section 3</a> of the

Act. The petitioner knew that the tenant will operate the stone crusher in

his own name. It is submitted that the action has been taken because of an

information by the CEC appointed in terms of the order passed by the

Supreme Court in the Bandhua Mukti Morcha's case (supra). However,

he could not deny that there was no condition in the licence that if the

petitioner lets out his premises to an entity having no licence to operate then

his licence shall be cancelled. He also could not deny that the order passed

by the Director, Mines and Geology Department, Haryana on 20.09.2018

(Annexure P-7) rectifying the mistake committed by the petitioner was open

to challenge by way of an appeal or even by way of a writ petition but no

such proceedings were carried out and the said order was allowed to become

final. He also could not deny that after the dispute between the parties had

already came to an end by the order dated 20.09.2018 (Annexure P-7), the

same authority had no jurisdiction to review its earlier order to start

proceedings de novo specially when the power of review is not conferred

upon it by the statute.
</p>
<p id="p_19">             We have heard counsel for the parties and perused the record

with their able assistance.
</p>
<p id="p_20">             The first question which requires consideration as to whether a

licence issued under <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_20">Section 3</a> of the Act can be cancelled under Rules 5(3)

of the Rules if there is no breach of condition on the part of the licensee? In

the present case, the licence was issued to the petitioner with the conditions

mentioned under Rule 5 (1). It is an admitted case that the petitioner did not

violate any of the conditions mentioned in Rule 5 (1). It is also an admitted

position that the Director / respondent No.2, who though had the

jurisdiction to impose further conditions at the time of issuance of licence

but in the present case, there is no such condition imposed by respondent

No.2 that in case the licensee lets out the premises (stone crusher) to a

tenant who does not have a valid licence issued under <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_21">Section 3</a> of the Act

then the licence issued to the licensee shall be cancelled. Thus, in view

thereof, the first question is hereby decided to the effect that if the licensee

has not violated the conditions imposed under Rule 5(I) of the Rules then

his licence cannot be cancelled.       The second question would be as to

whether a licencee commits a breach of condition which is imposed under

Rule 5(I) and remedy the breach within a period of 30 days of

the issuance of notice by the Director, whether the Director would still have

the jurisdiction to cancel the licence? A plain and simple reading of Rule

5(3) is the answer to this question in which it is provided that licensee to

whom the licence has been given with certain conditions may breach some

of the conditions but the scheme of the rules provides that if a show cause

notice is given or breach committed by the licensee is brought to its notice

by the Director and licensee rectifies the breach or remedy it within a period

of 30 days from the date of receipt of notice then its licence cannot be

cancelled.   In the present case, show cause notice was given to the

petitioner, intimating it that it had let out the premises (stone crusher) to an

entity as a tenant, having no valid licence issued under <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_22">Section 3</a> of the Act

to operate. As soon as the petitioner came to know about its mistake, it

cancelled the lease executed in favour of its tenant and retrieved the

possession of the stone crusher from him and did not allow him to operate

any further. In such circumstances, the Director had no jurisdiction to

cancel the licence. The third question would be as to whether the order

dated 20.09.2018 (Annexure P-7) passed by the Director, allowing the

remedy of the breach, if any, and in the meantime, on 11.06.2019, licence of

the petitioner was further renewed from 26.03.2019 to 25.03.2022 by the

Director, himself, the said order can be challenged by reopening the same

issue?
</p>
<p id="p_21">             In this regard, we are of the considered opinion that the

doctrine of finality of the order shall apply to this case because the order

was open to challenge by way of an appeal or by way of a writ petition

before this Court but the respondent did not choose to challenge the order

dated 20.09.2018 which had become final between the parties. The next

question shall be as to whether respondent No.2 has acted beyond his

jurisdiction in reopening of the case in the garb of review? It is well-settled

that power of review is not inherent. In this regard, the judgments relied

upon by the counsel for the petitioner, referred herein above, are applicable

and therefore, we hold that if the authorities do not have the statutory power

of review, it cannot review its own order by exercising inherent power. The

last question would be as to whether the petitioner has a remedy of an

appeal in terms of the provisions of <a href="/doc/51052032/" id="a_23">Section 10</a> of the Act? In this regard,

counsel for the petitioner has submitted that though the remedy is there but

the said remedy is useless because the appeal shall lie before the Secretary

of the Department, whereas, the impugned order has been passed by

respondent No.2 after taking his approval.
</p>
<p id="p_22">             Thus, we are of the considered opinion that in such

circumstances, the writ petition filed by the petitioner is maintainable.

Hence, in view of the above discussion, the writ petition is allowed and the

impugned order dated 06.08.2020 (Annexure P-11) is hereby quashed

though without any costs.
