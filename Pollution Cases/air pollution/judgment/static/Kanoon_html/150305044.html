</p><p id="p_3">    1. The above applications were filed in NGT against the

       proposed widening of sectoral roads involving cutting of

       number of trees in front of National Media Centre (NMC).

       The Project Proponents stated to be involved in the project

       are Haryana Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF Ltd.

       The main contention of the applicants is that there will be

       significant air and noise pollution problems due to

       movement of traffic in the area due to cutting of trees

       which were acting as a buffer and reducing noise &amp; dust

       pollution.   Incidentally, an email was received by NGT

       from Haryali Welfare Society addressed to the Hon'ble

       Chief Minister of Haryana and the Copy was sent to NGT

       raising the similar issues pertaining to the cutting of trees

       by DLF/HUDA, which was treated as an Application no.

       120/2013. Regarding this Application No. 120/2013, NGT

       passed the order restraining the Respondents from

       cutting/felling or uprooting any tree on the site in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 5</span>
   question on 2/08/2013. Besides these two applications,

  other two applications were registered i.e. Application No.

  156/2013 filed by Mrs. Krishan Devi and Application No.

  155/2013 filed by Mr. Rajpal Yadav &amp; Ors. VS Union of

  India &amp; Ors.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2. The applicants have mentioned that there have been

  violations of numerous environmental obligations by the

  Respondents in respect of road widening project in

  Gurgaon being undertaken by Respondent no. 8 (DLF) and

  Respondent no. 5 (HUDA). The applicants have stated in

  their applications that there is NH-8 passing close to the

  National Media Centre (hereinafter referred to as "NMC")

  which is a housing society in which the applicants are

  residing. The area of NMC is about 2 acres having 200

  meters of length and 50 meters of width. The plot of 2

  acres was stated to be owned by the society.     However,

  when the licence was issued by the State of Haryana

  (Respondent No.3), it was mentioned that the said area

  shall be retained as green belt.        According to the

  applicant, there were 111 trees of various species and

  sizes with 51 trees of above 20 feet height. The contention

  of the applicant is that respondent no. 8 (DLF) has

  obtained right on the said 2 acres of land to expand the

  slip road appurtenant to NH-8 into their own projects and

  properties which are next to the NMC. Even though the

  slip road is adjacent to National Highway but the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                           6</span>
   extension of the slip road is being done privately by

  Respondent no. 8 for its own private use and for the

  purpose of making value addition of its own properties. It

  is alleged by the Applicant that this project will increase

  value of DLF property but is being undertaken by HUDA

  in a 50:50 participation basis. The Applicants submit that

  in order to achieve the goal of expanding the slip road, the

  Respondent No. 8, is seeking to destroy the entire green

  belt and to achieve the said purpose is removing the trees

  from the said plot of land.        The entire extended 8 lanes

  fall upon the 50 meters green belt and would thereby

  destroy all trees on the said green belt which acts as a

  buffer against vehicular pollution. It is averred that the

  destruction of green belt would expose the residents to

  severe and incessant pollution which is likely to cause

  respiratory diseases as well as cancer, with the elderly and

  children being more prone to the ill effects.

</p><p id="p_5">3. Another   Applicant,    Haryali     Welfare   Society   through

  Application    No.      120/2013,      has     submitted     that

  maintaining of green belt is a part of Para 4.2 of the

  National Forest Policy, 1988, which provides that green

  belt should be raised in urban/industrial areas as well as

  in arid tracts. The policy also provides for modifying the

  laws   wherever   necessary     to    facilitate   and   motivate

  individual institution to undertake tree farming. Further,

  in <a href="/doc/887036/" id="a_1">Lafarge Umiam Mining (P) Ltd. v. Union of India</a> (2011)


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              7</span>
 7 SCC 338, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the

principles/guidelines mentioned in the National Forest

Policy, 1988 should be read as part of the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 read together with the

<a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_3">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980.        According to the

applicant there is no requirement of widening of road from

60 meters to 78 meters from NH-8 to Sector-55 &amp; 56 in

Gurgaon. Also an accusation has been made by the

applicants that the land available for compensatory

plantation or the type of trees which will be planted by the

HUDA is doubtful and without looking at the availability of

land with HUDA, the Forest Department simply granted

permission for cutting down 1055 trees in April 2012 for

the purpose of the widening of the aforementioned road.

The counsel for the applicants has also raised the

requirement of seeking EC under the EIA Notification

2006 for the said project of widening of sectoral road. Ld.

Counsel for the applicant has, further, submitted that the

said road widening project has been done in the green belt

area and no new green belt areas are being developed and

already existing green belt areas are being shown as the

areas for compensatory plantation works indicating that

we are losing the green belt area for developmental works

but not adding any further areas to be compensated for

the losses of the green belt.    In addition, there is no

disclosure of the location of 246 transplanted trees and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                          8</span>
   their status about survival and the Forest Department has

  not verified the same.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4. While hearing the applications, the NGT felt the need of

  directing vide its order dated 06/01/2014 to the State of

  Haryana to file a specific affidavit to the effect as to

  whether the disputed land forms part of the extent of

  1,54,706 hectares of land which includes 12,527.94

  hectares stated to have been declared as forest land by the

  Government of Haryana.         In addition to that the Ld.

  Additional Advocate General under took to produce copy

  of the affidavits before NGT which were filed before the

  Hon'ble Supreme Court on earlier occasion. In a written

  statement of Sh. SR Jotriwal, Principal Chief Conservator

  of Forest (PCCF), Haryana, it has been submitted that the

  land in question is a green belt maintained by Haryana

  Urban Development Authority where avenue plantations

  were raised by HUDA on either side of the HUDA sector

  road connecting National Highway No. 8 to HUDA sector

  55/56 of Gurgaon. The said green belt in question has

  never been treated or maintained in Government record as

  forest and is not a part of 1,54,706 hectares of land

  including 11513/12527.94 hectares of land notified under

  section 4 and 5 of       The Punjab Land Preservation Act

  (PLPA),   1900   as   mentioned    in   the   affidavit   dated

  8/12/1996 filed by the PCCF, Haryana in the Hon'ble

  Supreme Court in civil writ petition number 171 of 1996


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             9</span>
 in the case titled <a href="/doc/1264331/" id="a_4">Environmental Awareness Forum vs

State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and others</a>.          It has further

been submitted by the PCCF, Haryana that the Forest

Department has no jurisdiction or control on the said land

except for giving permission for felling of trees on the land

in question.   It is seen from the document submitted

before NGT that HUDA had written to the Forest

Department on 24/11/2011 and 25/11/2011 seeking

permission for cutting of 1080 Nos. of trees including

transplantation of trees in respect of the upgradation of 60

meter wide road adjacent to NH-8 in Sector 55-56,

Gurgaon for which the work was awarded to M/s DLF Ltd.

The Forest Department on 22 March 2012 has accorded

permission for transplantation of 236 trees with certain

conditions.     The   Forest   Department     also   granted

permission on 4/4/2012 for felling of 1055 trees under

Section 4 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900 with

a condition that 10 times of the trees felled be planted at

owners cost and preferably on owners land which will be

monitored by the Forest Department. It also stated in its

permission that out of 1055 trees, there are 246 trees

falling in Misc. categories such as Eucalyptus, Poplar, etc.

which are exempted and need no permission.                 A

notification dated 28/11/1997 was brought out by the

Forest Department which is valid for the period of 15 years

from the date of its publication in the official gazette for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                          10</span>
   the specified areas that the cutting of trees or timber

  except Eucalyptus and Poplar or the collection or removal

  or subjection to any manufacturing process of any forest

  produce other than flower, fruit and honey, are allowed for

  bonafide domestic or agricultural purposes to the right

  holders in the land, provided that the owners of the land

  may sell trees or timber after obtaining permit to do so

  from the Forest Department. This notification was valid

  for 15 years from the date of its publication in the official

  gazette which has expired on 27/11/2012, and it is not

  known from the records available to us as to whether the

  notification/order dated 28/11/1997 has been further

  extended or not.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5. The horticultural division of HUDA of Gurgaon has

  intimated to the Range Forest Department, Gurgaon on

  3/7/2013 that 11000 number of plants of various species

  have been planted/being planted by HUDA in the various

  sectors which include sector 9A Gurgaon, Sector 31, STP

  plant area in Gurgaon, Sector 90, 91, 92 in Gurgaon and

  Sector 53 in Gurgaon and photographs of afforestation

  were also submitted. It is seen from the photographs that

  mostly champa plants (smaller trees) have been planted

  which doesn't provide proper green cover and is of

  basically ornamental nature.        As such, it may not serve

  the purpose of green belt which is expected to provide

  coverage at 3 levels i.e.        Lower level, middle level and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                              11</span>
      upper level. In fact, this has been one of the contentions

     of the Ld. Counsel Mr. Rahul Choudhary for the Appellant

     No. 120/2013 that HUDA has mainly planted champa

     trees and such other species which do not provide proper

     green coverage to cover the 3 levels and the species

     planted can be cut without seeking permission from the

     Forest Department, thereby defeating the aims and

     objectives of the purpose of compensatory afforestation.

     The Ld. Counsel for the applicant Haryali Welfare Society

     also submitted that HUDA/DLF require EC for the road

     widening project and as the area under construction is

     more than 20,000 sq. meters, he felt that the provisions as

     given in the Schedule of the EIA notification, 2006 under

     7(f) and 8(a) be read together and as such EC would be

     needed for the said project.               He also emphasised that

     under the Forest Policy, it is necessary as per para 4.2 to

     maintain green belt in the urban areas, especially para

     4.2.2 which reads as below:
</p>
<p id="p_8">
"It is necessary to encourage the planting of trees alongside

of roads, railway lines, rivers and streams and canals, and

on      other   unutilised      lands           under     State/corporate,

institutional or private ownership.               Green belts should be

raised in urban/industrial areas as well as in arid tracks.

Such     a   programme       will        help    to   check   erosion   and

desertification as well as improve the microclimate."                   But




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                    12</span>
 then the Forest Policy has not been statutorily recognised so

as to make it enforceable.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">6. Ld. Counsel Mr. Rahul Choudhary for the applicant has

  also argued that HUDA has not indicated any new areas

  where green belt will be provided as also the details of the

  plant species to be planted have not been given.           Also,

  there is no averment made by the Forest Department with

  respect to the monitoring of the stipulated conditions

  which were provided by them during the time of according

  permission for cutting of various trees.
</p>
<p id="p_11">7. Mr. Rahul Choudhary, Ld. Adv. has also cited the NGT

  judgement dated 08/04/2013 passed in Application No.

  15/13    (P.B.   No.   13/2011   THC)      in   the   matter    of

  Association of Socio Environmental Assistance &amp; Action

  Vs Union of India, wherein the need of raising green belt

  was emphasised and project proponent was directed to

  provide the same failing which the project proponent was

  made liable to pay a compensation of Rs. 5 crores.

</p><p id="p_12">8. Mr. Chetan Chawla, Ld. Senior Adv. for the appellant

  contended that it is HUDA and the State Government that

  are answering the issues raised during the hearing and

  the DLF did not answer/ reply to the arguments on merit

  in respect of environmental concerns raised.                   The

  provision of Section 14 of the NGT Act are applicable in

  this case as water table is diminishing in Gurgaon and the

  provisions of The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution)


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                             13</span>
   Act, 1981 are also attracted due to the said widening of

  sectoral road project which may lead to air pollution

  creating noise problems to the residents of the area due to

  movement of vehicles. He also submitted that the

  prevailing ambient noise levels in the area which were

  already on higher side may further go up.
</p>
<p id="p_13">9. The Counsel for the respondents have however refuted

  the contentions made by the advocate for the applicant

  and stated that the relevant issues are not covered in the

  <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_5">Forest Conservation Act</a> 1986 as forest land is not

  involved in cutting of the green belt as also the provisions

  of the EIA Notification 2006 and EPA, 1986 are not

  attracted as no EC is required. However, the Advocate for

  the Applicant, disagreeing with the above submissions

  stated that India is signatory to a number of International

  Treaties and Conventions on environment and there are

  substantial questions of environment involved due to

  cutting of large number of trees and emissions of toxic

  gases from the vehicles which may have adverse effects on

  the residents of the area, especially on the NMC residents

  who are located in close proximity to the widening of

  sectoral road project. He vehemently opposed the project

  in question which he felt is against the protection provided

  to the citizens under the <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_6">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of

  India, which states that no person shall be deprived of his

  life or personal liberty except through the procedure


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                           14</span>
   established by law. Right to Life is one of the basic human

  right and not even the State has the authority to violate

  that right; <a href="/doc/1108032/" id="a_7">Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre v. State of

  Maharashtra, JT</a> 2010 (13) SC 247: (2010) 12 SCALE 691.

</p><p id="p_14">10. He, further, argued that about 150 trees have already

  been cut by DLF/HUDA and 75 trees are only left in the

  area in question. However, according to the Ld. Additional

  Advocate General, Haryana, only 26 trees are required to

  be cut.   Mr. Chetan Chawla, Ld. Senior Adv. for the

  appellant further stated that urban areas should have

  green belt as per para 4.2 of the National Forest Policy

  1988. He also cited Lafarge Case decided by the Hon'ble

  Supreme Court in I.A. NOs.1868, 2091, 2225-2227, 2380,

  2568 AND 2937 IN WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) No. 202 OF

  1995 highlighting the importance of green belt/cover and

  afforestation. He also cited NGT judgement on Goa

  Foundation in M.A. 49 of 2013 in Application No. 26 of

  2012 regarding maintainability in terms of the provisions

  of the NGT Act.    All cases where substantial question

  relating to environment and disputes are involved, they

  fall in the domain of NGT.
</p>
<p id="p_15">11. Mr. Narender Hooda, Ld. Sr. Adv. appearing for R-3, R-

  4, R-6, R-7 and R-10, has stated that in the matter of <a href="/doc/1725193/" id="a_8">T.N.

  Godavarman Thirumulkpad vs Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. on

  12 December, 1996, the State Government has informed

  to the Hon'ble Apex Court that about 12,000 hectares of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                           15</span>
   land is forest land in Haryana.        He clarified that the

  project in question does not fall under the category of the

  said forest land and as such the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_9">Forest

  Conservation Act</a>, 1980, are not attracted.      He, further,

  informed that the project is not falling under the Aravalli

  Notification of MoEF and is about 20 Km. away from the

  Sultanpur National Park.        The documents submitted by

  HUDA also indicate that the plants to be cut are not part

  of Aravalli Plantations. He, also stated that the provisions

  of the EIA Notification 2006, are also not applicable to the

  project in question as it does not fall under widening of

  the National Highways or State Highways. In fact the

  project   in   question   involves   the   widening   of   the

  Slip/sectoral road and at best the project is covered under

  The Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900 and for cutting of

  trees proper permission was taken under Section 4 of The

  Punjab Land Preservation Act.        In fact, Mr. Hooda, Sr.

  Adv. also raised the issue of maintainability of the

  application under Section 14 of the NGT Act as none of the

  Acts included under the Schedule given to the NGT Act,

  2010 are involved in this case.
</p>
<p id="p_16">12. Ms. Anubha Agrawal, Adv. for R-5(HUDA) informed the

  court that no forest land is involved for the project site in

  question and the land in the disputed site falls in the

  category of the green belt which is out of the purview of

  the forest land. EC is also not required from MoEF for the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                             16</span>
   widening of the side/ sectoral roads and she categorically

  stated that the project in question is not an extension of

  the National Highway or the State Highway. Efforts have

  already been made to save maximum number of trees

  possible and the plants/trees have been cut or proposed

  to be cut to the bare minimum and after taking proper

  permission from the Forest Department.            She, further,

  stated that the larger public interest is involved in the

  project in question and as such interest of individuals or

  small group of people may not be looked into as laid down

  by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. She also stated that the

  project in question is also out of the Aravalli Notification.

  Ld. Advocate for DLF has also expressed the similar views,

  akin to HUDA &amp; State Govt's views on the disputed site in

  question.
</p>
<p id="p_17">13. From the above averments and documents placed

  before us, basically the following issues are required to be

  settled in respect of the project in question:-

</p><p id="p_18">1. Whether the land falling in the widening of the side/

  sectoral road (project in question) is a forest land?

</p><p id="p_19">2. Whether required permission for cutting of trees was

  taken?
</p>
<p id="p_20">3. Whether the residents of the NMC will be affected due to

  the project in question?
</p>
<p id="p_21">4. Whether proper permission from environmental angle was

  obtained by the project proponent?
</p>
<p id="p_22">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                             17</span>
</p><p id="p_23"> 5. Whether   afforestation    work   has    been    proposed/

  undertaken in lieu of cutting of the trees at the site of the

  project in question?
</p>
<p id="p_24"> 14. Now we propose to address the above issues one by

    one.
</p>
<p id="p_25">  Issue No: 1

    It has been clearly stated by the Ld. Senior Counsel for

  Respondents- 3, 4, 6, 7 and 10 that the project site

  involving widening of the side road does not fall in the

  forest area as informed by the State Government to the

  Hon'ble Supreme Court.          Even though, the land in

  question is basically impinging on the green belt which

  was raised by the State Government as side road

  plantations for the purpose of raising green belt. However,

  it can be put to other uses after taking the required

  permission, including permission for cutting of trees. The

  documents filed to show that the land in question does

  not fall in the forest land are quite clear.     We hold no

  reason to that the land in question does not fall within the

  domain of the forest land and as such the provision of the

  <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_10">Forest Conservation Act</a>, 1980 are not attracted as has

  been categorically asserted by the Ld. Sr. Counsel of the

  State Government. The issue is answered accordingly.

  Issue No: 2

    According to the project proponent all efforts were made

  to save the trees but certain trees which are coming on the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                             18</span>
 way of alignment/widening of the said road cannot be

saved and are required to be cut (about 26 trees). He has

stated that efforts have been made/will be made to

transplant certain trees if it is feasible and for every tree

cut at least 10 trees will be planted as per the permission

obtained from the Forest Department. As permission has

already been obtained from the competent authority, while

answering the issue in favour of the respondents, we feel it

necessary to issue suitable directions for compensatory

afforestation.
</p>
<p id="p_26">Issue No: 3

  It has been stated by the Ld. Counsel for Applicants

that about 190 families are living for the last several years

in NMC and a green cover of 50 m. wide and 200 m. in

length existed which the project proponent started cutting

and it was pointed out by the Ld. Counsel for Applicant

that a number of trees have already been illegally cut. The

project proponent mentioned that as per the revised plan

only 26 trees will be required to be cut in front of the NMC

in the land which belongs to the Government. No tree will

be cut from the land belonging to the NMC which has

considerable width of green belt in front of the project in

question. Due to the widening of the slip road/ sectoral

road proposed to be undertaken, it is expected that the

same will result in smooth flow of traffic and as such the

congestion and traffic jams will be taken care of.      This


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                          19</span>
 may result in containing air and noise pollution which

would have otherwise been continued if no expansion or

widening of the sectoral road have been taken due to the

resultant congestion and slow movement of vehicles in the

area in question.
</p>
<p id="p_27">  Ambient noise levels encountered in the area are

exceeding the residential area standards as per the report

submitted by the Applicant which was measured on

05.02.2014    by    Shri    Ram    Analytical   Laboratory,

Ghaziabad.    Similarly, the report filed by HUDA on

ambient noise levels indicated that the noise levels were

found to exceed the prescribed standards. This report was

got prepared by M/s. Perfact Researchers Pvt. Ltd. which

is NABL accredited laboratory.    In both the reports, the

ambient noise levels in residential areas were found

exceeding the prescribed threshold limits. Therefore, we

feel that there is need to provide proper measures

including acoustical barriers to reduce vehicular noise so

as to minimise the adverse impact on the residents on

NMC and other human settlements of the nearby areas. In

view of this matter, we strongly feel that acoustic barriers

must be provided to safeguard nearby residents from the

noise pollution problems. In addition, wherever possible

plantation work must be taken up in close proximity of

the project in question as also in the other areas not very

far from the said project. By this process the noise level


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                           20</span>
 would be mitigated to the benefit of the residents. Issue

answered accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
Issue No: 4


  From    the   various        averments,   documents   and

submissions made before us, it is quite clear that for the

project in question EC is not required under the EIA

notification 2006.   Also no forest clearance is required

under the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_11">Forest Conservation Act</a>, 1980. The project is

also far away from Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary (about 20

km) and the provision of Aravalli Notification brought by

MOEF are also not attracted as the plants in question are

not part of Aravalli Plantations as per the records

submitted before us. However, permission is required to

be taken from the Forest Department for the cutting of

trees for which it was stated before us by the counsel for

the respondents that no tree will be cut without taking

proper permission and that afforestation work will be

undertaken in lieu of the trees which are required to be

removed as per the conditions stipulated by the regulatory

authority. Issue answered accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_29"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">Issue No. 5</span>

  It was stated by the Ld. Counsel appearing for the

Applicants that HUDA has cut number of trees in different

sectors and no proper afforestation work has been

undertaken by the HUDA or other concerned departments

which has resulted in considerable reduction of green

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                          21</span>
 cover in Gurgaon. According to him, the green cover left

in Gurgaon is only 3.8 per cent in the year 2010 and it

might   have    gone    further      down   due   to    massive

urbanisation policy of HUDA. He, further, mentioned that

3.8 per cent green cover in Gurgaon is against the State

Policy of having 20 per cent green cover which is even

much shorter of the requirement of 33 per cent of green

cover as per the National Forest Policy. Be that as it may,

there are no two opinions that there is need to have more

and more greenery in the urban areas where significant

concretisation/number of building structures have come

up in Gurgaon making it difficult for the residents to have

fresh air to breath.   We, therefore, call upon the Forest

Department and HUDA to make it compulsory that

environmental issues right from beginning at the project

planning   stage   itself   should    become   the     necessary

component of the project so that environmental and

forestry issues are addressed early and become an integral

part of the project.
</p>
<p id="p_30">   The concept of sustainable development is to be

considered in terms of the pressing requirement of

expanding infrastructure pertaining to transport sector.

Urban city roads/sectoral roads are required to be

expanded in order to avoid congestion and traffic jams due

to increased Vehicular population and are required to be

addressed by increasing the supportive and assimilating


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                            22</span>
 capacity of traffic movement in the area. While applying

the concept of sustainable development, one has to keep

in mind the "Principle of Proportionality" based on the

concept of balance and there is a need to have trade-off

between the development &amp; environment.            As such, we

have to balance the priorities of development on the one

hand and environmental problems on the other.                 So

sustainable development should address the requirement

of development that can be allowed and which can be

sustained by environment with or without any significant

adverse impacts, keeping in view the public interests

rather than the interests of handful of persons or group of

persons, according to a 'reasonable person's test'.

NGT in its recent judgement in Appeal No. 12/2012 in the

matter of M.P. Patil Vs. UOI &amp; Ors. has stated as below:-

"It has to be respectfully accepted as a proposition of law

that individual interest or, for that matter, smaller public

interest must yield to the larger public interest.

To an extent, there is a right to development. However,

even this right is not free of limitations and regulations. It

is not an unfettered right so as to completely give a go by

to the issues of environment. Development may be carried

out to satisfy the need of a developing society but it has to

be   regulated   so   as   to   satisfy   the   requirement   of

preservation and nurturing of the natural recourses,

which are the real assets of the society."
</p>
<p id="p_31">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                           23</span>
</p><p id="p_32"> 15. In the light of the above principles, we have to ensure

     that the widening of road project does not unduly affect

     the residents of nearby areas.
</p>
<p id="p_33">16. Traversing through the documents, affidavits, counter

     affidavits, and submissions made by the applicants and

     respondents     and   banking    upon   the   Principles   of

     Sustainable Development and recognising the need of the

     project in question which will serve the larger public

     interest by way of resulting in smoother flow of traffic, we

     are of the opinion that the project in question may be

     allowed subject to the environmental safeguard which

     would keep the likely adverse impacts to the bare

     minimum. We, therefore, feel that the following directions

     are required to be issued for implementation of the project

     without causing any significant adverse impacts on

     environment:-
</p>
<p id="p_34">1.     Afforestation work- The project proponent must have a

proper plan with time frame and financial commitment to

undertake afforestation work according to the permission

given by the Forest Department. Local plant species should

be preferred involving smaller, medium and larger trees to

be forming part of the green belt. The Forest Department

must ensure that the project proponent implement the

conditions so stipulated by them and the periodical check-

up/verification be undertaken. In case it is found that the

project proponent has done any violation with respect of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                              24</span>
   raising of green belt, a penalty upto Rs. 5 crore will be

  imposed on DLF/HUDA.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
  We direct HUDA to internalise environmental issues at the

  project planning stage and all efforts should be made to cut

  bare minimum number of trees and undertake massive

  afforestation works wherever possible in the urban areas.


      As was stated by Ld. Additional Advocate General,

  Haryana that not more than 26 trees will be cut in the area

  in question (in front of NMC) after re-orientation of

  alignment of sectoral road, we direct HUDA/DLF not to cut

  more than 26 trees in the project area.             The Forest

  Department    will   supervise   the   cutting   operation   and

  maintain record. They shall submit a status report on the

  total number of trees cut at the project site along with the

  details of afforestation done by the Project Proponent within

  six months.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">2. Noise Prevention- The project proponent should provide

  adequate and effective acoustic barrier in front of NMC and

  other nearby human settlements to avoid any noise

  pollution problems to the residents.      Also, this stretch of

  land in question be declared as "No Honking Zone".           The

  Haryana Pollution Control Board and Traffic Police through

  Superintendent of Police, Gurgaon, will ensure that such

  measures are provided and there is no violation of the noise

  standards as per the provision of The Air (Prevention and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                              25</span>

  Protection Act</a>, 1986.
</p>
<p id="p_38">3. Internalisation    of   Environmental    Issues-   In      order   to

  internalise environmental issues at the planning stage of the

  projects, it will be desirable for DLF &amp; HUDA to have an

  Environmental Adviser who            would   report to the top

  Executive, say Chairman or Managing Director so that

  environmental issues get addressed quickly by way of policy

  interventions and financial commitments at the initial stage

  of the projects.
</p>
<p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">       The above directions shall be implemented pari passu

  with the construction work of the proposed project.


</p><p id="p_41">       The applications are disposed of with the above

  directions.   The    concerned      Departments     shall     submit

  compliance report within 6 months before the Registry.
