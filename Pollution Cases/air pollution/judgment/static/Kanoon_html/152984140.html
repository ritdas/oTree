Mr. Shiv Pandey, Advocate holding brief of Mr. Aman Rab, Advocate for
respondent nos. 2 and 3.
</p><p id="p_2">Mr. Bhupendra Bisht, Advocate holding brief of Mr. D.S. Patni, Advocate
for respondent no. 4.
</p>

<p id="p_3">U.C. Dhyani, J (Oral)

              By means of present writ petition, the
petitioner seeks following reliefs, among others:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       (i)    to issue a writ, order or direction in the
       nature of certiorari quashing the sealing order
       dated 15.02.2016, issued by respondent no. 3,

Unit/Manufacturing processes with immediate effect in
exercise of powers conferred under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_1">Section 33(A)</a> of

1974.
</p>

<p id="p_5">3)         The learned counsel for the petitioner
contended, among other things, that there is a violation

giving any reasonable and proper opportunity of
hearing to the petitioner's company.
</p>

<p id="p_6">4)         It is also the submission of the learned
counsel for the petitioner that even before the judgment
dated 10.12.2015 so rendered by Hon'ble National
Green Tribunal (for short NGT), the consent by the
respondent Board was either granted or was being
processed. It is not a case in which the consent was
being processed after the judgment of Hon'ble NGT.
</p>

<p id="p_7">5)         It is also submitted that the Hon'ble NGT, in
its judgment has observed that industries, which are in
the process of complying with the directions issued by

Control Board (respondent Board herein) and/or are
installing Anti Pollution Devices like ETP or other

mechanism to ensure that trade effluent discharge by
them on land, drains, water bodies or any other places is
strictly complied with prescribed parameter would not
be closed and would be permitted to do the needful at
the earliest and in any case within three months.
</p>

<p id="p_8">6)          Learned counsel for the petitioner also
submitted that the respondents may also be directed to
restore the power supply and remove the seal of the
plant.
</p>

<p id="p_9">7)          Learned counsel for the respondent Board
submitted that Board is ready to re-consider the case of
the petitioner in accordance with law.
</p>

<p id="p_10">8)          Learned counsel for the parties stated before
this Court that writ petitions filed against similar
notices have already been allowed by this Court and
identical order can be passed.
</p>

<p id="p_11">9)          Writ petition is, accordingly, disposed of at
the admission stage itself by directing the petitioner to
make representation to the respondent Board within a
week, annexing therein copy of the writ petition, which
it has filed before this Court.
</p>

<p id="p_12">10)         The respondent Board is directed to decide
the representation of the petitioner and re-consider its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             4</span>




case by a reasoned and speaking order in accordance
with law within a period of two weeks of receipt
of representation. Notice dated 06.02.2016 shall be kept
in abeyance till then.
</p>

<p id="p_13">11)         Learned counsel for the respondent no. 2
submits that in case the petitioner represents its request
for removal of the seal of the plant as well as power
supply to the plant, in that event, power supply will be
restored within forty eight hours from the time of
supply of certified copy of the order as well as copy of
writ petition.
</p>

<p id="p_14">12)         Let a copy of this order be supplied to the
learned counsel for the parties today itself on payment
of usual charges.
