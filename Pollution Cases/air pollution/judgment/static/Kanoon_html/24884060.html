that the petitioners have been causing noise pollution by

exceeding the standards prescribed in Schedule III of the

Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986.             The allegations in this

regard are in para Nos.11, 12 and 13 of the complaint which are

extracted hereinbelow:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           11.      It is submitted that the Accused No.1
           Hotel has installed 2 Nos. of 1500 KVA DG
           Sets and also 2 Nos. of Hot Water Generators
           of capacity 6,00,000 Kilo Calories per Hour
           and 5 Nos. of Kitchen Exhaust Fans. The
           Accused No.1 Hotel has provided a complete
           acoustic measures to prevent noise generation
           from the DG Sets, whereas the 5 Exhaust
           Fans provided to Kitchen, during its operation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                           7</span>

generate noise pollution, and under such
circumstances, the Accused No.1 Hotel who is
using all these electrical equipments for trade
purpose is required to obtain consent for
operation under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_15">Section 21</a> of the Air Act. As
stated above, the first consent for operation
was issued on 29.1.2013 which was valid upto
30.6.2013 and thereafter, the consent has not
been renewed, and on the other hand, the
Accused No.1 Hotel has operated all those
machineries        and    plants     etc.,       thereby
contravening the provisions of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_16">Section 21</a> of
the   Air   Act    and    committed        an    offence
punishable under <a href="/doc/1296808/" id="a_17">Section 37</a> thereof. Further,
while issuing the consent for operation, the
Complainant Board has imposed condition to
the Accused No.1 Hotel that it shall maintain
the   noise   levels     during    night     time     i.e.,
55dB(A) Leq and 65 dB(A)             Leq. since the
Accused     No.1    Hotel     is   situated      in   the
commercial area as per the Bruhut Bangalore
Mahanagara Palike Master Plan.                  However,
towards Northern side of the said Accused
No.1 Hotel, there are residential houses and
the said area has been classified as residential
area and for residential area, the stipulated
noise level are 45 dB(A) Leq during night
time, and 55 dB(A) Leq during the day time.

on 30.06.2013, whereafter the petitioners have failed to apply

for renewal of the said consent, instead operated the hotel

without the requisite consent, thereby committed the offences

under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_18">section 25</a> of the Water Act, 1974 which are punishable

under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_19">section 44</a> thereof.

Act</a>, 1981) as per Schedule III of the Environment (Protection)

Rules, 1986, are concerned, the allegations are that the

admissible standard of noise level for commercial area during

daytime is 65 dB(A) Leq and night time is 55 dB(A) Leq, whereas

in the instant case, on the date of inspection on 5/6.12.2013,

the hotel run by the petitioners was found generating noise

exceeding 4.1 dB(A) Leq to 14.9 dB(A) Leq in violation of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  10</span>

Act</a>, 1974, the Board was bound to grant its consent in terms of

sub-clause (4)(a) or refuse such consent by virtue of sub-clause

(4)(b) by assigning reasons to be recorded in writing.       In the

instant case, till the date of initiation of criminal action, the

Board did not act on the application submitted by the petitioners

and therefore, by virtue of sub-clause (7) of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_26">section 25</a>, consent

is deemed to have been accorded by the Board. As a result,

there is no violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_27">section 25</a> of the Water

Act 1974 and hence, prosecution of the petitioners for the

alleged offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_28">section 44</a> of the Water Act,

1974 is legally untenable.

<a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_30">44</a> of the Water Act 1974. <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_31">Section 44</a> deals with a different

situation which is not subject matter of accusations in the instant

complaint.    Therefore, on this score also, initiation of criminal

action against the petitioners is legally untenable and an abuse

of process of court and is liable to be set at naught.


</p><p id="p_22">      (iii)   With regard to the allegations attracting the offences

under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_32">Air Act</a>, 1981 are concerned, learned counsel for the

petitioners has referred to the initial consent accorded by the

Board for establishment of the Hotel.         Clause V of the said

consent reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              NOISE POLLUTION CONTROL:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">              1      The applicant shall ensure that the
              ambient noise levels and ambient air quality
              within its premises during construction and
              after construction shall not exceed the limits
              specified in the Environment (Protection)
              Rules, i.e. 65dB(A) Leq. during day time and
              55 dB(A) Leq. during the night time.</blockquote><p id="p_23">


</p><p id="p_24">      (iv)    The contention of the learned Counsel is that the

consent was accorded for establishment of Hotel for commercial

purpose. The annexure appended to the said consent letter

specifically provided that the noise levels shall not exceed 65
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                  12</span>


dB(A) Leq. and 55 dB(A) Leq. during day time and night time

respectively.    The    notification   issued   by   the   Ministry   of

Environment and Forest dated 14.2.2000 prescribes that,               a

person may, if the noise level exceeds the ambient noise

standards by 10 dB(A) or more given in the corresponding

columns against any area/zone, make a complaint to the

authority. In the instant case, the inspection report relied on by

the Board indicates that at the time of inspection, the noise

generated in the Hotel was within the standard prescribed for

commercial purpose and therefore, on the face of it, the charges

levelled against the petitioners for the alleged offences under the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_33">Air Act</a> 1981 are legally untenable and are

liable to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">      6(i)   Meeting    the   above    arguments,    learned   counsel

appearing for the Board does not dispute the fact that

permission was granted to the petitioners - Hotel to carry on

commercial activities. However, he reiterates that at the time of

inspection, the noise generated by the petitioners - Hotel was

found to exceed the prescribed limit, as such, offence under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                     13</span>


<a href="/doc/1296808/" id="a_34">section 37</a> of Air Act 1981 has been committed and therefore

there is no reason to quash the complaint filed against the

petitioners for the said offence.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">       (ii)    Insofar as the offence under the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_35">Water Act</a> 1974 are concerned, learned counsel submits that the

consent accorded to the petitioners had expired on 30.06.2013.

Clause No.13 of the General Conditions required the applicant to

make an application for renewal of consent atleast 120 days

before expiry of consent. But, in the instant case, renewal

application was submitted only on 19.08.2013 in violation of

provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_36">section 25</a> of the Water Act 1974. As a result, with

effect from 01.07.2013, the petitioners are guilty of alleged

violation of provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_37">section 25</a> of the Water Act 1974,

rendering them liable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_38">section 44</a> of the said Act.


</p><p id="p_29">       (iii)   The learned counsel appearing for the Board has

seriously disputed the plea advanced by the learned counsel for

the petitioners based on the interpretation of <a href="/doc/1559088/" id="a_39">section 25(2)</a> and

(7).   It is the submission of the learned counsel that there is

nothing in the said section to suggest that the permission sought
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                         14</span>


by the applicants is deemed to have been accorded. On the

other    hand,       the   Act    prescribes     various   procedures   and

requirements to renew the consent. Therefore, question of

deemed consent does not arise at all. On the other hand, the

material on record shows that during the interregnum period

from 01.07.2013 to 19.08.2013, the petitioners have been

running the Hotel without consent and therefore a clear case for

prosecution for the offence under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_40">section 25</a> of the Water Act,

1974 is made out and hence, there is no ground to quash the

impugned proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_30">        (iv)   In support of his arguments, learned counsel for the

respondent has placed reliance on the observation of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court of India in <a href="/doc/1814230/" id="a_41">U.P. POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD vs.

MOHAN MEAKINS LTD., &amp; Others</a> in (2000)3 SCC 745, with

reference to paragraph No.13 wherein it is held,

               The    Courts     will   share   the   parliamentary
               concern on the escalating pollution level of our
               environment.       Those who discharge noxious
               polluting   effluents     into   streams    may   be
               unconcerned about the enormity of the injury
               which it inflicts on the public health at large,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                        15</span>

              the irreparable impairment it causes on the
              aquatic     organisms,    the    deleteriousness   it
              imposes on the life and health of animals. So
              the courts should not deal with the prosecution
              for offences under the Act in a casual or
              routine manner. Parliamentary concern in the
              matter is adequately reflected in strengthening
              the measures prescribed by the statute.         The
              court has no justification for ignoring the
              seriousness of the subject.

indicates that no establishment or industry could be established

the Water Act 1974 which was valid till 30.06.2013. It is also a

matter of record that an application for renewal of the said

19.08.2013. Violation of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_50">section 25</a> of the Water Act, 1974 is

made an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_51">Section 44</a> of the Water Act,

renewal of the consent, there is a deemed consent under <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_52">section

25(7)</a> of the Water Act, 1974 cannot be accepted. <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_53">Section 25(4)</a>

of the Water Act 1974 deals with circumstances in which the

Board may grant or refuse consent. It is only sub-clause (7) of

<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_54">section 25</a> provides for deemed consent after expiry of period of

four months from making of an application. In the instant case,

undisputedly,   the   application   was   not   submitted   by   the

petitioners during the validity of the consent. The application

itself having been submitted more than 1½ months after the

expiry of the consent, the benefit of the said clause could be

availed by the petitioners only after 18.12.2013. During the

interregnum, there is a clear violation of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_55">section 25</a> of the Water

Act 1974. The inspection report relied on by the complainant

indicates that, as on the date of the inspection of the said hotel

i.e., on 5/6.12.2013, the petitioners were found operating the

hotel without the necessary consent and hence, in my view, the

complainant has made out a clear case for prosecution of the

petitioners for violation of provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_56">section 25</a> of the Water
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                22</span>


Act, 1974, punishable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_57">section 44</a> of the said Act. Nowhere

in the petition, the petitioners have taken up a plea that the

hotel was not in operation subsequent to 01.07.2013. Therefore,

the contention of the petitioners that by virtue of the deemed

permission, the petitioners were entitled to carry on the

operation without the consent as required under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_58">section 25</a> of

the Water Act, 1974 cannot be accepted.

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_59">Air Act</a>, 1981 are concerned, the specific accusations against the

petitioners are that, at the time of inspection, the petitioners

were found generating noise level exceeding the standard

prescribed in the consent letter. A bare perusal of the consent

letter indicates that the petitioners were required to ensure the

ambience noise level within its premises and it should not

exceed the limits prescribed in Annexure-I appended to the

consent i.e., the noise level should   not exceed 65 dB(A) Leq.

and 55 dB(A) Leq. during day time and night time respectively.


</p><p id="p_66">     9.    There is no serious dispute that the consent was

premises. The annexure appended to the consent also stipulates

noise level at 65 dB(A) Leq. during day time and 55 dB(A) Leq.

during night time. The said limit is also permissible as per the

notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forest. As

such, no case is made out by the Board for prosecution of the

petitioners for the offences under <a href="/doc/1161070/" id="a_60">section 22</a> of the Air Act, 1981

punishable under <a href="/doc/1296808/" id="a_61">section 37</a> of the Air Act, 1981.

The said order indicate that the learned Magistrate has not

applied his mind to the facts of the case and has directed

above offences. Therefore, to this extent the matters require to

be remitted to the trial court, to reconsider the matters afresh in

Metropolitan Magistrate, Traffic Court, Bengaluru is quashed and

the matter is remitted to the learned Magistrate to reconsider
