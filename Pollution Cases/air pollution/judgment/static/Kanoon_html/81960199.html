                  with clean water; prevents floods and also serves a grassing ground for cattle.

                  Further, the grassland is an important habitat for several species of flora and

                  fauna, including migratory birds.      The area has unique biodiversity with

                  several endemic and rare plants.       Through the grassland, Thalavarai river

                  flows, which is the irrigation source of around 2000 Acres of cultivable lands

                  and it is stated to be the only water source to the residents of the village. It is

                  stated that when the entire area is so unique in its biodiversity, the Fisheries

                  Department, without giving importance to the protection of environment and

                  ecosystem, have proposed to establish a massive fish hatchery unit in the

                  grassland at Mannavanur Village.

                  is established in the said grassland, it would result in serious environmental

                  degradation and the waste, which would be generated from the fish points,

                  would result in contamination of the water resource and ultimately, destroy

                  the entire grassland area. Therefore, the petitioners seek for a direction from

                  this Court to forbear the Fisheries Department from establishing the Aqua

                  Culture Centre in the subject land.

                  Authority, namely, the Forest Department themselves has proposed to declare

                  the area as forest and the proposal is pending before the District Collector,

                  Dindigul, since 2012 and at this juncture, if the subject land is to be used for

                  establishing of Aqua Culture Center, it will not only be an impediment for

                  declaring the subject land as forest and after declaration, the said activity will

                  be a non-forest activity.      Therefore, it is submitted that the Court may

                  consider the case of the petitioners and issue appropriate directions so that

                  the Aqua Culture Center is not established in the land in question.

                  due to the constraints in the availability of breeder rearing space in most of

                  the major fish seed production centers in Tamil Nadu. As a result of which,

                  seed suppliers from Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal to meet out the

                  demand. The costs of imported seeds are very high and the quality is poor

                  due to transport stress. It is, therefore, submitted that the availability of the

                  land and climate in Kodaikanal is suitable for common carp breeding and

                  This is clear, because the District Forest Officer and Wildlife Warden,

                  of which, private pliers and middlemen can have a field day.         Further, the

                  also justified their stand stating that there will be no environmental

                  be used for construction of tanks, no chemical will be used and the water

                  principle and the polluter pays principle have been accepted as a part of the

                  law of land. After referring to Articles 47, 48-A and 51-A(g) of the Constitution

                  of India, it was held that apart from the constitutional mandate to protect and

                  improve the environment, there are plenty of post-independence legislations

                  on the subject, but more relevant enactments for the purpose are the Water

                  The Tamil Nadu Forest Department is the guardian of the forests in the State.

                  In other words, they are the Trustees, who are constituted to protect the

                  and made a proposal to the Government to declare the area as a forest land.

                  Since the subject land falls within the control of the District Collector of

                  Government poramboke land.       It is the Government, which is the ultimate

                  authority to issue notification declaring a land as forest land. However, the

                  proposal has been kept in cold storage. Even if it is so, it does not mean that

                  the proposal is not feasible of consideration, because the endeavour of the

                  State Government as well as the Government of India is to increase the forest

                  cover in the State and in the country. Therefore, in our considered view, it will

                  be an unreasonable stand on the part of the revenue administration or the

                  Department of Fisheries to take a stand that as on date, the land is a

                  Government poramboke land and therefore, the proposed project should be

                  permitted. This thought process of the respondents clearly falls foul of the

                  precautionary principle. This also will fall foul of the principle of sustainable

                  development.    In other words, merely because the proposal has not been

                  considered, that would not be a ground to justify the sanction of the project in

                  the area.   This Court can take judicial notice of the fact that the entire

                  Kodaikanal and Palani Hills area have been indiscriminately exploited by

                  several individuals and corporates under the guise of promoting tourism. The

                  account of these thoughtless development, the impact on the environment in

                  the area was huge and action was initiated by the authorities only after this

                  Court stepped in by issuing directions in public interest litigations. Several

                  buildings have been locked and sealed and those violators are now before the

                  Government by way of appeals, which have been dealt with by the

                  Government. Therefore, in our view, time has come to take a firm stand on

                  these issues and a stage has also been formed where it would be unsafe to

                  leave the decision to certain wings of the Government. This is precisely the

                  reason why the Courts have stepped in and issued directions preventing

                  indiscriminate mining of river sand and other minor and major minerals in the

                  and to the naked eye, it will appear to be a land, which can be put to use for

                  any purpose. However, many a times, what has lost sight of is the benefits of

                  these grasslands as they serve as a filtration bed and help for recharging the

                  ground water. Thus, merely because the lands are flat and large tracts are

                  available, that does not mean that the lands do not contribute anything to

                  environment.

                  throw much light on grasslands.       It has been stated that unique type of

                  grassland type is the Shola grassland of the Western Ghats. This type is

                  generally over looked or clumped with other grassland type. However, Shola

                  grasslands are unique as they are confined to the high altitude in the Western

                  Ghats and interspersed with tropical forests (generally found in the mountain

                  folds and valleys). Shola grasslands are maintained by fire and frost and

                  appear to be climax vegetation as an ancient and geographic relict species of

                  ungulate (Niligir Tahr) is found in the shola grasslands and no where else in

                  the world.

                  absorbing rain water and play vital role in water retention and hydrology of an

                  grasslands are not managed by the Forest Department whose interest lies

                  mainly in trees, not by the agriculture department who are interested in

                  agriculture crops, nor the veterinary department who are concerned with

                  livestock, but not the grass on which the livestock is dependent. It is further

                  reported that the grasslands are the ‘common’ lands of the community and are

                  the responsibility of none. They are the most productive ecosystems in the

                  subcontinent, but they belong to all, are controlled by none, and they have no

                  godfathers. The report further says that some of the rarest species of wildlife

                  are found in the grasslands, many of them totally dependent on them.

                  India have excluded the grasslands and have not identified them as “deemed

                  forest” by the State Expert Committee’s pursuant to the landmark order dated

                  12.12.1996 in T.N.Godavarman Thriumalpad (supra). It is pointed out that

                  in terms of the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court the word ‘forest’

                  should be given a wide and liberal interpretation. Excluding grasslands and

                  including lands only with tree cover as ‘forest’ is against the letter and spirit of

                  the said order thereby denying the protection under the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_15">Forest (Conservation)

                  Act</a>, 1980 (F. C. Act). Further, it has been pointed out that the grasslands

                  have spontaneous natural vegetative growth, these should also be treated as

                  ‘forest land’ for the purposes of the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_16">Forest Conservation Act</a> and restrictions

                  on diversion of such lands for non-forest use should be applicable to these

                  critical ecosystems as well. Further, the Report recommends that the Central

                  Government should invoke the provisions of the Articles 251 and 254 of the

                  Constitution to direct state governments to instruct Revenue Departments not

                  to divert any grassland identified in the landscape for bustard/florican

                  protection.

                  grasslands (including grasslands in Tamilnadu) should be recognized as

                  ecologically sensitive ecosystems and any development projects in these areas

                  will have to undergo stringent environmental impact assessments. Further,

                  the Task Force recommends framing of a National Grazing Policy and in the

                  said recommendation, the Report states that in our country, only livestock is

                  considered as wealth, not the grasslands on which this livestock depends nor

                  the traditional knowledge that helps maintain this livestock! Interestingly,

                  protection of fodder producing, natural grasslands greatly help in the

                  protection    of   many   endangered   species.   The   Report    recommends

                  modifications to the EIA guidelines by including ecologically fragile and

                  environmentally sensitive areas where prior EIAs will have to be made

                  mandatory. Also, presence of representatives from identified institutions and

                  experts should be made mandatory during public hearing whenever an EIA is

                  done in the grassland and desert ecosystems so as to review the identified

                  impacts, prediction and mitigation. The Report recommends to the Ministry of

                  Section to look after the grassland issues. The Report of the Task Force on

                  the Task Force cannot be disregarded as merely a report. Many a times, the

                  Reports of such expert bodies have ultimately crystallized into legislation.

                  Therefore, the State of Tamilnadu can lead the country in evolving policies to

                  preserve the grassland rather than to take a technical stand based on the

                  revenue classification of the land in question.

                  from borewells.   Therefore, they propose to extract ground water, which is

                  already in depleted stage in Kodaikanal Hills. The only reason, which appears

                  to have assumed predominant to locate the fish farm in the subject land, is

                  climatic condition. In our considered view, this cannot be the sole reason as

                  we are required to balance environment and industry.           Technology has

                  developed where temperature controlled environment is being created to rear

                  rare varieties of plants and herbs and they have also been done on large scale

                  basis.   Therefore, merely because Kodaikanal Hills has a cool climate, it

                  cannot be a justification to state that fish seed farm should be located in the

                  land in question.   Therefore, we are of the clear view that the project as

                  proposed by the Fisheries Department has to be necessarily shelved.
