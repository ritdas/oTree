4.   With all this merit the appellant applied for membership in the club which
was neither refused nor accepted. When he sought to know what happened, the
club refused even to give any information generally. Then he approached under
Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_3">Information Act</a>, by filing a formal application seeking information: a)
number of applications received and pending for outstation membership in
Willington Gymkhana Club (WGC) with a deposit of Rs. Five Lakh as on
01.09.2012; b) number of applications considered and approved by the
Managing Committee of WGC; c) number of rejected applications; d) whether
the membership was given as per serial number according to seniority, if not the
criterion fixed for giving membership and the criterion fixed for rejecting the
application; e) genesis of the grounds fixed for giving the membership and for
rejecting the application for membership; f) minutes of each meeting of the
Managing Committee as well as of the Sub-Committee for membership, where
the decision to appoint or reject the applications for membership was taken;
g) names of the applicants given the membership and the names of those not
given and rejected in the outstation category and h) break-up of the applicants
given the membership in the outstation category and how many civilians and
people from defence background. Since no information was given, the appellant
approached this Commission. The Club refused to give information claiming that
it was not public authority under <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_4">RTI Act</a>.




CIC/SH/A/2014/000684                                                          Page 3
 5.    Appellant said that respondent body is a public authority because the</pre>
<p id="p_1">Government gave a huge and very valuable land in Udakamandalam (Ooty) to
the Wellington Gymkhana Club by the government, without which it cannot
provide space and facilities for various sports including Golf. Despite being a
public authority under <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_5">RTI Act</a>, 2005, the WGC is wrongfully claiming that it was
not so, with a motive to exercise arbitrary power in allotting membership
without following any seniority or reasonable criterion. When he applied for
membership four years ago, he was refused the membership. The complainant
said that till date no information has been provided to him about his application.
"Minimum courtesy and fairness demands to tell me if my application was
rejected and I must be explained the reasons for rejected". He also submitted
to the Commission that when requested for the status, one office-bearer said
"Sorry sir, you know the system".
</p>
<p id="p_2">6.    Shri Anand Darbari further submitted: The Wellington Gymkhana Club is
an affiliated club of Delhi Gymkhana Club.           If the latter is providing
benefits/facilities to its members and maintaining the seniority-list-applicants-
waiting for membership, why not the WGC follow the same? He filed the
application for membership under the category of outstation-applicant, as he
would be going once in a year to his in-laws place and would like to spend there.
An exorbitant amount Rs. 7.5 lakh was charged with the application.
</p>

<p id="p_3">7.   The Wellington Gymkhana Club, whether public authority under <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_6">RTI Act</a> or
not, has a duty as a trustee to be transparent in its administration when it is
dealing with hue landed property including the money of the public. If what
complainant stated is true, it's deplorable and also a shame to hear about such
trustees.   Neither parties submitted any material to support their contentions.
Hence the Commission directs appellant, the CPIO, Ministry of Youth Affairs and
Sports and the President of the Wellington Gymkhana Club to submit material in
support of their claims including the following:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      a. Documents pertaining to the allocation of land to the Wellington
            Gymkhana Club WGC;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      b. Recognition, registration and certification granted to WGC, if any;
      c. Audit Reports of balance sheet for the last five years;</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">      d. List of members with the date on which membership was given



CIC/SH/A/2014/000684                                                           Page 4
       e. List of applications for membership pending along with the date of
          application, date of consideration, the number-indicating seniority, if
          any, etc

</p><p id="p_5">8.    All parties shall exchange their documents and submit them to the
Commission before 16.10.2017 along with acknowledgement of service of copies
on other parties.
