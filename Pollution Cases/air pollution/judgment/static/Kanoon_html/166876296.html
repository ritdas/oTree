<p id="p_2">1.          This petition has been filed as a Public Interest Litigation

seeking a direction to the respondents to shift the site of Solid

Waste Project from village Dhudhar, District Patiala to any other

less inhabited and barren land.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.          Brief facts of the case are that the petitioners are

aggrieved by the resolution dated 10.8.2010 (P-1), passed by the

Gram Panchayat, Dhudhar, with regard to providing of 40 acres of

Shamlat land to the Municipal Corporation, Patiala, for a period of

33 years on lease basis for setting up of a Municipal Solid Waste
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> CWP No. 16218 of 2010                                                 2</span>

Project. It is alleged that earlier the said project was to be set up at

Chhoti Nadi, Patiala and even permission was taken from the

Irrigation Department. However, due to resistance of the Municipal

Councilors, the site has been shifted to village Dhudhar. According

to the petitioners if the Solid Waste Project is allowed to be set up

in village Dhudhar, it would create nuisance and health problems

for the residents of the area. The petitioners have urged that in the

said project solid waste of three cities, namely, Samna, Rajpura and

Patiala would be dumped. The dump would make the entire area

unlivable because of the foul smell and poisonous gages.           This

would also increase the flow of vehicles carrying the solid waste

from the above three cities day and night.      The site in question is

near the abadi area. The villages of the area are already suffering

health hazards because of Patiala Refinery, DSG Paper Mill and a

Ganda Nala.     The Health Department has already declared the

water of village Dhudhar and village Main as unfit and unsafe for

human consumption. It has also been stated that the shamlat land

of village Dhudhar, where the Solid Waste Project is to be set up, is

a fertile land and source of income of the Gram Panchayat and also

source of livelihood for the poor people who took the land in

question for cultivation in auction. In order to show the resentment

of the people of the area, the petitioners have placed on record

copies of the resolutions stated to have been passed by the Gram

Panchayats of various adjoining villages and the representation

made to the Deputy Commissioner, Patiala (P-3 to P-8).

</p><p id="p_4">3.         Separate written statements have been filed by the

respondents.     In the written statement filed by the Deputy

Commissioner, Patiala, on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 and 2

various allegations levelled in the writ petition have been denied.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CWP No. 16218 of 2010                                             3</span>

In the preliminary objections it has been asserted that about 150

acres of shamlat land is under the ownership of Gram Panchayat,

Dudhar, out of which 40 acres of land has been given by the Gram

Panchayat to the Municipal Corporation, Patiala, for setting up of

Municipal Solid Waste Project, which is under consideration of the

State Government. It has been pointed out that earlier the land in

question was in unauthorised possession of the villagers and after

prolonged litigation the same has been got vacated by the Gram

Panchayat. Those persons are now raising objections against the

setting up of Municipal Solid Waste Project.         The Municipal

Corporation, Patiala has agreed to pay `20,000/- per year per acre

with 10% increase in the lease money every third year to the Gram

Panchayat.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.         It has been specifically denied that the said project

would create any nuisance and health hazard because the abadi of

village Dudhar is located at a distance of about 2.5 Kms. from the

site which has been earmarked for the project.         There is no

populated area near the land in question.     It is also stated that

petitioner Nos. 5 to 9 belong to other nearby villages and they have

no concern or public interest with the said Municipal Solid Waste

Project.   It has been denied that the residents of surrounding

villages, namely, Bhanri, Drola, Droli, Main, Purana Dakala and New

Dakala would be adversely affected by the setting up of the

Municipal Solid Waste Project. In fact, only two Gram Panchayats

have passed the resolution in their proceeding books i.e. Gram

Panchayat, Daroli and Gram Panchayat, Darola, whereas the other

Gram Panchayats i.e. Main, Bhanri, Dakala etc. never passed any

resolution as wrongly stated by the petitioners. Even the distance

of said villages is between 3 to 8 Kilometers from the project site.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> CWP No. 16218 of 2010                                                    4</span>

Therefore, they have no locus standi or cause of action to institute

the instant petition.      An objection has also been raised for not

impleading the Gram Panchayat, Dudhar as a party respondent.

The petitioners have challenged the resolution, dated 10.8.2010,

without availing the remedy before the Director, Rural Development

and Panchayats, Punjab. It has also been asserted that the project

would conform the norms prescribed by the Pollution Control Board

to ensure that no threat is caused to the health of the villagers.

The raw waste of the Municipal Solid Waste Project would be

recycled into various consumable by-products.

</p><p id="p_6">5.           In    the   written   statement   filed   by   the   Municipal

Corporation, Patiala-respondent No. 3 it has been highlighted that

under <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_1">Sections 3</a>, <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_2">6</a> and <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_3">25</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act,

1986 (for brevity, 'the Act'), the Ministry of Environment and Forest,

New Delhi, has made the Rules, known as 'the Municipal Solid

Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000 (for brevity, 'the

Rules') to regulate the management and handling of the municipal

solid wastes. Rule 4 and 5 of the Rules fixes the responsibility of

every municipal authority and the State Government for collection,

segregation, storage, transportation, processing and disposal of

municipal solid wastes as well as enforcement of the provisions of

the Rules.        Rule 6 and 7 of the Rules contains the provisions

regarding management of municipal solid wastes and in Schedule-

III appended to the Rules various specifications have been provided

how it is to be done.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.           In para 3 of the preliminary submissions it has been

explained that after framing of the Rules, the Department of Local

Government, Punjab, has taken steps for developing the integrated

municipal solid waste processing plants across the State of Punjab
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CWP No. 16218 of 2010                                               5</span>

including Patiala. Such processing plants have to be developed in

clusters. Each cluster comprises a major town and other peripheral

towns.     The Municipal Solid Waste Project includes door to door

collection of solid waste from all towns/cities, its transportation,

processing and scientific disposal in the common engineered landfill

facility along with transfer stations.   The transfer stations would

serve as collection centres for municipalities in surrounding area

and the collected waste would then be transported to the central

landfill facility. It is estimated that the inert waste not to exceed

20% would be dumped in the Sanitary Landfill. The project is being

developed on the integrated and regional basis covering 15-30

towns under a Municipal Solid Waste cluster approach wherein all

towns/cities of the State would be covered for municipal solid waste

management in scientific manner under a State Level Master Plan.

It has been submitted that the project has been developed and

implemented as per the provisions of the Rules, which is

environment friendly and, thus, there would not be any pollution

threats.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.           It has further been explained that after careful survey

and analysis, the site in question has been finalised at village

Dhudhar, which is located approximately 1.27 to 2.00 kilometers

away from the habitation cluster. About 75% to 80% of the solid

waste is expected to be converted/recycled into usable form and

only inert of 20-25% would be sent for disposal at Scientific Landfill

site.   It would also generate employment for nearby villages and

have a positive impact on the socio economic environment.

</p><p id="p_9">8.           In the written statement filed by the Punjab Pollution

Control Board-respondent No. 4, in reference to the pollution

created by the already set up industries as alleged by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> CWP No. 16218 of 2010                                                       6</span>

petitioners, it is stated that the Punjab Pollution Control Board

monitors the functioning of the industrial units from time to time.

The air and water pollution emitted out of those industries is found

to be within the norms prescribed under the provisions of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.

</p><p id="p_10">8.         We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length

and perused the paper book with their able assistance. We find no

substance in the averments made by the petitioners and are

satisfied with the reply filed by the respondents.        The petitioners

have not been able to bring on record any statistical data showing

that how much of pollution or nuisance would be created by setting

up the Solid Waste Project at the site in question.             They have

alleged that there is inhabitation near the site and on the contrary

the Municipal Corporation, Patiala-respondent No. 3 has specifically

denied this fact and rather placed on record the site plan showing

that the site in question is more than 1.27 to 2 Kms. away from the

Phirni /abadi of village Dudhar (R-3/2). The Municipal Corporation-

respondent No. 3 has made specific averments that it has chalked

out a methodology for waste collection, segregation, transportation

and disposal at site, which is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "(i)    Door to door waste collection system to ensure

                   segregated collection of waste.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           (ii)    Appropriate storage of mixed/segregated waste at

                   Transfer Stations. Transportation of waste shall be

                   done in covered vehicles.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">           (iii)   After unloading MSW on the tipping floor/pits at

                   processing plant, it shall be immediately sprayed

                   with   herbal   insecticide   to   retard   its   rate   of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> CWP No. 16218 of 2010                                                         7</span>

                 decomposition thereby reducing any chance of foul

                 smell.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">          (iv)   MSW shall not be allowed to stay unprocessed in

                 the building, for more than 2 days.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">          (v)    The proper cleaning of tipping floor shall be taken

                 up once in 24 hours.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">          (vi)   Construction equipments shall be fitted with noise

                 shields.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">          (vii) Noisy       construction    equipments       would     not   be

                 permitted during night hours.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">          (viii) Air emission standards envisaged for the project

                 shall be superior to applicable National Standards,

                 resulting in better air quality.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">          (ix)   In order to repel rodents, the liquid discharge

                 produced by washings and leachate, if any shall be

                 taken      out   through    proper        water    traps    and

                 underground       pipes    rather    than    through       open

                 drains.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                 Further, about 75% to 80% of solid waste is

          expected to be converted/recycles into usable form and

          only inert (20-25%) will be sent for disposal at Scientific

          Landfill Site.      The proposed project will also lead to

          employment generation from nearby villages and will

          have    a   positive     impact     on     the    socio    economic

          environment."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">9.        It is, thus, evident that once the above steps, which are

in consonance with the specifications provided in Schedule-III

attached with the Rules, are taken care of while setting up of the

Municipal Solid Waste Project at village Dhudhar, there would be no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> CWP No. 16218 of 2010                                                8</span>

problem of pollution etc., as has been apprehended by the

petitioners.   It has also come on record in the written statement

filed on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 and 2 that earlier the land in

question was in the illegal possession of the villagers and the Gram

Panchayat after litigating against the petitioners before this Court in

CWP No. 3789 of 2010, decided on 4.3.2010, has been able to take

back the possession of the land from the illegal occupants.

Therefore, the only motive of the petitioners seems to be that that

want to create unnecessary hurdles in setting up of the Municipal

Solid Waste Project. Therefore, we see no merit in the instant

petition warranting admission and no interference by this Court is

called for.    Accordingly, the writ petition fails and the same is

dismissed.
