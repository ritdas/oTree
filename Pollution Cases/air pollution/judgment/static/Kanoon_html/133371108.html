MSW BAREILLY CASE



1.        On 03.01.2005, Respondent No.2, UPPCB granted a no-</pre>
<p id="p_1">     objection certificate in favor of Respondent No. 4, Municipal
     Corporation, Bareilly for setting up an integrated mechanical
     composting plant of 500 t/d capacity at village Razau
     Paraspur, in an area of 21.20 acres.             On 28.03.2013,
     respondent no. 2 granted authorization to the respondent no.
     4 for its MSW Plant at the same site. The said authorization
     expired on 31.12.2013.On its meeting held on 19.12.2012,
     State Level Environmental Impact Assessment Authority
     (SEIAA)   agreed   with   the       recommendation   of   the   State
     Environmental Appraisal Committee (SEAC) and declared that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     1</span>
      respondent no. 4 was not required to take Environmental
     Clearance for Municipal Solid Waste Project under EIA
     Notification of 2006. The validity and correctness of this letter
     was challenged before this Tribunal in Application No.
     86/2013, a petition filed by Rayons-Enlighting Humanity, a
     society, in Application No. 99/2013 by the Invertis University
     (the same Applicant in Application 110 of 2014) and in
     Application 100 of 2014 by a group of residents of village
     Razau Paraspur, Bareilly. All these Applications were heard
     together and disposed of by the common judgment dated July
     18, 2013. It was found that respondent no. 4 was required to
     take Environmental Clearance from SEIAA, being a category B
     project, before setting up and operating the MSW plant. It was
     also found that the plant is neither meeting the site
     specifications nor does it have incinerator to ensure proper
     treatment and volume reduction and disposal of municipal
     waste. Therefore, various directions were issued.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.   The said judgment was challenged before the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Civil Appeal 7215 of 2013.        Vide order dated
13.09.2013, the Hon'ble Supreme Court granted special leave and
passed the following order:
</p><p id="p_3">     "By way of interim order, the directions as contained in Para 49
of the impugned judgment shall remain stayed"
</p>
<p id="p_4">     3.   Application No. 5 of 2014 is filed by the residents of the
affected villages seeking an order directing the Respondents not to
operate the MSW plant before obtaining EC clearance as per EIA
Notification 2006 and fresh authorization as per Municipal Solid
Waste (Management and Handling )Rules 2000 (in short MSW Rules
2000).
</p>
<p id="p_5">     4.   Application No. 6 of 3014 was filed by farmers of the
village Razau Paraspur and Nariyawal claiming to be directly and
substantially affected by the operation of the said plant seeking an
order restraining Respondent No. 4 and M/S AKC Developers Ltd.
(Respondent No. 5 in that Application) from operating the plant

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  2</span>
 without obtaining Environmental Clearance and from raising fresh
or further construction on the site of the plant. The Invertis
University filed the Application No. 110 of 2014 seeking almost
identical reliefs against the Respondent No. 4 who is impleaded
therein as Respondent No. 3.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     5.    As the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has already
stayed operation of the directions contained in para 49 of the
Judgment dated 18th July, 2013 of the Tribunal, and the matter is
subjudice before that Court, in these Applications before us we,
would not deal with any contention or matter that directly or
indirectly arises for consideration of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India in the Appeal pending before that Court.      We shall confine
ourselves only to the subsequent events de-hors the contentions
raised in that case.       Be that as it may, the Applicants are
contending that the Respondent No. 4 cannot operate the MSW
plant without obtaining an authorization as provided under the
MSW Rules and as they have not obtained the consent under Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, they cannot legally
continue to operate the plant without obtaining the authorization
and consent. It was also contended that the leachates are being
sprayed over the solid waste for the purpose of composting and it
causes    serious   pollution.   Taking   into   consideration   these
submissions we directed the CPCB to inspect the premises making
it clear that the CPCB shall send its team for inspection of the
project and the inspection shall be conducted jointly by Respondent
No. 2, UPPCB and the CPCB, especially in relation to the leachtes,
collection, treatment and disposal on the site in question. Pursuant
to the directions the CPCB and UPPCB conducted a joint inspection
on 5-4-2014 and submitted a joint inspection report highlighting
the various deficiencies as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_7">  a. Construction of drains inside the premises has not been found
     for discharge of any rainy water.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   3</span>
<p id="p_8">   b. The height of the wind rose of Bio Composting Plant has been
     found about 4 mts. Whereas in normal conditions the height of
     the same should be 01 to 1.5 mts. Anaerobic position has been
     fund inside the windrows.
</p><p id="p_9">  c. Some    wet   organic   waste       has   been   found   outside   Bio
     Composting Yard. Drains all around Bio Composting Yard to
     collect the leachtes have not been made.
</p><p id="p_10">  d. After the wind rose, Maturation Yard has not been constructed.
  e. Plastic waste has also been found in Land Filling Area, which
     shows that segregation of plastic waste from inert waste is not
     being done properly.
</p><p id="p_11">  f. Tanks have been made for collection of leachtes waste, but no
     arrangements have been made for treatment of leachtes waste.
  g. Foul smell has been found near the plant.
</p><p id="p_12">  h. Plant has been found operated without valid authorization. It is
     known that vide Letter No.F42119/C8/MSW/02/14 dated
     29.04.2014 of the Board's headquarters the authorization for
     said plant has been rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     6.    It has been observed in the report that the Plant does not
have valid authorization for its operation. It is to be noted that the
Plant had authorization only till 31.12.2013 which was issued by
UPPCB. The Municipal Corporation applied to the UPPCB in
November, 2013 for extension of the authorization and the Regional
Officer of the UPPCB had submitted a report stating that it is for the
Regional Office of UPCC to take a decision. But the consent was not
granted.
</p>
<p id="p_14">     7.    It is thus clear that the Respondent No.4 is not having
any valid authorization and consent for the operation of the MSW
Plant. The leachtes was spread over the waste for bio-compost. The
bio-compost yard was not circled by lined drains for collection of
leachtes or surface run off. The compaction/consolidation was not
done as per SLF specification prescribed under the rules. Moreover,
plastic waste was disposed of in the SLF indicating that proper
segregation was not carried out. The leachtes collection sumps were

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     4</span>
 not covered and were filled with rain water. The joint report further
reveals that required adequate facility for treatment of leachtes
generated should be provided so that treated leachtes quality shall
confirm to the standard prescribed in MSW Rules 2000, and proper
drainage system are required to be built along the periphery of the
compost yard. So also provision for proper drainage system,
separate storm water drainage and catch pit for the leachtes in the
premises are essential to prevent contamination of ground water.
Based on the above, UPPCB declined the authorization sought for
by the Respondent No.4.
</p>
<p id="p_15">8.   When this Report was filed, learned Counsel appearing for
respondent no. 4 submitted that they are willing to take such
remedial measures as have been stated by the Board in their report
within a prescribed time frame. However, a further joint inspection
was again carried out on 27.05.14 by UPPCB and CPCB and it is
reported that the deficiencies were not fully complied with. We may
also notice that it is the undisputed case before us that even now
the excess municipal waste is being dumped at another site which
is at Bhakadganj which is far away from the vicinity of any
residential area or even offices etc. This site was also being used
prior to the commencement of the present plant.
</p>


<p id="p_16">     9.   Learned Senior Counsel appearing for respondent no.4
made available photographs showing the constructions being
carried out on the periphery of the site and submitted that out of
the total length of drain along boundary which is 910 m, excavation
work of 300 m was over and 90 m construction was completed and
out of the total length of drain along the shed, which is 1050m,
excavation of 260 m was over and 90m construction base was over
and 30 labourers are working on the site and the entire work would
be over within a period of one month.       Learned Senior Counsel
argued that their MSW plant is one of the best in India and closing
down the same would go against the sustainable development and
therefore they be permitted to operate the plant.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  5</span>
<p id="p_17">      10. Learned Counsel for Applicant submitted that when
respondent no 4 did not obtain the consent and is not having the
EC clearance and the report submitted by the joint inspection team
establish that the deficiencies are not fully complied with, they
cannot be permitted to operate the plant. Learned Counsel
appearing for the Applicant relied on the decision of the Apex court
in Bangalore Medical Trust V.s B.S Buddappa and Ors. (1991) 4
SCC 54) and argued that financial gain cannot be at the cost of the
public welfare and no one howsoever high can arrogate to himself or
assume, without any authorization express or implied, in law a
discretion to ignore the Rules and therefore, respondent no 4
cannot be allowed to continue the operation of the plant without the
authorization,    consent   and   complying     with   the   mandatory
requirement under the law. The learned counsel also placed
reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Research
Foundation for <a href="/doc/18451466/" id="a_3">Science and Technology, National Research Policy
vs. UOI</a> ((2005) 10 SCC 510) wherein their Lordships directed that
units operating without any authorization or in violation of the
conditions of the authorization issued under the Hazardous Waste
Rules 1989 shall be closed forthwith.
</p>
<p id="p_18">     11. Rule 4 of the MSW Rules 2000 clearly provides the
responsibility on Municipal authority to obtain the authorization.
As per the said rule the Municipal authority or an operator of the
facility shall make an application in Form 1, for grant of
authorization for setting up waste processing and disposal facility,
including landfill, from the State Board. Rule 4 reads:
</p>
<p id="p_19">" The waste processing or disposal facilities shall include composting,
incineration, pelletisation, energy recovery or any other facility based
on state-of-the-art technology duly approved by the Central Pollution
Control Board."
</p>
<p id="p_20">     12. It is not even disputed by Respondent No. 4 that they are
not possessed of any consent and authorization by the competent
authority which had been granted to them by the Board subject to
compliance of the conditions.     Apparently, Respondent No. 4 has

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   6</span>
 failed to comply with such conditions. Respondent No. 4 also does
not have the approval of its facility from the Central Pollution
Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_21">     Schedule IV of MSW rules provides the standards for
composting treated leachtes and incineration, which reads as
follows:
</p>
<p id="p_22">     "The waste processing or disposal facility shall include
composting, incineration, pelletization, energy recovery or any other
facility based on the State of Art Technology duly approved by the
CPCB." Respondent no.4 has no case that they obtained any
approval from the CBCB on the technology of the plant as provided
under the said schedule.
</p>
<p id="p_23">     13. The Reports submitted by the joint inspection team
establish that there are various deficiencies which would result in
causing pollution and in spite of the duration of the dispute, the
deficiencies were not cured.    It is clear that pollution is being
caused by the leachtes which are hazardous to the neighboring
residents as well as adversely affecting the quality of the ground
water.
</p>
<p id="p_24">     14. It is thus clear that respondent no4 has not obtained the
requisite consent and authorization from the State PCB and is also
not having the approval of CPCB on the art of the technology
adopted. It is very clear that pollution is being caused by disposal
of leachtes in an unscientific manner. The rules and regulations are
binding on all including the Respondent No.4. In the name of Public
Welfare, respondent no.4 cannot be permitted to operate the MSWM
plant violating the rules and regulations. Violation of rules and
regulations and operating its plant without authorization cannot be
countenanced by the Tribunal, in the light of the law clearly
enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of
Bangalore Medical Trust V.s B.S Buddappa and Ors. (supra) and
Research Foundation for Science and Technology Vs. Union of India
(supra) Larger public interest and public health must take
precedence over the claim by Respondent No. 4.        More so when
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  7</span>
 Respondent No. 4 had ample time to make up for the deficiencies
and take all anti pollution measures.             The conduct of the
Respondent No. 4 itself disentitles it from any discretionary relief
from the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_25">             In such circumstances we have no other option but to
direct closure of the MSW Plant of Respondent No. 4 which we do
hereby Order. The Respondent No. 4 is at liberty to cure all the
deficiencies pointed out by the joint inspection team and approach
the   Pollution   Control   Board   for   the   requisite   consent   and
authorization. In that event it is for the Board to take appropriate
decision in accordance with law. If the Board grants the consent
and authorization to Respondent No 4, it is entitled to resume
operation of the plant in accordance with law subject to the order
that may be passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
