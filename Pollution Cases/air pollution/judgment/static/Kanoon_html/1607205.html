                                             Date of decision:   .9.2008

Haryana State Pollution Control
Board and another                                  ...... Appellants

                          versus

Juglan Glue P.C.I.S. Ltd.                          .......Respondent

CORAM:        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAKESH KUMAR GARG

                          ****
</pre><p id="p_1">Present:      Mr. J.P.Bhatt, Advocate for the appellants.


Rakesh Kumar Garg, J .
</p>
<p id="p_2">CM No.8090-C of 2008

              For the reasons mentioned in the application, delay of 70 days

in filing the appeal is condoned.
</p>
<p id="p_3">              CM stands disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_4">RSA No.2742 of 2008

              The respondent is a Co-operative Society and is running a

glue industry since 1967. After coming into force of Water (Prevention and

Control of Pollution)Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1981, no standards were prescribed for the industry of the respondent.

</p><p id="p_5">              It is the case of the respondent that although his industry did

not discharge any trade effluent which could cause pollution, yet as a

matter of precaution it applied for consent to the appellants which was

granted as per rules and it was found that the plaintiff-respondent was not

discharging any trade effluent. Despite this, the employees of the

appellants took samples from the industry of the respondent and false

report was prepared and prosecution was launched against the

respondent.     Subsequently, the appellants advised and suggested the
 respondent to deposit litigation charges for the withdrawal of prosecution.

As per the advise and suggestion and assurance of the appellants,

respondent deposited a sum of Rs.7,500/- with the appellants on 28.3.1994

but despite that, the prosecution was not withdrawn by the appellants and

subsequently the complaint filed by the appellants against the respondent

was found to be false, which was dismissed by the Court of competent

jurisdiction by acquitting the respondent. The respondent requested the

appellants to refund the fee of Rs.7,500 deposited for withdrawal of the

prosecution. The request of the respondent for refund of the amount was

rejected by the appellants vide its letter dated 29.8.2002.

</p><p id="p_6">            The respondent filed the present suit for declaration to the

effect that the letter dated 29.8.2002 issued by defendants whereby the

refund of the litigation charges has been declined by the defendants is

totally wrong and illegal against law and facts on record, null and void and

as such is liable to be set aside and as a consequential relief of mandatory

injunction directing the defendants to refund the litigation fees received by

the defendants for withdrawal of prosecution with interest @ 24% per

annum from the date of deposit to the date of realization on the basis of

evidence oral and documentary of every description.

</p><p id="p_7">            The suit was contested by the appellants and it was submitted

that the fee of Rs.7,500/- deposited by the respondent was not the fee for

withdrawal of the prosecution, rather it was the litigation charges and they

have forwarded the case of the respondent to the Government for

withdrawal of the prosecution. However, the Government did not permit

the withdrawal of prosecution. It was also asserted that the suit is not

maintainable in the present form. The trial Court dismissed the suit filed by

the respondent vide its judgement and decree dated 26.9.2006.

</p><p id="p_8">            Feeling aggrieved against the aforesaid judgment and decree,
 the respondent filed an appeal before the District Judge, Hisar which was

allowed vide judgment and decree dated 8.3.2008. The relevant part of

the impugned judgment and decree passed by the District Judge, Hisar is

reproduced as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                       "I have considered the rival contentions of the

                       parties   very    carefully   and     I   find    that    the

                       respondents who are part and partial of the govt.

                       and are discharging the sovereign duties, are not

                       supposed to take a frivolous technical plea so as

                       to non-suit the plaintiff. In this case, resolution,

                       was passed to institute the suit for refund of the

                       amount due to the violation of the promise given

                       by the respondents.       In this case, the Pollution

                       Board     has     although    taken       Rs.7500/-       for

                       withdrawal of the prosecution on the plea of

                       litigation expenses yet they have not fulfilled that

                       promise. It is different matter that the appellant

                       successfully faced that prosecution and was

                       acquitted of the charges. Once the respondents

                       were unable to fulfill their promise, they were not

                       only morally bound but duty bound to refund this

                       amount to the appellant, instead they have started

                       taking one plea or another in order to defeat the

                       claim of the appellant. Since it was a violation of

                       the undertaking given by the respondents, the suit

                       for mandatory injunction is fully maintainable.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                       Admittedly,      the   promise      having       not     been

                       fulfilled,the respondents are liable to refund the
                        amount to the appellant and there is no necessity

                       to file suit for recovery. The appeal being

                       continuation of suit can very well be filed by the

                       person who was authorized to file suit.         The

                       arguments that the appeal has been signed only

                       by the advocate would not make any difference.

                       Because the same advocate was representing the

                       appellant before the trial court.      The finding

                       recorded by the trial court with regard to issues

                       no.1 to 4 are hereby reversed. Resultantly, the

                       suit of the plaintiff succeeds and a decree for

                       mandatory injunction is passed in favour of the

                       appellant and against the defendant/respondents

                       to refund the amount of Rs.7500/- with 6% interest

                       from the date of filing of the suit till the date of

                       recovery. If this amount is not paid within three

                       months then, the interest would be 12% per

                       annum instead of 6% per annum.           Thus, the

                       appeal is accepted."</blockquote><p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">           By way of this appeal, the Haryana State Pollution Control

Board has challenged the impugned judgement and decree.

</p><p id="p_11">            Learned counsel for the appellants has argued that an amount

of Rs.7,500/- deposited by the respondent was not the fee for withdrawal

rather it was the litigation charges and the case of the plaintiff was

forwarded to the Government for withdrawal of the prosecution as per the

guidelines but the Government did not permit the withdrawal of the

prosecution and the appellant was not competent to withdraw the complaint

against the respondent and hence, they are not at fault. It was further
 argued by the learned counsel for the appellants that the suit for mandatory

injunction is not maintainable and the plaintiff-respondent should have filed

the suit for recovery.        An objection has also been raised to the

maintainability of the appeal on the ground that the resolution to file the

appeal has not been attached with the grounds of appeal as resolution has

been passed later on i.e. 22.11.2006 whereas the appeal was filed on

9.11.2006. On the basis of the above arguments, learned counsel for the

appellants has raised the following substantial question of law:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                   " Whether the suit as well appeal filed by the respondent

                   are maintainable.?"</blockquote><p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">             I have heard learned counsel for the appellants and perused

the record. However, I find no force in the arguments raised by the learned

counsel for the appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_14">             Admittedly, there was a policy Ex.D1 vide which the procedure

has been laid down for withdrawal of the cases and in compliance of the

assurance given by the appellant-Board and the procedure prescribed in

the document Ex.D1, the plaintiff-respondent deposited a sum of

Rs.7,500/- for withdrawal of the prosecution against him. This procedure

has been laid down by the appellant-Board and it has also been admitted

that the Board recommended for withdrawal of the case to the

Government. Another important factor which is relevant to be mentioned is

that, in fact, the respondent stood acquitted in the complaint/prosecution

case by a Court of competent jurisdiction. The only plea taken by the

appellants is that the Government has not allowed the withdrawal as they

were not competent to withdraw the complaint and therefore, they are not

at fault.   The appellant-Board    has not substantiated its arguments by

placing on record the reasons on the basis of which the Government did

not allow withdrawal. Even the order of the Government declining to allow
 the withdrawal of the case against the respondent has not been placed on

record of the case. Even otherwise, the appellant-Board is an autonomous

body which has been created under a statute. It was the Board who had

initiated the complaint against the respondent and it was for the appellant-

Board to withdraw the complaint against the respondent.         There is no

evidence on record to prove that permission of the        Government was

necessary for withdrawal of complaint against the respondent. Thus, the

letter dated 29.8.2002 issued by the appellant-Board whereby the request

of the respondent for refund of litigation charges has been declined has

been rightly held to be illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_15">             As far as the objection of the appellants with regard to the

maintainability of suit for mandatory injunction being for recovery of money

is concerned, the same is liable to be rejected. The suit filed by the

respondent is not a suit for recovery simpliciter. In fact the respondent has

filed a suit for declaration to the effect that the letter dated 29.8.2002

issued by the appellant-Board declining its request for refund is illegal and

as a consequential relief a mandatory injunction has been sought against

the appellants to refund the litigation fee.   The judgement cited by the

learned counsel for the appellants in the case of <a href="/doc/247014/" id="a_2">State of Haryana v. Dr.

Prem Singh Mann</a>, 1996 (3) PLR 799 is not applicable to the facts of the

case.
</p>
<p id="p_16">             The other objection of the appellants regarding maintainability

of the appeal on the ground that there was no resolution by the

respondent-Company to file the appeal on the date of filing of the appeal

i.e. 9.11.2006 is also liable to be rejected. Undisputedly, resolution was

passed by the respondent-Company on 22.11.2006. Thus, it was merely

an irregularity which cannot come in the way of the Court for granting
 relief. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of <a href="/doc/690646/" id="a_3">Uday Shankar

Triyar v. Ram Kalewar Prasad Siingh and another</a> AIR 2006 SC 269 has

held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                   "17.   Non-compliance with any procedural requirement

                   relating to a pleading, memorandum of appeal or

                   application or petition for relief should not entail

                   automatic dismissal or rejection, unless the relevant

                   statute or rule so mandates. Procedural defects and

                   irregularities which are curable should not be allowed to

                   defeat    substantive   rights   or   to   cause     injustice.

                   Procedure, a hand-maid to justice, should never be

                   made a tool to deny justice or perpetuate injustice, by

                   any oppressive or punitive use.        The well recognized

                   exceptions to this principle are:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                  i) whether the Statute prescribing the procedure, also

                    prescribes specifically the consequence of non-

                    compliance.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                  ii) where the procedural defect is not rectified, even after

                    it is pointed out and due opportunity is given for

                    rectifying it;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                  iii)where the non-compliance or violation is proved to be

                    deliberate or mischievous;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                  iv)where the rectification of defect would affect the case

                    on merits or will affect the jurisdiction of the court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                   v) In case of Memorandum of Appeal there is complete

                    absence of authority and the appeal is presented

                    without the knowledge, consent and authority of the

                    appellant."</blockquote><p id="p_17">



</p><p id="p_18">             Thus, in view of the above well settled proposition of law, there

is no merit in the said objection raised by the appellants. Even otherwise

the resolution authorising to file appeal dated 22.11.2006 was passed. It is

not disputed that while instituting the suit in the trial Court, the respondent-

Company has placed on record a resolution of the Company to institute

the legal proceedings against the appellant-Board.          It is well settled

proposition of law that    appeal is a continuation of a suit therefore, if

powers have been given by a company to a person to institute suits and

other legal proceedings that power will also include the power to file

appeals and revisions. In my above view, I am supported by a judgement

of this Court in the case of National Fertilizers Ltd. Bathinda v.

Municipal Committee, Bathinda and another 1982 PLR 322. In RSA

No.1270 of 2004 (<a href="/doc/770731/" id="a_4">Municipal Council Bathinda v. Raj Kumar</a>) decided on

27.7.2006, this Court after relying upon Uday Shankar Triyar's case

(supra) has taken the view as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                   "Coming to the facts of the case, the resolution

                   authorising the Executive Officer to file the suit has been

                   proved before the lower appellate court and the plaint

                   was duly signed by the pleader.          It has also been

                   established that the Municipal Committee was entitled to

                   recovery a sum of Rs.3,11,000/- from the respondent

                   along with interest thereon. The rights of the appellant,
                   therefore,   could   not   be   defeated   on   this    mere

                  technicality. "</blockquote><p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">            For the reasons stated above, I find no merit in the present

appeal. No substantial question of law raises for the determination of this

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_21">            Dismissed.
