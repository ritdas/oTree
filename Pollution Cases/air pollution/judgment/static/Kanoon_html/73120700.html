    THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED U/S 482 OF
CR.P.C. SEEKING THAT THE ENTIRE PROCEEDINGS OF
                              2

THE C.C.NO.234/2006 (P.C.NO.62/2006) PENDING ON THE
FILE OF THE JMFC II-COURT, KARWAR, INSTITUTED BY
THE RESPONDENT, BE QUASHED BY ALLOWING THIS
CRIMINAL PETITION.

     I.A. NO.1/2014 IS FILED FOR GRANT OF STAY.

    THIS PETITION A/W. I.A. COMING ON                FOR
ADMISSION THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE                   THE
FOLLOWING:

                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The petitioner approached this Court seeking quashing

of the entire proceedings in CC No.234/2006, pending on

the file of the JMFC Second Court, Karwar.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2. Heard the arguments of the leaned counsel for the

petitioner. Perused the records.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3. The notice to be issued to the respondent is

dispensed with as there is no right accrued to the

respondent in this case, as this Court is not quashing the

entire proceedings pending before the trial Court, only

setting aside some irregular procedure followed by the

learned Magistrate, while dealing with the matter.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              3</span>

</p><p id="p_4">     4. The   records   disclose   that   the   respondent   -

Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, lodged a private

complaint under <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_1">Section 200</a> Cr.P.C., alleging the offences

under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_2">Sections 25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_3">26</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_4">44</a> of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.   There is no need for this

Court to deal with the factual matrix of this case in detail.

After lodgment of the complaint, the learned Magistrate took

cognizance and issued a process to the petitioner herein who

appeared before the Court and contested the proceedings.

The petitioner has been representing before the Court

through his Advocate. The records disclose that the learned

Magistrate on so many occasions, posted the case for

evidence, before framing of the charge. On 3/7/2014, the

learned Magistrate has passed the order in the following

terms:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "both the parties were present, complainant examined

     as PW-1, EXs.P1 to P10 were marked and learned

     Magistrate perused records and held that the prima

     facie case was made out, hence, posted the case for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              4</span>

     framing of the charges and posted the case to

     30/7/2014".</blockquote><p id="p_5">


</p><p id="p_6">     5. The learned Counsel brought to my notice that

though this Court is not quashing the entire proceedings in

the above said criminal case, nevertheless, exercising the

revisional jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Section 401</a> even Sue-motto

Court can set right the irregularities committed by the

learned Magistrate, in not following the procedure properly

under <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_7">Sections 244</a> and <a href="/doc/1568411/" id="a_8">245</a> of Cr.PC.      He contended that

no opportunity was provided to the accused to cross-

examine PW-1 and also counter the documents marked at

EXs.P1 to P10, in order to demolish the case of complainant,

at the threshold, even without divulging his defence at that

stage. Further, added to that the learned Magistrate has not

passed any order with regard to how the Magistrate was

satisfied with regard to the existence of a prima facie case.

Mere using of the word 'prima facie' in the order is not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     5</span>

sufficient and it should be by means of objective satisfaction

of the Magistrate, under <a href="/doc/1568411/" id="a_9">Section 245</a> of Cr.P.C.


</p><p id="p_7">      6. Having heard the arguments of the learned Counsel,

now, this Court has to examine, what procedure the

Magistrate ought to has followed before proceeding to order

for framing of the charges.         In a case instituted otherwise

than the police report, the Magistrate has to follow <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_10">Section

244</a> of Cr.P.C., and he has to record the evidence of the

prosecution before framing of the charges. The section reads

as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "244. Evidence for prosecution.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">               (1) When, in any warrant-case instituted other
               wise than on a police report the accused
               appears or is brought before a Magistrate, the
               Magistrate   shall       proceed   to   hear   the
               prosecution and take all such evidence as may
               be produced in support of the prosecution.
               (2) The Magistrate may, on the application of
               the prosecution, issue a summon to any of its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              6</span>

           witnesses directing him to attend or to produce
           any document or other thing."</blockquote><p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">     7. This particular provision clearly mandates that in a

warrant   case   otherwise   than   a   police   report,   after

appearance of the accused, the Magistrate shall proceed to

hear the prosecution and take all evidence as may be

produced in support of the prosecution.          That clearly

indicates that the examination of all the witnesses is

absolutely necessary, before proceeding further in the case.

After recording of such evidence of the prosecution, the

Magistrate may on an application of prosecution issue

summons to any of the witnesses directing him to attend or

to produce any document or other thing. This also makes it

clear that the examination of the complainant alone is not

sufficient under <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_11">Section 244</a> of Cr.P.C. The complainant has

to examine all his witnesses and produce all the documents

he proposed to rely upon.    The idea behind this provision

under <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_12">Section 244</a> of Cr.P.C. is that in a case instituted on

the police repot, the police would investigate the matter and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               7</span>

submit the entire charge sheet papers under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_13">Section 173</a> of

CR.P.C. and the entire charge sheet papers would be

provided to the accused under <a href="/doc/1613898/" id="a_14">Section 207</a> of CR.P.C. so as

to prepare himself for the trial of the Case.   He would be

knowing what exactly the case of the prosecution and how

many witnesses the prosecution would like to examine

before the Court and what are the documents it proposes to

rely upon so that the accused can prepare himself for an

effective trial before the Court. So far as the case which are

instituted otherwise than the police report, this opportunity

would not be there to the accused person, unless the Court

enquires into the matter, records the statements of the

witnesses and the complainant and also the complainant

producing all his documents before the Court.         So this

procedure enable the accused persons in order to know what

exactly case of the complainant and how he would like to

prove his case before the Court, how many witnesses he

would like to examine during the course of the trial, and

what are the documents he proposes to place before the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               8</span>

Court. Therefore, it is incumbent on the Magistrate under

<a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_15">Section 244</a> of Cr.P.C., to call upon the complainant to lead

evidence on his side, by examining the complainant and

other witnesses and also by producing the documents, if

necessary, before the Court so as to enable the accused

person, an opportunity to go through the materials on

record. After recording the evidence in such a manner, if the

Magistrate is satisfied, then the Magistrate has to pass an

order, necessarily, under <a href="/doc/1568411/" id="a_16">Section 245</a> of Cr.P.C. Section 245

rules as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "245. When accused shall be discharged.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">            (1) If, upon taking all evidence referred to in

            section 244 the Magistrate considers, for

            reasons to be recorded that the case against

            the accused has been made out which, if

            unrebutted, would warrant his conviction, the

            Magistrate shall discharge him.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">            (2) Nothing, in this section shall be deemed to

            prevent a Magistrate from discharging the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 9</span>

           accused at any previous stage of the case if,

           for   reasons   to   be   recorded,   Magistrate

           considers the charge to be groundless."</blockquote><p id="p_10">


</p><p id="p_11">     8. This particular provision empowers the Magistrate

to look into the evidence recorded by him, under <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_17">Section 244</a>

of Cr.P.C. and documents produced. Thereafter by recording

the reasons as to whether any case is made out, against the

accused person to proceed against the accused person for

putting the accused person on to the trial he can order to

frame charges. If the Magistrate is of the opinion, that no

case as against the accused has been made out, which even

if unrebutted would warrant his conviction, the Magistrate

shall discharge the accused person at the threshold itself.

Sub clause 2 of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_18">Section 245</a> also further empowers that the

Magistrate for discharging the accused person, even at any

previous stage of the case, if for reasons to be recorded by

the Magistrate, if he considers the charge to be groundless.

Therefore, this unfettered powers given to the learned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               10</span>

Magistrate has to be exercised properly and in accordance

with law and procedure. After recording the evidence under

<a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_19">Section 244</a> of Cr.P.C., it is bound and duty of the learned

Magistrate to record his reasons, whether the accused is

liable to be discharged or charges shall be framed against

him. If no orders are passed under <a href="/doc/1568411/" id="a_20">Section 245</a> of Cr.P.C., it

becomes a serious irregularity affecting the rights of the

accused persons. In this particular case, no such exercise

has been taken up by the learned Magistrate. As could been

seen   from   the   orders   dated   3/7/2014,   the    learned

Magistrate very casually and cryptically stated that he has

examined the complainant as PW-1 and Exs.P1 to P10, were

marked and there was prima facie case made out, hence, he

proceeded to order for framing of the charges.         But, the

learned Magistrate has not at all recorded his satisfaction as

to how he came to the conclusion that there is a prima facie

case is made out.     It is not the mere satisfaction of the

learned Magistrate in one sentence, but, the Magistrate has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                              11</span>

to record how the evidence recorded by him, if unrebutted

would be sufficient to convict the accused person.


</p><p id="p_12">     9. Therefore, in my opinion, the order passed by the

learned Magistrate, without recording his reasons is illegal

and it has to be set aside by this Court, though not prayed

by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">     10.   The another important aspect to be looked into is

that whether the accused is entitled to cross-examine the

witnesses or the complainant on the evidence, recorded

under <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_21">Section 244</a> of the Cr.P.C.         Though there is no

absolute right is created, but, the wordings used in <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_22">section

244</a> is 'evidence' not a statement of the complainant.    The

evidence, in my opinion, includes not only the examination-

in-chief, but, also cross examination.    The specific words

used evidence for prosecution creates certain rights on the

accused persons to cross-examine the witnesses. Therefore,

though there is no absolute right to cross examine before the

charge is framed, but, the section does not prohibit the same
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                              12</span>

and the Magistrate should not refuse to allow the cross

examination of the prosecution witnesses.         This would

definitely serve two purposes, the one purpose is that the

accused can cross examine the witnesses in order to show to

the Court that the very basis for the complaint and the

evidence recorded by the Court is not sufficient to proceed

against him and the said evidence even if it is unrebutted is

not sufficient for the purpose of convicting the accused

person. The second purpose is the accused at the threshold,

if he is permitted to cross examine the witnesses, a legal

lapses on the part of the complainant can also be brought to

the notice of the Court and the Court can take appropriate

notice of the irregularities or any legal hurdles to proceed

against   the   accused   person   by   framing   the   charge.

Therefore, in my opinion, the Magistrate ought to have

provided an opportunity to the accused to cross-examine the

witnesses and thereafter, he should have passed an order

under <a href="/doc/1568411/" id="a_23">Section 245</a> of Cr.P.C., before ordering to frame

charges against the accused persons.

passed by the learned Magistrate date 3/7/2014 is illegal

and the same is liable to be set aside.

<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">      12.       With the above said observations, a direction is

issued     to    the     learned   Magistrate    to   call   upon    the

complainant to examine any of the witnesses whom he

would like to examine and produce any other documents,

which he intends to produce before the Court so as to enable

the   accused       to    know     about   the   exact   case   of   the

complainant.        The learned Magistrate has to provide an

opportunity to the accused to cross examine the PW-1 and

any of the witnesses and then the Magistrate has to pass

appropriate orders under <a href="/doc/1568411/" id="a_24">Section 245</a> of Cr.P.C., before

proceeding to frame charges against the accused person.

With these observations, the petition is hereby partly

allowed.
