2     7.1.2010</pre><p id="p_1">                    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and the counsel

                    appearing on behalf of the State.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                  This application has been filed for quashing the order,

                    dated 14.2.2009 passed by the Subdivisional Magistrate, Sadar,

                    Munger in Case No. 23(M)/2009 by which the Magistrate has stayed

                    the construction of tower of Vodafone Essar Specetel Limited, a

                    public limited company.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                                  The grounds for passing the order is a complaint petition

                    contained in Annexure 3 was filed in which there is grievance by the

                    residents of the locality that the installation of the tower involves use

                    of a diesel generator which emits foul fuels and is also very noisy

                    which disturbs the residents of the locality. The petitioner company

                    has been asked to file a show cause on 24.2.2009.

</p><p id="p_4">                                  Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

                    Company is a licensee by the Central Government in the Ministry of

                    Communication &amp; Information Technology, Department of Tele-

                    communication,     Wireless    Planning    and   Co-ordination    Wing.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                        2</span>




Annexure 1 is a certificate by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board

under the Water Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control Of Pollution Act</a>, 1981. It is

submitted that the petitioners utilize a silent generator and it has

wrongly been stated that the generator used by the petitioners emits

foul smell and emits fuel.
</p>
<p id="p_5">              The main contention on behalf of the petitioners is that

section 133 of the Code envisages that the District Magistrate or the

Subdivisional Magistrate or any other Executive Magistrate

empowered by the State Government should receive a report from the

police or other information and on taking evidence if he things fit,

should pass orders as envisaged under section 133 of the Code.

</p><p id="p_6">              In this case it is submitted that before passing the

prohibitory order the Subdivisional Magistrate ought to have held an

enquiry and ascertained the facts.
</p>
<p id="p_7">              It is stated that the petitioners have already filed a show

cause before the Subdivisional Magistrate. However, the matter is

pending and no steps have been taken to hear the matter, which is

rather unfortunate.
</p>
<p id="p_8">              Considering the nature of the case in hand, I direct the

Subdivisional Magistrate, Sadar, Munger to hold an enquiry in the

matter in presence of the petitioners and pass an order in this case the

Court should take evidence if necessary, and also look into the

documents produced on behalf of the petitioners within a period of

two months from the date of receipt / production of a copy of this

order.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 3</span><p id="p_9">




</p><p id="p_10">                        This application is disposed of with the aforesaid

        observations.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                        It is made clear that if the Subdivisional Magistrate,

        Sadar, Munger does not pass an order in the case within the aforesaid

        two months, the order impugned dated 14.2.2009 shall remain stayed.
