     THIS WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
10.10.2019, ALONG WITH WP(C).25986/2019(W), THE COURT ON THE SAME
DAY DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
 WP(C).25986/2019 &amp; 26250/2019
                                    4



                                JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">          These two writ petitions require to be heard together since

   the essential factual circumstances and attributes presented in

   them are connected with each other and the reliefs to be

   granted in one will certainly affect and modulate the reliefs to

   be granted in the other.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          2. W.P(C) No.25986/2019 has been filed by an association

   of persons who call themselves "Diamond Action Council",

   Maneed and two of their members, alleging that the quarrying

   and stone crushing operations being carried on by the first

   respondent - "M/s.Diamond Aggregates" is causing depredation

   to nature and poses severe threat to human lives and safety in

   the area and therefore, prays that the Secretary of the fourth

   respondent - Maneed Grama Panchayat be directed to take

   immediate action to stop such activities. The petitioners submit

   that they have approached the Village Officer through Ext.P3;

   the Secretary of the Panchayat through Ext.P4; the District

   Collector, Ernakulam through Ext.P6 and the Pollution Control

   Board through Ext.P7 against the alleged illegal activities of

   M/s.Diamond Aggregates but allege that no action has been
 WP(C).25986/2019 &amp; 26250/2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                         5</span>


   taken on these representations until now. They, therefore, pray

   that the respondents be directed to immediately take action to

   close down the quarry and the stone crusher.

</p><p id="p_3">          3. While so, it appears that the Maneed Grama Panchayat,

   presumably on account of the complaints preferred by the

   petitioners in W.P(C) No.25986/2019 and others, issued a stop

   memo to M/s.Diamond Aggregates asking them to stop their

   quarrying activities and the said communication has been

   challenged by them by filing W.P.(C) No.26250/2019. In the

   said writ petition, the stop memo issued by the Maneed Grama

   Panchayat has been produced as Ext.P9 and M/s.Diamond

   Aggregates say that this has been issued without competence

   and without any jurisdiction. They, therefore, pray that Ext.P9 in

   this writ petition be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_4">          4. I have heard Sri.Dinesh R.Shenoy, the learned counsel

   appearing for M/s.Diamond Aggregates - petitioners in W.P.(C)

   No.26250/2019;         Sri.Georgie    Simon,     the     learned   counsel

   appearing      for   the     petitioners   in   W.P(C)    No.25986/2019;

   Sri.T.Naveen, the learned standing counsel appearing for the

   Kerala State Pollution Control Board in both cases; Sri.Sunu

   P.John, the learned standing counsel for Maneed Grama
 WP(C).25986/2019 &amp; 26250/2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          6</span>


   Panchayat in both cases and the learned Government Pleader

   appearing for the official respondents in both cases.

</p><p id="p_5">          5. From the afore narrated facts, it becomes evident that

   while the petitioners in           W.P(C) No.25986/2019 (who will

   hereinafter      be    called    the   'Action   Council')   allege   that

   M/s.Diamond Aggregates are operating their quarry and stone

   crusher illegally; the latter asserts, with equal vehemence that

   these allegations are completely wrong, since they have all the

   necessary consents, permissions and licences - including the

   necessary Environmental Clearance - issued by the competent

   Authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_6">          6. While the Action Council has foundationalised their

   allegations on certain incidents and events which they have

   mentioned       in    the writ    petition;   M/s.Diamond    Aggregates

   submits that these events and incidents do not have any

   connection with their activities, since they are operating under

   strictly controlled atmosphere and as per the stipulations and

   mandate of the various consents that they have obtained.

</p><p id="p_7">          7. In fact, Sri.Dinesh Shenoy, the learned                counsel

   appearing for         M/s.Diamond Aggregates submits that there is

   not even a whisper of an allegation by the Action Council in
 WP(C).25986/2019 &amp; 26250/2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      7</span>


   their writ petition that his client has violated the terms of any of

   the consents, or that any complaints have been preferred with

   respect to such violations before any competent Authorities. He

   adds that his client is willing to submit to any enquiry or

   investigation that this Court may deem fit to order and that they

   will co-operate with any such enquiry, since they are confident

   that their activities are well within the parameters of law and

   guided implicitly by the terms and conditions of the permissions

   granted to them.
</p>
<p id="p_8">          8. When I consider the pleadings available on record in

   W.P(C) No.25986/2019, the Action Council, in paragraph 3

   thereof, has stated as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                "It is submitted that the quarries are situated in a
          residential area and the operations are causing nuisance
          and hardships to the petitioners and other residence. The
          outburst of explosives and its sounds are intolerable to
          human brain. The explosions are done by using many
          electrical dynamites at a time. The petitioners' house
          walls were broken and damaged and the damages are so
          visible. Since explosions are made by using electrical
          dynamites, there are severe vibrations to the earth during
          the blasting, which resulted in causing cracks to the
          houses of the petitioners and other people in the locality.</blockquote><p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">          In the explosion pieces of stones are fallen on the roofs of
          the petitioners' house and courtyards and in their
          properties. Operations of the quarries are against the
          provisions of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>
          and Noise Pollution Rules. Due to the blasting, water tank
          of the nearby government school was severely damaged
          and became useless. Blasting operations are conducted
 WP(C).25986/2019 &amp; 26250/2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     8</span>


          by unskilled workers and is dangerous to people. The
          respondents have restarted blasting operations and
          crusher unit on 22.06.2018. Due to the negligence of the
          respondents, a lady worker in the crusher unit was died
          on 01.08.2017 and the Piravom police has registered a
          case as accidental death due to the undue influence of the
          respondents.     As against the illegal acts of the
          respondents, petitioners and other local people filed
          complaints before the revenue authorities and they are
          not ready to consider the complaints. Petitioners have
          filed complaints before the RDO, Muvattupuzha, District
          Collector, Ernakulam Pollution Control Board, Mining and
          Geology Wing, and Maneed Grama Panchayat. But they
          are no taking any action. Hence the suit is filed. The
          petitioners have every right to live peacefully in the
          locality without any fear, threat to life to person and
          property.    The nearly proximities of the quarry is
          surrounded by many scheduled caste colonies such as
          Rajeev     Gandhi    colony,    Murukidamattom     colony,
          Keezhethukuzhi colony in which Murukidamattom and
          Keezhethukuzhi colonies are settlement colonies and
          Rajeev Gandhi colony is a Panchayat colony have lots of
          backward schedule caste, tribes are living which have to
          protected or taken care (sic)."
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">          9. Without meaning to say that any of these allegations are

   true or otherwise, it is clear that many of the assertions

   mentioned above are based on possibilities and apprehensions

   rather than specific instances, especially because the Action

   Council and the other petitioners seem to be under the

   impression that the conduct of the quarry and the stone crusher

   by M/s.Diamond Aggregates causes deleterious consequences

   to the locality and the nature.
</p><p id="p_13"> WP(C).25986/2019 &amp; 26250/2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                            9</span>


</p><p id="p_14">          10. Though I do not intend to cast any aspersion on the

   bona fides of the Action Council, it is equally true that

   M/s.Diamond Aggregates are operating under specific licences,

   consents and permissions granted by the concerned Authorities

   and therefore, unless they are able to point out instances of

   violation or unless they are able to establish that such consents,

   permissions and licence have been obtained by M/s.Diamond

   Aggregates illegally or unlawfully, I am afraid that an omnibus

   prayer     as   sought       for   by    the   Action   Council   in   W.P(C)

   No.25986/2019 - to shut down the quarry - is not possible or

   prudent for this Court, while it acts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the

   Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_15">          11. That apart, the allegations and counter allegations of

   the parties are essentially in the realm of factual disputations,

   into which this Court cannot delve into while exercising writ

   jurisdiction and I am of the firm view that the Action Council or

   any other person who has any legitimate grievance against

   M/s.Diamond        Aggregates           must   approach    the    competent

   Authorities in terms of law, rather than seeking a blanket order

   as has been prayed for by them.
</p>
<p id="p_16">          12. The learned Government Pleader, sensing my mind as
 WP(C).25986/2019 &amp; 26250/2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       10</span>


   afore,    submitted      that   M/s.Diamond   Aggregates   have   all

   licences, consents and permissions as are required to operate

   their quarry and stone crusher and that the competent officials,

   including the Geologist will keep a close eye on their operations

   to ensure that public safety is maintained at all time and that

   disasters are averted on account of any such activity. He says

   that the concerned Geologist can always be approached by the

   Action Council or any other person, if they have any complaint

   and that in such event, it will be properly taken note of and

   necessary action taken without any authority.

</p><p id="p_17">          13. Sri.T.Naveen, the learned standing counsel for the

   Pollution Control Board, also affirms that as of now, no

   complaints have been preferred before them by any person and

   that the Board's officers are always willing and ready to react

   to any such complaints in terms of law as is required.

</p><p id="p_18">          14. Interestingly, Sri.Sunu P.John, the learned standing

   counsel for the Panchayat, submits that his client has taken a

   decision in principle to shut down all quarries within their

   territory and that they have, therefore, intimated the Action

   Council through their communication dated 03.10.2018, a copy

   of which has been produced on record as Ext.P5 in W.P(C)
 WP(C).25986/2019 &amp; 26250/2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                         11</span>


   No.25986/2019, to approach the Geologist appropriately so as

   to take necessary action against M/s.Diamond Aggregates. He

   says, therefore, that no further orders may be issued against his

   client, adding that Ext.P9 stop memo in W.P.(C) No.26250/2019

   has been issued taking note of the complaints of the residents of

   the locality including the Action Council.

</p><p id="p_19">          15. As I have already indicated above, when M/s.Diamond

   Aggregates are in possession of all licences and consents as are

   required in law, it would not be possible for this Court to

   intervene in their activities as long as it is done legally.

   However, the most pertinent question is whether they are doing

   so in compliance of law and whether the official Authorities are

   vigilant in their approach to ensure that no untoward incidents

   or violations of law are allowed to take place.

</p><p id="p_20">          16. That said, it is also equally pertinent that the Action

   Council or any other have not yet approached either the

   Geologist      or    the     other   competent     Authorities   against

   M/s.Diamond         Aggregates       complaining    violation    of   the

   conditions of the consents and permissions obtained by them

   and I am certain that they are at liberty to do so, if they feel it

   necessary, based on the factual scenario available in the area in
 WP(C).25986/2019 &amp; 26250/2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  12</span>


   question.
</p>
<p id="p_21">           17. In the afore circumstances and since I cannot find

   Ext.P9 in W.P.(C) No.26250/2019 to have been issued by the

   Panchayat after following due procedure and since it appears

   to be the product of unsubstantiated complaints made by

   certain persons, I order these writ petitions and set aside the

   said stop memo; however, leaving liberty to the Action Council

   and to the other petitioners in W.P(C) No.25986/2019 to

   approach the competent Authority, including the concerned

   Geologist, with any complaint that they may choose to make; in

   which event, all such Authorities will be obligated in law to act

   quickly and to ensure that M/s.Diamond Aggregates are acting

   within the confines of the conditions of the various consents,

   permissions and licence obtained by them and that their

   activities do not create any nuisance to the residents of the

   area.
</p>
<p id="p_22">           18. I also leave liberty to the petitioners in W.P(C)

   No.25986/2019 to challenge any of the consents, licences and

   permissions obtained by M/s.Diamond Aggregates in terms of

   law before the competent Forum, including this Court; for

   which purpose, I leave all their contentions open and clarify
 WP(C).25986/2019 &amp; 26250/2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                         13</span>


      that none of my observations in this judgment will trammel

      them in doing so.
</p>
<p id="p_23">           After   I   dictated   this   judgment,    Sri.Dinesh   Shenoy

      submitted that pending this lis, the Panchayat has again issued

      Ext.P10 stop memo and prays that the same be also set aside.

      It goes without saying that since I have set aside Ext.P9,        the

      consequential Ext.P10 order in W.P.(C) No.26250/2019 will also

      stand quashed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
