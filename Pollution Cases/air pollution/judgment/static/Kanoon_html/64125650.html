<p id="p_6">W.P.(C) 6904/2013

       Master Plan for Delhi - 2021 (MPD - 2021) came to be notified vide
notification dated 7.2.2007. The said plan contains a list of negative /
prohibited industries which are prohibited from being run in National Capital
Territory of Delhi. Annexure-III contains the list of those prohibited /
negative l industries and Item No.88 pertains to stainless steel pickling.
Clause 7.2 under the heading "Classification of Industries" provides that the
existing industrial units under prohibited category need to relocate themselves
outside Delhi, within a period of three (3) years. As a result of the aforesaid
requirement of Master Plan, stainless steel pickling industries could continue
in Delhi only for a period of three (3) years commencing 7.2.2007 and within
that period such industries were required to relocate themselves outside Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_7">2.     W.P(C) No.3404/2012 was filed by Apex Chamber of Commerce and
Industries versus NCT of Delhi and others, inter alia, challenging the
aforesaid entry no.88 in Annexure-III containing list of prohibited / negative
industries. Vide order dated 23.8.2012, a Division Bench of this Court struck
down/ quashed the aforesaid entry and accordingly also quashed the notice
dated 22.3.2012 issued by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC)
directing closure of such units only on the ground that their activity was bad/
prohibited under the Master Plan.
</p>
<p id="p_8">3.     Vide order dated 21.8.2013, the National Green Tribunal (NGT),
observing that such industries are highly polluting industries which can have a
serious impact on water, water-bodies, drains and where industrial effluent is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) No.6904/2013                                                 Page 2 of 5</span>
 discharged from such units and further noticing that such industries cannot be
established or operated without consent of DPCC, restrained such units from
carrying on their activities/ manufacturing anywhere in Delhi without
obtaining of consent from DPCC and other appropriate permissions which
were required for such operations in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_9">4.     Vide notification dated 23.9.2013, the Master Plan - 2021 was further
amended so as to re-introduce the stainless steel pickling in the list of
negative/ prohibited industries. Some of the existing units submitted
applications to DPCC seeking its consent under the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_1">Air Act</a> for
running such industries. Those applications were, however, returned to the
applicants solely on the ground that their industries have been placed in the
list of prohibited / negative industries in the Master Plan of Delhi - 2021.
Being aggrieved, the petitioners are before this Court seeking the following
reliefs:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       (i)     certiorari for quashing letter bearing number DPCC/CMC-II/SS
               Pickling/NGT/2013/43162 to 67 and Letter bearing no.
               DPCC/CMC-II/SS Picking/NGT/2013/43168 to 74 both dated
               10.10.2013 issued by respondent no.4/ DPCC to Deputy
               Commissioner (North - West), Kanjhawala and Deputy
               Commissioner (North), respectively requiring them to take
               immediate action for effective closure of units engaged in
               stainless steel pickling.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">5.     The main question which arises for consideration in this case as to
whether the period of three (3) years available to such industries to relocate
outside Delhi commenced on 7.2.2007 when Master Plan for Delhi - 2021
was notified or on 23.9.2013 when the above referred amendment in the said
plan came to be notified.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C) No.6904/2013                                                Page 3 of 5</span>
<p id="p_11"> 6.     In my view, considering that Entry no.88 of Schedule - III of MPD-
2021 came to be struck down/ quashed by a Division Bench of this Court, the
period of three (3) years available for relocation of such industries outside
Delhi commenced only from 23.9.2013 when the said plan came to be
amended. The result of this Court quashing the Entry No.88 in Third Schedule
was as if the said entry never existed in Master Plan for Delhi - 2021 when it
came to be notified. Therefore, the prohibition of running such industries in
Delhi shall be deemed to have come into force only on 23.9.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_12">       The learned counsel for DPCC submitted that such industries have
already availed the benefit of continuing in Delhi for more than three (3)
years. Even if that be so, that makes no difference, considering the order of
this Court striking down Entry no.88 in the Third Schedule. Once the said
entry was quashed, these industries became entitled to continue to operate in
Delhi subject of course to the provisions of other laws for the time being in
force including the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment Protection Act</a>, Water and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Air Pollution Act</a>
and the rules framed thereunder. If we look the matter from another angle,
after the order passed by this Court striking down the Entry no.88 of Third
Schedule nothing prevented the new industries engaged in the business of
stainless steel pickling coming into operation after obtaining other statutory
approvals. Certainly it cannot be said that such industries have enjoyed
holiday period of three (3) years contemplated under the Master Plan. Though
the units which are the petitioners before this Court may be those units which
existed even on 7.2.2007 when MPD-2021 came into force, the Court while
interpreting the provisions of Master Plan, has also to see the impact of its
interpretation on units which yet to be engaged in a business of this nature.
</p>
<p id="p_13">7.     Since the amendment in the Master Plan of Delhi has come into force
only on 23.9.2013, in my view, DPCC was not justified in returning the
applications seeking its consent solely on the ground that these activities are



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C) No.6904/2013                                                   Page 4 of 5</span>
 included in the list of prohibited industries, contained in Scheduled-III. The
DPCC, in my view, should have considered such applications for grant of its
consent on their merit and then taken an appropriate decision. I agree with the
learned counsel for the petitioners that if other laws for the time being in
force, permit DPCC to altogether reject such applications, despite such
industries have permission under Master Plan to continue in Delhi for a period
of three (3) years commencing from 23.9.2013, nothing prevents DPCC from
refusing to give its consent to the applicants. But, it must necessarily deal
with such applications on merit, in accordance with various legal provisions
including the provisions of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment Protection Act</a>, Water and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Air
Pollution Act</a> and the rules framed under such Acts.
</p>
<p id="p_14">8.     The DPCC is directed to decide the pending applications seeking its
consent, including the applications which were earlier submitted to it and
returned, as expeditiously as possible and in any case within the statutory time
prescribed in this regard. It is not open to the petitioners to resume stainless
steel pickling without obtaining consent from DPCC in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_15">9.     The letter dated 10.10.2013 issued by DPCC is hereby quashed, but
making it again clear that quashing of the said letter shall not permit the
petitioners or other industries engaged in such business to bypass the order
passed by the National Green Tribunal. In other words, so long as the order of
the National Green Tribunal remains in force, they cannot resume their
operations.
</p>
<p id="p_16">       The writ petition stands disposed of in terms of this order. There shall
be no orders as to costs. All pending applications also stand disposed of.
