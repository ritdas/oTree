</pre>
<p id="p_1">K.KALYANASUNDARAM, J.       
</p>
<p id="p_2">        This writ appeal is directed against the order passed in
W.P.(MD).No.20022 of 2017 dated 29.11.2017 whereby, this Court held that the 
provisions of Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_1">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 and
the Rules framed thereunder would not apply to the imported sand and also
issued directions to close the sand quarry, etc.
</p><p id="p_3">        2. The brief facts necessary for disposal of the appeal would run
thus:-
</p><p id="p_4">        (i) The 1st respondent herein ( hereinafter referred to as the writ
petitioner) has preferred a writ petition contending that the 1st respondent
/ writ petitioner is a Private Limited Company provided with Import and
Export Code (IEC) bearing No.0412018128 issued by the Ministry of Commerce  
and industries, the Government of India, in terms of the provisions of
Foreign Trade (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_2">Regulation) Act</a>. Since then, the writ
petitioner was doing the business.
</p><p id="p_5">        (ii) In India, for the past 10 years, there is rapid development of
infrastructure and the "natural sand" is one of the major and essential
material. Already, the natural sand was exploited from the rivers to its
maximum extend and consequently, the ecology is in peril. The deposit of
natural sand has come down rapidly in the Indian rivers due to maximum
exploitation. While its demands were very high and the price of the natural
sand has incidentally increased and in order to meet the high demand, and
control the price rise of the natural sand, the Union of India took a policy
decision to permit to import of "natural sand" from foreign countries. In
this regard, a notification dated 07.11.2014 was published by the Government
of India permitting the import of sand, subject to the only condition of
submitting quarantine in terms of the Plant Quarantine (Regulation of Import
into India) Order, 2003.
</p><p id="p_6">        (iii) It is the further case of the writ petitioner that after the
liberalisation of the import policy, the petitioner undertook an extensive
research concerning quality of "natural sand" in foreign countries to know
that the same is fit for construction purpose. They also conducted chemical
analysis test and thereafter entered into an agreement of sale with M/s.All
Works Trading Private Limited of Malaysia, on 09.09.2017, to supply river
sand of one lakh MT from Sungai Pahang River, Kuantan City, Malaysia. After
obtaining certificate of Plant Quarantine from Government of Malaysia, the
first shipment of sand of 55,443.84 MT reached Tuticorin Port in India on
14.10.2017 through Indian waters by obtaining necessary permission from the
Director General of Lighthouses and Lightships, Ministry of Shipping.
</p><p id="p_7">        (iv) It is the further case of the writ petitioner that they had paid a
sum of Rs.1,80,00,000/- (Rupees one crore and eighty lakhs only) towards Port
Wharfage Charges, Port on-board levy charges, Port Royalty Charges, Port Levy
for Shore Handling Charges, Port Royalty Charges for Shore, Labour Charges,
Customs Bill Filing Charges, Transport Charges, Yard Plot Rent, etc., through
the clearing agent viz., M/s.Janaki Traders. The writ petitioner has also
paid to the tune of Rs.38,39,347/- (Rupees thirty eight lakhs thirty nine
thousand and three and forty seven only) towards Goods and Service Tax (GST).
</p><p id="p_8">        (v) After completing the formalities with the Customs Department and
the clearance from the Plant Quarantine authorities, the imported river sand
was permitted to be taken out of the Port. The writ petitioner was  selling
the imported river sand directly to the individual customer by proper invoice
customs bill of entry and by hiring vehicles. When the river sand was in
transit, the Inspector of Police, Aralvoimozhi Police Station, Kanyakumari
District had seized the lorries along with imported sand and handed over the
same to the Revenue Divisional Officer, Kanyakumari District, who in turn
handed over the said lorries to the Assistant Director of Geology and Mines,
Kanyakumari District. The Inspector of Police has also registered a case in
Crime No.450 of 2017 under Mines and <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_3">Minerals Act</a>, 1957. It is further stated
that the 1st appellant / the District Collector Thoothukudi District had
instructed the V.O.Chidambaranar Port Trust, Tuticorin, not to allow any
private person / Government Firms or any other agency to transport the
imported sand from the Port Yard.
</p><p id="p_9">        (vi) On the basis of the instructions, the Port Trust has issued a
communication dated 24.10.2017 to the clearing agent, stating that the Port
will not permit to transport away the sand. Contending that the provisions of
Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_4">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 (hereinafter called
as <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_5">MMDR Act</a>) and Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959 (hereinafter  
called as MMCR Act) have no application to the imported sand and the
appellants have no authority to prevent this imported sand being sold to
their customers, and there is an interference with the fundamental right
guaranteed under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_6">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India, the writ
petition came to be filed for issuance of Writ of Mandamus forbearing the
respondents from insisting for licence, permit, transport slip, etc., under
the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959 for the transportation of
imported sand.
</p>
<p id="p_10">        (vii) In the counter affidavit, the averments and allegations of the
writ petitioner have been denied and the appellants further contended that
the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Illegal Mining, Transportation and Storage of
Minerals and Mineral Dealer Rules 2011 (herein after called as Rules 2011)
were framed under the enabling provisions of <a href="/doc/22457738/" id="a_7">Section 23(c)</a> of the MMDR Act to
prevent illegal mining, transportation and storage of minerals. The
definition of "minerals" in sub Rule (xiii) of Rule 2 includes all minerals
and minor minerals except sand. The term "except sand" denotes only the river
sand and exclusion of other silica sand and other sand, which is also
notified by the Government of India in the Gazette notification, dated
10.02.2015. The term "mineral dealer" has been defined under Sub-rule (xv) of
Rule 2, which states that any person, who carries on the business of buying,
selling, storing, supplying, transporting, distribution or delivering for
sale of mineral or its product and includes. There is a prohibition under
Rule 3 of Rules 2011 and the sub Rule (1) of Rule 7 deals with the
registration of imported minerals, wherein exemption has been given for
inspection, if the imported minerals of the are variety not available in
India. For the minerals available in India, all the Rules applied to the
regional mineral dealer are also applicable to the imported mineral dealer.
Rule 8 of the Rules 2011 deals with the seizure and confiscation of minerals,
which was not adhered to under the Act and Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_11">        (viii) It is further stated in the counter affidavit, that as per
<a href="/doc/1506268/" id="a_8">Section 4</a> (1<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_9">A) of MMDR Act</a>, no person shall transport or store any mineral
otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules
made thereunder. Section 21 Sub-clause (4-<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_10">A) of MMDR Act</a>, authorizes  
confiscation of any material, tool, equipment, vehicle, and other things
seized under sub-section (4) by order of the Court. Further, Section 15 of
the MMRD Act empowers the State Government to make Rules in respect of the   
mines and minerals and exercise of power.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        (ix) The sum and substance of the counter is that the Rules 2011
mandate the registration of a dealer, obtaining required permission for
transportation of the imported sand and also submission of the relevant
records connected thereto. By such submission, the respondent in the writ
petition sought dismissal of the writ petitioner?s claim.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        3. The Writ Court, after considering the rival submissions, allowed the
writ petition and issued the following directions:-
</p><p id="p_14">"(a) The State shall stop all sand mining/quarrying activities in the State
of the Tamil Nadu within six months from today and shall not open any new
sand quarries/mines in future;
</p><p id="p_15">(b) The quarries of granites and other minerals, except, jelly, have to be

</p><p id="p_16">(c) The respondents shall forthwith issue appropriate directions to the
authorities concerned enabling the importers to transport and sell the the

all the import related documents and maintain proper records reflecting the
quantity imported, sold, stock in hand and other necessary particulars before
the Mines and Commercial Taxes Departments respectively, to check evasion of 
taxes;
</p><p id="p_17">(d) The State shall depute a team with experts from the Geological Department
to identify, process and import the sands and minerals from countries which
permit export and display them for public and the 15th respondent shall cause
to effect a publication as to the countries which permit export of sand and
the procedures thereof to be complied with;
</p><p id="p_18">(e) The State shall also take a decision to import river sand by the State
owned Corporation itself to meet out the short-supply of sand within the
State, if there is no other legal impediments;
</p><p id="p_19">(f) The District Collectors and the Superintendents of Police of all the
Districts concerned, in consultation with the officials of the Commercial

to be possessed and displayed to the officers, at the check posts, if any;
</p><p id="p_20">(g) The State shall establish permanent check-posts within the State with the
officers equipped sufficiently to curb and prevent the illegal mining and

</p><p id="p_21">(h) The State shall initiate appropriate and immediate action against the
persons involved in illegal mining, transportation and storage in the State
and proceed for the permanent confiscation of the vehicle involved in the

</p><p id="p_22">(i) The State shall constitute a Committee to ascertain the loss caused to
the Government and take steps to recover the same from the Companies,  
individuals including the erring Government Servants, whose hand if found, be
immediately suspended and prosecuted as per law;  
</p><p id="p_23">(j) The imported sand must be tested before the goods are cleared, if Quality
Certificate is not produced by the importer and for that purpose, scientific
methods for testing be deployed;
</p><p id="p_24">(k) If any sale related to imported sand is proposed to be carried out, the
same has to be done by strictly following the provisions as well as the Rules
of local enactments, i.e., under the GST laws;
</p><p id="p_25">(l) The State shall be at liberty to bring in an enactment to regulate and
handle such imported sand within the State, maintenance of records, etc;
</p><p id="p_26">(m) The respondents 13 to 16 shall issue appropriate guidelines specifying
the quality of sand and its usage so as to enable the importers to get
appropriate sand with Certificate from the exporter/authorities in foreign
soil, so that the life and property of the common public is not jeopardised
and the natural wealth of the State is preserved; and
</p><p id="p_27">(n) A copy of this order be marked to all the parties concerned forthwith for
strict compliance/adherence."
</p>
<p id="p_28">        4. Assailing the order of the learned Single Judge, the appellants have
preferred this appeal, inter alia contending that the provisions of the Tamil
Nadu Prevention of Illegal Mining, Transportation and Storage of Minerals and
Mineral Dealer Rules 2011 are applicable and the definition of "sand" under
Rule 38 (c) of the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, could be relied
on, as both Rules were framed by drawing power under the MMRD Act. The State  
has powers to control the storage and transportation of imported sand also
and that the imported sand is silica sand and therefore, it could not be used
for construction and it should be used only for industrial purposes and that
the learned Single Judge issued certain directions as if it is a public
interest litigation, by travelling beyond the scope of the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_29">        5. A miscellaneous petition in C.M.P.No.11317 of 2017 is filed by one
M/s.John Saw Mill Private Limited to implead them as 7th respondent in the
writ appeal.
</p><p id="p_30">        6. By consent, the main writ appeal itself was taken up and was heard
in  detail.
</p>
<p id="p_31">        7. We have heard Mr.Vijay Narayan, learned Advocate General, 
Mr.B.Pugalaendhi, learned Additional Advocate General assisted by
Mr.V.R.Shanmuganathan, learned Special Government Pleader    
and       Mr.T.S.Mohamed Mohideen, learned Additional Government Pleader for 
the appellants and Mr.M.Vallinayagam, learned Senior Counsel appearing for
Mr.N.Viswanathan, learned counsel for R1 and Mr.V.Kakthirvel, Assistant
Solicitor General assisted by Mr.J.Jeyakumaran for R3 to R6 and Mr. Issac
Mohanlal, Learned Senior Counsel for the proposed 7th Respondent and also 
perused the materials on record.
</p>
<p id="p_32">        8. The learned Advocate General appearing for the appellants
vociferously contended that the direction of the learned Single Judge is in
the nature of Legislating laws, which could not be issued and it would amount
to transgression into the powers of Legislature and making the application of
separation of  powers redundant by placing reliance on the judgment of the
Apex Court reported in 2017 (5) SCC 16 (<a href="/doc/354320/" id="a_11">State of U.P. v. Subhash Chandra
Jaiswal</a>). It is further contended that the general direction in the public
interest could be issued only by a Division Bench and not by a Single Judge,
that too without providing an opportunity to the appellants/ State and other
lessees in the State.
</p>
<p id="p_33">        9. The learned Advocate General also relying upon the definition of the
"sand" in the Explanation to Rule 38 (C), contended that though <a href="/doc/1588675/" id="a_12">Section 2</a>
</p><p id="p_34">(xiii) of the      Rules  2011 exempt "sand" from the application, since
silica sand can be used only for industrial purpose and it is unfit for
construction and if the definition of sand under explanation to Rule 38(C) is
read into Rules 2011, then Rules 2011 would be applicable and the petitioner
would be under the obligation to get permits for storage and transportation
even in respect of the imported sands as per Rules 7 and 8 of the Rules 2011.
In this regard, the Learned Advocate General relied upon the decision in 2015
(11) SCC 513 (District  Magistrate, Haridwar v. Harish Malhotra) to contend
that the later enactment is ?pari materia?.
</p><p id="p_35">        10. The Learned Advocate General further contended that Rules 1959 and 
Rules 2011 were made by the State, only in furtherance of the powers granted
under <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_13">Sections 15</a> and <a href="/doc/22457738/" id="a_14">23</a> (c) of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_15">MMDR Act</a> and since both the Rules were 
cognate and subordinate Legislation, the definition under one Rule can be
relied on in another.
</p>
<p id="p_36">        11. It is also contended that as per <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_16">Section 4(1A)</a> of the MMDR Act,
and      Rules 1959 were amended and Rules 2011 were enacted in furtherance 
of the introduction of Sub-section, 1A to <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_17">Section 4</a> in 1999 and therefore the
appellants are well within their powers to exercise their jurisdiction over
the imported sand as well as <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_18">Section 4</a> and <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_19">4(1A)</a>, which are to be read dis-
jointly. Further the learned Advocate General contended that though the word
?regulate? would not ordinarily mean to include ?prohibit?, it may, under
certain circumstances include the power to suppress or prohibit and the scope
the word ?regulate?, which must be derived from the object of the
Legislation. However, in this case, there is no prohibition, but only
restriction. In support of his contentions, he relied on the judgments of the
Supreme Court reported in 1981 (2) SCC 205 and 1975 (1) SCC 375.  
</p>
<p id="p_37">        12. The learned Advocate General further contended that the writ
petitioner did not produce any document to show that the export was made only
after getting approval from the Government of Malaysia and the sand does not
contain any metals and no quality analysis was done by the State. Admittedly
the imported sand is only ?Silica sand?, as per the EXIM code and therefore,
the writ petitioner has to register under Rule 2 of Rules 2011.
</p><p id="p_38">        13. The learned Advocate General further relied on the Foreign Trade
Policy for the period from 01.04.2015 to 31.03.2020, the Kerala Minor Mineral
Concession Rules, 2015 and the Goa (Prevention of Illegal Mining, Storage,
and Transportation of Minerals) Act, 2013 and contended that the Rules akin
to Tamil Nadu Rules would cover imported minerals and that as per the Foreign
Trade Policy, covered  the importer, who is obliged to follow domestic laws.
If the authority over the imported sand is taken away, then the vehicles
under the garb of transporting imported sand, are likely to transport sand
illegally and would breed illegal mining.
</p>
<p id="p_39">        14. The learned Advocate General also contended that the refusal of the
learned Singled Judge in coming to the issue as to whether the imported sand
is fit for construction purpose or not, would itself vitiate the order and
that the quality of the sand is very important, as it could affect the life
and safety of the people in the State and that there is a over-riding public
interest in the transportation and storage of imported sand. It is also
contended that the sand is sold on-line and the on-line permits are issued by
the quarries of the PWD. Since the power of the Government to quarry under
<a href="/doc/25417879/" id="a_20">Section 38(A)</a> of Rules 1959 was approved by the Apex Court in a judgment 
reported in 2006 (4) SCC 517, the order of the learned Single Judge is
against the dictum laid down by the Supreme Court. Further, the Courts have
been emphasizing for balance between the development and environmental  
protection. While so, the ban on mining on the river bank is unwarranted.
</p>
<p id="p_40">        15. The learned Advocate General further submitted that the Government
has taken steps to curb the illegal mining and steps were taken for fresh
survey, site selection, boundary demarcation, sensitisation of the officials
on the environmental impact of sand mining, CCTV monitoring, District Level
Monitoring and State Level Monitoring by task force with provisions for
appeal, the centralised control room, creation of legal room, liability of
contractors, mine closure and plan and promotion of M-sand. The learned
Advocate General also relied upon a judgment of the Supreme Court reported in
2016 10 SCC 165, AIR 1961 Supreme Court 232, AIR 1962 Supreme Court 1406 and     
1985 2 SCC 116 and the Full Bench Judgment of the Kerala High Court in 
WP(C).No.4484 of 2012 and sought to set aside the order of the learned Single
Judge. In the course of arguments, the Learned Advocate General fairly
submitted that Rules 38 (A), 38 (B) and 38(C) of Minor Mineral Concession
Rules would not apply for imported sand.
</p>

<p id="p_41">        16. Per contra, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the 1st
respondent / writ petitioner urged that the learned Single Judge has rightly
appreciated the provisions, and the judgments including the Division Bench
judgment, wherein Rules 38(A) and 38(C) where upheld and it was rightly held
that the existing provisions including <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_21">MMDR Act</a> did not deal with the
imported sand. The learned Senior Counsel further contended that the imported
sand was permitted to meet out the demand of natural sand and to control the
price, which had escalated after maximum exploitation of rivers and putting
the ecology in peril. Further, placing reliance upon the certificates of
analysis, certificate of phytosanitary, invoice and certificates of Plant
Quarantine issued by the Quarantine Officer, Tuticorin, the test report
issued by the Principal of Government College of Engineering, Tirunelveli, it
is contended that the sand was imported with due certificates from Malaysia.
Therefore, it could not be said as smuggled sand and further Plant Quarantine
certificate as directed by the Central Government was obtained after
examination of sand by appropriate authorities under the Union of India and
the Principal of Government Engineering College of the State has tested, who
gave a certificate that it is a river sand.
</p>

<p id="p_42">        17. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the first respondent /
writ petitioner also referred to the preamble of the MMRD Act to contend that
the usage of word ?under the control? found in preamble, would make it clear
that the Act is not applicable to imported sand and therefore, the Rules
deriving powers from the Act cannot cover imported foreign sand and any such
policy or Rules contrary to the main Act, would be void. Pointing out to Para
3 of the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition, it is contended
that the argument of the Learned Advocate General  that the learned Single
Judge, travelled beyond the scope of the writ petition is unacceptable, since
the learned Single Judge relied upon the judgement of the Apex Court reported
in 2010 (13) SCC 1 in this context.
</p><p id="p_43">        18. The learned Senior Counsel relying upon the definition of Rule
2(xiii), contended that the sand was excluded from the application of Rules
2011 and since the object of both 1959 and 2011 Rules are different, they
cannot be treated as     pari materia. The definition under one Rule cannot
be read into the other, unless there is a specific reference to that effect.
So far as the quality of the sand is concerned, the learned Senior Counsel
contended that silica is a part of the sand and the imported sand contains
silica of 81.6%, which can be used for construction purpose and only when the
percentage of silica is higher, i.e., over 95%, it can be used purely for
industrial purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_44">        19. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the first respondent /
writ petitioner also contended that since the Central Government has
permitted the import of sand,  though the duty along with GST has been
remitted, the State Government instead of encouraging importers and for
obvious reasons, interfered with their lawful trade. Hence, the writ
petitioner cannot be prevented from transporting and selling the sand, as it
would violate the rights granted under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_22">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution
of India. Further, it was also pointed out that the imported sand is an
alternative sand, like M-sand, and by encouraging the import, the river-bed
can be preserved, thereby, curtailing the hazardous illegal mining. The
learned Senior Counsel further relied upon the judgments in AIR 2004 Madras
151 , 1995 (2) SCC 402, 2014 (9) SCC 657, 2003 (4) SCC 753and 2010 (13) SCC 1   
and sought dismissal of the Writ Appeal and seeks for early release of sand,
as the delay is causing severe hardship to the writ petitioner.
</p><p id="p_45">        20. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the proposed 7th
respondent, is sailing along with the writ petitioner, and he contended that
the proposed 7th respondent had purchased the sand from the writ petitioner
and delaying the release of sand from the Port is affecting him and causing
loss and hence, he sought to implead the 7th respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_46">        21. Further, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the proposed 7th
respondent, while countering the arguments of the learned Advocate General,
contended that it is horrendous plea that the Silica sand is hazardous and it
cannot be used for construction. The fear of silicosis is applicable only
when the stone or silicon blocks are pulverized, enabling the formation of
dust, whereas in the case of Silica sand, it is in the form of grain or
quarts and therefore, there is no possibility of dust hazardous to health.
Further relying upon the provisions under <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_23">MMDR Act</a>, MMCR Rules and Rules   
2011, he contended that the learned Single Judge has held that under the
existing provision, there is no necessity to either register or obtain
licence for the storage, transportation and sale of sand imported from
outside India and the existing laws are applicable only to the sand mined
within India and the Rules are only restricted to Mines and Minerals within
the State and that the Rules 2011 are not applicable for imported sand.
</p>
<p id="p_47">        22. It is further contended that in the absence of specific law for
maintaining the need for transit pass for the imported sand, insisting upon
the same would violate the fundamental right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_24">Article
19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India, and reliance was placed on the
judgment of the Supreme Court reported in 2006 (2) SCC 545 (<a href="/doc/1681170/" id="a_25">State of Bihar
and others v. Project Uchcha Vidya, Sikshak Sangh and others</a>). Insofar as
Rules of Kerala and Goa States are concerned, they have no relevancy  and
they are different from the Tamil Nadu Rules and in any case, in the absence
of enabling provisions under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_26">Central Act</a>, the Rules are void and if put
to test, they have to be struck down. It was also contended by the learned
Senior Counsel that the definition in one Act or Rules cannot be imported to
another, as the scope and applicability of the Rules are different. In
support of his contention, he relied on the judgment of Supreme Court in 1981
(2) SCC 308 (<a href="/doc/769281/" id="a_27">Union of India v. R.C.Jain</a>) and AIR 1962 Supreme Court 847
(<a href="/doc/1271790/" id="a_28">Jumma Masjid v. Kodimaniandra Deviah</a>), and further contended that the need
of the hour is to protect the environment and the balance of demand for sand
by liberalising the imports. Hence, the learned Senior Counsel sought
dismissal of the writ appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_48">        23. We have heard the rival submissions and perused the materials
available on record.
</p>
<p id="p_49">        24. After hearing the parties, this Court finds that the following
questions arise for consideration:-
</p><p id="p_50">(1) Whether the writ petitioner is liable to register and seek permits for
storage, transportation and sale of imported sand from outside india as per
the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_29">MMDR Act</a>, 1957, TNMMR 1959 and Tamil Nadu Prevention of Illegal Mining,  
Transportation and storage of Minerals and Mineral Dealers Rules 2011?
(2) Whether the directions issued by the writ court exercising its powers
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_30">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India needs interference?
(3) Whether this Court has a legal obligation/mandate to preserve ecology,
i.e Sand, Forests, Water, Air, etc for the present and for future generations
as guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_31">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India by issuing
appropriate   directions?

</p>
<p id="p_77">26. Before, going into the rival contentions, it is necessary to decide,
whether the impleading party is entitled to be impleaded. The impleading
party claims to be a purchaser of sand from the writ petitioner. In view of
the impugned actions, he is unable to receive the sand. Therefore, under the
circumstances, this court finding force in the contentions of the Learned
Senior Counsel for the proposed party, allows C.M.P.No.11317/2017 impleading 
the proposed party as the 7th respondent in the Writ Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_78">27. Now coming to the first question, it has been urged before this court
that the existing Rules, more particularly the Rules, 2011 would be
applicable to the imported sand. A perusal of the judgment of the Learned
Single Judge would indicate that the judgment was rendered after meticulously
considering all the provisions relied upon by either side.  At this juncture,
it is necessary to refer to the findings of the Learned Single judge on the
applicability of the Rules to the imported sand:-
</p><p id="p_79">?23.1. A cursory perusal of the aforesaid provisions throws lime-light on the
issue that revolved around for consideration before this Court and thus, the
following could be culled out for better appreciation: The Mines and Minerals
(Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_38">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 deals with reconnaissance, prospecting
and mining operations within the country of India. The scope and object of
the act is spelled out in <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_39">Section 4</a> extracted above. <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_40">The Act</a> does not
contemplate or deal with imports. <a href="/doc/1632341/" id="a_41">Section 13</a> of the Act enables the Central
Government to make rules and exercising the power, the Minor Concession 
Rules, 1960 were framed. <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_42">Section 15</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Development 
and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_43">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957, enables the State Government, by notification in
the Official Gazette, to make rules for regulating the grant of quarry
leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor
minerals and for the purposes connected therewith.
</p><p id="p_80">Similarly, by virtue of <a href="/doc/1814464/" id="a_44">Section 23-C</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Development
and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_45">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957, the State Government may, by notification in the
Official Gazette, make rules for preventing illegal mining, transportation
and storage of minerals and for the purposes connected therewith.
</p>
<p id="p_81">23.2. Further, the above provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development
and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_46">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957, make it amply clear that the State Government(s)
is/are given with such powers to make rules for regulating the grant of
quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor
minerals and for purposes connected therewith and also to make rules for
preventing illegal mining, transportation and storage of minerals. The words
?transportation and storage? will have to be read harmoniously with the
object of the enactment or empowerment of the states to enact rules, viz-a-
viz to prevent illegal mining, quarying or reconnaissance or prospecting
operations. The words ?transportation and storage? can only mean the
transportation and storage of illegally mined minerals. When the parent act
from which powers are derived does not deal with imports, the rules cannot
framed in 1959 and 2011 cannot contemplate such a preposition when the import 
of natural sand has been permitted with a condition to obtain plant
quarantine certificate from 2014 onwards.
</p><p id="p_82">...
</p><p id="p_83">26. A perusal of the above Rules, explicitly makes it lucid that the scope of
the Rules was to regulate the quarrying of minor minerals, including sand and
regulate the stocking, transportation and sale of such quarried minor
minerals, within the State of Tamil Nadu. After introduction of Rule 38-A,
the mining activity is to be done only by the Public Works Department and
when a person purchases sand from the Department, he has to obtain a licence 
for storage and transportion. The Rules does deal with the imported sand, be
it ordinary sand or silica sand or any other form or for the matter of fact,
it cannot deal as because in the first place, the Rules did not deal with the
import, the Rules were framed in 1959 and the permission to import with a
Plant Quarantine Certificate has been accorded in 2014. Also, The
introduction of Rules 38-A, 38-B and 38-C did not alter the original
position. At this juncture, it is to be borne in mind that the object of
introduction of the Rules in 2003, was only to restrict the right of
quarrying of private individuals and increase the role of the State, more
particularly, the Public Works Department. The Rules, in the opinion of this
Court, can apply only to the sand quarried by the Public Works Department and
the restrictions imposed on transportation, stocking and sale of sand would
apply only to the sand purchased from Public Works Department or licencee.
</p>
<p id="p_84">27. A conjoint reading of Rule 38-C with other Rules and Appendixes will
reveal that it deals with issuance of transport permit to the licencee by the
Public Works Department or when the licencee effects a sale and when a sale
slip is to be duly authenticated by the Taluk Head Quarters Deputy Tahsildar.
A thorough scrutiny of various Forms in APPENDIX XII, XVII, XVIII, XIX, XX
and XXII would illustrate that the restrictions in Rule 38-C are applicable
only to the sand quarried within the State and purchased from the Public
Works Department and a licencee, as all the Forms contained columns only 
demanding the place, survey number, etc., where the sand was quarried and
stored. The Explanation to the Rules also makes it very clear that
'stockyard' means the place where the licencee stores the sand purchased from
the Public Works Department and 'sale slip' is to authenticate that the sand
from such stockyard has been sold. 
</p><p id="p_85">...
</p><p id="p_86">31. Further, as per the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Illegal Mining,
Transportation and Storage of Minerals and Mineral Dealers Rules, 2011, the
Transport Permit and Transit Pass in form F, would show that it should
indicate the payment of royalty / seigniorage fee. In case of importer, there
is no question of payment of royalty /seigniorage. Hence, the said Form is
not applicable. The Rules also do not deal with the imported minerals. As
again, the object was only to curb illegal mining, transportation and storage
of minerals, similar to the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959,
which was applicable for minor minerals secured within the state. The words
?transportation and storage? will have to be read keeping in mind the object
and the circumstances under which the Rules were framed. It only implies that
not only mining must be legal, the transportation and storage of the mined
mineral must also be legal.
</p><p id="p_87">32. Hence, the conditions prescribed in the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Illegal
Mining, Transportation and Storage of Minerals and Mineral Dealers Rules,
2011 cannot be imposed on the importers. The word 'import' used in Rule 7 is
applicable in cases of minerals imported from other States as there is only a
ban in movement of sand from one State to another. Similarly, the Rules came
into force in 2011 and therefore, it cannot be extended to an import
permitted by the import policy of the year 2012 and revised by the
notification dated 07.11.2014 issued by the Department of Director General of
Trade and Finance to obtain a Plant Quarantine Certificate, under the
Regulations which though was in vogue in 2003 itself. Therefore, this Court
accepting the contention of the petitioner, rejects the stand of the State
that the Rules are applicable to the imported goods and therefore, on this
ground alone, the petitioner is entitled to succeed.?
</p>
<p id="p_88">28. As rightly contended by the Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the 1st
and 7th respondents and upon perusal of the preamble and the entire
provisions of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_47">MMDR Act</a>, this Court can only come to the conclusion that the
parent Act, from which the rule making power is derived by the State
Governments itself does not deal with imported sand from another country and
is applicable only for the development and regulation of mines and minerals
under the control of the Union. Though it could be contended that once the
sand is imported, the same would fall under the control of the union, the
provisions of the Act do not contemplate such a situation. Further, this
court is in complete consonance with the findings of the Learned Single Judge
that the provisions of <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_48">Sections 15</a> and <a href="/doc/179493821/" id="a_49">23C</a> do not empower the States to deal
with imported sand. Also, the Judgments of the Division Bench upholding the
validity of Rules 38A and 38C will in no way affect the contentions of the
writ petitioner as held by the Learned Single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_89">29. It is pertinent to mention here though it was contended by the appellants
in the writ petition that Rule 38C would empower the appellants to  exercise
their authority over imported sand also, now a stand is taken that the
definition of ?sand? in explanation to Rule 38C must be read into 2011 rules
as both originate from the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_50">MMDR Act</a>, 1959 and are to be considered as Pari
materia. The following judgments were also relied upon by the Learned
Advocate General:-
</p><p id="p_90">(i) District  Magistrate, Haridwar v. Harish Malhotra [(2015) 11 SCC 513]:-
"12. Notification No. 145/XXVII(5)Entertainment Tax/2005 dated 17-8-2005 does
not apply to the respondent as it seeks to tax ?exhibition by means of
video?. The respondent's activities are not covered by the aforementioned
expression. For the definition of the said expression the U.P. Cinemas
(Regulation) Act, 1955 has to be referred even though the notification has
been issued under the U.P. Entertainments and Betting Tax Act, 1979. The
expression can be said to be in pari materia and definition of a term under
one Act, can be used to interpret provisions of rules under the other Act."
</p>
<p id="p_91">(ii) <a href="/doc/114237665/" id="a_51">Hiral P. Harsora v. Kusum Narottamdas Harsora</a>, [(2016) 10 SCC 165]:-
"46. We were given to understand that the aforesaid Bill lapsed, after which
the present Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 22-8-2005, and was then
passed by both Houses. It is interesting to note that the earlier 2002 Bill
defined ?respondent? as meaning ?any person who is?.? without the addition of
the words ?adult male?, being in consonance with the object sought to be
achieved by the Bill, which was pari materia with the object sought to be
achieved by the present Act. We also find that, in another Act which seeks to
protect women in another sphere, namely, the Sexual Harassment of Women at

noticed that the prefix ?adult male? is conspicuous by its absence. The 2002
Bill and the 2013 Act are in tune with the object sought to be achieved by
statutes which are meant to protect women in various spheres of life. We have
adverted to the aforesaid legislation only to show that Parliament itself has
thought it reasonable to widen the scope of the expression ?respondent? in
the 2013 Act so as to be in tune with the object sought to be achieved by
such legislations."

when the object of both the rules are different, the definition or expression
under one enactment cannot be imported into another. Reliance is placed as

</p><p id="p_94">"1. The question for consideration in this appeal is whether the Delhi
Development Authority is a ?local authority? whose employees are taken out of
the purview of the <a href="/doc/720619/" id="a_56">Payment of Bonus Act</a>, 1965, by <a href="/doc/31687231/" id="a_57">Section 32(iv)</a> of that Act,
which provides that nothing in the Act shall apply to employees employed by
an establishment engaged in any industry carried on by or under the authority
of any Department of the Central Government or State Government or a Local
Authority. It appears that for about ten years prior to 1973-74 bonus was
paid to the employees of the Delhi Development Authority but it was stopped
thereafter on the advice of the Ministry of Law. The employees questioned the
stoppage of the payment of bonus by filing Civil Writ Petition 1139 of 1979
in the Delhi High Court. The High Court allowed the writ petition and the
Union of India and the Delhi Development Authority have preferred this
appeal, after obtaining special leave of this Court under, <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_58">Article 136</a> of the
Constitution. The expression ?local authority? is not defined in the <a href="/doc/720619/" id="a_59">Payment
of Bonus Act</a>. One must, therefore, turn to the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_60">General Clauses Act</a> to
ascertain the meaning of the expression. <a href="/doc/142884/" id="a_61">Section 3(31)</a> defines Local
Authority as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_95">??Local Authority?? shall mean a Municipal Committee, District Board, Body of
Port Commissioners or other authority legally entitled to, or entrusted by
the Government with, the control or management of a municipal or local fund.?
?Local fund? is again not defined in the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_62">General Clauses Act</a>. Though the
expression appears to have received treatment in the Fundamental Rules and
the Treasury Code, we refrain from borrowing the meaning attributed to the
expression in those Rules as it is not a sound rule of interpretation to seek
the meaning of words used in an Act, in the definition clause of other
statutes. The definition of an expression in one Act must not be imported
into another. ?It would be a new terror in the construction of Acts of
Parliament if we were required to limit a word to an unnatural sense because
in some Act which is not incorporated or referred to such an interpretation
is given to it for the purposes of that Act alone? (per Loreburn, L.C. in
Macbeth &amp; Co. v. Chislett [1910 AC 220 : 102 LT 82] ). For the same reason we
refrain from borrowing upon the definition of ?local authority? in enactments
such as the <a href="/doc/71679/" id="a_63">Cattle Trespass Act</a>, 1871 etc. as the High Court has done."

fields, and under different conditions, and we see no ground for reading a

1 : 2014 SCC OnLine SC 586 at page 689  

"52. An argument raised by the appellants herein is the issue relating to the
?doctrine of pari materia?. It is contended that since the ESI Act does not
define the term ?shop?, the said definition may be ascertained in the light
of the definitions under the relevant Shops and Commercial Establishments Act
as enacted by the respective State Legislatures, since the purpose and object
of both the enactments are one and the same. 
</p>
<p id="p_99">53. For the above purpose, it would be necessary to look into the concept of
?doctrine of pari materia? and further ascertain whether the given statutes
are in fact pari materia with the ESI Act. It is settled law that two
statutes are said to be in pari materia with each other when they deal with
the same subject-matter. The rationale behind this rule is based on the
interpretative assumption that words employed in legislations are used in an
identical sense. However, this assumption is rebuttable by the context of the
statutes. According to Sutherland in Statutes and Statutory Construction,
Vol. 2, 3rd Edn.:
</p><p id="p_100">?Statutes are considered to be in pari materia to pertain to the same
subject-matter when they relate to the same person or things, or to the same
class of persons or things, or have the same purpose or object.?
</p>
<p id="p_101">56. On a perusal of the above, it may be said that the said Acts, though they
may relate to labour and workmen, are in essence intended to be regulatory.
<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_75">The Act</a>s require mandatory registration of the establishments covered by the
respective statutes, set out provisions relating to working hours, wages,
annual leave, etc. and further prescribe penalties for non-compliance with
the said provisions. <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_76">The Act</a>s further enable the local authorities to appoint
local inspectors who are given certain powers to ensure the compliance with
the provisions of the Acts. Under sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_77">Section 48</a> of the 1948
Act such inspectors would also be deemed to be inspectors under the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_78">Minimum  
Wages Act</a>, 1948. Further, the 1961 Act under Chapter V makes an express   
reference to the applicability of the <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_79">Payment of Wages Act</a>, 1936 and the
Workmen's <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_80">Compensation Act</a>, 1923. There is a clear absence of reference to 
any other legislation in the aforesaid provisions, thereby indicating that
the legislature intended to exclude the applicability of the ESI Act.
</p>
<p id="p_102">57. The ESI Act, on the other hand, as has been noticed in the Preamble
quoted earlier, is an Act that provides for certain benefits to employees in
case of sickness, maternity and employment injuries. It establishes
Employees' State Insurance Corporation for the administration of the scheme
of Employees' State Insurance and sets up an Employees' State Insurance Fund  
in which all contributions paid under the ESI Act are held and accordingly
administered. The ESI Act also establishes a Special Court for adjudication
of disputes and claims under the same.
</p>
<p id="p_103">58. It can be concluded that though the ESI Act, the 1948 Act and the 1961
Act deal with labour and workmen, in essence and spirit they have a different
scope and application. <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_81">The Act</a>s do not appear to have any overlap in their
fields of operation and have mutually exclusive schemes. Therefore, the
argument that the Acts are pari materia with each other, must fail.
....
</p><p id="p_104">61. It is to be noticed that every word of a language is flexible to connote
different meanings when used in different contexts. That is why it is said
that words are not static, but dynamic and the Court should adopt the dynamic
meaning which upholds the validity or scheme of any legislation. It is
settled law that the words used in a particular statute cannot be used to
interpret the same word in a different statute especially in light of the
fact that the two statutes are not pari materia with each other and have a
wholly different scheme from one another.

</p><p id="p_106">69. In the matters regarding Royal Western India Turf Club Ltd., it is
brought to our notice by Shri J.P. Cama, learned counsel, that there are
other issues involved as well. Therefore, we now send back the matters i.e.

</p><p id="p_108">"8. According to Rule 7(b), the appointing authority is the Commandant and
since the DIG is of higher rank, there is no illegality in the order passed
by him in passing the order of dismissal. Just because the IG's approval is
required for the purpose of appointment or promotion, the position of the
Commandant as the appointing authority is not changed and the IG does not 
become the appointing authority. If the submission made is accepted, it would
mean addition of words or expressions in Rule 27. It is not a case of casus
omissus as contended. A construction which requires for its support addition
of words has to be avoided. The words of a statute never shared, in
interpretation, be added or subtracted from without almost a necessity. It is
contrary to all rules of construction to read words into a statute unless it
is absolutely necessary to do so. Courts cannot reframe the words used by the
legislature as they have no power to legislate. A matter which, for the sake
of argument, should have been provided but has not been provided for in a
statute cannot be supplied by the courts as to do so will be legislation and
not construction. (See Johnson v. Moreton [(1978) 3 All ER 37 : 1980 AC 37 :
(1978) 3 WLR 538 (<a href="/doc/1879682/" id="a_83">HL)] and Baliram Waman Hiray (Dr) v. Justice B. Lentin</a>
[(1988) 4 SCC 419 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 941 : AIR 1988 SC 2267] .) There is no
presumption that a casus omissus exists, and language permitting the courts
should avoid creating a casus omissus where there is none. Therefore, the
conclusion of the Division Bench in holding that the order of dismissal
passed by the DIG was legal, does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant
interference."
</p>
<p id="p_109">31. A careful consideration of the above judgments would reveal that when the
language used in the statue is clear and unambiguous and when the object of
the enactments are different, there cannot be any reference or incorporation.
In fact, in both the judgments relied upon by the appellants, the Apex Court
has ultimately rejected the contention holding that when the parent act was
not applicable, reading into the same is not permissible. In the case on
hand, the Rules 2011 under definition of Minerals in Rule 2 (xiii)
specifically excludes? sand?. While so, when there is  a specific exclusion,
the definition in other rules cannot be referred or relied upon, more so,
when the Parent Act itself does not deal with imported sand. A plea was made
on behalf of the appellants that <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_84">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_85">4</a> (1A) have to be read
disjointly. This Court is not agreeing with the said contention, as the
provisions have to be read harmoniously with the object of the enactment.
<a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_86">Section 4</a> deals with reconnaissance permit, prospecting or mining operations.
Sub <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_87">section 1A</a> was introduced with effect from 18-12-1999. When a sub section
is introduced under a particular section, it has to be read in conjunction
with the object of the section.  <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_88">Section 4</a> states that no operations shall be
permitted in any area except under and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of permit or licence or lease granted under the Act. Therefore,
the transportation and storage referred in the Sub-<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_89">section 1A</a> can only apply
to  the mined or quarried mineral under the reconnaissance permit or
prospecting licence or mining lease. Further, as rightly held by the Learned
Single Judge that <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_90">Section 15</a> empowers the State to make rules for regulating
the grant of quarrying lease and <a href="/doc/179493821/" id="a_91">Section 23C</a> deals with measures to prevent
illegal mining, transportation and storage of minerals, it does not deal with
import from another country.
</p>
<p id="p_110">32. Insofar as the Kerala and Goa Rules and the Foreign Trade Policy are
concerned, the same are not applicable as the Tamil Nadu Rules do not contain
such specific provisions regarding import from foreign country and more so in
the light of the fact that the Act, itself does not deal with imported
minerals from another country. What is not available in the statute, cannot
be created by drawing inference from another statute.
</p>
<p id="p_111">33. Insofar as the constitutional right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_92">Article 301</a>, it has
been contended that right is not absolutely free but is subject to
limitations. The following judgments were relied upon by the appellants:-

</p><p id="p_117">"Regularisation" by stating that the word 'free' in <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_97">Article 301</a> does not mean
freedom from regulation. There is a clear distinction between laws
interfering with freedom to carry out the activities constituting trade and
laws imposing on those engaged therein rules of proper conduct or other
restraints directed to the due and orderly manner of carrying out the
activities. This distinction is described as regulation. The word
?regulation? has no fixed connotation. Its meaning differs according to the
nature of the thing to which it is applied. The true solution, perhaps, in
any given case, could be found by distinguishing between features of the
transaction or activity in virtue of which it fell within the category of
trade, commerce and intercourse and those features which, though invariably
found to occur in some form or another in the transaction or action are not
essential to the conception. What is relevant is the contrast between the
essential attribute of trade and commerce and the incidents of the
transaction which do not give it necessarily the character of trade and
commerce. Such matters relating to hours, equipment, weight/size of load,
lights, which form the incidents of transportation, even if inseparable, do
not give the transaction its essential character of trade or commerce. Laws
for Government of such incidents ?regulate? "<a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_98">Article 301</a>, with which Part

key to the solution of the problems posed by the whole part. The freedom

</p>


<p id="p_119">        34. There is no quarrel over the ratio laid down in the above
judgments. The answer to this contention is found in paragraphs 33 and 38 of
the judgment of the Learned Single Judge, wherein the right of the State to
bring in an enactment under <a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_102">Article 304</a> has been accepted. We agree with the
said findings. The State is empowered to bring in an enactment subject to
legal scrutiny. The rules framed, as rightly held by the Learned Single
Judge, are in derivation of powers under <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_103">Sections 15</a> and <a href="/doc/179493821/" id="a_104">23C</a> and not under
<a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_105">Article 304</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_120">        35. Insofar as the Full Bench Judgment of the Kerala High Court is
concerned, the same is not applicable to the facts of this case as evident
from the very first para that the question of law therein was the powers of
the authorities to deal with sand brought into the State of Kerala from other
States, when there was a ban in the rules of the other States. In the present
case, the import is not from another State, but from another country and the
Union Government has permitted the import of sand.
</p>
<p id="p_121">        36. The next contention that was raised by the learned Advocate General
is that the power to regulate would under certain circumstances include the
power to prohibit. The judgment in 1985 2 SCC 116 (<a href="/doc/87528/" id="a_106">K.Ramanathan v. State of
Tamil Nadu</a>) has been relied upon. The said contention cannot be accepted for
the simple reason that the delegation of power to regulate, does not empower
the States to deal with imported sand. As rightly held by the learned Single
Judge, the policy decisions on import and export are within the domain of the
Union Government under Entry 41 of the Union List of Seventh Schedule. Also,
the existing rules are only to regulate the mining/quarrying, transportation
and storage of such mined/quarried minerals located within the State and
therefore, the right to prohibit can also be only with regard to such
minerals.
</p>
<p id="p_122">        37. By relying upon the judgment of 2006 4 SCC 517 (<a href="/doc/975323/" id="a_107">State of Tamil Nadu
v. P.Krishnamurthy</a>), wherein the challenge to Rule 38A of the MMCR rules was
rejected, the learned Advocate General contended that the State has the right
of monopoly to quarry. The same is not in dispute that by virtue of Rule 38A,
the quarrying activity is to be made only by PWD of the State. But, that is
not the point of dispute in the present case. The grant of monopoly to the
State to quarry does not mean that the State is empowered to restrict the
import, which falls within the domain of Central Government.
</p>

<p id="p_123">        38. It was further contended  that the imported sand is a silica sand
which is not fit of construction activities and that it can be used only for
industrial purposes. It was also contended that it is not clear whether the
export was carried out with the knowledge of the Malaysian Government or not
and without subject to any test by the state, the imported sand cannot be
permitted to be used for construction activities.  The said contention, in
the opinion of this Court, cannot be countenanced. As rightly contended by
the learned counsels for the contesting respondents, the certificate of
analysis and phytosanitary certificate have been issued by the Government of
Malaysia, which find place in the typed set of papers filed by the appellants
themselves. Therefore, it cannot be contended that the import was made
without the knowledge of the Malaysian Government. Also from the guidelines
issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Department of
Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia as placed by the respondents, it is evident
that the rivers in Malaysia are covered with sand blocking the passage and
the Government itself has been encouraging the dredging activity and such
sand are sold.
</p>
<p id="p_124">        39. Insofar as the contention that the sand imported with 81.6% of
silica is not fit for construction, this court is of the view that the same
is not backed by scientific evidence. On the contrary, from the materials
available before this Court about sand, it is clear that it is only when the
percentage of silica is over 95%, it could be used for industrial purpose.
Therefore, the contention that  the sand with higher silica is only
industrial sand cannot be accepted. From a perusal of uses and specifications
of silica sand by I.J. Mclaws, it could be seen that the silica sand can be
used for Industrial purpose only when the presence of silica is 99% for
glass,  96% (min) for transit pipe, 96.40 % for refractory brick and so on.
In short, the presence of silica must be more than 95%.  It is also pertinent
to mention here from the report of Dr.RavindraPatnayaka, Assistant Professor
in Architecture, the most common constituent of sand is silica, usually in
the form of quartz.  The river sand also will contain silica. Further, in all
the documents relating to import, it is clearly mentioned that the sand
imported is river sand for construction purpose. Also, the government of
Karnataka has already imported river sand from Malaysia to curb illegal
mining and at the same time to satisfy the demand. There are many sky 
scrapers in Malaysia as well. Therefore, the contention of the appellants
that the imported sand from Malaysia is not fit for construction activities,
is rejected. At this juncture, the plant quarantine certificate has been
issued by the appropriate central authority and the principal of a government
college under the Department of Technical Education has also certified the
imported sand to be river sand.
</p>
<p id="p_125">        40.     Therefore, under the above facts and circumstances, this Court
finds that the existing Act and Rules are applicable only to sand and
minerals quarried in India and the Learned Single Judge had rightly rejected
the contentions of the appellants and held that the appellants cannot rely
upon the existing provisions to insist the respondents / writ petitioners to
obtain permits for storage and transportation of Imported Sands and the
appeal on this question fails.
</p>
<p id="p_126">        41. On the second question, it has been agitated by the appellants that
the Learned Single Judge has travelled beyond the scope of the writ petitions
and issued certain directions, which the court is not entitled to unless it
is a public interest litigation. It was also contended that the directions
issued are in the nature of legislative directions and the Courts do not have
such powers to issue such directions. The Judgement of the Apex Court in 2017
5 SCC 163 (<a href="/doc/354320/" id="a_108">State of U.P. v. Subhash Chandra Jaiswal</a>)  in support of his
contention that the High Court must not travel beyond the scope of the
petition and should not issue directions which are in the sphere of policy.
</p>
<p id="p_127">"23. Some of the directions, as we perceive, are in the sphere of policy. A
court cannot take steps for framing a policy. As is evincible, the directions
issued by the High Court and the queries made by it related to various
spheres which, we are constrained to think, the High Court should not have
gone into. It had a very limited lis before it. Be it stated, the directions
may definitely show some anxiety on the part of the learned Judges, but it is
to be remembered that directions are not issued solely out of concern. They
have to be founded on certain legally justifiable principles that have roots
in the laws of the country. In this regard, we may fruitfully refer to the
following passage from <a href="/doc/49529177/" id="a_109">State of U.P. v. Anil Kumar Sharma [State of U.P</a>. v.
Anil Kumar Sharma, (2015) 6 SCC 716 : (2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 368] : (SCC p. 722,

reiterated the principle that the ?role of the Judge is that of a referee. I
can blow my judicial whistle when the ball goes out of play; but when the
game restarts I must neither take part in it nor tell the players how to
play?. Anand, C.J. added:
</p><p id="p_128">?The judicial whistle needs to be blown for a purpose and with caution. It
needs to be remembered that court cannot run the Government. It has the duty
of implementing the constitutional safeguards that protect individual rights
but they cannot push back the limits of the Constitution to accommodate the
challenged violation.??
</p><p id="p_129">24. Be it noted, the said case also arose from the High Court of Allahabad
where sweeping directions were issued. Thus analysed, we are of the convinced
opinion that the High Court has crossed the boundaries of the controversy
that was before it. The courts are required to exercise the power of judicial
review regard being had to the controversy before it. There may be a laudable
object in the mind but it must flow from the facts before it or there has to
be a specific litigation before it. Additionally, the High Court should have
reminded itself that it cannot enter into the domain where amendment to
legislations and other regulations are necessary. We are absolutely conscious
that it is the duty of the State Government to discharge its obligations in
the matters relating to law and order and remain alert to the issues that
emerge. It has a duty also to see that the investigations are speedily
completed in an appropriate manner. If there is a failure of law and order
situation, the executive is to be blamed. In the maintenance of law and order
situation the judicial officers are not to be involved. But the executive has
to remain absolutely alive to its duties and we are sure, the State
Government shall look into the aspects and endeavour to see that appropriate
steps are taken to maintain the law and order situation."
</p>

<p id="p_130">        42. Before, going into the applicability of the judgment, it is
necessary to point out to the reasons and directions of the Learned Single
Judge.
</p><p id="p_131">?15. The State of Tamil Nadu had, at one point of time, agriculture as its
main profession. Even today, the State contributes a lot to the country?s
agricultural contribution. However, the percentage is depleting every year as
the State is dependent on water from neighbouring States. Even, when there is
significant rain, the same is of no use as the State has not taken
appropriate steps for several decades, despite the continuing dispute and
demand for water from neighbouring States. The importance of preservation of
rivers and the river beds and their direct impact on the underground water
table and agricultural activity, is paramount. The removal of excess sand
from the river beds causes erosion of the river banks and ultimately, affects
the riparian habitats in many ways. The depletion will cause deepening of the
rivers and thereby, it would also affect the aquatic habitat. The effects of
the sand mining will affect the ecological balance, in such a way that the
same cannot be retrieved forever.
</p><p id="p_132">39. Here, it is necessary to point out that as per the report filed before
the Honourable Division Bench of this Court, about 1,00,14.239 MT of sand has
been illegally mined in 2013-14 alone in Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and
Tuticorin Regions. The Rio Declaration on Sustainable Development (2012) has
accentuated the preservation of natural resources and natural eco-system for
the benefit of the present and future generation. It is the duty of the
current generation to develop and conserve the natural resources for the
benefit of the succeeding generations. The natural resources constitute the
nation?s wealth. <a href="/doc/1814464/" id="a_110">Section 23-C</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Development
and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_111">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957, permits the State Governments to create check
posts and conduct periodical check. However, this Court has not come across
any permanent check-post by Mines Department, like the ones notified under
the erstwhile Tamil Nadu Value Added tax Act, with permanent staffs.
</p><p id="p_133">40. The Honourable Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/184104065/" id="a_112">G.Sundarrajan v. Union of India</a> reported
in (2013) 6 Supreme Court Cases 620, while emphasizing the role of a State
and the welfare of the public to be supreme and deciding the challenge made
to the commencement of Kudankulam Project, reiterated as follows:
?226. <a href="/doc/299215/" id="a_113">In Charan Lal Sahu v. Union of India</a> [(1990) 1 SCC 613], this Court,
while dealing with the constitutional validity of the <a href="/doc/1510537/" id="a_114">Bhopal Gas Leak
Disaster (Processing of Claims) Act</a>, 1985, observed that the said enactment
was passed as a sequel to a grim tragedy that occurred on the night of 2-12-
1984. This Court treated it to be the most tragic industrial disaster in
recorded human history. While discussing the concept of parenspatriae, the
learned Chief Justice observed that the conception of the parenspatriae
theory is the obligation of the State to protect and it takes into custody
the rights and the privileges of its citizens for discharging its obligation.
While dealing with the said concept, it has been opined that the maxim
saluspopuli (est) suprema lex ? regard for public welfare is the highest law.
</p><p id="p_134">227. I have referred to the said pronouncement solely to emphasise on the
role of the State to act in the greater welfare of the collective and how the
public welfare has been treated to be at the zenith of law.
***** *****
</p><p id="p_135">229. Thereafter, the Court referred to the technology in agriculture that has
given a big impetus to enterprises of chemical fertilisers and its serious
problems. Thereafter, it has been stated thus: (Union Carbide Corpn. case
[(1989) 3 SCC 38] , SCC p. 50, para 34) ?34. Indeed, there is also need to
evolve a national policy to protect national interests from such ultra-
hazardous pursuits of economic gains. Jurists, technologists and other
experts in economics, environmentology, futurology, sociology and public
health, etc. should identify areas of common concern and help in evolving
proper criteria which may receive judicial recognition and legal sanction.?
</p><p id="p_136">230. <a href="/doc/1401520/" id="a_115">In Pritam Pal v. High</a> Court of M.P. [1993 Supp (1) SCC 529 : 1993 SCC
(Cri) 356] , the maxim saluspopuli (est) suprema lex, i.e. welfare of the
people is the supreme law, was again emphasised upon, though in a different
context.
</p><p id="p_137">231. At this juncture, I must also refer to the other maxim salusreipublicae
suprema lex, i.e. safety of the State is the supreme law and in case of any
conflict, an individual must yield to the collective interest. But, it should
not be done at the cost of safety. At all times and at all quarters, sincere
efforts are to be made to maintain and sustain the safety of the people. That
has been spoken by the ancients when the Kings ruled and the same reigns 
supreme in a democratic set-up. True it is, there are exceptions, but the
exceptions are to remain in the realm of exceptions only and should not be
brought into play either at the whim or fancy of the executive. The purpose
of saying is that the law has many a mansion and the mosaic of law covers
many spectrums so that both the maxims, namely, saluspopuli (est) supreme lex 
and salusreipublicae suprema lex, can harmoniously coexist. The present case
is one where there is need for nuclear energy for the welfare of the public
and for other welfare of the people of India and for peaceful purpose.
Definitely, the interest of the economy and the interest of safety are to be
the real concerns of a welfare State.
</p><p id="p_138">232. In this regard, I may usefully refer to the following observations made
by this Court, though in a different context, in <a href="/doc/479666/" id="a_116">State of Karnataka v.
Praveen Bhai Thogadia</a> [(2004) 4 SCC 684 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 1387] : (SCC p. 694, 
para 9) ?9.? Welfare of the people is the ultimate goal of all laws, and
State action and above all the Constitution. They have one common object,
that is to promote the well-being and larger interest of the society as a
whole and not of any individual or particular groups carrying any brand
names. It is inconceivable that there can be social well-being without
communal harmony, love for each other and hatred for none. The core of
religion based upon spiritual values, which the Vedas, Upanishads and Puranas
were said to reveal to mankind seem to be: ?Love others, serve others, help
ever, hurt never? and ?sarvaejanasukhinobhavantoo?.?
***** ***** ***** *****
</p><p id="p_139">239. I have referred to the aforesaid pronouncements only to highlight that
this Court has emphasised on striking a balance between the ecology and
environment on one hand and the projects of public utility on the other. The
trend of authorities is that a delicate balance has to be struck between the
ecological impact and development.
</p><p id="p_140">240. The other principle that has been ingrained is that if a project is
beneficial for the larger public, inconvenience to smaller number of people
is to be accepted. It has to be respectfully accepted as a proposition of law
that individual interest or, for that matter, smaller public interest must
yield to the larger public interest. Inconvenience of some should be bypassed
for a larger interest or cause of the society. But, a pregnant one, the
present case really does not fall within the four corners of that principle.
It is not a case of the land oustees. It is not a case of ?some
inconvenience?. It is not comparable to the loss caused to property.
</p><p id="p_141">241. I have already emphasised upon the concept of living with the borrowed
time of the future generation which essentially means not to ignore the
inter-generational interests. Needless to emphasise, the dire need of the
present society has to be treated with urgency, but, the said urgency cannot
be conferred with absolute supremacy over life. Ouster from land or
deprivation of some benefit of different nature relatively would come within
the compartment of smaller public interest or certain inconveniences. But
when it touches the very atom of life, which is the dearest and noblest
possession of every person, it becomes the obligation of the constitutional
courts to see how the delicate balance has been struck and can remain in a
continuum in a sustained position. To elaborate, unless adequate care,
caution and monitoring at every stage is taken and there is constant vigil,
life of some can be in danger. That will be totally shattering of the
constitutional guarantee enshrined under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_117">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. It
would be guillotining the human right, for when the candle of life gets
extinguished, all rights of that person perish with it. Safety, security and
life would constitute a pyramid within the sanctity of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_118">Article 21</a> and no
jettisoning is permissible. Therefore, I am obliged to think that the
delicate balance in other spheres may have some allowance but in the case of
establishment of a nuclear plant, the safety measures would not tolerate any
lapse. The grammar has to be totally different.?
</p><p id="p_142">41. Therefore, in larger interest, for the welfare of the people of the
State, to protect the environment, river beds, river bodies and the field of
agriculture on which thousands of farmers are thriving, the writ court found
it  appropriate to issue the  directions referred earlier to the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_143">        43. To appreciate the directions, it is necessary to revert to the
circumstances, under which the writ petition was filed. The writ petitioner
contending that already there has been excess mining in the state depleting
the ecology and because of the same, the natural sand is in demand and the
prices have escalated. The pleadings are available in para 3 of the writ
affidavit.  Under the above circumstances, as the import of sand is
permitted, the writ petitioner imported sand from Malaysia. However, without
authority, the same was not permitted to be moved and hence the writ petition
was filed. This court has already held that the writ court has rightly held
that the imported sand cannot be brought within the restrictions imposed in
the existing laws. The court was able to see that the actions of the State
were not only in accordance with law, but also not in the interest or welfare
of the State and rather are in the nature of suiting individual commercial
interests. More particularly, when alternate source is available, it could be
used to preserve the ecology of the state.
</p>
<p id="p_144">        44. The State of Tamil Nadu has a long history of illegal mining. So
far umpteen number of cases have been filed before this Court for the release
of vehicle involved in illegal mining and transportation. It is not in
dispute that the state has been unsuccessful in curbing the illegal mining.
It is also evident from the judgment of the Division Bench reported in 2012
(4)  CTC 1 at Para 37 (<a href="/doc/133044775/" id="a_119">V.Madhav v. Govt. of Tamil Nadu</a>).
</p>

<p id="p_145">        45. In Contempt Petition No 561/2001, My Respected Brother Justice  K.
Sampath had issued certain directions after observing as under:-
?19. In a disturbing article "Sandstorm under water" in `The Hindu' dated 14-
7-2002, very serious warning has been sounded that the turbulence created by
dredging for sand at sea in Kerala could damage the fragile ecosystem along
the coast. There also appeared a sub article about ravaged rivers. Though it
is about Kerala rivers, it is as much relevant elsewhere and in particular in
Tamil Nadu. The article depicts a very harrowing picture of the dangers of
clandestine exploitation of river sand. In my view what is happening is not
clandestine exploitation, but a bold unabashed robbery of nature's wealth.
</p><p id="p_146">20. Sand mining has an adverse and destructive impact. Its disastrous effect
is unimaginable. It has "crippled the riverine ecology and depleted the
ground water table resulting in a nascent desertification process". It has
affected the stability of river banks leading to loss of whole chunks of land
and making large areas flood prone. Drain channels to lakes, ponds, tanks
irrigation are blocked since there is no more water. The river bed goes down
far below the receive canals. It has been identified as the main reason for
the water crisis. The potable nature of available drinking water is affected
as the sweet water acquifers (recharger and purifier) are destroyed by
quarrying. It has increased the base flow of ground water to the rivers. It
also causes sea water intrusion further than usual upstream through back
waters and river mouths. As enough sand does not reach the river mouths to
make natural barriers along the coast, sea water and sand enter the back
waters and rivers. This ultimately leads to saline intrusion into ground
water. It has also seriously affected the structural stability of several
bridges. River bridges and railway tracks are severely damaged by sand mining
in violation of rules and lease deeds. Flooding of agricultural lands due to
break in linkage between discharge/channels and river basins. There is
destruction of Agriculture/Mangrove Eco System. Houses and buildings collapse
due to erosion. The groundwater table goes down in all the river basins
affecting agriculture severely. The sand mining permitted in private lands
adjacent to river beds enables private owners to encroach the river bed
illegally. Public roads are also seriously damaged. Direct irrigation to
about 22000 acres of lands is affected in Vaigai and Cauvery basins. Drinking
water has turned saline. Accidents occur due to heavy lorry traffic. The
noise and dust thrown up by the lorries carrying quarried sand affect the
people's health.
</p><p id="p_147">21. It takes millions of years for natural denudation of hard rock into sand.
The current rate of extraction is far more than what nature is capable of
replenishing. Alternative materials have to be found to replace river sand in
construction activities. Excessive deepening of the river bed due to sand
removal also accentuates soil erosion. Reduction in sediment supply from the
rivers due to indiscriminate extraction will deplete the quantum of beach
sand which in turn contributes to increased erosion along the coast line.
</p>
<p id="p_148">22. There is large scale illicit, irregular and illegal sand mining in the
river beds of Tamiraparani, Vaigai, Amaravathi, Palar, Araniyar, Kusasthalai,
etc. The Hindu report says that rivers are being plundered by a powerful
mafia controlling the sand mining business. The illegal trade is driven by
the unholy nexus between contractors, politicians, trade union leaders,
panchayat and revenue officials and corrupt policemen, making a mockery of
the regulations imposed by the Government. Contractors who quote marginal 
amounts for auction rights go on to make a killing, extracting many times the
permitted amount of sand as enforcement agencies turn a blind eye.
</p><p id="p_149">23. Local political leaders anchor the whole operation acting as the conduit
for the huge bribes fuelling the well oiled network. Many of the kingpins
evade the long arm of the law by alternating between other illegal operations
in the forest and liquor business.
</p><p id="p_150">24. Government is deprived of huge amounts by way of royalty.
</p><p id="p_151">25. There is no proper legal provision enacted by the Government to take
action on illegal sand mining. Very often policies are dictated by short term
considerations such as elections or partisan pressure. The rules are not
scrupulously followed in the matter of grant of permit for sand quarrying.
Government officials who are supposed to check illegal sand quarrying join
hands with sand smugglers. 
</p><p id="p_152">26. Articles 48-A and 51A emphasize protection and improvement of the natural
environment including forests, lakes, rivers, wildlife and other living
creatures. The phrase used is `protect and improve' which implies that the
phrase appears to contemplate affirmative governmental action to improve the
quality of the environment and not just to preserve the environment in its
degraded form. <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_120">Section 3</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 contains
parliamentary mandate to improve the environmental quality. The Courts are
increasingly relying on these directive principles as complementary to
fundamental rights."
</p><p id="p_153">27. "The State is a trustee of all natural resources and is under a legal
duty to protect them and that the resources are meant for public use and
cannot be converted into private ownership." - M.C. MEHTA VS. KAMAL NATH    
</p><p id="p_154">28. People's Watch- Tamil Nadu is doing yeoman service in this field. There
was a public hearing on the impact of sand mining under its aegis on 19-2-
2002 at Chennai. It appears that there was very active public participation.
I had the benefit of perusing the proceedings and I have incorporated the
valuable materials I gathered from the said proceedings in this judgment.
</p><p id="p_155">29. SHANMUGAM, J. in W.P.Nos.10632/98 etc. by order dated 14-7-1999 directed    
the State Government to immediately take the following measures:
"(1) To clearly define the river bank and fix permanent marks so as to enable
the clear determination of the river bank on either side in reference to all
the rivers in Tamil Nadu where quarrying sand is permitted or at least the
portions over which quarrying is permitted.
</p><p id="p_156">(2) To specify the normal sand bed level for the respective rivers and after
such demarcation, to mark the level with some permanent benchmark on the  
river bank for the purpose of quarrying.
</p><p id="p_157">(3) To ban the removal or extraction of sand from such rivers where the
present sand bed level is below the required level as fixed by the State.
(4) To form a river management committee or an action committee by the
District Collector or the Tahsildar with the co-operation of voluntary
agencies so as to ensure that sand is being collected in strict compliance
with the restriction laid down by the authorities and the rules and the lease
deeds. The wastes and impurities especially those from the septic tanks
should not be permitted to open into the rivers.
</p><p id="p_158">(5) The encroachments are to be prohibited and existing encroachments are to
be evicted summarily from the river beds.
</p><p id="p_159">(6) The Forest Department is to give special priority in conservation of
forests at the origination point of the rivers."
</p>
<p id="p_160">30. It appears that it was only a cry in wilderness. Nothing appears to have
been done. On the contrary things have gone from bad to worse. The Hindu
reported about the battles between the District administration and the sand
mafia. The report referred to the collapse of Karanodai Highway Bridge on
Chennai-Calcutta Highway and how the LakshmipuramAnicut across Araniar, on   
the northern outskirts of the city was washed away some years ago because its
structure got weakened as a result of sand extraction around the Anicut. As
on that day it required Rs.3 or 4 crores to build a fresh Anicut.
</p><p id="p_161">31. The enormity of the problem suffocates us. The apathetic and lukewarm
approach of the powers that be baffles and pains us. Gide Andre lamented
`Everything has been said already but nobody is listening. We must always
begin again.' Scores of Judges have said before. Their directions have not
been implemented. It is a sordid commentary on the state of affairs. Still I
am issuing directions to the Government in the fond hope that they will be
implemented and something good may come about. These are in addition to what  
has been directed to be done by P. SHANMUGHAM, J. in W.P.Nos.10632/92 etc.     
batch already referred to.
</p><p id="p_162">1. The Government shall constitute a high level committee consisting of
scientists, geologists and environmentalists within one month from today. The
said committee shall tour the State, conduct a scientific survey with
reference to sand quarrying in rivers and river beds and submit a report with
particular reference to the damage caused on account of indiscriminate and
illegal quarrying and spelt out suitable remedial steps to stamp out the
malady, within six months thereafter.
</p><p id="p_163">2. On receipt of the report from the committee, the Government shall act in
conformity with the guidelines and take all necessary further steps to arrest
the exploitation and to protect and improve the situation and restore status
quo ante. The Government shall pass suitable regulatory legislation in this
regard. The action on the part of the Government after the receipt of the
report should not brook any delay. It should act fast.
</p><p id="p_164">In the meantime there should be a total ban on sand quarrying anywhere near
motor or rail bridges - the distance between the bridges and the quarrying
area should be not less than 500 metres.
</p><p id="p_165">The distance between the riverbank and the mining area should be not less
than 10 to 15 metres. The depth of the sand pits should not exceed 1 to 1-
1/2metres.
</p><p id="p_166">While granting licence the local public should be taken into confidence. They
should be allowed to air their views and raise their objections.
Wherever there has been violation of the terms of the grant, stringent action
should be taken against the erring parties. Prosecution under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_121">Section 379</a> of
the Indian Penal Code for theft and causing damage to public property should
be launched. Severe penalties should be imposed. They should also be made to 
pay heavy compensation.  
</p><p id="p_167">There should be a special river protection force mobilised for patrolling and
policing the river areas and apprehending the culprits indulging in illicit
quarrying. Such a force should be composed of high calibre personnel and
should not fall a prey to enticements.
</p><p id="p_168">The officials responsible should be vested with the power to seize the
vehicles involved in illicit quarrying and transport of sand. The Executive
Engineer of the Assistant Executive Engineer can be vested with such powers.
The Courts at the District level may be empowered to entertain complaints of
sand mining, to direct investigation, appoint commissions to inspect and
report and on being satisfied direct suspension of operations.
</p>
<p id="p_169">The above are broad suggestions. There can be additions and elucidations to
make the object more effective and result oriented.
</p><p id="p_170">No stone should be left unturned to annihilate the pernicious practice of
exploitation of natural resources jeopardising the long term interest of the
people.
</p>
<p id="p_171">32. Under Articles 48-A and 51-A(g) it is the fundamental duty of every one
of the citizens of this country to protect and improve the natural
environment including forests, lakes, rivers, all other water resources and
wild life and to have compassion for living creatures?????.
</p>
<p id="p_172">46. Based on the directions of the Hon?ble Court, under similar
circumstances, a High Level Committee was constituted and after inspecting
all the river beds, submitted a report. The relevant findings on the
depletion of the rivers are given below:-
</p>

<p id="p_173">"2.2 OBSERVATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE         
2.2.1 Araniyar, Kosasthalaiyar, Palar, Coovam and Vegavathi Rivers in
Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram Districts
The Kosasthalaiyar and Araniyar rivers flow mostly in Tiruvallur district. At
the time of visit by the committee there were no existing quarry leases in
these riverbeds. However, the committee visited the Koasasthalaiyar riverbed
near Karanodai Bridge, where illicit quarrying has caused damage to the
bridge. The examination of the river course clearly indicates that the width
of the river has been widened due to removal of sands on both sides of the
river by illicit means. The Revenue officials of that region explained that
due to failure of monsoon and lack of farm work the villagers indulged in
removal of sand. They projected this illicit activity as a socio-economic
problem.
</p><p id="p_174">The committee is of the view that a realistic approach has to be evolved by
the authorities concerned to tackle this socio-economic problem and stop the
indiscriminate damage caused to the river by the local villagers. If this
problem is not tackled urgently, the possibilities of damage to the bed and
banks of Rivers and streams causing irreparable loss to environment cannot be
avoided.
</p><p id="p_175">It is also pointed out that this socio-economic problem is exploited by
antisocial elements, who encourage the villagers to remove sand illegally for
transportation to the city to make profit. It is suggested that the PWD may
study in detail the banks of Kosasthalaiyar River to assess the damage caused
to the bank and the basin so that a comprehensive picture may evolve to
tackle this problem during the heavy monsoons.
</p><p id="p_176">It was also pointed out to the committee by the local people that in addition
to removal of sand from the river bed, people are also engaged in active
quarrying of sand in patta land adjacent to the river banks and that this
removal of sand adjacent to the river banks has caused fluctuation of water
level in the neighbouring wells. Even though the rule prohibits removal of
sand upto 50 meters from the boundary of the river, sand is removed in the
safety zone area on either side of the banks at many places along the
Kosasthalaiyar river course. Moreover some lessees obtain quarry lease for
brick earth in patta land, and misuse the same for removing sand occurring
below the brick earth.
</p><p id="p_177">The committee also visited the Lakshmipuram Anaicut in Araniyar River. This
anaicut was constructed in the year 1976 by Public Works Department and it
collapsed in 1994 because of indiscriminate sand quarrying in the riverbed
adjacent to the Anaicut by the illicit miners. Public Works Department
authorities have now proposed to reconstruct the anaicut at a cost of Rs.5.50
Crores. At present no lease has been granted in Araniyar River bed. The local
Public Works Department officials deposed before the committee that they are
helpless and not able to do anything to stop the illicit removal of sand, as
they do not have any powers to take action on such illegal activity. The
local police are also reluctant to take action and advice to report the
activity to the local Tahsildar and by the time action has been taken,
irreparable damage has been caused. The local Tahsildar and Revenue 
Divisional Officer of the region explained that this illicit activity is
carried out mostly during night time. They are unable to take effective steps
in this regard.
</p><p id="p_178">The committee also examined the damage caused to Aranvoyal Anaicut near the   
12/4-km stone of the Poondi-Tiruvallur highway. It is reported that this
anaicut had collapsed in 1986 and was repaired by the Public Works
Department, which again got damaged in 1991. The main cause for this damage  
is illegal quarrying and over exploitation of sand from the Coovum riverbed.
Due to constant removal of sand the Coovum riverbed has lost its sand
potential and the quarrying has been shifted to the patta lands adjacent to
the Coovum riverbanks, where large scale illicit quarrying was observed by
the committee. No action is being taken to stop thisplunder, and there is
every possibility of Poondi-Tiruvallur highway being damaged irreparably
because of such illegal sand removal.
</p><p id="p_179">The illicit miners have caused irreparable damage to the riverbed and banks
because of unscientific, indiscriminate mining methods. In the Palar at
Kancheepuram district a similar situation of meagre leases exists and this
promote illicit quarrying. So it is felt by the committee that immediate
steps have to be taken to grant leases in more areas for sand quarrying so
that sand is made available for the construction industry and thereby illegal
quarrying is stopped.
</p><p id="p_180">.....
</p><p id="p_181">2.2.2 Gadilam, Pennaiyar and Malattar River beds in Cuddalore and
Villupuram Districts
In Gadilam river in Thirumanikuzhi village, a lease granted was stopped by
the district authorities due to indiscriminate mining. The committee also
felt that the action taken was justified. In the Pennaiyar riverbed, the
quarry site at Melpattambakkam and Pulavanoor villages were visited. In this
river course the centre of the river forms the district boundary for
Cuddalore and Villupuram districts. While bringing the sand bearing areas for
auction the authorities from the two districts do not bring the adjacent
areas for auction simultaneously. Therefore a lessee having lease in one-
district removes the sand in the adjacent area of the neighbouring district
also. This sort of illicit removal can be avoided by the district authorities
by bringing the adjacent areas for simultaneous leasing.
It is also reported that the persons quoting for auction manipulate to stop
the auction of the adjacent area so that they could have access to
availability of sand in the adjacent district and to create a monopoly. The
maximum tender amount realised by the Cuddalore district in one tender is
Rs.2.50 Crores. The concerned riverbeds are all dry and replenishment is
mainly due to North East Monsoon. The amount quoted by the bidders is 
unreasonably high. It is very obvious that the person has quoted such high
price keeping in view the adjacent free hold areas. It is also pointed out to
the committee that sand from Cuddalore is taken to Chennai to meet the demand 
in construction activity. It is also reported that one individual takes three
or four areas in ?benami names? and operates only one quarry blocking the
other areas from exploitation thereby creating an artificial demand for sand
which enables hiking of sand price. The committee feels that appropriate
changes are to be made in the rules so that only genuine people are permitted
to participate in the auction.
</p><p id="p_182">In Villupuram district, only one lease is currently in operation in Malattar
River. In the area leased out in Sithattur Thirukkai village extensive damage
to the river bed is caused because of indiscriminate and unscientific method
of quarrying. The boundaries of the lease are not properly demarcated, and so
illicit operations are carried out in the area adjacent to the leasehold.
Even though large areas of sand are available in the river bed, the District
authorities are yet to take action to bring the areas for exploitation and
the committee was told that the proposals are also available for bringing
these areas for tender cum auction. In Villupuram and Cuddalore Districts
illicit quarrying in the areas adjacent to lease hold areas is observed in
all the places visited by the committee. Sand is continuously removed and
sent to Chennai to meet the demand there. Generally the committee observed 
that in riverbed the removal of sand is haphazard and has caused hindrance to
the free flow of water, which will eventually affect the ground water
potential in down stream villages.
</p><p id="p_183">In Cuddalore District authorities informed the committee that illicit removal
of sand in bullock carts by local villagers causes large-scale damage to the
river bed system. Daily 200 to 300 cart loads of sand are transported in such
a manner, but the district authorities are unable to take any action.

<p id="p_184">2.2.3 Cauvery, Coleroon and Bhavani Rivers in Trichy, Karur, Namakkal and
Erode Districts
In Coleroon near Thiruvasi village a well-laid road was noticed inside the
riverbed for removal of sand from the lease hold area. The road is seen
running to a distance of 3 to 5 km covering mostly non-lease hold area. Such
formation of road in the riverbed not only encourages illicit mining but also
has a negative impact on the flow, contour of the river and biota of the
ecosystem. 
</p><p id="p_185">....
</p><p id="p_186">The committee also visited a sand quarry in the Cauvery riverbed near
Nanjaithottakurichi village in Karur District. This quarry is being operated
under the directions of the court. The examination of the area clearly
reveals that the lessee removed sand beyond 2 to 3m depths as large water-
stagnated pits created due to sand mining were noticed in the riverbed.
Several hutments are also seen in the riverbed. The lessee has also indulged
in illicit quarrying in the adjacent Namakkal district in the same riverbed.
...
</p><p id="p_187">The committee visited the sand quarries in the Cauvery bed in Namakkal
district. In Manapalli village where a lease has been sanctioned in the
riverbed, the area leased out only reveal exposure of rocks and pebbles. The
lessee has taken this area only with a high hope to remove sand from the same
riverbed in the adjacent Karur district where sand is available. The
inspection of the Cauvery river basin in Trichy, Karur and Namakkal districts
by the committee revealed large scale illicit removal of sand by the lessees.
Well-laid roads are seen in the riverbed for removal of sand by the lessees.
When the district authorities take action against the lessee for using
poclain for sand removal they say that the poclain is used only for laying
road and not for sand removal and the Honourable Court also permits them to
use poclain for road formation. Roads inside the riverbeds should not be
permitted. In the guise of laying roads in the leasehold area the lessees
engage poclains and remove sand indiscriminately and illicitly from large
areas.
</p>
<p id="p_188">2.2.4 Palar and Cheyyar Rivers in Tiruvannamalai and Vellore Districts
The committee visited a lease area in Cheyyar River in Anapathur. Here also
road formation is seen inside the riverbed and sand is being quarried by
rathole mining, which will affect the flow of water and the environment. In
Panamugai village in Palar river bed, quarry operations were seen in depth
beyond three to four meters exposing the bed rock. In the riverbed in many
places huge ponds are formed due to illicit and deep sand quarrying thereby
obstructing the free flow of water. It is also observed that the lessee is
quarrying in the riverbed in the adjacent Vellore district-taking lease in
Tiruvanamalai district. In Vellore district near Perumugai village
indiscriminate mining of sand was noticed in Palar River in the leased area.
Since there is no flow of water in the Palar river, only large ponds of water
are seen in the river bed which are standing examples for exposure of
groundwater table.
</p>
<p id="p_189">2.2.5 Vaigai, Vaipar, Tamiraparani, Chitrar and Nambiyar River in Madurai,
Sivagangai, Thoothukkudi and Tirunelveli Districts
In Madurai sand quarry has been banned in Vaigai River. Inspite of the ban
reports of illegal quarrying of sand are received on the western and southern
upstream side of the river. In Sivagangai district the committee examined an
expired lease area in Kalpiravu village, in Vaigai riverbed, where illicit
quarrying to a large extent is seen. The quarrying is carried out to a depth
of more than one-meter thereby free flow of water in the river is hampered.
There are a number of irrigation as well as water supply proposals between
Silaiman and Manamadurai, in this riverbed. It is interesting to note that in
Vaigai river in some areas sand is available for removal but no action has
been taken because of objections from the public. Near Kirungakottai village
in the same Vaigai riverbed the river has lost its face due to sand removal
which has been permitted in the erstwhile Rule 39. The committee also visited
the adjacent Sirugudi village wherein sand quarrying was seen in a patta
land. Here the lessee has removed sand for more than 10-m depth. This large-
scale removal of sand will definitely hamper the river flow since the patta
land adjoins the Vaigai riverbed and thereby cause serious impairment to flow
of water in the river. This in turn will cause serious damages to agriculture
production downstream. 
</p><p id="p_190">Therefore, the committee feels that in patta land adjacent to the river no
quarrying should be allowed within 250m distance of river boundary on either
side. In Thoothukkudi District a sand quarry lease in Vaippar riverbed near
Kilnattukkurichi village was visited. The district authorities have issued
show cause notice to the lessee as he has indulged in quarrying outside the
leasehold area. But the Hon?ble Court has stayed orders of the District
collector and permitted the lessee to continue the operation. The lessee has
indulged in rathole mining and has removed sand for more than two to three
meter depths in the riverbed. It was felt by the committee that number of
leases have to be granted where the sand is available. This may reduce to a
greater extent illegal removal of sand and also environmental degradation of
the riverbed. In Tamirabarani riverbed the Committee examined the lease area
where quarrying in two places were allowed near Kansapuram village. Road was 
constructed in the river bed with the consent of the Public Works Department
authorities to remove sand. Here water is seen flowing throughout the year.
Such construction of road will only obstruct the free flow of water and sand
collection in the river. In this riverbed also illicit removal and
unscientific mining have made the river to appear as small ponds. Near
Seevalaperi in the Chitrar River, a tributary of Tamirabarani River,
indiscriminate quarrying has made the river appear as an undulated terrain
with large pits. Sand has been removed to a depth of two to three meters. The
river has also been widened due to indiscriminate sand removal in adjacent
patta land to a depth of 3 meter. All these quarry operations are of illegal
nature. Road has been formed within the riverbed for such illegal removal of
sand.
</p><p id="p_191">The committee also examined leasehold areas in Rajakalmangalam in Nambiyar   
riverbed. Here the District Collector has permitted the Koodangulam atomic
power project authorities to remove 8500 lorry loads of sand for their
construction work. Even in this area where government agencies have been
permitted to quarry sand, sand quarrying is done in haphazard manner and this
has resulted in formation of pits in the river up to a depth of two to three
meters. The committee asked the District Authorities to inform the
Koodangulam project personal to conduct the quarrying in a scientific way so
as to prevent environment degradation of the area.
</p>

<p id="p_192">2.2.6 Thenpennaiyar River in Dharmapuri District
The committee visited Irumatur village near Thenpennaiyar River, where it is
reported that illicit removal of sand in the riverbed in areas within 500
meter of the TWAD board wells has caused health problems causing cholera. The  
examination of the area did reveal illicit mining in the areas adjacent to
the TWAD board wells and this has caused depletion of sand bed and 
consequential seepage of polluted water. The committee is of the opinion that
in all places where TWAD board has such water wells, areas around 500 meters 
should be handed over to TWAD, so that they can protect the area. They should
be given powers to take penal action against persons engaged in illicit
removal of sand from their protected area.
</p>
<p id="p_193">        47. Though, the report of the committee was part of judicial
pronouncements, the illegal mining was not curbed. Therefore, several
petitions alleging illegal mining has been raised before this court on
various occasions. In the case of M.Periyasamy Vs The State and others in W.P 
No 11182/2010, the Division Bench of this Court, while considering a plea to
ban mining in the Tamirabarani river bed, after analyzing the pitiable
condition and the rampant illegal mining, banned the mining for five years by
its order dated 02/12/2010 and directed for a constitution of a state level
monitoring committee to inspect the river beds in the state and only upon the
inspection and recommendation of the committee, future mining can be
permitted. The usage of poclains or heavy machinery was also banned.
</p>
<p id="p_194">        48. Similarly while dealing with the rampant and illegal sand mining
across the cauvery river, the Division Bench of this Court in W.P No
4699/2012, by its order dated 03/08/2012 mandated that the sand quarrying can
be permitted only after Environmental Impact assessment, even if the
quarrying activities are done by the PWD and all the quarries in operation
beyond five years were directed to be stopped and the quarries in operation
for less than five years were permitted to continue for three months with
certain restrictions and their continuation is subject to the order from the
State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority. 
</p>
<p id="p_195">        49. Recently, in a batch of writ petitions in WP (MD) No.4251 of 2017 &amp;
etc, the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court, by order dated 28.07.2017,
constituted a Committee of Commissioners to inspect the quarries and report
the details with regard to excavation of sands from the quarries.
Accordingly, as directed by the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court, the
Committee of Commissioners filed its report with conclusions, from which, it
is ascertained as follows:
</p><p id="p_196">???The team had found during the inspection that the entire river beds
riddled with pits and ponds due to indiscriminate and chaotic sand mining
continuously. The illegal mining beyond the permitted boundary and depth
level has not only thrived, but also flourished inspite of rigorous rules to
restrict illegal mining and due to failure of monitoring mechanisms. The
large scale illegal mining could not have taken place without the knowledge
of all concerned who were/are part of sand mining. The natural mineral, which
is the public wealth has been looted and squandered without restraint
illegally.
</p><p id="p_197">???The irresistible conclusion of the commission is that in all the sand
quarries inspected by the team, there are violations both with reference to
permitted extent and depth level of sand mining. Even in the virgin quarries,
the MSL level and river bed level do not correspond with the GPS measurements
taken during inspection.
</p><p id="p_198">???The entire quarrying operation at various sites was carried out in a
random and unscientific manner. The site inspection and the consequential
granting of mining plan, preparing of Topo Sheet, obtaining of SEIAA
clearance and sand quarrying permission have taken place mechanically without
application of mind and without minimum care to comply with all the mandatory
requirements under the relevant rules. The quarrying operation on ground had
carried out in a most unorganized manner and in violation of the conditions
of SEIAA clearance and terms and conditions of permission granted by the
competent authority. The inspection team has identified a uniform pattern of
illegal mining in all the quarries excepting the virgin quarries. As a matter
of routine, first the mining of sand is done beyond the boundary of permitted
site by misusing the quarry license. Mining of sand has been done in a most
haphazard manner without any respect to the extent and depth parameters. 
Excess and illegal mining had taken place in all quarries and operations as
mentioned above and beyond the boundary and beyond the depth level causing  
severe environmental disturbance and degradation. The national mineral wealth
was looted out without any hindrance in the illegal quarry near the
Chinthalaivaadi and the inspection team has also found that not even a single
complaint from the officials side about the illegal mining at Chinthalaivaadi
which will shock the conscience of any reasonable man and the methodology 
adopted for illegal mining ingenious.
</p><p id="p_199">??The SEIAA clearance is obtained by the authorities as a matter of routine
with no mechanism to check and counter check to ascertain the veracity of the
details contained in the application to avail environmental clearance. It is
astonishing that the violation continue unabated with the SEIAA has no
independent powers for mechanisms for site inspection and to find violations.
The SEIAA is dependent on the informations submitted by the Government and it 
is unreasonable to expect the Government to file report against itself.
Therefore, all the mandatory conditions remain as formalities and the breach
of conditions go unnoticed by the agencies which grant permission for sand
quarry.
</p><p id="p_200">??Since the licensee is the Government, all the norms are violated with
impunity and yet the quarrying operation is allowed to continue. It is also
desirable to impose a long term ban of mining operation at the stretches of
Kadambankurichi, Thottakurichi, Silaipillaiyarpudur, Manamedu and entire
kollidam River to enable the replenishment as in all these quarry sites, the
mother river Cauveri is weeping blood and she is being repeatedly violated by
her own sons continuously. The above statement does not imply that the other
sand mining sites are given clean chit for further sand mining.
???The illegal mining starts from poclain operator. Without fixing of pucca
permanent pillar boundaries, it may not be possible for the poclain operator
to excavate within the limited extent.
</p><p id="p_201">???So far, the lifting contractor has not performed any stipulated duty under
the terms of contract including backfilling of pits wherever warranted which
has caused severe ponding effect throughout the length and breadth of river
Cauveri which is a major stumbling bottle neck for the free flow of water.
Excess mining beyond the permitted depth has resulted in reducing the ground
watter table and drawing of ground water from the neighbouring agricultural
lands and human habitations to fill up the very deep pits that exist in the
river belt.
</p>
<p id="p_202">        50. Even after all, the committee?s and frequent intervention from this
Court in many cases, the illegal mining in the state has not stopped and the
EIA has also not been obtained by following the due procedures. The same is
evident from the number of cases filed in 2017 for release of vehicle. Under
this background, when the directions issued by the Learned Single Judge are
examined, this Court is of the view that the directions are not legislative
directions but only directions issued for non-compliance of statutory
provisions and for failure to safeguard the environment and the ecology,
which in the opinion of this Court, is duty enshrined on the High Court under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_122">Article 226</a> of the constitution of India. Further, when there is an alternate
source of sand, which is permissible in law, this Court is of the view that
the directions cannot be termed as beyond the scope of the writ petition.
Insofar as the Judgment of the Apex Court relied upon by the appellants, this
Court is of the view that the judgment is not applicable to the present facts
and circumstances for the following reasons:
</p><p id="p_203">        a. The directions issued are not in the nature of legislative
directions but only in exercise of power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_123">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India because of the failure of the state to protect the
river beds and curb illegal sand mining which has gone beyond resurrection.
</p><p id="p_204">        b. The directions are in the nature of the directing the authorities to
comply with the statutory provisions and to safe guard the river beds.
</p><p id="p_205">        c. In the case decided by the Apex Court, the directions issued by the
High Court were in the nature of legislative or policy decisions, which
required amendment of the provisions. It cannot be said so in the present
case as the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_124">MMDR Act</a>, itself has issued guidelines for grant of quarry lease,
when many directions issued by this Court in many instances have not been
scrupulously followed and when it has been brought to the knowledge of the
court about the rampant illegal mining activities and availability of
alternate source of sand, directions have been issued to stop the mining
activities in the state within 6 months and follow the provisions in the
rules to take action against the perpetrators of illegal mining.
</p><p id="p_206">        d. The liberty to the State to enact law cannot be termed as a policy
direction as such a direction was issued after holding that the existing laws
are inadequate to deal with imported sand.
</p>
<p id="p_207">        51. Insofar as the contention that the directions can be issued only by
the Division Bench, this Court is not in consonance with same. The directions
were issued by the Learned Single Judge in exercise of his power under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_125">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, which is wider even than the power of the
Apex Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_126">Article 32.</a> The law on this point is settled in many cases.
This High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_127">Article 226</a> of the constitution has wide powers to
issue directions to not only protect the fundamental rights but also the
constitutional rights. The directions issued are relating to and connected
with the subject matter of lis before the court. Therefore, this Court is of
the view that the learned Single Judge was well within the powers of the
Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_128">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and the second question is
answered in negative against the appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_208">        52. Another ground that was raised is that the directions have been
issued without giving opportunity to the State and lessees.  This statement
is fallacious for the simple reason that the Collectors on behalf of
different Districts represented the State in this Writ Appeal and the learned
Advocate General of the State has argued their case, not only before the
Division Bench and also before the learned Single Judge. Further, the State
has now issued a Government order permitting import by individuals with
certain conditions. Therefore, the contention also fails.
</p>
<p id="p_209">        53. Now coming to the third question, the High Courts are empowered to
issue orders or directions, not only in matters relating to fundamental
rights but also to protect the constitutional rights enshrined in the
constitution. In that sense, the power of High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_129">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution have been held by the Apex Court in various judgments to be
superior than that of the Apex Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_130">Article 32</a> of the Constitution.
Right to life and liberty is the basic fundamental right guaranteed by the
constitution under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_131">Article 21.</a> The scope of the Article has been widely
interpreted by the Supreme Court in the following cases to ensure that all
plausible conditions are prevalent in the society for the man kind to
survive, which run thus:-

without these basic human rights. Shelter for a human being, therefore, is
not a mere protection of his life and limb. It is home where he has
opportunities to grow physically, mentally, intellectually and spiritually.
Right to shelter, therefore, includes adequate living space, safe and decent
structure, clean and decent surroundings, sufficient light, pure air and

</p>
<p id="p_217">        54. The directive principles of the state policy are not mere
guidelines. The decisions of the state are to be in consonance with the
fundamental and constitutional rights. It is the duty of the state to ensure
that the fundamental right to life guaranteed in the constitution is
safeguarded. The maintenance of ecology by preserving the river and river
beds go a long way in not only preserving them for future generations or
inhabitants in the vicinity, but also will have a global impact. The mining
of sand along the river-bed has drastic effects on the ecology. Though the
Act and the Rules framed thereunder, permit mining, it cannot vest a
perpetual right even on the state to carrying out mining.  The effect and
impact of mining has been a subject matter of concern throughout the world as
it directly impacts the climate control. Many international conventions have
addressed the issue. Many scholars have voiced their concern on the effects
of mining. The Dr.V.Kumar, Controller of Examinations, Associate Professor of
Geology, National College (Autonomous), Trichy has penned the impacts of sand 
mining on different aspects in his report  as follows:-
"Effects of Physical Impact
These impacts may cause:  
</p><p id="p_218">1. the undercutting and collapse of river banks,
</p><p id="p_219">2. the loss of adjacent land and/or structures,
</p><p id="p_220">3. upstream erosion as a result of an increase in channel slope and changes
in flow velocity, and
</p><p id="p_221">4. down erosion due to increased carrying capacity of the stream, downstream
changes in patterns of deposition, and changes in channel bed and habitat
type.
</p>
<p id="p_222">Impact on Ground Water  
Water quality
???Sand mining and dredging activities,
???poorly planned stockpiling and uncontrolled dumping of overburden,
???and chemical / fuel spills affects the adjoining groundwater system will
cause 
???reduced water quality for downstream users,
???increased cost for downstream water treatment plants
???and poisoning of aquatic life.
</p><p id="p_223">Ground Water  
???Apart from threatening bridges, sand mining transforms the riverbeds into
large and deep pits; as a result, the groundwater table drops leaving the
drinking water wells on the embankments on these rivers dry.
??Bed degradation from in stream mining lowers the elevation of stream flow
and the floodplain water table which in turn can eliminate flow depth and a
bar skimming operation increases flow width.
</p><p id="p_224">???Both conditions produce slower stream flow velocities and lower flow
energies, causing sediments arriving from upstream to deposit at the mining
site.
</p><p id="p_225">???As stream flow moves beyond the site and flow energies increase in
response to the "normal' channel from downstream, the amount of transported
sediment leaving the site is now less than the sediment carrying capacity of
the flow.
</p><p id="p_226">???This sediment-deficient flow or "hungry" water picks up more sediment from
the stream reach below the mining site, furthering the bed degradation
process.
</p><p id="p_227">???This causes shallowing of the streambed, producing braided flow or
subsurface inter gravel flow in riffle areas, hindering movement of fishes
between pools. 
</p><p id="p_228">Groundwater quantity 
???Whenever the stream bed is lowered the water table adjacent to the rivers
are also get lowered.
</p><p id="p_229">??Sand acts as cushion - absorb water and allow them flow laterally.
???The ground water recharge in the adjacent area of the river course is
mainly by the lateral flow of water from the river. This phenomenon is
application to the river flowing in plains.
</p><p id="p_230">Ecological Impact
  These impacts may have an effect on
???the direct loss of stream reserve habitat,
???disturbances of species attached to streambed deposits,
???reduced light penetration,
?reduced primary production, and reduced feeding opportunities.
</p>
<p id="p_231">Salt Water intrusion
???Excessive instream sand-and-gravel mining causes the degradation of 
rivers.
</p><p id="p_232">?????Depletion of sand in the streambed and along coastal areas causes the
deepening of rivers and estuaries, and the enlargement of river mouths and
coastal inlets. It may also lead to saline-water intrusion from the nearby
sea.
</p><p id="p_233">?????Excessive instream sand mining is a threat to bridges, river banks and
nearby structures. Sand mining also affects the adjoining groundwater system
and the uses that local people make of the river.
</p><p id="p_234">???Instream sand mining results in the destruction of aquatic and riparian
habitat through large changes in the channel morphology. Impacts include bed
degradation, bed coarsening, lowered water tables near the streambed, and
channel instability."
</p><p id="p_235">Bird habitat
???Physical disturbance of the habitat caused by dredging activities includes
generation of noise, which can interrupt nesting / breeding activities.
????Other effects include destruction of habitat for foraging and nesting,
increased exposure to re-suspended toxicants, human disturbance from mining 
operations and increased predator use of recently dredged areas.
Riparian habitat, flora and fauna
???In stream mining can have other costly effects beyond the immediate mine
sites.
</p><p id="p_236">???Many hectares of fertile land are lost, as well as valuable timber
resources and wildlife habitats in the riparian areas.
???Degraded stream habitats result in lost of fisheries productivity,
biodiversity and recreational potential.
</p><p id="p_237">???Severely degraded channels may lower land and aesthetic values. 
???All species require specific habitat conditions to ensure long-term
survival.
</p><p id="p_238">???Factors that increase or decrease sediment supply often de-stabilize bed
and banks and result in dramatic channel readjustments.
???Mining-induced changes in sediment supply and channel form disrupt channel 
and habitat development processes. 
</p>
<p id="p_239">Biological environment
???Introduction of abnormal volumes of organic material and nutrients, thus
increasing the biological oxygen demand (BOD), which in turn reduces oxygen
levels and productivity;
</p><p id="p_240">???Reintroduction of toxic substances uncovered by mining activities;
???Inadvertent destruction of the adjacent habitat critical to the life
cycles of certain organisms.
</p><p id="p_241">????Disruption of migratory routes of motile marine organisms."
</p>
<p id="p_242">The above report clearly spells out that the harm caused to the human lives,
properties and ecology is alarmingly higher than the benefit derived out of
mining, necessitating imminent remedial measures.  At this juncture it is
relevant to refer to the following judgments of the Apex Court, while dealing
with the duty to preserve the environment, which run thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_243">(i)      <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_136">M.C.Mehta v. Kamal Nath and others</a> (1997 1 SCC 388):
?15.The notion that the public has a right to expect certain lands and
natural areas to retain their natural characteristic is finding its way into
the law of the land. The need to protect the environment and ecology has been
summed up by David B. Hunter (University of Michigan) in an article titled an
ecological perspective on property: A call for judicial protection of the
public's interest in environmentally critical resources published in Harvard
Environmental law Review Vol. 12 1988 Page 311 in the following words:
"Another major ecological tenet is that the world is finite. The earth can
support only so many people and only so much human activity before limits are
reached. The lesson was driven home by the oil crisis of the 1970's as well
as by the pesticide scare of the 1960's. The current deterioration of the
ozone layer is another vivid example of the complex, unpredictable and
potentially catastrophic effects posed by our disregard of the environmental
limits to economic growth. The absolute finiteness of the environment, when
coupled with human dependency on the environment, leads to the unquestionable 
result that human activities will at some point be constrained. "[H]uman
activity finds in the natural world its external limits. In short, the
environment imposes constraints on our freedom; these constraints are not the
product of value choices but of the scientific imperative of the
environment's limitations. Reliance on improving technology can delay
temporarily, but not forever, the inevitable constraints. "There is a limit
to the capacity of the environment to service...growth, both in providing raw
materials and in assimilating by-product wastes due to consumption. The
largesse of technology can only postpone or disguise the inevitable."
</p>
<p id="p_244">Professor Barbara Ward has written of this ecological imperative in
particularly vivid language:
</p><p id="p_245">We can forget moral imperatives. But today the morals of respect and care and
modesty come to us in a form we cannot evade. We cannot cheat on DNA. We    
cannot get round photosynthesis. We cannot say I am not going to give a damn 
about phytoplankton. All these tiny mechanisms provide the preconditions of
our planetary life. To say we do not care is to say in the most literal sense
that "we choose death."
</p><p id="p_246">There is a commonly-recognized link between laws and social values, but to
ecologists a balance between laws and values is not alone sufficient to
ensure a stable relationship between humans and their environment. Laws and
values must also contend with the constraints imposed by the outside
environment. Unfortunately, current legal doctrine rarely accounts for such
constraints, and thus environmental stability is threatened.
Historically, we have changed the environment to fit our conceptions of
property. We have fenced, plowed and paved. The environment has proven 
malleable and to a large extent still is. But there is a limit to this
malleability, and certain types of ecologically important resources - for
example, wetlands and riparian forests - can no longer be destroyed without
enormous long-term effects on environmental and therefore social stability.
To ecologists, the need for preserving sensitive resources does not reflect
value choices but rather is the necessary result of objective observations of
the laws of nature.
</p><p id="p_247">In sum, ecologists view the environmental sciences as providing us with
certain laws of nature. These laws, just like our own laws, restrict our
freedom of conduct and choice. Unlike our laws, the laws of nature cannot be
changed by legislative flat; they are imposed on us by the natural world. An
understanding of the laws of nature must therefore inform all of our social
institutions."
</p><p id="p_248">16.The ancient Roman Empire developed a legal theory known as the "Doctrine 
or the Public Trust. It was founded on the ideas that certain common
properties such as rivers, sea- shore, forests and the air were held by
Government in trusteeship for the free and unimpeded use of the general
pubic. Our contemporary conceded about `the environment' bear a very close
conceptual relationship to this legal doctrine. Under the Roman Law these
resources were either owned by no one (res Nullious) or by every one in
common (Res Communious). Under the English common law, however, the Sovereign     
could own these resources but the ownership was limited in nature, the Crown
could not grant these properties to private owners if the effect was to
interfere with the public interests in navigation or fishing. Resources that
were suitable for these uses were deemed to be held in trust by the Crown for
the benefit of the public Joseph L. Sax, Professor of Law, University of
Michigan proponent of the Modern Public Trust Doctrine - in an erudite
article "Public Trust Doctrine in natural resource law: effective judicial
intervention". Michigan Law Review Vol. 68 Part-1 page 4/3 has given the
historical background of the Public Trust Doctrine as under:
"The source of modern public trust law is found in a concept that received
much attention in Roman and English law - the nature of property rights in
rivers, the sea, and the seashore. That history has been given considerable
attention in the legal literature, need not be repeated in detail here. But
two points should be emphasized, First, certain interests, such as navigation
and fishing, were sought to be preserved for the benefit of the public;
accordingly, property used for the those purposes was distinguished from
general public property which the sovereign could routinely grant to private
owners. Second, while it was understood that in certain common properties -
such as the seashore, highways, and running water - "perpetual use was
dedicated to the public," It has never been clear whether the public had an
enforceable right to prevent infringement of those interests. Although the
state apparently did protect public uses, no evidence is available that
public rights could be legally asserted against a recalcitrant government.
</p><p id="p_249">17.The Public Trust Doctrine primarily rests on the principle that certain
resources like air sea, waters and the forests have such a great importance
to the people as a whole that it would be wholly*** onjustilled to make them
a subject of private ownership. The said resources being a gift of nature,
they should be made freely available to everyone irrespective of the status
in life. The doctrine enjoins upon the Government to protect the resources
for the enjoyment of the general public rather than to permit their use for
private ownership or commercial purposes.
</p><p id="p_250">According to Professor Sax the Public Trust Doctrine imposes the following
restrictions on governmental authority.
</p><p id="p_251">"Three types of restrictions on governmental authority are often though to be
imposed by the public trust: first, the property subject to the trust must
not only be used for a public purpose, but it must be held available for use
by the general public; second, the property may not be sold, even for a fair
cash equivalent; and third property must be maintained in particular types of
uses".
</p><p id="p_252">18.The American law on the subject is primarily based on the decision of the
United States Supreme Court in Illinois Central R.R. Company vs. Illinois 146
US 687 (1982). In the year 1869 the Illinois legislature made a substantial
grant of submerged lands - a mile strip along the shores of Lake Michigan
extending one mile out from the shoreline - to the Illinois Central Railroad.
In 1873, the legislature changed its mind and repealed the 1869 grant. The
State of Illinois sued to quit title. The court while accepting the stand of
the State of Illinois' held that the title or the State in the land in
dispute was a little different in character from that which the State held in
lands intended for sails. It was different from the title which the United
States held in public lands which were open to preemption and sale. It was a
title held in trust - for the people of the State that they may enjoy the
navigation of the water, carry on commerce over them, and have liberty of
fishing their in free from obstruction or interference of private parties.
The addiction of the general control of the State over lands in dispute was
not consistent with the exercise of the trust which required the Government
of the State to preserve such waters for the use of the public. According to
Professor ?? court in Illinois' Central "articulated a principle that has
become the central substantive thought in public trust litigation. When a
State holds a resource which is available for the free use of the general
public, a court will look with considerable skepticism upon any governmental
conduct which is calculated either to relocate that resource to more
restricted uses or to subject public uses to the self- interest of private
parties".
</p><p id="p_253">19.In Gould vs. Greylock Reservation Commission 350 Mass 410 (1966), the  
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts took the first major step in
developing the doctrine applicable to changes in the use of lands dedicated
to the public interest. In 1888 a group of citizens interested in preserving
Mount Greylock as a unspoiled natural forest, promoted the creation of an
association for the purpose of laying out a public park on it. The State
Ultimately acquired about 9000 acres, and the legislature enacted a statute
crating the Greylock Reservation Commission. In the year 1953, the
legislature enacted a statute creating an Authority to construct and operate
on Mount Greylock an Aerial Tramway and certain other facilities and it
authorised the commission to lease to the Authority any portion of the Mount
Greylock Reservation. Before the project commenced, five citizens brought an
action against both they Greylock Reservation Commission and the licency
Authority. The plaintiffs brought the sult us beneficiaries of the pubic
trust. The court has been the lease and the management agreement invalid on
the ground that they were in excess or the statutory grant of the authority.
The crucial passage in the judgment of the Court is as under:-
"The profit sharing feature and some aspects of the project itself strongly
suggest a commercial enterprise. In addition to the absence of any clear or
express statutory authorization of as broad a delegation of responsibility by
the Authority as is given by the management agreement, we find no express
grant to the Authority or power to permit use of public lands and of the
Authority's borrowed funds for what seems, in part at least, a commercial
venture for private profit."
</p><p id="p_254">Professor Sax's comments on the above quoted paragraph from Gould decision  
are as under:-
</p><p id="p_255">"It hardly seems surprising, then that the court questioned why a state
should subordinate a pubic park, serving a useful purpose as relatively
undeveloped land, to the demands of private investors for building such a
commercial facility. The court, faced with such a situation, could hardly
have been expected to have treated the case as if it involved nothing but
formal legal issues concerning the state's authority to change the use of the
certain tract of land ..... would, like Illinois Central, was contented with
the most overt sort of imposition on the public interest; commercial
interests had obtained advantages which infringed directly on public uses and
promoted private profits. But the Massachusetts court as also confronted a
more pervasive, if more subtle, problem - that concerning projects which
clearly have some public justification. Such cases arise when, for example, a
highway department seeks to take a pace of parkland or to fill a wetland."
</p><p id="p_256">19.In Sacco vs. Development of Public Works 352 MASS 670, the Massachusetts    
Court restrained the Department of Public Works from filling a great pond as
part of its plan to relocate part of State Highway. The Department purported
to act under the legislative authority. The court found the statutory power
inadequate and held as under:-
</p><p id="p_257">the improvement of public lands contemplated by this section does not include
the widening of a State highway. It seems rather that the improvement of
public lands which the legislature provided for ... is to preserve such lands
so that they may be enjoyed by the people for recreational purposes."
</p><p id="p_258">20.In Robbins vs. Department of Public Works 244 N.E. 2d 577, the Supreme 
Judicial Court of Massachusetts restrained the Public Works Department from
acquiring Fowl Meadows, "Wet lands of considerable natural beauty ... often
used for nature study and recreation" for highway use.

</p><p id="p_260">22.Professor Sax stated the scope of the public trust doctrine in the
following words:-
</p><p id="p_261">If any of the analysis in this Article makes sense, it is clear that the
judicial techniques developed in public trust cases need not be limited
either to these few conventional interests or to questions of disposition of
public properties. Public trust problems are found whenever governmental
regulation comes into question, and they occur in a wide range of situations
in which diffuse public interests need protection against tightly organized
groups with clear and immediate goals. Thus, it seems that the delicate
mixture of procedural and substantive protections which the courts have
applied in conventional public trust cases would be equally applicable and
equally appropriate in controversies involving air pollution, the
dissemination of pesticides, the location of rights of way for utilities, and
strip mining or wetland filling on private lands in a state where
governmental permits are required."
</p><p id="p_262">23.We may at this stage refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court of
California in <a href="/doc/148498757/" id="a_139">National Audubon Society vs. Superior</a> Court of Alpine County 33
CAL. 3d 419. The case is popularly known as "the Mono lake case", Mono lake 
is the second largest lake in California. the lake is saline. It contains no
fish but support a large population of brine shrimp which feed vast numbers
of nesting and migrating birds. Islands in the take protect a large breeding
colony of California guits, and the lake itself serves as a haven on the
migration route for thousands of birds. Towers and spires of tura on the
north and south shores are matters of geological interest and a tourist
attraction. In 1940, the Division of Water Resources granted the Department
of Water and Power of the city of Los Angeles a permit to appropriate
virtually the entire flow of 4 of the 5 streams flowing into the lake. As a
result of these diversions, the level of the lake dropped, the surface area
diminished, the gulls were adbondoning the lake and the scenic beauty and the
ecological values of the Mono Lake were imperiled. The plaintiffs
environmentalist - using the public trust doctrine - filed a law suit against
Los Angeles Water Diversions, the case eventually came to the California
Supreme court, on a Federal Trial Judge's request for clarification of the
States public trust doctrine. the Court explained the concept of public trust
doctrine in the following words:-
</p><p id="p_263">"By the law of nature these things are common to mankind - the air, running
water, the sea and consequently the shores of the sea." (Institutes of
Justinian 2.1.1.) From this origin in Roman law, the English common law
evolved the concept of the public trust, under which the sovereign owns "all
of its navigable waterways and the lands lying beneath them as trustee of a
public trust for the benefit of the people."
</p><p id="p_264">24.The Court explained the purpose of the public trust as under:-
"The objective of the public trust has evolved in tandem with the changing
public perception of the values and uses of waterways. As we observed in
Marks v. Whitney, supra, 6 Cal.3d 251, "[p]ublic trust easements [were]
traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce and fisheries. They
have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for
boating and general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state,
and to use the bottom of the navigable waters for anchoring, standing, or
other purposes. We went on, however, to hold that the traditional triad of
uses-navigation, commerce and fishing-did not limit the public interest in
the trust res. In language of special importance to the present setting, we
stated that "[t]he public uses to which tidelands are subject are
sufficiently flexible to encompass changing public needs. In administering
the trust the state is not burdened with an outmoded classification favoring
one mode of utilization over another. there is a growing public recognition
that one of the most important public uses of the tidelands-a use encompassed
within the tidelands trust-is the preservation of those lands in their
natural state, so that they may serve as ecological units for scientific
study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for
birds and marine life, and which favorably affect the secondary and climate
or the area."
</p><p id="p_265">Mono Lake is a navigable waterway. It supports a small local industry which
harvests brine shrimp for sale as fish food, which endeavor probably
qualifies the lake as a "fishery" under the traditional public trust cases.
The principal values plaintiffs seek to protect, however, are recreational
and ecological-the scenic views of the lake and its shore, the purity of the
air, and the use of the lake for nesting and feeding by birds, Under Marks v.
Whitney, supra, 6 Cal.3d 251, it is clear that protection or these values is
among the purposes of the public trust."
</p><p id="p_266">The court summed up the powers of the state are trustee in the following
words:-
</p><p id="p_267">"Thus, the public trust is more than an affirmation of state power to use
public property for public purposes. It is an affirmation of the duty of the
state to protect the people's common heritage of streams, lakes, marshlands
and tidelands, surrendering that right of protection only in rare cases when
the abandonment of that right is consistent with the purposes of the
trust......
</p><p id="p_268">The Supreme Court of California, inter alia, reached the following
conclusion:-
</p><p id="p_269">"The state has an affirmative duty to take the public trust into account in
the planning and allocation of water resources, and to protect public trust
uses whenever feasible. Just as the history of this state shows that
appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of water despite unavoidable
harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative water
rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may
cause unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. (See Johnson, 14
U.C.Davis LL. Rev.233, 230-257;
</p><p id="p_270">Robie, Some Reflections on Environmental Considerations in Water Rights 
Administration, 2 Ecology L.Q.695, 710-711 (1972); Comment, 33 Hastings L.J. 
653,
</p><p id="p_271">654.) As a matter of practical necessity the state may have to approve
appropriations despite foreseeanie harm to public trust uses. In so doing,
however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the
effect of the taking on the public trust (see United Plainsmen v. N.D. State
Water Cons. Comm'n, 247 N.W. 2d 457, 462-463 (N.D. 1976), and to preserve, so  
far as consistent with the public interest, the uses protected by the trust."
</p><p id="p_272">25.The Court finally came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs could rely on
the public trust doctrine in seeking reconsideration of the allocation of the
waters of the Mono basin.
</p><p id="p_273">26.It is no doubt correct that the public trust doctrine under the English
Common Law extended only to certain traditional uses such as navigation,
commerce and fishing. But the American Courts in recent cases have expanded  
the concept of the public trust doctrine. The observations of the Supreme
Court of California in Mono Lake case clearly show the judicial concern in
protecting all ecologically important land,s for example fresh water,
wetlands or riparian forests. The observation of the Court in Mono Lake case
to the effect that the protection of ecological values is among the purpose
of public trust, may give rise to an argument that the ecology and the
environment-protection is a relevant factor to determine which lands, waters
or airs are protected by the public trust doctrine. The Courts in United
States are finally beginning to adopt this reasoning and are expanding the
public trust to encompass new types of lands and waters. In Phillips
Petroleum co. vs. Mississippi 108 S.Ct. 791 (1988), the United States Supreme
Court upheld Mississippi's extension of public trust doctrine to lands
underlying nonavigable tidal areas. The majority judgment adopted ecological
concepts to determine which lands can be considered tide lands. Phillips
Petroleum case assumes importance because the Supreme Court expanded the     
pubic trust doctrine to identify the tide lands not on commercial
considerations but on ecological concepts. We see no reason why the public
trust doctrine should not be expanded to include all eco-systems operating in
our natural resources.
</p><p id="p_274">27.Our legal system - based on English Common Law - includes the public trust
doctrine as part of its jurisprudence. The State is the trustee of all
natural resources which are by nature meant for public use and enjoyment.
Public at large is the beneficiary of the sea- shore, running waters, airs,
forests and ecologically fragile lands. The State as a trustee is under a
legal duty to protect the natural resources. These resources meant for public
use cannot be converted into private ownership.
</p><p id="p_275">28.We are fully aware that the issues presented in this case illustrate the
classic struggle between those members of the public who would preserve our
rivers, forests, parks and open land sin their pristine purity and those
charged with administrative responsibilities who, under the pressures of the
changing needs of an increasing complex society, find it necessary to
encroach to some extent open lands heretofore considered in-violate to
change. The resolution of this conflict in any given case is for the
legislature and not the courts. If there is a law made by Parliament or the
State Legislatures the courts can serve as an instrument of determining
legislative intent in the exercise of its powers of judicial review under the
Constitution. But in the absence of any legislation, the executive acting
under the doctrine of public trust cannot abdicate the natural resources and
convert them into private ownership or for commercial use. The esthetic use
and the prestime glory of the natural resources, the environment and the eco-
systems of our country cannot be permitted to be eroded for private,
commercial or any other use unless the courts find it necessary, in good
faith, for the public goods and in public interest to encroach upon the said
resources.
</p><p id="p_276">29.Coming to the facts of the present case, large area of the bank of river
Beas which is part of protected forest has been given on a lease purely for
commercial purposes to the Motels. We have no hesitation in holding that the
Himachal Pradesh Government committed patent breach of public trust by 
leasing the ecologically fragile land to the Motel management. Both the lease
</p><p id="p_277">- transactions are in patent breach of the trust held by the State
Government. The second lease granted in the year 1994 was virtually of the
land which is a part of river-bed. Even the board in its report has
recommended deleasing of the said area. 
</p><p id="p_278">30.This Court in <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_140">Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum v. Union of India &amp; Ors.
JT</a> 1996(7) S.C.375 explained the "Precautionary Principle" and "Polluters
Pays principle" as under:-
</p><p id="p_279">Some of the salient principles of "Sustainable Development", as culled out
from Brundtland Report and other international documents, are inter-
Generational Equity, Use and Conservation of Natural Resources, Environmental
Protection, the Precautionary Principle, Polluter Pays principle, Obligation
to assist and cooperate, Eradication of Poverty and Financial Assistance to
the developing countries. We are, however, of the view that "The
Precautionary Principle" and "The Polluter Pays" principle are essential
features of "Sustainable Development". The "Precautionary Principle" - in the
context of the municipal law - means:
</p><p id="p_280">(i) Environment measures - by the State Government and the statutory
authorities - must anticipate, prevent and attack the causes of environmental
degradation.
</p><p id="p_281">(ii) Where there are threats of serious and irreversible damage, lack of
scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures
to prevent environmental degradation.
</p><p id="p_282">(iii) The "Onus of proof" is on the actor or the developer/industrialist to
snow that this action is environmentally benign.
</p><p id="p_283">"The Polluter Pays" principle has been held to be a sound principle by this
Court in Indian Council for <a href="/doc/1356184/" id="a_141">Enviro-Legal Action vs. Union of India JT</a> 1996
(2) 196. The Court observed, "We are of the opinion that any principle
evolved in this behalf should be simple, practical and suited to the
conditions obtaining in this country". The Court ruled that "Once the
activity carried on is hazardous or inherently dangerous, the person carrying
on such activity is liable to make good the loss caused to any other person
by his activity irrespective of the fact whether he took reasonable care
while carrying on his activity. The rule is premised upon the very nature of
the activity carried on".
</p><p id="p_284">Consequently the polluting industries are "absolutely liable to compensate
for the harm caused by them to villagers in the affected area, to the soil
and to the underground water and hence, they are bound to take all necessary
measures to remove sludge and other pollutants lying in the affected areas".
The "Polluter Pays" principle as interpreted by this Court means that the
absolute liability for harm to the environment extends not only to compensate
the victims of pollution but also the cost of restoring the environmental of
the damaged environment is part of the process of "Sustainable Development"
and as such polluter is liable to pay the cost to the individual sufferers as
well as the cost of the reversing the damaged ecology.

utilization results in irreversible damage to environments. There has been
accelerated degradation of environment primarily on account of lack of
effective enforcement of environmental laws and non-compliance of the

the present without compromising the ability of the future generation to meet
their own needs. <a href="/doc/1938608/" id="a_150">In Narmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. [(2000)

nature/ecology with or without mitigation. In these matters, the required
standard now is that the risk of harm to the environment or to human health
is to be decided in public interest, according to a "reasonable person's "
test. [See Chairman Barton : The Status of the Precautionary Principle in

people's right of natural resources. The entire process of setting up and
functioning of mining operation require utmost good faith and honesty on the
part of the intending entrepreneur. For carrying on any mining activity close
to township which has tendency to degrade environment and are likely to
effect air, water and soil and impair the quality of life of inhabitants of
the area, there would be greater responsibility on the part of the
entrepreneur. The fullest disclosures including the potential for increased
burdens on the environment consequent upon possible increase in the quantum 
and degree of pollution, has to be made at the outset so that public and all
those concerned including authorities may decide whether the permission can
at all be granted for carrying on mining activity. The regulatory authorities
have to act with utmost care in ensuring compliance of safeguards, norms and
standards to be observed by such entrepreneurs. When questioned, the 
regulatory authorities have to show that the said authorities acted in the
manner enjoined upon them. Where the regulatory authorities, either connive
or act negligently by not taking prompt action to prevent, avoid or control
the damage to environment, natural resources and peoples' life, health and

that mining operation can commence. It cannot be accepted that by approving

have approved mining and it can commence forthwith on such approval. Section
13 of the MMRD Act and the Rules made in exercise of powers under the said

soil exists and is to be excavated for mining operations, remove it
separately and utilize for restoration or rehabilitation of the land which is
no longer required for mining operations. The holder is also required to take
steps so that the overburden, waste rock, rejects and fines generated during
prospecting and mining operations or tailings, slims and fines produced
during sizing salting and benefication or metallurgical operations shall be
stored in separate dumps which shall be properly secured to prevent escape of
material therefrom in harmful quantities which may cause degradation of
environment. Wherever possible, the waste rock, overburden etc. shall be
back-filled into the mines excavation with a view to restoring the land for
its original use as far as possible and wherever it is not feasible during
mining operation, the waste dumps shall be suitably tarraced and stabilized
through vegetation or otherwise. It is also required that the phased
restoration, reclamation and rehabilitation of lands affected by mining
operation shall be undertaken which work shall be completed before the
conclusion of mining operations and the abandonment of mine. Air pollution
due to fines, dust and smoke or gaseous emissions during mining operations
and related activities shall be controlled and kept within 'permissible

out of such operations shall be abated or controlled by the lessee at the
source so as to keep it within the permissible limit. The mining operations
shall be carried out in such a manner so as to cause least damage to the
flora of the area and nearby areas. Every holder of mining lease shall take
immediate measures for planting in the same area or any other area as
selected by the authorized officer and not less than twice the number of

2005 SC 4256): 
</p><p id="p_295">?69. The duty to preserve natural resources in pristine purity has been
highlighted in <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_162">M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath &amp; Ors</a>. [(1997) 1 SCC 388]. After
considering the opinion of various renowned authors and decisions rendered by
other countries as well on environment and ecology, this Court held that the
notion that the public has a right to expect certain lands and natural areas
to retain their natural characteristics is finding its way into the law of
the land. The Court accepted the applicability of public trust doctrine and
held that it was founded on the ideas that certain common properties such as
rivers, sea-shore, forests and the air were held by the Government in
trusteeship for the free and unimpeded use of the general public. These
natural resources have a great importance to the people as a whole that it
would wholly unjustified to make them subject to private ownership. These
resources being a gift of nature, should be made freely available to everyone
irrespective of the status in life. The doctrine enjoins upon the Government
to protect the resources for the enjoyment of the general public rather than
to permit their use for private ownership or commercial purposes. It was held
that our legal system  based on English common law includes the public trust
doctrine as part of its jurisprudence. The State is the trustee of all
natural resources which are by nature meant for public use and enjoyment.
Public at large is the beneficiary of these resources. The State as a trustee
is under a legal duty to protect these natural resources. Summing up the
Court said : "We are fully aware that the issues presented in this case
illustrate the classic struggle between those members of the public who would
preserve our rivers, forests, parks and open lands in their pristine purity
and those charged with administrative responsibilities who, under the
pressures of the changing needs of an increasingly complex society, find it
necessary to encroach to some extent upon open lands heretofore considered 
inviolate to change. The resolution of this conflict in any given case is for
the legislature and not the courts. If there is a law made by Parliament or
the State Legislatures the courts can serve as an instrument of determining
legislative intent in the exercise of its powers of judicial review under the
Constitution. But in the absence of any legislation, the executive acting
under the doctrine of public trust cannot abdicate the natural resources and
convert them into private ownership, or for commercial use. The aesthetic use
and the pristine glory of the natural resources, the environment and the
ecosystems of our country cannot be permitted to be eroded for private,
commercial or any other use unless the courts find it necessary, in good
faith, for the public good and in public interest to encroach upon the said
resources."
</p>
<p id="p_296">?74. The forest policy has a statutory flavour. The non-fulfillment of
aforesaid principle aim would be violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the
Constitution. The basic objectives of the Forest Policy, 1988 are: "2.1 The
basic objectives that should govern the National Forest Policy are the
following:
</p><p id="p_297">-- Maintenance of environmental stability through preservation and, where
necessary, restoration of the ecological balance that has been adversely
disturbed by serious depletion of the forests of the country.
</p><p id="p_298">-- Conserving the natural heritage of the country by preserving the remaining
natural forests with the vast variety of flora and fauna, which represent the
remarkable biological diversity and genetic resources of the country.
</p><p id="p_299">-- Checking soil erosion and denudation in the catchment areas of rivers,
lakes reservoirs in the interest of soil and water conservation, for
mitigating floods and droughts and for the retardation of silation of
reservoirs.
</p><p id="p_300">-- Checking the extension of sand-dunes in the desert areas of Rajasthan and
along the coastal tracts.
</p><p id="p_301">-- Increasing substantially the forest/tree cover in the country through
massive afforestation and social forestry programmes, especially on all
denuded, degraded and unproductive lands. 
</p><p id="p_302">-- Meeting the requirements of fuelwood, fodder, minor forest produce and
small timber of the rural and tribal populations.
</p><p id="p_303">-- Increasing the productivity of forests to meet essential national needs.
</p><p id="p_304">-- Encouraging efficient utilization of forest produce and maximum
substitution of wood.
</p><p id="p_305">-- Creating a massive people's movement with the involvement of women, for
achieving these objectives and to minimize pressure on existing forests.
2.2 The principal aim of Forest Policy must be to ensure environmental
stability and maintenance of ecological balance including atmospheric
equilibrium which are vital for sustenance of all life forms, human, animal
and plant. The derivation of direct economic benefit must be subordinated to
this principal aim."
</p><p id="p_306">?79?. Moreover, any threat to the ecology can lead to violation of right of
enjoyment of healthy life guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_163">Article 21</a> which is required to be
protected. The Constitution of India enjoins upon this Court a duty to
protect environments.?
</p>
<p id="p_307">?85.Reference may also be made to report of the Planning Commission (Chapter  
IX) relating to forest environments in Tenth Five Year Plan (2002- 2007)
which has taken note of the fact that sustainability is not an option but
imperative since without it environmental deterioration and economic decline
will be feeding each other leading to poverty, pollution, poor health,
political upheaval and unrest. Environment cuts across all sectors of
development. The rapid increase in green house gases in the atmosphere, land
degradation, deteriorating conditions of fragile eco systems, deforestation,
loss of biodiversity and environmental pollution have become subjects of
serious global concern. The overall impact of these phenomena is likely to
result in depletion of ozone layer, change of climate, rise in sea-level loss
of natural resources, reduction in their productivity ultimately leading to
an ecological crisis affecting livelihood options for development and over
all deterioration in quality of life.?
</p><p id="p_308">?88.The national development agenda must recognize the necessity of 
protecting the long-term ecological security. The problem area is the growing
population, high degree of mechanism and steep rise in energy use which has
led to activities that directly or indirectly affect the sustainability of
the environment.?
</p><p id="p_309">?89.It is recognized that the sustainable use of bio-diversity is fundamental
to ecological sustainable. The loss of bio-diversity stems from destruction
of the habitat, extension of agriculture, filling up of wet lands, conversion
of rich bio-diversity sites for human settlement and industrial development,
destruction of coastal areas and uncontrolled commercial exploitation. It is
thus evident that the preservation of eco- systems, bio-diversity and
environment whether examined on common law principle or statutory principle
or constitutional principle eying from any angle it is clearly a national
issue to be tackled at the national level. All initiatives are required to
seriously pursue.?
</p><p id="p_310">?90.Dealing with inter-generational justice, it has been rightly observed
that posterity shall not be treated like dirt. In an article published in
2003 Columbia Journal of Environmental Law (28 Colum.J.Envtl.L.185), the
author says that the way in which a society cares or does not care for its
dirt  its land reflects the degree to which it cares or does not care for its
own long-term future.?
</p><p id="p_311">?91.We may also briefly refer to Public Trust doctrine and its applicability
to the matters under consideration. The Public Trust Doctrine looks beyond
the need of the present generation and also suggests that certain resources
are invested with a special nature. It would be instructive to make a note of
a story given in by Timothy Patrick Brady in Boston College Environmental
Affairs Law Review, Spring 1990 under the title 'But most of it belongs to
those yet to be born'. The story relates to digging of well at the time of
drought. When a Frenchman told villagers of a prudent African solution of
digging well, many villagers agreed but others argued that it will bring
people from other villages and they would bring their cattle and that would
increase the pressure on the already precious water. The Frenchman told the
villagers that why not explain to them that the well is only for your own
village and they can dig their own. It was then said that 'water is not only
ours, but is gift of nature from God and must be shared.' Ultimately, they
concluded that it was wiser not to dig the well at all. The moral of the
story is that we are trustees of natural resources which belong to all
including future generation as well. The public trust doctrine has to be used
to protect the right of this as also future generation.?

</p>
<p id="p_314">?52. We entirely agree with the CEC report that in the absence of proper
checks, verifications and controls, there is bound to be illegal mining,
storage and transportation of minerals, but we find that after the CEC

Minerals) Rules, 2013 have been framed by the State Government under <a href="/doc/22457738/" id="a_170">Section 
23(c)</a> of the MMDR Act. A reading of these Rules show that several provisions
have been made in these rules to prevent illegal mining and to regulate the
sale, export and transit of ore, storage of mineral and transportation and
winning of mineral. The rules also provide for establishment of check posts,
barriers and weighbridges and inspection of minerals in transit. Moreover,
these rules empower any person authorised by the Government to enter, 
inspect, search and seize articles. These rules will have to be strictly
enforced by the State Government and we hope that by such strict enforcement
of these rules, the mining, storage and transportation of minerals in the
State of Goa will get controlled and regulated and the leakages and evasion
of revenue will, to a large extent, be prevented.?
</p>
<p id="p_315">?66. We are of the considered opinion that it is for the State Government to
decide as a matter of policy in what manner the leases of these mineral
resources would be granted, but this decision has to be taken in accordance
with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_171">MMDR Act</a> and the Rules made thereunder and in
consonance with the constitutional provisions and the decision taken by the
State of Goa to grant a mining lease in a particular manner or to a
particular party can be examined by way of judicial review by the Court. To
quote the opinion of four Judges out of five Judges expressed by D.K. Jain J.
in Natural Resources Allocation, In Re, Special Reference No.1 of 2012
(supra):
</p><p id="p_316">?Alienation of natural resources is a policy decision, and the means adopted
for the same are thus, executive prerogatives. However, when such a policy
decision is not backed by a social or welfare purpose, and precious and
scarce natural resources are alienated for commercial pursuits of profit
maximising private entrepreneurs, adoption of means other than those that are
competitive and maximise revenue may be arbitrary and face the wrath
of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_172">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Hence, rather than prescribing or
proscribing a method, we believe, a judicial scrutiny of methods of disposal
of natural resources should depend on the facts and circumstances of each
case, in consonance with the principles which we have culled out above.
Failing which, the Court, in exercise of power of judicial review, shall term
the executive action as arbitrary, unfair, unreasonable and capricious due to

of the nation and its citizens. It is the obligation of all concerned,
including the Central and the State Governments, to conserve and not waste
such valuable resources. <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_175">Article 48-A</a> of the Constitution requires that the
State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and safeguard
the forests and wild life of the country. Similarly, <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_176">Article 51-A</a> enjoins a
duty upon every citizen to protect and improve the natural environment
including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life, and to have compassion for
all the living creatures. In view of the Constitutional provisions, the
Doctrine of Public Trust has become the law of the land. The said doctrine
rests on the principle that certain resources like air, sea, waters and

be highly unjustifiable to make them a subject of private ownership.

(2011 7 SCC 338): 
</p><p id="p_323">?19. Universal human dependence on the use of environmental resources for the
most basic needs renders it impossible to refrain from altering environment.
As a result, environmental conflicts are ineradicable and environmental
protection is always a matter of degree, inescapably requiring choices as to
the appropriate level of environmental protection and the risks which are to
be regulated. This aspect is recognized by the concept of "sustainable
development". It is equally well-settled by the decision of this Court in the
case of <a href="/doc/1938608/" id="a_179">Narmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of India and Others</a> [(2000) 10 SCC  
664] that environment has different facets and care of the environment is an
on-going process. These concepts rule out the formulation of across-the-board
principle as it would depend on the facts of each case whether diversion in a
given case should be permitted or not, barring "No Go" areas (whose
identification would again depend on undertaking of due diligence exercise).
In such cases, the Margin of Appreciation Doctrine would apply.
</p><p id="p_324">20. Making these choices necessitates decisions, not only about how risks
should be regulated, how much protection is enough, and whether ends served
by environmental protection could be pursued more effectively by diverting
resources to other uses. Since the nature and degree of environmental risk
posed by different activities varies, the implementation of environmental
rights and duties require proper decision making based on informed reasons
about the ends which may ultimately be pursued, as much as about the means  
for attaining them. Setting the standards of environmental protection
involves mediating conflicting visions of what is of value in human life.
</p><p id="p_325">30. Time has come for us to apply the constitutional "doctrine of
proportionality" to the matters concerning environment as a part of the
process of judicial review in contradistinction to merit review. It cannot be
gainsaid that utilization of the environment and its natural resources has to
be in a way that is consistent with principles of sustainable development and
intergenerational equity, but balancing of these equities may entail policy
choices. In the circumstances, barring exceptions, decisions relating to
utilization of natural resources have to be tested on the anvil of the well-
recognized principles of judicial review.
</p><p id="p_326">Have all the relevant factors been taken into account? Have any extraneous
factors influenced the decision? Is the decision strictly in accordance with
the legislative policy underlying the law (if any) that governs the field? Is
the decision consistent with the principles of sustainable development in the
sense that has the decision-maker taken into account the said principle and,
on the basis of relevant considerations, arrived at a balanced decision?
98Thus, the court should review the decision-making process to ensure that
the decision of MoEF is fair and fully informed, based on the correct
principles, and free from any bias or restraint. Once this is ensured, then
the doctrine of "margin of appreciation" in favour of the decision-maker
would come into play. Our above view is further strengthened by the decision
of the Court of Appeal in the case of <a href="/doc/1186698/" id="a_180">R v. Chester City Council</a> reported in

?7?..On account of extensive mining on a disproportionate scale without
taking remedial measures has resulted irreversible changes in the environment
at Aravalli. It is in the aforestated background that any mining activity
came to be banned under Order dated 29/30.10.2002. Even as far back as 2002, 
the environmental problems in the Aravalli range in Gurgaon district came to
be identified. Remedial measures including pollution control guidelines and
action plan for various stakeholders came to be suggested by CMPDI. Though 
guidelines for mining operations came to be issued by the State Government,
the compliance was not there. Moreover, there was no mechanism to upgrade the 
mining technologies to minimize the impact due to mining in the eco-sensitive
zones. CMPDI also noticed that in the Aravalli Hills a large number of
activities, operations of stone crushers and deforestation had caused
environmental degradation even in 2002 which is clear from para 63 of the
above judgment in M.C. Mehta case (supra) and the tragedy is that despite all
warnings, the mines continued their operations without Environment Management 
Plan. That, right from 18.3.2004, when this Court pronounced the judgment in
M.C. Mehta case (supra), till date, number of Reports came to be submitted as
the Court tried to balance mining activity on one hand with protection of
environment on the other hand. In fact, in para 57 of the said judgment, this
Court stated that so long as it is possible to undertake mining operations on
the sustainable development principle, the Court should not impose complete
ban on mining as it generates revenue for the State. However, vide para 89, a
warning was given that if despite imposition of stringent conditions, the
degradation of environment continuous and reaches a stage of no-return, then
this Court may have to consider at a later date the closure of mining
activity. This prediction has come true. The consequence is that the State
now has decided to close the mining activity. Para 89 is also important from
another angle. The judgment in M.C. Mehta case (supra) has left it to this
Court to consider at a later date the closure of mining activity. Even in
para 96(6), this Court observed that mining activity can be permitted only on
the basis of sustainable development and on compliance with stringent
conditions as the Aravalli Hill Range has to be protected at any cost and in
case despite stringent conditions, mining results in an irreversible
consequence on the ecology in the said area then at a later date the total
stoppage of mining activity may have to be considered. In other words, in the
judgment of this Court in M.C. Mehta case (supra) decided on 18.3.2004, a
window was left open for this Court to impose complete ban on mining
operations if emergent situation arises.

immense mineral treasures with great potential for economic exploitation. At
the same time, our economy is facing problems on account of rising
population, indiscriminate industrialization, unsustainable exploitation of
natural resources etc. Mining sector is regulated by a large number of
environment and forest statutes. The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_182">Control of

and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_188">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 ("1957 Act"); under <a href="/doc/672459/" id="a_189">Section 2(ii)</a> of Forest
(Conservation) Act, 1980; and to Environment Clearance under EIA Notification
which applies to mining of major minerals and to the areas exceeding 5
hectares. In case of mining projects, a Site Clearance is also required which
is issued either by the Central Government or the State Government depending
upon the area of land let out on lease. Further, <a href="/doc/672459/" id="a_190">Section 2(ii)</a>of Forest
(Conservation) Act, 1980 prohibits grant or renewal of mining lease without
prior approval of Central Government.
</p><p id="p_330">20. At this stage, we may also note that under <a href="/doc/1164073/" id="a_191">Section 13(2)(qq)</a> of 1957 Act,
Rules have been framed for rehabilitation of flora and other vegetation
destroyed by reason of any prospecting or mining operations. Under <a href="/doc/25002195/" id="a_192">Section
18</a> of the 1957 Act, Rules have been framed for conservation and systematic
development of minerals in India and for the protection of environment by
preventing or controlling pollution caused by prospecting or mining
operations which also form part of Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 and Mineral
Conservation and Development Rules, 1988. Under Rule 27(1)(s)(i) of Mineral
Concession Rules, 1960 every lessee is required to take measures for planting
of trees not less than twice the number destroyed by mining operations. Under
Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, 1988, vide Rule 34, mandatory 
provisions for reclamation and rehabilitation of lands are made for every
holder of prospecting licence or mining lease to be undertaken and that work
has to be completed by the lessee/licensee before abandoning the mine or
prospect. Similarly, under Rule 37 of Mineral Conservation and Development
Rules, 1988 the lessee/licensee has to calibrate the air pollution within
permissible limits specified under EP Act, 1986 as well as Air (Prevention
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_193">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. Under the said Rules 1988, the most
important Guideline is Guideline No. 25.26.3, 25.26.4, 25.26.5 and 25.26.6.
This Guideline deals with reclamation, planning and implementation,
restoration strategy, principles of rehabilitation, rehabilitation of mined
out sites and methods of reclamations. (see Handbook of Environment &amp; Forest 
Legislations, Guidelines and Procedures in India by Ravindra N. Saxena and
Sangita Saxena at pp. 1555-1562). It may be noted that there are two steps to
be taken in the method of reclamation, namely, technical reclamation and
biological reclamation. The most important aspect of the above guideline is
making of a Rehabilitation Plan.
</p><p id="p_331">Conclusion:
</p><p id="p_332">21. None of the above provisions have been complied with. In the
circumstance, by the present order, we hereby suspend all mining operations
in the Aravalli Hill Range falling in the State of Haryana within the area of
approximately 448 sq. kms. in the Districts of Faridabad and Gurgaon
including Mewat till Reclamation Plan duly certified by State of Haryana,
MoEF and CEC is prepared in accordance with the above statutory provisions
contained in various enactments enumerated above as well as in terms of the
Rules framed thereunder and the Guidelines. The said Plan shall state what
steps are needed to be taken to rehabilitate (including reclamation) followed
by Status Reports on steps taken by the Authorities pursuant to the said
Plan.?

<p id="p_333">(viii) Association For Environment Protection Versus State Of Kerala, AIR
2013 SC 2500: 
</p><p id="p_334">?4. Although, the Constitution of India, which was enforced on 26.1.1950 did
not contain any express provision for protection of environment and ecology,
the people continued to treat it as their social duty to respect the nature,
natural resources and protect environment and ecology. After 26 years,
<a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_194">Article 48-A</a> was inserted in Part IV of the Constitution and the State was
burdened with the responsibility of making an endeavour to protect and
improve the environment and to safeguard the forest and wildlife of the
country. By the same amendment, Fundamental Duties of the citizens were  
enumerated in the form of <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_195">Article 51-A (Part-IV A).</a> These include the duty to
protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers
and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures [<a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_196">Article 51-A(g)].</a>
</p><p id="p_335">5. The Courts in different jurisdictions have, time and again, invoked the
public trust doctrine for giving judicial protection to environment, ecology
and natural resources. This Court also recognized the importance of the
public trust doctrine and applied the same in several cases for protecting
natural resources which have been treated as public properties and are held
by the Government as trustee of the people. The judgment in M.C. Mehta V/s.
Kamal Nath (1997) 1 SCC 388 is an important milestone in the development of
new jurisprudence by the Courts in this country for protection of
environment. In that judgment, the Court considered the question whether a
private company running tourists resort in Kullu-Manali valley could block
the flow of Beas river and create a new channel to divert the river to at
least one kilometer down stream. After adverting to the theoretical and
philosophical basis of the public trust doctrine and judgments in Illinois
Central Railroad Co. V/s. People of the State of Illinois, 146 US 387; Gould
V/s. Greylock Reservation Commission 350 Mass 410 (1966); Sacco V/s.   
Development of Public Works, 532 Mass 670; Robbins V/s. Deptt. of Public 
Works 244 NE 2d 577 and National Audubon Society V/s. Superior Court of  
Alpine County 33 Cal 3d 419, this Court observed:
</p><p id="p_336">"Our legal system ? based on English common law ? includes the public trust
doctrine as part of its jurisprudence. The State is the trustee of all
natural resources which are by nature meant for public use and enjoyment.
Public at large is the beneficiary of the sea-shore, running waters, airs,
forests and ecologically fragile lands. The State as a trustee is under a
legal duty to protect the natural resources. These resources meant for public
use cannot be converted into private ownership.
</p><p id="p_337">We are fully aware that the issues presented in this case illustrate the
classic struggle between those members of the public who would preserve our
rivers, forests, parks and open lands in their pristine purity and those
charged with administrative responsibilities who, under the pressures of the
changing needs of an increasingly complex society, find it necessary to
encroach to some extent upon open lands heretofore considered inviolate to
change. The resolution of this conflict in any given case is for the
legislature and not the courts. If there is a law made by Parliament or the
State Legislatures the courts can serve as an instrument of determining
legislative intent in the exercise of its powers of judicial review under the
Constitution. But in the absence of any legislation, the executive acting
under the doctrine of public trust cannot abdicate the natural resources and
convert them into private ownership, or for commercial use. The aesthetic use
and the pristine glory of the natural resources, the environment and the
ecosystems of our country cannot be permitted to be eroded for private,
commercial or any other use unless the courts find it necessary, in good
faith, for the public good and in public interest to encroach upon the said
resources."
</p>
<p id="p_338">55. From the above judgments, it is clear that the courts have stepped in to
protect the environment by curbing mining activity, whenever the state has
failed in its duty under <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_197">Article 48</a> A and 51 A. Also, from the various
reports referred above, it is evident that the directions and the orders of
the Hon'ble Apex Court and this Court referred above have been violated and
the illegal mining activity has not been curbed and the mining has been
continued beyond permissible limits, resultantly, causing irreparable damage
to the ecology. The scope of the doctrine of public trust has been discussed
elucidated by the Apex Court in M.C Mehta?s case (supra).  The scope of
judicial review is not limited to validity of enactments alone but would also
be applicable to policy decisions when the decisions either directly or
indirectly violate the fundamental rights, more so in cases where the
interest of the public is at stake.If the ecology is not protected, there is
no doubt that it will endanger the very existence of human life and we might
not even have a future generation.Therefore, as a custodian of the
fundamental rights and the constitutional rights, it is the duty of this
court to ensure that environment is protected and is not subjected to
degradation, when the authorities have failed. Hence, the third question is
answered in affirmative.
</p>
<p id="p_339">        56. Under the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the
appellants have not made out any case for interference with the order of the
Learned Single Judge. Hence, the writ appeal is dismissed and the appellants
are directed to strictly comply with the directions issued in W.P No
20020/2017.  No costs. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous petitions are 
closed.
