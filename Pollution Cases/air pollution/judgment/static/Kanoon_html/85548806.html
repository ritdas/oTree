<p id="p_4">4.     Individual facts of the writ petitioners, the submissions made on behalf of

Respondents State and Union of India are being noticed hereinafter.

WPC 2027/2016

</p><p id="p_5">5.      Petitioner was granted mining lease of Iron Ore over an area of 233.99

Hectares in Karampada Reserve Forest in West Singhbhum district with effect

from 10.07.1972 for a period of 30 years (Annexure-1). Twelve month before

expiry of the period of lease, it applied for first renewal on 08.07.2001 in terms of

Rule 24(A)(1) of Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, which however, remained

pending till Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/542527/" id="a_3">Regulation) Amendment Act</a>,

2015 was enacted. The Ordinance had come into force with effect from

12.01.2015 before the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_4">Amendment Act</a> was passed by the Parliament. Prior to that,

on 18.07.2014, Rules 24A(6) of Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 was amended

which provided for deemed extension for a period of two years with effect from

18.07.2014 of such cases pending for first renewal of lease deed where renewal

application had been made within time. Petitioner's application for renewal of

lease has been rejected by Annexure-19 order dated 01.04.2016 contained in

Memo No. 882 passed by the Department of Industries, Mines &amp; Geology,

Government of Jharkhand. Consequent thereto, petitioner has been asked to hand

over possession of the lease area to Mines Department by letter no. 445 dated

05.04.2016 (Annexure-20) issued by the Deputy Commissioner, West Singhbhum,

Chaibasa, failing which steps would be taken to take possession of the lease hold

property by the State Authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.     It is submitted that the petitioner has obtained forest clearances for the

break up area i.e. area which has been diverted for non-forest purpose having

24.86 acres vide Annexure-11 order dated 19.05.2005. According to the

petitioner, it has obtained environmental clearances on 23.01.2007 and

19.07.2013 for 01 lakh MT and 08 lakh MT respectively by order contained at

Annexure-9 &amp; 10. It is submitted that only after clarification made for obtaining

environmental clearances under the environmental <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_5">Protection Act</a>, 1986,

petitioner applied on 30.01.2006 for the same which was granted on 23.01.2007

and has been extended from time to time. Petitioner has also complied with the

provisions of Scheduled Tribes and <a href="/doc/121302/" id="a_6">Other Traditional Forest Dwellers

(Recognition of Forest Rights) Act</a>, 2006, as per Certificate dated 12.01.2011

(Annexure-12) issued by the competent authority. Petitioner has always worked

the mines as per the approved plan. The Indian Bureau of Mines (hereinafter to be

referred as 'IBM') has not raised the issue regarding mining without the approved

plan or scheme. The statutory certificate of IBM is contained at Annexures-4 to 8

and is extended up to 31.03.2019. As per Annexure-23 to the rejoinder to the

counter affidavit and supplementary counter affidavit of the State issued by the

IBM, no violation has been found in respect of Karampada Ore Mines having an

area of 233.99 hectares of the petitioner situated in Karampada Forest in Saranda

Forest Division in West Singhbhum up to 31.03.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.     Petitioner has contended that it has obtained the Consent to Operate (CTO)

and applied for it within time. Once the application for Consent to Operate is

made, the same is deemed to have been granted unconditionally, if not expressly

refused. The Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board had never refused issuance

of CTO till 2016. But suddenly on 11.07.2016, it has issued a letter informing the

petitioner that its application for grant of CTO dated 30.09.2014 has been rejected

as it did not submit a valid mining lease deed. These documents are enclosed as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           4</span>


Annexure-13 series to the writ petition and Annexure-22 series to the rejoinder

affidavit. It is stated that such order has been recalled and the petitioner has been

issued Consent to Operate by the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. In

respect of the charge relating to exploration under section 27(3) of Mining

Concession Rules, 1960 (hereinafter to be referred as ' M.C.R, 1960'), it is stated

that it is not applicable since the State was to execute the supplementary lease

deed with condition of exploration which was not executed, as per the Central

Government Circular dated 23.12.2010. According to the petitioner, exploration

was done and data reported to IBM. In respect of allegation relating to violations

of Rules 13(1) and 42(1((c)(i) of Mineral Conservation and Development Rules,

1988 (hereinafter to be referred as 'M.C.D.R., 1988') and Rule 22(A) of M.C.R.,

1960, it is stated that all the violations fall within the exclusive domain of IBM

and DGMS which have given clearances that there are no outstanding violations

till 31.03.2016, as per Annexure-23 of the rejoinder of the affidavit. Further, in

respect of the allegations relating to violation of Clauses 1,2,5,11(c) of Part VII of

Form-K (Lease Deed), learned counsel for the petitioner submits that all these

allegations have been categorically replied at paragraph-47 of the writ petition.

The State could not have alleged violation of the terms of the lease deed without

physical verification of mines and mining plan / scheme under which petitioner

was working the mines. It is stated on their behalf that the petitioner is undertaking

the mining operations completely in accordance with law. IBM and DGMS have

never pointed out any violation regarding these clauses. Annexure-23 of the

rejoinder is again being relied in support thereof. It is stated that Xerox copy of the

violation pointed out after inspection made under M.C.D.R., 1988 and compliance

position during the last five years which has been taken from approved modified

mining plan dated 08.12.2015, is also enclosed as part of the letter dated

02.05.2016 (Annexure-23) issued by Senior Assistant Controller of Mines, and

Head of Office of Regional Controller of Mines, IBM, Ministry of Mines,

Government of India. On the observations of Justice Shah Commission on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           5</span>


following points inter-alia (i) delay in obtaining environmental clearances, (ii)

extraction of mineral beyond environmental clearance, (iii) mining in safety zone

beyond lease hold area, and (iv) difference in monthly returns filed by the lessee in

IBM and DGMS found; petitioner have contended that there has been delay in

obtaining environmental clearances as earlier stated also. The lessee has never

extracted minerals beyond environmental clearances. According to it, extraction

and dispatch from stock was two distinct concepts. Dispatch cannot meet the

production and extraction. Therefore, it had denied the observation that it has not

worked in safety zone.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.     Counsel for the petitioner has also controverted the observation made by

the Justice Shah Commission on the question of working outside the lease area by

stating that inspection conducted by the Director, DGMS has not pointed out any

illegal mining. Such allegation was neither part of the show-cause notice or the

impugned order. Counsel for the petitioner has therefore sought to controvert the

allegations contained in the counter affidavit in relation to the allegations of delay

in obtaining forest clearance, royalty clearance certificate, environmental

clearance, mining plan through the aforesaid categorical statements. According to

the petitioner, DMO has issued royalty clearance certificate for the period up to

March 2016. It is their case that the State Government had itself accepted, as per

the second show-cause notice issued to it earlier, that the petitioner has been issued

royalty clearance certificate on 24.05.2014,. In respect of the remarks contained in

the show-cause notice dated 31.07.2015 (Annexure-17) in relation to the royalty

clearance certificate and the demand raised by the State Government towards price

of mineral raised in excess of environmental clearance, it is stated at para-48 of the

writ petition that the same was challenged before the Revisional Authority and the

demand has been stayed by an interim order dated 18.08.2015. It is further

submitted that the Respondent also in their counter affidavit at para-31 have

accepted that the Central Government Mining Tribunal have passed an interim

order on 18.08.2015 and that the final decision is awaited. So far as the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                           6</span>


allegation relating to the complaint case filed by the Jharkhand State Pollution

Control Board is concerned, as stated at para-32 of the counter affidavit, it is

contended that the same has got no bearing with the extension of the period of

lease and it is a separate proceeding altogether.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.     In the background of these relevant facts, learned Senior Counsel for the

petitioner Mr. Amarendra Sharan submits that the impugned order rejecting the

application of the petitioner for renewal of lease, is bad in law. Learned Senior

Counsel for the petitioner has advanced the following submissions in support of

the challenge to the impugned order of rejection of renewal application of the

petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       Under the M.M.D.R. Act, the regulation and development of mines and

minerals are under the control of the Union. <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_7">The Act</a> itself provides for procedure

for grant and renewal of licence of lease, terms and conditions thereto, breach,

penalty, etc. Though State is the owner of the mineral deposits in the land which

vest with the Government, but the Parliament has, by reason of the declaration

made in Section 2 of the M.M.D.R. Act, acquired complete dominion over the

legislative field covered by the said legislation. <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_8">The Act</a> though does not denude

the State of its ownership of the minerals, but it tends to regulate to the extent set

out in the provisions of the Act the development of mines and minerals in the State

(Civil Appeal No. 3608/2016 judgment dated 08.04.2016 (<a href="/doc/92025453/" id="a_9">State of Kerala &amp;

others vs. M/s Kerala Rare Earth &amp; Minerals Ltd</a>). The M.C.R. provides for

rules of grant and renewal of lease and licence. Section 8 of M.M.D.R. Act lays

down the period for which a mining lease is granted and renewed. This section has

been amended from time to time. The original <a href="/doc/64657360/" id="a_10">section 8(3)</a>, as introduced in 1957,

confers power to authorize renewal solely upon the Central Government.

Thereafter, for the first time vide amendment in 1999, power to authorize renewal

was vested with the State Government. The M.M.D.R. (Amendment) Act, 2015

has restored this power to the Central Government. Under the un-amended Sub-

Section 3 of Section 8, prior to the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_11">Amendment Act</a>, 2015, the State Government
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                          7</span>


had the power to authorize second and subsequent renewal of mining lease.

<a href="/doc/64657360/" id="a_12">Section 8</a> has been amended and substituted by the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_13">Amendment Act</a>, 2015

whereunder, the power of the State Government to authorize renewal of mining

lease has been done away. The scope of <a href="/doc/64657360/" id="a_14">Section 8(3)</a> prior to the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_15">Amendment Act</a>,

2015 has been interpreted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the catena of

judgments. Vide judgment rendered in the case of <a href="/doc/180993556/" id="a_16">Goa Foundation vs. Union of

India</a> [(2014) 6 SCC 590] dated 21.04.2014, the Apex Court held that an 'Express

Order' is mandatory for leases awaiting second and subsequent renewal under

<a href="/doc/64657360/" id="a_17">section 8(3)</a>. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_18">Amendment Act</a>, 2015 has brought about a huge change, so far as the

regime regulating the period of lease is concerned. <a href="/doc/64657360/" id="a_19">Section 8</a> has been made

inoperative inter-alia, for Iron ore and <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_20">section 8A</a> has been inserted to regulate the

period of grant and subsistence of leases with effect from 12.01.2015. Under sub-

<a href="/doc/532738/" id="a_21">section 6</a> thereof, all leases for non-captive purposes including that of the

petitioner has been extended up to 31.03.2020 by operation of law or for a period

of 50 years from the date of grant, whichever is earlier. As per <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_22">section 8A(3)</a>, all

mining lease granted before commencement of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_23">Amendment Act</a>, 2015, shall be

deemed to be granted for 50 years. It is submitted that as a result of the

amendment, the process of renewal has been completely done away with.

However, the rights that accrued in favour of the renewal applicant has been taken

care of by extending the period of lease deed beyond the period.

</p><p id="p_11">10.    It is submitted that petitioner's case is squarely covered by <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_24">Section 8A(3)</a>

read with Section 8A(6) of the M.M.D.R. Act. The statutory right of extension of

mining lease flows from the statute and is an automatic extension. This section

does not envisage imposition or fulfillment of any conditions extraneous to the

scheme of the Act, either prior or post amendment. The State Government by

passing the order of denial of extension is in spirit, passing the order of rejection

of renewal application which is nothing but an attempt to circumvent the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_25">Amendment Act</a>, 2015. If even after <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_26">Amendment Act</a>, 2015, its

object is not given effect to, it would amount to disregard the intention of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                           8</span>


Legislature. In effect, the State Government by its impugned action, has tried to

maintain its status as it was prior to amendment, so far as the second and

subsequent renewals are concerned and is trying to create power for itself, so far

as cases for first renewal (all prior to 12.01.2015) are concerned.

</p><p id="p_12">11.    Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the law prevailing on the date

of decision making has to be applied. Reliance has been placed upon the

judgments rendered by the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1233720/" id="a_27">State of Tamil Nadu vs.

Corporation, Simla vs. Prem Lata Sood &amp; others</a> [(2007) 11 SCC 40]. It is

reiterated on their part that M.M.D.R. Act, 1957 post 2015 amendment, does not

contemplate any procedure for denying extension / rejecting the applications for

renewal / extension of period of lease, whether be it a case of first renewal

application or second and subsequent renewal application pending prior to

12.01.2015. The State Legislature having been denuded of its Legislative power

with respect to the regulation of mines and minerals to the extent provided in the

M.M.D.R. Act in view of Parliamentary declaration in Section 2 of the M.M.D.R.

Act, cannot justify the impugned order dated 01.04.2016 on any basis other than

the provisions of M.M.D.R. Act as amended. The Executive power of the State

under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_31">Article 162</a> of the Constitution of India extends only to the matters with

respect to which the Legislature of the State has the power to make laws.

Therefore, State is also denuded of its Executive power in regard to matters

covered by the M.M.D.R. Act and Rules. Reliance has been placed upon the

Constitution Bench Judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/865455/" id="a_32">State of Orissa &amp; others vs. M/s

</p>
<p id="p_13">12.     Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner submits that it is equally well

settled that M.M.D.R. Act and Rules are a complete code with respect to the grant

and renewal of mining leases of the lands belonging to the State Government.

Reliance has been placed upon a judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case

of <a href="/doc/1100438/" id="a_36">State of Assam &amp; others vs. Om Prakash Mehta &amp; others</a> [(1973) 1 SCC

584, para-12 thereof]. Both the Central Government and the State Government

act as mere delegates of Parliament while exercising powers under the M.M.D.R.

Act and M.C.R., 1960. Reference has been made to the judgment rendered by the

Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/281568/" id="a_37">Quarry Owners' Association vs. State of Bihar &amp;

others</a> [(2000) 8 SCC 655, para-45&amp;57].
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.     Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner submits that M.M.D.R. Act in

itself provides for different modes to deal with different contingencies and

procedure to bring an end to a lease viz. termination, determination and lapsing of

lease. These contingencies have been dealt with in the judgment rendered by the

Apex Court in the case of Common Cause (Supra) dated 04.04.2016. Reference

is made to the provisions of section 4A of the M.M.D.R. Act which deals with

premature termination of lease on the grounds enumerated therein and to be acted

upon by the State Government at the request of the Central Government. Reliance

has also been placed upon provisions relating to lapse of lease under <a href="/doc/109881589/" id="a_38">section 4A(4)</a>

read with Rule 28 of M.C.R., 1960. These rules have been framed under the Act of

1957. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has also referred to the provisions

relating to determination of lease as contained in Rule 27 of M.C.R., 1960. It is

contended that Rules 28 and 28A of M.C.R., 1960 provides for lapsing of the

leases in the event when the State Government has passed a specific order to that

effect, as held by the Apex Court in its judgment in the case of Common Cause

(Supra). Based upon the aforesaid submissions and provisions, it is contended that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                             10</span>


the State Government has neither terminated or prematurely terminated the lease,

nor determined it, nor declared the lease as lapsed. Denial of extension as

contemplated in the impugned order, is completely unconnected to the scheme of

M.M.D.R. Act and the Rules framed thereunder and is beyond the competence of

the State. Therefore, the order of the State Government dated 01.04.2016

purportedly passed in exercise of powers under section 8A(6) of the M.M.D.R.

Act, is wholly without jurisdiction and nullity in the eyes of law.

</p><p id="p_15">14.    Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner submits that the amended

provisions under <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_39">section 8A(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_40">8A(6)</a> should be interpreted through the tools

of statutory interpretation i.e. (i) literal interpretation, (ii) purposive interpretation,

</p><p id="p_16">(iii) Heydon's rule i.e. mischief rule. It is submitted that if the language of

amended provisions does not lead to any absurd construction, then golden rule of

literal construction should apply. From the reading of the sub-rule, it is clear that

there is no power conferred upon the State Government to deny extension. For the

purposes of the purposive construction of the provisions, the object and aims of

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_41">Amendment Act</a>, 2015 have to be examined. Reliance is placed on a recent

judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case of Shailesh Dhairyawan versus

Mohan Balkrishna Lulla [(2016) 3 SCC 619]. Relying upon the judgment

rendered by the Apex Court in the case of Common Cause (Supra), it is

submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court had deeply examined the aims and

object of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_42">Amendment Act</a>, 2015 and came to a definite conclusion that the

amendment proposed to put in place a mechanism for (i) eliminating discretion,

</p><p id="p_17">(ii) improving transparency in the allocation of mineral resources, (iii) Simplifying

procedures, (iv) eliminating delay in administration so as to enable expeditious

and optimum development of the mineral resources of the country. The salient

features of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_43">Amendment Act</a>, 2015, as quoted in the judgment of Common

Cause (Supra), also shows that there is no provision of renewal of lease, as tenure

of mining lease has been increased from existing 30 years to 50 years, thereby

removing the element of discretion. The object is to provide impetus to the mining
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                          11</span>


sector which has been aggrieved due to second and subsequent renewal remaining

pending. It is further submitted that in matters of interpretation of such Acts,

mischief rule or Heidon's rule is often applied. The reason for amendment to the

M.M.D.R. Act, is aimed at remedying a situation which existed prior to it. It was

directed at remedying the grievances of the mining industry due to second and

subsequent renewal pending and also because provisions of law relating to rules

have been found to be wanting. The impugned action of the Respondent State are

therefore substantively ultra vires as it has got no power or jurisdiction to refuse

extension under the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_44">Amendment Act</a>, 2015. Reliance has been placed upon para-

32(iv) &amp; (vi) of the judgment of the Apex Court in Common Cause (Supra).

</p><p id="p_18">15.    Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner submits that the understanding of

the State Government on the 'subject to' clause in the amended section 8A(6) of

M.M.D.R. Act, is wholly misconceived." The language of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_45">section 8A(6)</a> clearly

speaks of deeming fiction i.e. 'shall be extended and shall be deemed to be

extended'. Therefore, no affirmative action is required on the part of the State

Government. It is further equally imperative to read under the amended provisions

that the extension shall be coupled with the conditions of the lease which any

lessee is bound to comply. However, when there is no power conferred under the

amended Act for rejection of the extension, resort to the provisions on the 'subject

to' clause for refusing extension on the part of the State Government' suffers from

substantive ultra vires and cannot be upheld in the eyes of law.

</p><p id="p_19">16.    Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has also questioned the impugned

action on the grounds of procedural ultra vires and infirmity. It is submitted that

High Power Committee constituted by the State Government is in teeth of the

provisions of section 26(2) of the M.M.D.R. Act, which has not been notified in

the Extraordinary Gazette. Even otherwise, there is no role of High Power

Committee envisaged under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_46">section 8A(6)</a> of the Amendment Act, 2015. It is

submitted that on perusal of the Report of the High Power Committee at

Annexure-19, there are no specific case of violations pointed out in respect of any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                          12</span>


lessee. However, impugned order has been passed relying upon the report of the

High Power Committee by the Joint Secretary, Mines and Geology Department,

Government of Jharkhand without giving any opportunity of hearing by the

authority passing the impugned order. A mere perusal of the impugned order

would show that it suffers from complete non-application of mind to the

petitioner's show-cause dated 29.06.2015 and 31.07.2015 (Annexures-16&amp;17 to

the writ petition). The impugned order only refers to the allegations of charges and

does not contain any finding after due application of mind to the reply of the

petitioner to the alleged charges / violations. It straightaway proceeds to hold that

the Committee has found repeated violations committed by the lessee and that it

has not complied with the terms and conditions of the lease. Thereafter, it holds

that the State Government is fully satisfied that the lease in question is not a fit

case for extension under section 8A(6) of the M.M.D.R. Act, 1957, as amended

vide <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_47">Amendment Act</a> of 2015. Therefore, extension of lease in question is rejected.

</p><p id="p_20">17.    It is further submitted that the order not only suffers from procedural

irregularity, but is violative of doctrine of proportionality as well. The industry

employs about 2000 people directly or indirectly and is paying substantial amount

to the tune of several hundred crores to the State Government. Reliance has been

also placed upon the press report issued by the Ministry of Mines, Government of

India after the Ordinance to the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_48">Amendment Act</a>, 2015 was promulgated to submit

that it conveyed the intention to revive the mining industry which was suffering

due to renewal applications pending for longer period of time at the level of the

State Government. In the instant case, for about 14 years since it was made on

09.07.2001 well within the 12 months before expiry of the lease period.

Submissions of the Counsel for the Respondent State:
</p>
<p id="p_21">18.    Learned A.A.G. Mr. Ajit Kumar, appearing for the State has defended the

impugned action of the State Government inter-alia on the following grounds.

</p><p id="p_22">       It is stated that the petitioner's firm was given mining lease of Iron Ore and

Manganese by way of registered lease agreement on 10.07.1972 for 30 years.

Petitioner's firm applied for first renewal on 09.07.2001 over 233.99 hectares area.

Out of this 233.99 hectares of land, forest clearance was available on 24.856

hectares only comprising 12.564 hectares for mining of mineral, 7.140 hectares for

over burden dump, 0.24 hectares for mineral storage and 4.912 hectares for roads.

It is further stated that MoEF gave environmental clearance on 23.01.2007

(Annexure-9 to the writ petition) for 1 lakh tonne raising it from 60,000 tonnes

with conditions that (i) tree density should be 2000 plants per hectare (ii) digital

processing of the entire lease area required and (iii) CTO to be taken before

starting production from State Pollution Control Board. Petitioner has failed to

comply the above conditions. Petitioner violated these conditions since 2007 and

for the first time, has taken CTO on 24.07.2010 (Annexure-A to the counter

affidavit). It is further stated that thereafter the petitioner again obtained CTO for

the period 01.10.2012 to 30.09.2014 vide letter no. 6211 dated 29.11.2012 of

SPCB and letter no. 5119 dated 31.12.2013 for the period 01.10.2013 to

30.09.2014. It is crystal clear from the above CTO that the lessee was not having

CTO from 01.10.2010 to 30.09.2012 (Annexure-A/2 &amp; A/3 to the counter

affidavit). It is further stated that the findings of Justice M.B. Shah Commission

shows that CTO was to be taken immediately after 23.01.2007 for starting

production in which the lessee failed and continued its mining and production

violating the statutory conditions as made in the MoEF letter for grant of

environmental clearance (Annexure-B to counter affidavit).

</p><p id="p_23">19.    It is further stated that Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) vide letter dated

23.05.2012 once again approved the scheme of mining and modified it on

23.05.2012 with conditions laid down in clause-7 and clause-9, though this

scheme and approval, in any way, cannot be taken as the approval of the

Government. It is further stated that environmental clearance was revised by

MoEF on 19.07.2013 (Annexure-10 to the writ petition) wherein it has been stated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                          14</span>


that there was a proposal to surrender 43.769 hectares of forest land which has

been taken over by the Forest Department vide letter no. 1211 dated 14.06.2005.

The mining lease for the reduced area is not yet renewed and therefore the mining

scheme has been prepared for the total mine lease area. TORs for this project was

prescribed on 22.06.2010. It is also mentioned in the environmental clearance

issued by MoEF dated 23.02.2007 that the life of the mines is 105 years but in the

environmental clearance given on 19.07.2013, it is stated that life of mines is 30

years.
</p>
<p id="p_24">20. It is further stated that pursuant to the report of Justice M.B. Shah Commission

which was submitted on 14.10.2013, petitioner was issued show-cause notices on

27.09.2014, 14.10.2014, 28.10.2014 along with opportunity of personal hearing

(Annexure-C series to the counter affidavit). It is further stated that the State

Government issued a Circular dated 09.03.2015 to all the authorities / respondents

for proper recommendation about eligibility of extension of time period for the

lease holders in the light of the amendment (Annexure-F to the counter affidavit).

Thereafter, the Deputy Commissioner, West Singhbhum vide letter dated

06.04.2015 sent a report of 22 lessees recommending not to extend the term of

lease period as they have violated certain terms and conditions, wherein name of

the petitioner is at serial no. 13(Annexure-G to the counter affidavit). Thereafter,

Department of Cabinet Secretariat and Co-ordination issued a letter dated

05.02.2016 forming a high power seven member committee which was published

in the Jharkhand Gazette. (Annexure-H to the counter affidavit). It is further stated

that the Department of Mines vide letter dated 09.07.2015 instructed the

committee to inspect all the mines and submit a report of compliance of all the

terms and conditions of the lease in reference to section 8A(5) and 8A(6) of the

M.M.D.R. (Amendment) Act, 2015 in a prescribed format (Annexure-J to the

counter affidavit). The Technical Sub Committee inspected all the leases in

question and submitted its report in prescribed format including that of the

petitioner (Annexure-K to the counter affidavit). Thereafter, the Department of

Mines and Geology summarized all the violations mentioned against the petitioner

by different agencies and issued show-cause notice to the petitioner on

31.07.2015, to which the petitioner submitted its reply on 20.08.2015 with a

prayer for extension of lease period under the amended M.M.D.R. Act. After

hearing the petitioner, the Committee submitted its report to the Government

(Annexure-L to the counter affidavit) wherein petitioner has been found to have

violated certain terms and conditions and did not find them eligible for extension

of time period. The Mines Department sought opinion regarding the same from the

law department (Annexure-H to the counter affidavit).
</p>
<p id="p_25">21.    It is further stated that the learned Advocate General recommended that the

administrative department can take appropriate actions if all the terms and

conditions is not satisfied. In the case of the petitioner, it was not a fit case for

extension as all the terms and conditions were not satisfied. Therefore, petitioner's

applications dated 29.06.2015 and 20.08.2015 were rejected. Thereafter, the

Deputy Commissioner, Chaibasa issued a letter dated 05.04.2016 to the petitioner

to surrender the possession of the land in favour of State Government (Annexure-

N to the counter affidavit). When the petitioner did not surrender, possession was

taken by public beat of the drum on 07.04.2016 by Assistant Mining Officer. It is

further stated that the petitioner vide letter dated 06.04.2016 sought permission

from the Government seeking six months time for removing properties from the

lease hold area (Annexure-P to the counter affidavit). However, subsequent to the

passing of the impugned order dated 01.04.2016, the State Government has taken

possession of the mining lease hold area on 08.04.2016 and the same has already

been published in Jharkhand Gazette vide Notification dated 20.04.2016

(Annexure-O to the counter affidavit). It is further stated that the power to grant

extension would also include the power to reject as well going by the General

Clause Act, 1897. The State Government is the owner of the mineral under its

territory and all grants and rejection of mineral concession is in the sole domain of

the State. It is further stated that the original lease area of the petitioner is 233.99
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                          16</span>


hectares. In their renewal application, though they have retained an area of the

desired lease up to 233.99 hectares, however they have stated that they have

surrendered 43.769 hectares area to the forest authority and the area of 190.221

hectares shall be retained by them. They have not produced the land schedule and

map of surrendered area to the Mines Department (Annexure-R to the counter

affidavit). It is further stated that the latest modified mining plan and progressive

mines closure plan were approved on 08.12.2015 i.e. after the amendment Act

came into existence. It also contains a progressive mines closure plan for about

43.73 hectares of non-mineralized zone. This is contrary to the provisions of rule

22(5) of M.C.R., 1960. The land schedule of the surrendered lease area is also not

well documented and not submitted in District Mining Office, Chaibasa. It is

further stated that when the petitioner exceeded the production limit and the

production and dispatch was done without any lawful authority, a demand of Rs.

1243.94 crores was raised on 02.05.2015 and has been outstanding against the

petitioner (Annexure-S to the counter affidavit). The Jharkhand State Pollution

Control Board has also filed a complaint case before the Court of Chief Judicial

Magistrate, Chaibasa vide letter no. 1748 dated 19.06.2012 (Annexure-T to the

counter affidavit).
</p>
<p id="p_26">22.    It is further stated that despite the law concerning the rights of forest

dwelling communities, the petitioner could obtain a certificate only on 11.09.2014

and that too for 118.636 hectares of forest land. It is also stated that several other

lessees whom State has refused to extend the lease, have already approached the

Mines Tribunal (Annexure-V to the counter affidavit). Petitioner is supposed to

maintain and keep boundary marks in good order to secure and keep good

condition and to maintain plan, etc. which the petitioner could not satisfy to the

District Administration. The DGMS is also not satisfied with the functioning of the

petitioner. Justice M.B. Shah Commission has also made certain observation as

noted above.

</p><p id="p_28">23.    It is further stated that under the provisions of Section 26(2) of the

M.M.D.R. Act, the State Government can exercise its power on its own or through

its office subordinate or authority, as may be specified in the notification. Thus, the

constitution of the High Power Committee by the department vide Notification no.

1044 dated 21.05.2015 is justified (Annexure-S.A.-1 to the supplementary counter

affidavit). It is further stated that petitioner filed his renewal application on

09.07.2001 which should have been supported by approved mines plan in which

the petitioner failed. The petitioner did not have any duly approved mining plan

between the period 09.07.2002 to 08.12.2005. It is further stated that the

environmental limit is for the dispatches made from the lease hold area and does

not differentiate the limit for production from the mines and dispatch. The

beneficiation and processing including production of ROM from the mines is to be

within the sanctioned limit of Environmental Clearance in which the petitioner has

failed. Thus, his reply dated 20.08.2015 was not accepted. The same issue came

before the IBM and show-cause notice was issued to the petitioner on 18.11.2011

(Annexure-S.A.-4 to the supplementary counter affidavit).

extension of the lease period under section 8A of the M.M.D.R. Act is available

subject to a further overriding condition, namely "that all the terms and conditions

of the lease have been complied with". A leaseholder who does not satisfy any of

the required conditions of the lease, as for instance, the postulated clearances /

approvals / consent would not be entitled to the benefits extended under sub-

section (5) or (6) of Section 8A of the Amended M.M.D.R. Act.

that the State Government being the lessor is obliged in law to see whether all the

has to be clearly understood in the context of the different provisions of the

cannot claim an automatic extension of the lease period. The following judgments

[Chandavarkar Sita Ratna Rao Versus Ashalata S. Guram (1986) 4 SCC 447,

SCC 463 para-22].
</p>
<p id="p_34">27.    Learned counsel for the State has also dealt with the difference in the legal

connotation of the expression 'renewal' and 'extension'. Reliance has been placed

upon the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case of Provesh Chandra

Dalui and another versus Biswanath Banerjee and another [(1989) Supp. 1

SCC 487 para-10 and 11] as also in the case of State of U.P. and others versus

Lalji Tandon (Dead) through LRs. [(2004) 1 SCC 1]. It is submitted that though,

the term 'extension' may not require execution of a fresh lease, in case of a

renewal, the option is to be exercised by the lessee to be decided by the lessor by

exercise of its discretion in a rationale and objective manner as per the law

prevailing at the time. However, the concept of deemed extension referred to in

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_61">section 8A(5)</a> and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_62">8A(6)</a> of the Amendment Act, 2015 cannot mean automatic

extension as they are subject to compliance of the terms and conditions of the

lease. The State Government therefore being the lessor, is fully entitled to examine

the compliances made before any such benefit of extension is given to a lessee

under the said provision. Reliance has been placed on the judgment rendered by

the Apex Court in the case of Kanai Lal Sur versus Paramnidhi Sadhukhan

[AIR 1957 SC 907 para-6 thereof] that the words used in the material provisions

of the statute must be interpreted in their plain grammatical meaning and it is only

when such words are capable of two constructions that the question of giving

effect to the policy or object of the Act can legitimately arise. When the material

words are capable of two constructions, one of which is likely to defeat or impair

the policy of the Act, whilst the other construction is likely to assist the

achievement of the said policy, then the Courts would prefer to adopt the latter

construction. It is only in such cases that it becomes relevant to consider the

mischief and defect which the Act purports to remedy and correct. The Legislature

could not have envisaged such a situation also to give uncontrolled benefit of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                           20</span>


extension to such lessee who have violated the statutory requirements or have

failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the lease.
</p>
<p id="p_35">28.    Learned A.A.G for the State has produced the guidelines / instruction

relating to grant of extension by the State of Chhatisgarh under the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_63">Amendment

Act</a>, 2015. He has placed the contents of letter dated 19.05.2015 of the Mineral

Resources Department, Government of Chhatisgarh addressed to all the Collectors

of various districts of Chhatisgarh and the form of amendment agreement for

extension of the mining lease to be entered into between the State Government and

such lessee. It also prescribes a check list containing certain particulars relating to

the lease in question as also conditions relating to the compliances to be

undertaken under the M.C.R. And M.C.D.R. which are to be examined at the time

of execution of the Agreement for extension of period of mining lease.

</p><p id="p_36">29.    It would also be not out of place to mention that the documents relating to

extension of mining leases under the amended provisions of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_64">Section 8A</a> by the

Government of Rajasthan, have been produced by the counsel for the petitioner in

the connected case WPC No. 2207/2016 which is dated 10.02.2015. The contents

of the guidelines / letters of the State Government of Chhatisgarh and Rajasthan

shall be referred to in the later paragraphs of this judgment. Learned counsel for

the State has also responded to the contention of the counsel for the petitioner

relying upon the interim order passed in the case of Thakur Prasad Sao versus

Union of India through Ministry of Mines &amp; others in WPC No. 2722/2015

and analogous cases on 29.04.2016. It is submitted on his part that though such

an interim order has not been challenged by the State Government in any forum or

before the learned Division Bench of this Court, but the order being interim in

nature and the lessee having been granted six months time to obtain statutory

clearances / ensure compliances, the legal issue is still open to be addressed at the

appropriate time when such matter is finally decided. Petitioner therefore cannot

claim any benefit of the interim orders passed in the said case.

</p><p id="p_37">30.    A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of Union of India through

Ministry of Mines, Government of India as well. Learned ASGI has taken

preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petition on the availability

of the revisional remedy before the Central Government Mining Tribunal under

section 30 of M.M.D.R. Act. He submits that issues relating to the compliances on

the part of the lessee of the statutory clearances and terms and conditions of leases

are questions of fact which can be looked into by the statutory forum where other

aggrieved lessees also have gone in revision against such orders passed by the

State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_38">31.    The Union of India in its affidavit has taken the stand that the lessee cannot

claim automatic extension of the lease under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_65">section 8A(5)</a> and

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_66">8A(6)</a> of the Amendment Act, 2015. He relies upon the 'subject to' clauses under

the aforesaid provisions also in order to support the submissions. He has also

relied upon the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case of K.R.C.S.

Balakrishna Chetty (Supra) referred to earlier also by the counsel for the State.

Reliance has been also placed upon a judgment in the case of The South India

Corporation (P) versus The Secretary, Board of Revenue, Trivandrum &amp;

Another [1964 SCR 280]. It is submitted that the State Government is empowered

to examine whether the terms and conditions of the lease have been complied with

by any such lessee before the extension under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_67">Section 8A(5)</a> or

8A(6) is granted. He has however also taken the Court to the objects and reasons

behind the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_68">Amendment Act</a>, 2015. He submits that the Central Government in

order to resolve the plight of the mining industry and pendency of the renewal

application before the State Government for longer periods, has enacted the

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_69">Amendment Act</a>., but the benefit of extension / deemed extension cannot be

construed to operate automatically without lessee conforming to the terms and

conditions of the lease and also obtaining the necessary postulated clearances. He

has referred to the various paragraphs of the judgment rendered by the Apex Court

in    the   case   of   Common       Cause     (Supra)    including    paragraph-27
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                          22</span>


where it has been observed that such benefit of extension can only be available to

a lessee who has been able to obtain statutory clearances and complied with the

terms and conditions of the lease. Learned ASGI when posed with the question

relating to the application of the amended provisions by different State

Government, has not brought to notice any specific direction or orders / guidelines

issued by the Central Government under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_70">section 24</a> of the Amendment Act, 2015

in the matter of giving effect to the amended provisions of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_71">section 8A(5)</a> or 8A(6)

of the M.M.D.R. Act. He has also relied upon the judgment rendered by the Apex

Court in the case of Union of India and others versus Brigadier P.S. Gill

[(2012) 4 SCC 463].

13.04.2011 by the Ministry of Environmental and Forest vide Annexure-9 whereas

the Department has granted temporary working permission on 06.02.2004

(Annexure-10); forest clearance has been granted on 03.08.2009 (Annexure-10/1);

petitioner has also obtained certification of competent authority under the

mining plan and mining scheme on 16.04.2010 (Annexure-7). Petitioner has

applied for mining plan and scheme on 21.08.2015 (Annexure-8/1). Learned

counsel for the petitioner has sought to controvert the allegations contained in the

order of rejection dated 01.04.2016 relating to alleged violation of terms and

conditions of lease and non-compliance of provisions of lease deed. In respect of

allegation relating to delay in obtaining clearances such as, forest clearance,

environmental clearance, mining plan, it has been stated that these clearances were

obtained and only thereafter, mining activity was resumed from 02.04.2013 and no

mining was carried out till clearances were obtained.

<p id="p_43">35.    It is contended that grounds and assertions made in his reply to the notice

Ministry of Mines Letter No. F. No. 10/75/2008-MV issued under Rule 27(3) of

M.C.R., 1960, is not warranted against the petitioner since the State has not

executed a fresh lease deed for continuation of exploration, as per Central

Government letter dated 23.12.2010, rather exploration was done and data was

provided to I.B.M, description of which are contained at page-262-274 and 303-

304 of the writ petition. The allegation relating to violation of Rule 28/28A of

M.C.R., 1960 has been also replied by relying upon the judgment rendered by the

Apex Court in the case of Common Cause (Supra) dated 04.04.2016, stating that

no proceeding under Rule 28 and 28A of M.C.R., 1960 was ever initiated and the

lease was never declared to have lapsed prior to 01.04.2016. In respect of violation

alleged in terms of clause 2, 3, 11C of Form-K (Lease Deed), it has been stated

that the petitioner has complied the same. The Inspection Report of Task Force

Team dated 14.02.2014 has been referred to which shows compliance of these

violations. (page 307 of the writ petition). So far as observations of Justice M.B.

Shah Commission alleged in the impugned order is concerned, petitioner has

contended that there was no delay in obtaining environmental clearances as he had

applied well within time on 12.12.2006. Petitioner has not undertaken mining

outside the lease area as alleged, which is also confirmed by the DGMS Report.

The Inspection Report dated 14.02.2014 at page 307 states that no illegal mining

operation was observed in the lease area. So far as difference in monthly return

figure of lessee in IBM and DGMS is concerned, it is stated that there are no

difference in calculation as the figures of IBM do not pertain to the same period.

Petitioner contends that royalty has been paid on the higher quantity of extracted

ore.

He has adopted the legal submission made by Learned Senior Counsel Mr.

Amarendra Sharan in WPC No. 2027/20. However, in addition thereto, learned

counsel for the petitioner has made the following submissions:

</p><p id="p_48">       It is submitted that in the backdrop of the judgment rendered by the Apex

Court on the scope of <a href="/doc/737017/" id="a_82">Section 8(3)</a> of un-amended M.M.D.R. Act, in the case of

Goa Foundation versus Union of India [(2014) 6 SCC 590 dated 21.04.2014

that an 'Express Order' is mandatory for leases awaiting second and subsequent

renewal under <a href="/doc/737017/" id="a_83">section 8(3)</a>, that the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_84">(Amendment) Act</a>, 2015 was enacted which is

a significant transition in the regime of allocation of mineral resources. Allocation

of mineral resources is now to be held only through auction by competitive

bidding. Section 8A (Amended) applies to minerals other than those specified in

Part-A and Part-B of the First Schedule (Part-A: Hydrocarbons / Energy minerals,

Part-B: Atomic Minerals). The period of mining lease has been increased to 50

years. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_85">Section 8A(3)</a> has been inserted for extending the period of lease granted

prior to commencement of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_86">Amendment Act</a> for period of 50 years. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_87">Section

8A(5)</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_88">8A(6)</a> have been inserted for effecting transition in respect of mining

purposes. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_90">Section 9B</a> and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_91">9C</a> deal with the creation of District Mineral Foundation

by the State Government and establishment of National Mineral Exploration Trust

by the Central Government. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_92">Section 10A</a> of Amendment Act provides for

"Procedure for obtaining Prospective Licences for Mining Leases in respect of the

land in which minerals vest in the Government" for dealing with applications

which are yet to fructify into a mining lease.

<p id="p_49">38.    Under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_93">section 8A</a> of the Amendment Act, 2015, though process of renewal

renewal applicant whose application for renewal validly made before 12.01.2015

was pending.
</p>
<p id="p_50">39.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has also elucidated on the objects and

reasons of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_94">Amendment Act</a>, 2015 and sought to rely upon the documents

obtained under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_95">R.T.I. Act</a>, 2005 in the nature of note to the Cabinet dated

04.01.2015. According to the petitioner, amendment was necessitated in view of a

virtual halt in the matter of disposal of renewal application due to inordinate delay

by the State Government which had led to closure of several mines. Therefore, an

urgent corrective measure was felt necessary to revive the mining sector in the

country. Domestic production of Iron ore had fallen from 218 million tonnes in

2009-10 to 152 million tonnes in 2013-14. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_96">Section 8A</a> was inserted as the State

Government had no facility or potential to comply with the order. The regime of

grant of mining leases and their renewals therefore needed a change by

introducing uniformity in the process. The objects and reasons of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_97">Amendment

Act</a>, 2015 relate to the past litigation resulting in different interpretation of the

provisions of the M.M.D.R. Act and the alleged hardship caused to the mining

sector due to second and subsequent renewal pending with the State Government

without any decision. The amendment therefore sought to remedy the grievances

of the mining industry and is a beneficial piece of Legislation.

</p><p id="p_51">40.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has profusely relied upon Para-32(iv) (v)

&amp; (vi) of the judgment rendered in the case of Common Cause (Supra). The

provisions under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_98">section 8A(3)</a> / (5) / (6) of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_99">Amendment Act</a> have been placed

with emphasis in support of the submission that it is a transitory provision for

smooth transition between change in two regimes. It is submitted that the

transitory provisions are to be construed to effect such continuity, as envisaged by

the provision and not so as to create a lacuna. In support thereof, reliance has been

placed on the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case of KS.

Paripoornan Versus State of Kerala &amp; others [(1994) 5 SCC 593, page-637]

where the opinion of the learned Author Francis Bennion on statutory
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                          27</span>


interpretation has been quoted. Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that from

the insight into the judgment rendered in the case of Goa Foundation (Supra),

Parliamentary intent evident from the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_100">Amendment Act</a> would show that the focus

and emphasis is on regulating the mining operations and not prohibit / ban it, so as

to ensure continuity in operation without hiatus. Learned counsel has also placed a

communication addressed by the Central Government to the State Governments on

05.02.2015 (Annexure-B to the counter affidavit) after coming into force of Mines

and Minerals (Amendment) Ordinance, 2015 with effect from 12.01.2015

whereunder the State Governments were directed to implement the provisions of

the Ordinance in right way and take action to implement the transitory provisions

of the Ordinance.
</p>
<p id="p_52">41.   It is submitted that the petitioner's case could be covered solely under the

provisions of Section 8A(3) of the M.M.D.R. Act as it is a case of first renewal

and grant of lease to the petitioner shall be deemed to have been granted for 50

years from the date of grant. This Sub-section does not provide any further

requirement. Section 8A(6) of the M.M.D.R. Act, on the other hand, extends the

period of mining lease for the applicable period mentioned therein. The impugned

action of the State Government to deny the benefit of grant of 50 years or

automatic statutory extension under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_101">section 8A(6)</a>, is therefore illegal.

</p><p id="p_53">42.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has sought to convey the distinction

between the legal connotation 'extension' and 'renewal'. In this connection, he has

relied upon the judgments in the case of Provash Chandra Dalui and another

versus Biswanath Banerjee and another [1989 Supp (1) SCC 487, para-14

thereof], State of U.P. and others versus Lalji Tandon (Dead) through LRs.

[(2004) 1 SCC 1], Gajraj Singh and others versus State Transport Appellate

Tribunal and others [(1997) 1 SCC 650] and State of West Bengal and others

versus Calcutta Mineral Supply Company Private Limited and another

[(2015) 8 SCC 655]. He has referred to the other provisions of M.M.D.R. Act, un-

amended as well as amendments introduced in the year 2015. The submission
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                           28</span>


is that the Parliament whenever considered it necessary has given a definite role,

power and jurisdiction to the State Government such as in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_102">section 4A</a>, <a href="/doc/919618/" id="a_103">10</a>, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_104">10-A(2)</a>

</p><p id="p_54">(b). Under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_105">section 10-A</a>, all applications received prior to date of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_106">Amendment Act</a>,

2015 have been rendered ineligible, but without prejudice to sub-section (1); under

sub-section (2), Parliament has laid down that such application shall remain

eligible on and from the date of commencement of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_107">Amendment Act</a>, 2015

where reconnaissance permit or prospecting licence has been granted in respect of

any land for any mineral. However, such right for obtaining prospecting licence

followed by a mining lease in respect of that mineral, could only be considered if

the State Government is satisfied that the permit holder or the licencee has

fulfilled the conditions enumerated at clause (i) to (iv). It is submitted that silence

on the jurisdiction of the State Government under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_108">section 8A</a>, is therefore

eloquent. Parliament in its wisdom has, while changing the regime of renewals,

removed the jurisdiction of the State Government, so far as the power to grant

extension or its rejection are concerned. In support of his submission, learned

counsel has relied upon the judgment in the case of Sandur Manganese And Iron

Ores Limited versus State of Karnataka and others [(2010) 13 SCC 1].

</p><p id="p_55">43.    Referring to the provisions under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_109">section 8A(5)</a> / <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_110">8A(6)</a> specifically 'subject

to' clause, it is submitted that it does not make reference to violation, rather the

term used is 'compliance'. In the scheme of M.M.D.R. Act and M.C.R., failure to

remedy the breach alleged within the time stipulated, will amount to non-

compliance of the lease condition. No notice requiring the petitioner to remedy

any breach, has ever been issued. Consequences of violation of other legal

provisions has to be dealt under the concerned statute such a <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_111">Forest Conservation

Act</a>, 1980, <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_112">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986, etc. It is submitted that para-27 of

the Common Cause (Supra) judgment has to be understood in the context of the

facts stated at para-1 to 4 of the said judgment. It cannot be lost sight of that the

judgment dated 04.04.2016 in Common Cause (Supra), came to be passed on

various applications made by mining lessee seeking revocation of the suspension

of the earlier order dated 16.05.2014 passed in the same writ petition. The State

Government is merely a delegatee of the Parliament and acts within the confines

of the Act and Rules. It does not exercise any inherent power. Learned counsel for

the petitioner also submits that such a power cannot be read into the provisions of

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_113">Section 8A(5)</a> or 8A(6) as it would be wholly uncanalized without any guidelines

laid thereunder. Even a flimsy ground of breach of any terms and conditions of the

lease, would be made a basis for denial of extension on the part of the State

Government. This would amount to deny the whole aim and purpose of the

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_114">Amendment Act</a> itself. Learned counsel for the petitioner has also referred to a

situation where the period of renewal of lease extends beyond 12.01.2015, i.e. the

cut-off date, in that case also the State Government would have the authority to

look into the compliances of terms and conditions of the lease and deny the benefit

of deemed extension up to the farthest period as guaranteed under the said

provisions. The interpretation of any such provision therefore has to be on well

settled cannons of interpretation which uniformly apply to all situations.

</p><p id="p_56">44.    Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that if the view of the State

Government is accepted, it would amount to forfeiture of the lease of the petitioner

in teeth of the deeming provision under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_115">section 8A</a> without following the

procedure prescribed by law i.e. under Rule 27(5) of M.C.R. He submits that the

State Government like the Central Government being a delegate of the Parliament,

is not denuded of its statutory powers available under the M.M.D.R. Act and

M.C.R., 1960 or M.C.R.D., 1988 which are to be exercised in accordance with law

and as per the procedure prescribed. In case of any breach of terms and conditions

of the lease or failure to comply it, the State Government in exercise of powers

under section 27(5) of the M.C.R. is obliged to issue notices giving a period of 60

days for remedying the breach and only on failure thereof, can proceed to

determine the lease. Apart from that, M.C.D.R. provides that all mining operations

are to be done as per the mining plan sanctioned by the IBM which is authorized

to regularly oversee the work of the mines as per the mining plan. Similarly,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                          30</span>


various authorities under the Environmental Protection Act, 1986, State Pollution

Control Board under the provisions of Air and Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_116">Control of

Pollution) Act</a> are empowered not only to issue the statutory form and certificates

of compliances of conditions by the lessee, but also to take decision in respect of

any violations thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_57">45.    The impugned order however does not contain any findings as to any such

action taken by either Indian Bureau of Mines or various other authorities under

the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_117">Forest Conservation Act</a>, <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_118">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986 or by State

Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_58">46.    It is submitted that the provisions of such Acts have to be made workable.

At the same time, no one can be allowed to take the benefit of deemed extension

without obtaining the statutory clearances / compliances and also complying with

the terms and conditions of the lease. The State Government being the lessor, on

failure of a lessee to satisfy the postulated clearances / compliances and the terms

and conditions of the lease, may direct stoppage of the mining operations, while

granting reasonable time for obtaining the statutory clearances and comply with

the terms and conditions of the lease. On failure to do so, it is always open for the

State Government to take action for determination of the lease in terms of Rule

27(5) of M.C.R., 1960. However, the State Government instead of resorting to the

powers conferred under the M.M.D.R Act and Rules for taking the contemplated

action permitted thereunder, cannot resort to rejection of renewal application in the

manner it has been done to deny extension to such lessee in teeth of the provisions

of Section 8A(5) and 8A(6) of the M.M.D.R. Act by relying upon the 'subject to'

clause contained therein. Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that

except for two mining lessees whose leases have been extended till 12.01.2015,

applications for renewal of mining leases have been rejected in the case of other

22 Iron ore lessees similarly in an arbitrary and illegal manner. Learned counsel

for the petitioner has referred to different approaches adopted by different State

Governments such as that of State of Chhatisgarh and Rajasthan. It is submitted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                         31</span>


that in the State of Rajasthan, leases have been extended in terms of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_119">section 8A</a> (5)

and 8A (6) of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_120">Amendment Act</a> without any such resort to refusal of renewal

application under the 'subject to' clause. One such letter dated 10.02.2015 of the

Joint Secretary, Mines Department, Government of Rajasthan to the Director,

Mines and Geology Department Udaipur, Rajasthan have been placed which also

encloses a Form-A containing the recital of extension of leases. Learned counsel in

support of his submissions on different proposition of law, relied on the following

Rebuttal of the State Government:
</p>
<p id="p_60">47.    The grant of original lease to Sardar Fauja Singh; its transfer to the

petitioner and surrender of 3.331 hectares by him, has not been disputed by the

State. It is however stated that petitioner never submitted any modified mining

plan for the rest of the area i.e. 19.331 hectares and continued mining on the basis

of previously approved mining plan which is violative of the rules. It is further

stated that petitioner's firm applied for first renewal on 18.04.2001 over 19.331

hectares (Annexure-4). Out of 19.331 hectares of the forest land, temporary

working permission was granted for nine months by the Ministry of Environment

and Forest (MoEF) for mining in 8.242 hectares of broken up area vide letter dated

06.02.2004. Subsequently, only in the year 2009, forest clearance was granted to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                          32</span>


the petitioner vide letter dated 03.08.2009 but the petitioner continued its mining

operation in violation of <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_121">Forest Conservation Act</a>, 1980 and the conditions

imposed by the MoEF.
</p>
<p id="p_61">48.    It is further stated that as per Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) letter dated

25.10.2004, forest clearance had to be obtained by the petitioner and was to be

submitted to IBM. This instruction was also not complied by the petitioner. The

Scheme of Mining and Systematic Mine Closure of land was approved by IBM on

16.04.2010 with certain conditions (Annexure-7). That MoEF gave environmental

clearance on 13.04.2011 for raising from 39000 to 74000 tonnes under specific

conditions, but the petitioner has failed to comply the conditions. In terms of

aforesaid letter dated 13.04.2011 regarding environmental clearance, Consent to

Operate (CTO) was to be taken immediately after 13.04.2011 for starting

production which the lessee failed to obtain and continued its mining and

production violating the statutory conditions as laid for the grant of environmental

clearance. The petitioner while violating the conditions for the first time, has taken

CTO on 25.03.2013 for a period 25.03.2013 to 31.12.2013, for the second time on

27.03.2014 for a period of 01.01.2014 to 31.12.2014 and third CTO on 27.02.2015

for the period 01.01.2015 to 31.12.2015 (Annexure-A series). It is further stated

that the superimposed output in the form of soft copy and hard copy should be

submitted along with the mining plan, scheme. This too has not been complied by

the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_62">49.    It is further stated that the Justice M.B. Shah Commission report on

Jharkhand submitted on 14.10.2013 shows that the petitioner continued its mining

and production violating the statutory conditions. Accordingly, Department issued

show-cause notice on 15.06.2015 and 31.07.2015 (Annexure-14).

</p><p id="p_63">50.    The sequence of events leading to the report of the Technical Sub

Committee on inspection of the leases and its report (Annexure-H) are same as

stated in connected writ petition i.e. WPC 2027/2016. The Department of Mines

and Geology thereafter summarized all the violations mentioned against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                           33</span>


petitioner by different agencies and issued show cause notice to the petitioner on

31.07.2015 (Annexure-I), to which the petitioner submitted its reply on

20.08.2015 with a prayer for extension of lease period under the amended

M.M.D.R. Act. After hearing the petitioner, the committee in its report concluded

that the petitioner has violated certain terms and conditions of the lease deed and

did not find it eligible for extension. It observed that the administrative department

can take appropriate actions if all the terms and conditions are satisfied. However,

the case of the petitioner was not fit for extension as all the terms and conditions

were not satisfied. (Annexure-J). Accordingly, application dated 29.06.2015 and

20.08.2015    filed   by   the   petitioner    were   rejected.   Thereafter,   Deputy

Commissioner, Chaibasa issued a letter dated 05.04.2016 asking the petitioner to

surrender the possession of the land in favour of the State Government.

(Annexure-K) When the petitioner did not surrender, possession was taken by

publically beating the drum on 06.04.2016 by Assistant Mining Officer.

Publication about the vacant lease hold land for further mineral concession was

published in Jharkhand Gazette vide Notification no. 257 dated 20.04.2016

(Annexure-L). Thereafter, petitioner by letter dated 06.04.2016 sought permission

from the Government seeking six months time for removing properties from the

lease hold area (Annexure-M). It is further informed that the petitioner was also

found engaged in illegal transportation of ore and theft of ore from the leasehold

area of M/s TISCO on 10.09.2003 and a case under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_122">section 379</a>/<a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_123">411</a> IPC was also

registered against him which is pending. Petitioner also preferred a Criminal

Revision No. 686/2004 before this Court for quashing of the entire criminal

proceeding against him and the same was also dismissed vide order dated

10.01.2013 (Annexure-N).
</p>
<p id="p_64">51.    It is further stated that the renewal application of the petitioner could not be

granted in the absence of papers mentioned in the letter no. 883 / M dated

01.04.2016 which is under challenge.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                         34</span><p id="p_65">


</p><p id="p_66">52.    It is stated that as per the letter of IBM bearing no. CAL/SB/FE/MP-249

dated 06.08.1993, approval was conditional. The petitioner has not informed the

same in the IBM office. Further, the petitioner surrendered 3.331 hectares area on

11.06.1997, but the modified mining plan for the rest area of 19.331 hectares was

not submitted. It is further informed that the Forest Department has recently issued

guidelines for mining in the Saranda Forest vide letter dated 13.07.2015

(Annexure-R). It is also stated that the Circular No. 2 of 2010 dated 06.04.2010 of

Indian Bureau of Mines also stipulates certain conditions which the petitioner also

violated (Annexure-T). It is further stated that the petitioner has not carried out

any mining activities between November 2004 to August 2009. Upon this, the

DMO has issued a show cause notice to the petitioner vide letter dated 10.03.2015

(Annexure-U). Therefore, it is apparent from the return filed by the petitioner that

he has violated the rule of Jharkhand Mineral Dealer's Rule, 2007 (Annexure-V).

WPC 2515/2016

Petitioner's case:- Facts:
</p>
<p id="p_67">53.    Petitioner's predecessor in-interest was granted mining lease of Iron Ore

over an area of 41.639 Hectares in village Rajabera of District West Singhbhum on

29th February, 1988 (Annexure-1) for a period of 20 years effective from 29 th

February 1988 till 28th February 2008. Lease was transferred with the permission

of the State Government in favour of the present petitioner on 2 nd March, 1997

(Annexure-2). Before expiry of the statutory period of 12 months prior to expiry of

lease, he made an application for renewal on 23rd February, 2007. The application

for renewal remained pending. In the meantime, a show-cause was issued upon the

lessee on 15th June, 2015 (Annexure-9). Petitioner replied to the show-cause notice

on 29th June, 2015 (Annexure-10). A second show-cause notice was also furnished

on 31st July, 2015 (Annexure-11) to which he submitted his reply on 19 th August,

2015. Inter Departmental Committee constituted by the State Government heard

the petitioner on 24.08.2015 and finally by the impugned order dated 1st April,

2016 bearing memo no.884/M (Annexure-13) the application for extension of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                          35</span>


lease has been rejected. Petitioner has approached this Court against the said order

of rejection. He has also questioned the constitution of Inter Departmental

Committee vide notification dated 9.6.2015 as beyond the power conferred upon

the State Government by the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_124">MMDR Act</a>, 1957 (<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_125">Section 26(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/173795193/" id="a_126">Section 28(3)</a>

MMDR Act). Petitioner has also prayed for declaration that the mining lease

granted on 29th February, 1988 should be deemed to have been granted for a period

of 50 years w.e.f. the said date in terms of <a href="/doc/1814464/" id="a_127">Section 8A(3)</a> of the Mines and

Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/542527/" id="a_128">Regulation) Amendment Act</a>, 2015. Petitioner has

also made a prayer for quashing the show-cause notice and for setting aside the

notification bearing no.257 dated 18th April, 2016 published in the official gazette

on 20th April, 2016 by which the mines of the petitioner has been notified for

auction in terms of Mineral (Auction) Rules, 2015.
</p>
<p id="p_68">54.    Learned counsel for the petitioner, at the outset, submits that mining lease

was not under operation since 2011. He further submits that the approval of the

mining plan has been issued lastly on 23rd April 2015 vide Annexure-A-5/1 with

validity up to 31st March, 2018. The application for environmental clearance

made on 22nd June, 2015 (Annexure-6) is still pending. He has made an application

for grant of consent to operate from Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board

which has remained pending for want of environmental clearance. These statutory

clearances are required to be obtained by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_69">55.    Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that out of 41.639 Hectares of

the leasehold land, only 4.672 Hectares is reported to be a Jangal-Jhari and

therefore deemed to be forest land. No mining operation has been carried out in

the said area. It is also pointed out that in the 1 st and 2nd show-cause notices, no

such ground was taken, rather the Government of Jharkhand has stated that the

leasehold area is a non-forest area. However, the petitioner, if required, would

obtain forest clearance and would not undertake to work on forest area without

obtaining the statutory clearance. It is further stated that up to date royalty

clearance certificate dated 13th April, 2014 has been issued by the District Mining
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                          36</span>


Officer and the same was submitted along with its reply. Petitioner contends that

allegation relating to violation of Ministry of Mines' letter no.F.No.10/75 /2008-

MV issued under Rule 27(3) of Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 regarding mineral

exploration was never made in the show-cause notice. However, exploration has

been done and it forms part of the mining scheme which was approved by the

Indian Bureau of Mines. Counsel for the petitioner contends that in view of the

judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1707158/" id="a_129">Common Cause vs. Union of

India</a> dated 4th April, 2016, the allegation relating to violation of Rule 28/28A of

Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 relating to lapse of mining lease are no longer

available to be taken as there is no such order or declaration by the State

Government before 12th January, 2015. In respect of the allegation relating to

violation of the terms and conditions of the lease deed, it is submitted that no dues

certificate has been submitted on 24th May, 2015. The demand of surface rent has

been quashed by this Court and the matter is pending in appeal before the Hon'ble

Supreme Court of India. Charges relating to excess mining are also subject matter

of W.P.(C) No.1524/2013. In respect of the violation relating to para-2 of Part-VII

of Form 'K', it is submitted that the Government approved surveyor namely Gem

Surveyors has been issued work order to undertake survey which has also been

concluded. Pillars, corner pillars and intermediate lease boundary pillars are

already in place and discrepancy, if any, would be rectified. So far as allegation of

violation of para-11(c) of Part-VII of Form 'K' is concerned, it is the subject matter

of W.P.(C) No.1524/2013. Petitioner has questioned the demand as being without

jurisdiction. Counsel for the petitioner has further pointed out in respect of

allegation of violation of Para-18 of Part-VII of Form 'K' that the said allegations

are unfounded. The lease is a non-captive lease and there is no restriction under

law that the ore cannot be sold to one person. Therefore, there is no violation of

any provision of the lease deed or the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960. In respect

of violations observed by Justice M.B. Shah Commission on the aforesaid lease, it

has been submitted that no mining operations have been carried out in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                             37</span>


contravention of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_130">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986. All mining operations

have been stopped since 2011 for this reason only. Environmental clearance has

already been applied for and terms of reference have already been granted. Only

thereafter, the petitioner can carry the mining operation. It is stated that the

allegations relating to difference in monthly return filed by lessee are vague. No

details have been given in respect of as to in which monthly return, there was a

difference in figures of IBM and DMG.
</p>
<p id="p_70">56.    Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the case of the petitioner

being of first renewal and his application for renewal having been made before

expiry of 12 months from the date of expiry of the lease, petitioner would be

entitled to treat his lease as having been granted for a period of 50 years in terms

of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_131">Section 8A(3)</a> of the Amendment Act, 2015 as held by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Common Cause vs. Union of India (Writ

Petition (Civil) No. 194/2014) vide judgment dated 4th April, 2016. It is further

submitted that the application for renewal of lease was not rejected before 12 th

January, 2015 i.e. the date of coming into force of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_132">Amendment Act</a>, 2015 and

no declaration of lapse of lease has been made. Therefore, petitioner is entitled to

be treated as subsisting lessee as on 12.1.2015. Learned counsel for the petitioner

further submits that in terms of the provisions of the amended Rule 24 A(6) of the

Mineral Concession Rules, petitioner's lease would be treated to be subsisting for

a period of two years from 18th July, 2014 up to 18th July, 2016 as there was no

rejection of his application for renewal.
</p>
<p id="p_71">57.    Having regard to the declaration of law rendered by the Apex Court in the

case of Common Cause (supra) and the provisions of amended Rule 24A(6), the

State Government was required to treat the mining lease of the petitioner as

subsisting till 18th July 2016, more so, when neither the mining lease was

terminated or declared as lapsed and when no rejection of its renewal application

was made prior to coming into force of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_133">Amendment (MMDR) Act</a>, 2015 on

12th January, 2015. Petitioner submits that unless and until petitioner is treated to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                          38</span>


be a subsisting lessee, the statutory clearance required to be obtained cannot be

considered and granted by the respective statutory authorities.

</p><p id="p_72">58.    So far as legal submissions are concerned, counsel for the petitioner Mr.

Indrajit Sinha has reiterated the submissions made by him in WPC No. 2207/2016.

Submission of the learned counsel for the State

</p><p id="p_73">59.    Respondents in their counter affidavit have not refuted the assertion relating

to grant of original mining leases and transfer thereafter in the name of the present

petitioner on 02.03.1997. They also do not dispute that the application for first

renewal was made on 23.02.2007 which, according to them, was pending for want

to statutory clearances. Respondent however stated that the petitioner has carried

out mining operations illegally during the pendency of the renewal application

without obtaining all the statutory clearances, chart at Annexure-N is referred to in

support thereof. It is further submitted that petitioner has continued its mining

activity without obtaining environmental clearances. The highest production

admissible to be produced till there was no enhancement under the deemed

provision was the cut-off as in the year 1991-92 being 10572 tonnes for the

petitioner. There has been excess production till 2012-13. Thereafter, a demand

letter dated 30.05.2014 for Rs. 18,87,55,120.03 including interest from 1995-95

till date, was raised against the petitioner which has not been paid till date

(Annexure-P). It is further submitted that till April 2015, demand was again raised

vide letter dated 02.05.2015 for Rs. 20,80,89,320/-        taking into account the

previous unpaid dues (Annexure-P/1). Learned counsel for the State further

submits that the Ministry of Mines circulated a letter dated 05.02.2015 requesting

all the States to take prompt action in pursuance of section 8A(5) and 8A(6)

(Annexure-A).
</p>
<p id="p_74">60.    Respondents in their counter affidavit, have referred to the same

chronology of facts relating to the findings rendered by the High Power

Committee constituted by the Department of Cabinet Secretariat and Coordination

vide letter dated 06.04.2015 (Annexure-D) and Inspection carried out by the

Technical Sub Committee in respect of the leases in question. The Report in

prescribed format including that of the petitioner is Annexed as Annexure-H to the

counter affidavit. The Department of Mines and Geology summarized the

violations mentioned against the petitioner by different agencies and issued a

show-cause notice on 31.07.2015 (Annexure-I). After consideration of the

petitioner's reply and upon hearing him, the Committee submitted its report with a

finding that the petitioner's case is not fit for extension. Accordingly, the

application dated 29.06.2015 and 19.08.2015 filed by the petitioner were rejected

by order dated 01.04.2016, impugned herein.
</p>
<p id="p_75">61.   Counsel for the Respondent State submits that pursuant to the impugned

order and upon failure of the petitioner to surrender possession of the leaseholder

land in favour of the State Government, the Assistant Mining Officer, Chaibasa

has taken possession of the leasehold area. The leasehold area has been made open

for further mineral concession vide Gazette Notification contained at Annexure-L

dated 18.04.2016 The State Government was well within its jurisdiction to

constitute a Technical Sub Committee to inspect the mines of such lease holders. It

is further submitted that the Mining Plan / Scheme of the petitioner was not

prepared for the year 2008-09 and 2009-10, but the mining operation was carried

out by the petitioner without Mining Plan in the year 2008-09 to 2009-10

(Annexure-N Chart). Petitioner has Discharge Consent Order and Emission

Consent Order for the period 01.04.2006 and 30.04.2007 only. Learned counsel

further submitted that mining operation in the leasehold area was closed during

2000-2001 to 2003-04 and from 2011 to till date without any information. It is also

submitted that the petitioner has chosen to by-pass the statutory remedy of

revision. For availing the benefit of extension of lease under the deeming

provisions under section 8A of the M.M.D.R. Act, lessee was required to comply

with the terms and conditions of the lease. State Government is entitled to

application in the face of the aforesaid facts is, therefore, proper in the eye of law

as the State Government is the owner of the mines and minerals. Learned counsel

for the State has also reiterated the legal submissions advanced in the connected

cases.
</p>
<p id="p_76">62.      Counsel for the petitioner in his rejoinder to the counter affidavit of the

Respondent State, has reiterated the opening statement and submissions, as noticed

in the foregoing paragraphs. It is submitted that the assertion made in the counter

affidavit and the show-cause notice issued earlier, have been duly replied by the

petitioner. It is submitted that the mining operations were suspended by the IBM

through letter dated 18.12.2009, however after complying the conditions, it was

revoked by letter dated 01.04.2010. It was duly intimated by the Deputy

Commissioner, Chaibasa to the Assistant Mining Officer, Chaibasa through letter

dated 26.04.2010. It is submitted that the State Government has never contested

the enclosed proforma to the letter at Annexure-16 to the rejoinder. Petitioner

contends that the alleged possession of the leasehold area by the Assistant Mining

Officer, Chaibasa on 08.04.2016, cannot be treated as a valid mode of taking

possession in the eye of law. It is stated that physical possession of mines is still

with the petitioner. In fact, it has been admitted by the State Government that the

petitioner has a right to remove its goods, machinery and excavated minerals

within six months from the date of the termination of the lease. Therefore, letter

dated 05.04.2016 for taking over possession, is bad in law.

it is subject to compliance of terms and conditions of mining leases. The

Respondent Union of India in Para-22 of their affidavit have stated that <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_136">Sections

8A(5)</a> and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_137">8A(6)</a> contains transitional provisions of extending tenure of those

extends the period of tenure of mining leases till 31.03.2020 / 31.03.2030, subject

to the condition that terms and conditions of the leases have been complied with.

According to the Respondents, Sub-<a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_139">section 3</a> cannot be read in isolation and has to

<p id="p_81">65.       I have considered the submissions of the parties in the light of the relevant

material facts pleaded, provisions of law and judgments relied upon by them. The

moot question which is required to be answered in the present batch of writ

petitions is whether the State Government has the power to refuse extension of

lease under the amended provisions of Sections 8A(5) and 8A(6) of M.M.D.R.

Act, 2015? The ancillary question which arises is, whether the impugned orders

rejecting the renewal application of the lessee / writ petitioners herein, are

vulnerable to challenge on settled principles of judicial review of administrative

action.

<p id="p_82">66.       State Government is the owner of the mines [See: Monnet Ispat and

under the M.M.D.R. Act, by virtue of declaration made under <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_141">section 2</a> thereof,

Parliament has acquired complete dominion over the Legislative field covered by

the State Legislature. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_142">The Act</a> though does not denude the State of its ownership of

respect to the grant and renewal of mining leases of the land belonging to the State

Government. [See: State of Assam and others versus Om Prakash Mehta and

others (1973) 1 SCC 584 para-12]. It is equally well true that the Executive

the matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has the power to

of Orissa versus M.A. Tulloch and Co. [(1964) 4 SCR 461] &amp; State of W.B.

original <a href="/doc/737017/" id="a_145">section 8(3)</a> introduced in 1957, Central Government was conferred the

sole power to authorize renewal of mining leases. Thereafter, for the first time,

Common Cause (Supra) in the Writ Petition No. 114/2014 vide judgment dated

04.04.2016 on the subject. It would only be contextual to take note that the instant

judgment in the case of Common Cause (Supra) was rendered by the Apex Court

on a number of applications filed by the lease holders seeking revocation of the

order of suspension from carrying any mining operation by them. [Judgment dated

16.05.2015 reported in (2014) 14 SCC 155 [Common Cause versus Union of

India and others]. By the said order, 102 mining lease holders were restrained

from carrying on mining operations on account of the fact that none of these lease

holders were in possession of statutory clearances / approval / consent required for

carrying on mining operations. The Hon'ble Court granted liberty by the same

order dated 16.05.2014 to the lease holders whose operations were suspended to

move the Apex Court after obtaining the requisite clearances / approval / consent,

whereupon, the Hon'ble Court on being satisfied, would revoke the suspension

order. During course of such consideration on the application seeking revocation

of the order of suspension, Learned Amicus Curiae Mr. A.D.N. Rao raised an issue

that the question of granting permission to the lease holders to recommence the

mining operations could arise only if the lease holders have subsisting mining

leases. It was submitted that before determining the legitimacy of the claim raised

by the applicants, the Apex court may first examine whether applicants have

subsisting right to carry on mining operations under a valid mining lease. In the

aforesaid background, the matter was argued taking into account the significant

amendments incorporated in the M.M.D.R. Act, 1957 by the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_156">Amendment Act</a>,

2015 with effect from 12.01.2015.

<p id="p_85">68.    It would also not be out of context to refer to a little bit of the background

preceding the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_157">Amendment Act</a>, 2015, which were marked by significant

pronouncements by the Apex Court in the matter of Goa Foundation versus

Union of India and others [(2014) 6 SCC 590] and Common Cause (Supra).

Goa Foundation filed a Public Interest Litigation on the basis of the findings in the

report of Justice Shah Commission on the illegal mining in the State of Goa for

issuing directions to the Union of India and State of Goa to take steps for

termination of mining leases of lessee involved in mining in violation of <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_158">Forest

Conservation Act</a>, 1980, M.M.D.R. Act, 1957, M.C.R., 1960, <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_159">Environment

Protection Act</a>, 1986, Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_160">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, Air

Act</a>, 1972. On 05.10.2012 the Apex Court issued notices in the matter and directed

the Central Empowered Committee (in short 'CEC') to submit its report and also

directed that till further orders, all mining operations in the leases identified in the

Report of Justice Shah Commission and transport of Iron ore and Manganese from

those leases, shall remain suspended. Lessee of the State of Goa and Goa Mineral

Association filed writ petition in Bombay High Court at Goa Bench for a

declaration that the Report of Justice Shah Commission is illegal and for quashing

the findings in the report as also for quashing the order dated 10.09.2012 of the

Government of Goa suspending the mining operations in the State of Goa and the

order dated 14.09.2012 of the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of

India directing that environmental clearances granted to the mines in the State of

Goa be kept in abeyance. All these writ petitions were transferred to the Apex

Court for hearing along with the Writ Petition (Civil) No. 435/2012 filed by the

Goa Foundation. While dealing with the said matters in its judgment dated

21.04.2014, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that renewal of lease in respect of a

mineral not specified in Part-A and Part-B of first Schedule beyond the first

renewal for a period of 20 years is conditional upon the State Government forming

an opinion that it is in the interest of mineral development, that it is necessary to

do so. Only upon recording reasons for such renewal that a mining lease in respect

of such mineral such as Iron ore, would be granted beyond time specified in sub-

<a href="/doc/737017/" id="a_163">section 8(2)</a> in view of the clear and explicit language of section 8(3) of the

M.M.D.R. Act, 1957 as it then stood. The Hon'ble Court held that this measure

was incorporated in the Legislative Scheme as a safeguard against arbitrariness

and the letter and spirit of the law must be adhered to in a strict
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                           46</span>


manner. While dealing with the said issue in relation to the provisions of Rule 24-

A(6) of M.C.R., the Apex Court also held that this sub-rule cannot apply to a case

under sub-section 3 of Section 8 of the M.M.D.R. Act because renewal under this

provision cannot be made without express orders from the State Government

recording reasons for renewal in the interest of mineral development. It was held

that in other words, so long as there is a right of renewal in the lessee which in the

case of a mining lease is for a maximum period of 20 years, the provisions

regarding deemed extension of lease can operate. But if the right of renewal of a

mining leases is dependent upon the State Government forming an opinion that in

the interest of mineral development, it is necessary to do so for reasons recorded,

such a provision regarding deemed extension, till orders are passed by the State

Government on the application of renewal, cannot apply. It was accordingly held

that sub-rule (6) of Rule 24-A of M.C.R will apply to a case of first renewal under

sub-section (2) of section 8 of the M.M.D.R. Act other than a case covered under

sub-rule (9) of Rule 24-A of the M.C.R., but will not apply to renewal under sub-

section (3) of Section 8 of the M.M.D.R. Act. In the light of the aforesaid

pronouncement rendered by the Apex Court in the case of Goa Foundation

(Supra), while dealing with the matter relating to mining in the State of Orissa

raised by the petitioner Common Cause through the Writ Petition No. 114/2014,

the Apex Court held that the provision of deemed renewal under Rule 24-A(6) of

the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 is not available in the second and subsequent

renewal of mining lessee considering the language of section 8(3) of M.M.D.R.

Act, 1957. Hence, 26 lessees could not be allowed to operate until the State

Government passes Express Orders in terms of <a href="/doc/737017/" id="a_164">section 8(3)</a> of the Act of 1957

after it forms an opinion that in the interest of mineral development, it is necessary

to renew the lease and after it records reasons for its renewal of lease.

</p><p id="p_86">69.    The Apex Court as an interim measure directed that these 26 lessees

operating in second and subsequent renewal without any Express Orders of

renewal passed by the State Government will not be allowed to operate by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                         47</span>


State Government until Express Orders are passed in terms of Section 8(3) of

M.M.D.R. Act, 1957. The Hon'ble Court accordingly directed that all renewal

applications under section 8(3) of the M.M.D.R. Act, 1957 will be considered and

disposed of by the State Government within six months from the date of the order

i.e. 16.05.2014. The Apex Court by the same judgment taking into account the

Report dated 25.04.2015 furnished by the CEC found that 102 mining leases do

not have requisite environmental clearances / approval under the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_165">Forest

Conservation Act</a>, 1988 and approved mining plan / or consent to operate. It

accordingly directed that the mining operations in these 102 mining leases shall

remain suspended but it will be open to such lessee to move the authority

concerned   for   environmental    clearances   /   approval   under   the   <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_166">Forest

(Conservation) Act</a>, 1980, approval of Mining Plan or Consent to Operate and as

and when the mining lessees are able to obtain all the clearances / approval /

consent, they may move the Hon'ble Court for modification of this interim order

in relation to their cases. It was in this background that the application moved by

the applicant for revocation of the order of suspension before the Apex Court, was

considered and decided by the judgment dated 04.04.2016 in the case of Common

Cause (Supra).

rendered by the Apex Court in the case of Common Cause (Supra)                 dated

04.04.2016. Under the provisions of amended section 24-A(6) of M.C.R, the

period of mining operations would be deemed to be extended for a maximum

period of two years after the expiry of the period of the original grant, unless of

course, the State Government takes a conscious decision on the application for

renewal. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while referring to the amended provisions,

were of the view that it has to be read in continuation of the un-amended Rule 24-

A existing prior to 18.07.2014. The un-amended provisions postulated an

unlimited period of mining lease in the absence of determinative order, on an

application for renewal. Therefore, even if the original lease had expired many

years ago, but if a renewal application had been preferred within the permissible

time contemplated under Rule 24-A(1), the same would have continued to subsist

till the instant amendment took effect on 18.07.2014. The Apex Court in its

opinion at para-12 of the judgment observed that the aforesaid conclusion is

important    for the reason that proviso to new Rule 24-A(1)            amended on

18.07.2014, consciously provided that the lease period where applications had

been filed seeking first renewal, would be deemed to have been extended for a

further period of further two years from the date of coming into force of the

amended sub-rule (6). Accordingly, in all cases wherein the first renewal had been

sought, but not determined, the mining operations were extended, by operation of

law, till 18.07.2014.

</p>
<p id="p_91">72.    The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgment dated 04.04.2016 has

extensively dealt with the aims and object of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_170">Amendment Act</a>, 2015, the

background in which amendment was introduced and the significant regime

change, that it sought to bring into operation. The Apex Court also considered the

meaning of the expression used in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_171">section 8-A(9)</a>, whereunder the benefit of

section 8A of the M.M.D.R. Act would not extend to such cases where "renewal

have been rejected" or where mining lease had been "determined" or where the

mining lease had "lapsed". At para-24 of the judgment, the Apex Court held that it

is satisfied in accepting the contention that "renewal have been rejected"

"determined" and "lapsed" are terms used in different contingencies / situation /

exigency under the M.M.D.R. Act and Mineral Concession Rules. The Apex Court

expressed its view that these terms are not used in M.M.D.R. Act, or under M.C.R.

with reference to expiry of the original grant period or with reference to expiry of

the renewal period. It accordingly opined that it is not possible to accept the

contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_172">Section 8A(9)</a> can be

legitimate basis for excluding the applicability of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_173">Section 8A</a>, the claims of lease

holders where the period of lease or renewal had expired prior to 12.01.2015. It is

profitable to quote the opinion of the Apex Court on the object and reasons of the

amended M.M.D.R. Act contained at para-25 of the Report hereunder:

              "3. The mining sector has been subjected to numerous litigations in
              the past few years. Important judgments related to the mining sector
              have been pronounced by the Supreme Court, besides judgments on
              the issue of allocation of natural resources which have direct
              relevance to the grant of mineral concessions.

<p id="p_92">4. The present legal framework of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_178">MMDR Act</a>, 1957, does not
permit the auctioning of mineral concessions. Auctioning of mineral
concessions would improve transparency in allocation. Government
would also get an increased share of the value of mineral resources.
Some provisions of the law relating to renewals of mineral
concessions have also been found to be wanting in enabling quick
decisions. Consequently, there has been a slowdown in the grant of
new concessions and the renewal of existing ones. As a result, the
mining sector started registering a decline in production affecting the
manufacturing sector which largely depends on the raw material
provided by mining sector. The Government has therefore felt it
necessary to address the immediate requirements of the mining
sector and also to remedy the basic structural defects that underlie
the current impasse.
</p><p id="p_93">5. In view of the urgent need to address these problems, the Mines
and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Ordinance,
2015 was promulgated on 12th January, 2015. The present Bill is to
replace this Ordinance. This bill is designed to put in place
mechanism for:
</p><p id="p_94">(i) Eliminating discretion;
</p><p id="p_95">(ii) Improving transparency in the allocation of mineral resources;
</p><p id="p_96">(iii) Simplifying procedures;
</p><p id="p_97">(iv) Eliminating delay in administration, so as to enable expeditious
and optimum development of the mineral resources of the country;
</p><p id="p_98">(v) Obtaining for the government an enhanced share of the value of
the mineral resources of the country; and
</p><p id="p_99">(vi) Attracting private investment and the latest technology;
</p><p id="p_100">6. The salient features of MMDR Amendment Bill, 2015 are as
follows:
</p><p id="p_101">(i) Removal of discretion: auction to be sole method of allotment:
The amendment seeks to bring in utmost transparency by
introducing auction mechanism for the grant of mineral concessions.
The tenure of mineral leases has been increased from the existing 30
years to 50 years. There is no provision for renewal of leases.
</p><p id="p_102">(ii) Impetus to the mining sector: The mining industry has been
aggrieved due to the second and subsequent renewals remaining
pending. In fact, this has led to closure of a large number of mines.
The Bill addresses this issue also. The Bill provides that mining
leases would be deemed to be extended from the date of their last
renewal to 31st March, 2030 (in the case of captive mines) and till
31st March,2020 (for the merchant miners) or till the completion of
the renewal already granted, if any, or a period of fifty years from
the date of grant of such lease, whichever is later."
</p><p id="p_103">                                               (emphasis is ours)
From a perusal of the extract reproduced above, it is apparent, that
the insertion of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_179">Section 8A</a> into the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_180">MMDR Act</a>, was to address the
hardship faced by leaseholders, besides other reasons, due to the
second and subsequent applications for renewal, remaining
unattended at the hands of the State Government. The instant
amendment to the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_181">MMDR Act</a>, introduced a uniform original grant
period of fifty years, for all mining leaseholders. It also excluded
renewal(s), after the expiry of the original lease period. Accordingly,
no renewal application can now be filed (after 12.1.2015). Under
sub-sections (5) and (6) of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_182">Section 8A</a>, in our view, such
leaseholders who had moved applications for renewal of
captive/non-captive mines, would be entitled to continue up to
31.3.2030/31.3.2020. The "Objects and Reasons" for the amendment
to the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_183">MMDR Act</a> aim at remedying the position which emerged
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                           51</span>


             upon the interpretation of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_184">MMDR Act</a>, as they
             existed hitherto before. The instant amendment was also directed at
             remedying the grievances of the mining industry due to "second and
             subsequent renewals" remaining pending. And also, because the
             provisions of law relating to renewals had been found to be wanting.
             The above view is also endorsed by the fact, that <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_185">Section 8A(9)</a> deals
             with a situation wherein "...renewal has been rejected...". It is
             therefore apparent, that sub-sections (5) and (6) of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_186">Section 8A</a> of the
             amended <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_187">MMDR Act</a> are aimed at situations, wherein an application
             for renewal (validly made) has remained unattended. Therefore, for
             no fault of the leaseholder, he would be subjected to an arbitrary
             prejudice. It needs to be clarified, that since an application for
             renewal cannot be filed after 12.1.2015, an application for renewal
             as would be treated as having been validly made, ought to have been
             made before 12.1.2015. We are of the view, that out of the three
             contingencies contemplated under sub-<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_188">sections 8A(5)</a> and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_189">8A(6)</a>,
             referred to above, the first of the contingencies positively, pertains to
             a situation, wherein applications validly made for renewal, were
             pending without any final decision at the hands of the State
             Government. Because in the absence of a renewal application, the
             leaseholder can be taken to have already expressed his disinterest, to
             continue mining operations. Therefore logically, the words "... with
             effect from the date of expiry of the period of renewal last made ...",
             should relate to an expired lease prior to 12.1.2015, in relation to
             which a valid application for renewal had already been made".

                      Act is available, subject to a further overriding condition,
                      namely, "... that all the terms and conditions of the lease have
                      been complied with". A leaseholder who does not satisfy any
                      of the required conditions of the lease, as for instance, the
                      postulated clearances/approvals/consent, would not be
                      entitled to the benefits extended under sub-section (5) or (6)

                    12.1.2015, and the leaseholder had moved an application for

                    captive/non-captive mines, respectively).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">                    Additionally, a leaseholder whose period of renewal would
                    expire after 12.1.2015, but before 31.3.2030/31.3.2020, the
                    lease period would stand extended up to 31.3.2030/31.3.2020
                    (in the case of captive/non-captive mines, respectively).
                    Secondly, where the renewal of the mining lease already
                    extends to a period beyond 31.3.2030/31.3.2020 (in the case
                    of captive/non-captive mines, respectively), the lease period
                    of such leaseholders, would continue up to the actual period
                    contemplated by the renewal order. Thirdly, a leaseholder
                    would have the benefit of treating the original lease period as
                    of fifty years. Accordingly, even during the renewal period, if
                    the period of the mining lease would get extended (beyond
                    the renewal period) by treating the original lease as of fifty
                    years, the leaseholder would be entitled to such benefit.

                    sections (5) and (6) of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_213">Section 8A</a>, the contingency as would
                    extend the lease period farthest, would enure to the benefit of
                    the leaseholder.

                    4A(4)</a> of the MMDR Act, and Rule 28 of the Mineral
                    Concession Rules, we can draw the following conclusions.
                    Firstly, unless an order is passed by the State Government
                    declaring, that a mining lease has lapsed, the mining lease
                    would be deemed to be subsisting, up to the date of expiry of
                    the lease period provided by the lease document. Secondly, in
                    situations wherein an application has been filed by a

having a subsisting right to carry on mining operations, till the expiry of two years

after 18.07.2014 i.e up to 17.07.2016, as is apparent from a conjoint reading of the

un-amended and amended Rule 24A of Mineral Concession Rules. Such lease

holder would have the benefit of sub-section (5) and (6) of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_218">Section 8A</a> of the

amended M.M.D.R. Act. Sub Para-v of para-32 makes it further clear that in case

of second (third or subsequent) renewal application moved by a lease holder

under un-amended section 8(3) of the M.M.D.R. Act at least twelve months before

the renewed lease was due to expire and whose application had not been

considered and rejected (though not entitled to any benefit under the un-amended

Rule 24A(6) of the Mineral Concession Rules) up to 12.01.2015, would still have

the benefit of sub-sections (5) and (6) of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_219">Section 8A</a> of the amended M.M.D.R.

Act in view of the situation sought to be remedied by the M.M.D.R. (Amendment)

Act, 2015. Sub Para (vi) of para-32 contains the construction of regime introduced

under sub sections (5) and (6) of the amended <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_220">Section 8A</a>. It provides for three

contingencies where the benefits have been extended to lease holders whose lease

period had earlier been extended by a renewal. Firstly, for a lease holders whose

renewal application had been moved before 12.01.2015 i.e. at least twelve months

before the lease holder's existing lease was to expire and whose application had

not been considered and rejected, such lease period would extend extended up to

31.03.2030/    31.03.2020    (captive   and    non-captive    mines    respectively).

Additionally, in such cases where period of lease would expire after 12.01.2015

but before 31.03.2030 / 31.03.2020, the lease period would stand extended up to

31.03.2030 / 31.03.2020 (in case of captive / non-captive mines respectively).

Secondly, where renewal of a mining lease already extends to a period beyond

31.03.2030 / 31.03.2020, the lease period of such lease holders would continue up

to the actual period contemplated by the renewal order. Thirdly, a lease holder

would have the benefit of treating the original lease period as of fifty years.

Accordingly, even during the renewal period, if the period of mining lease would
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                          55</span>


get extended (beyond the renewal period) by treating the original lease as of fifty

years, the lease holder would be entitled to such benefit. Out of the above three

contingencies provided under sub-sections (5) and (6) of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_221">Section 8A</a>, the

contingency as would extend the lease period farthest, would enure to the benefit

of the lease holder.
</p>
<p id="p_108">76.    From the aforesaid ratio rendered by the Apex Court, it can be pithily stated

that the regime of renewal has been replaced by the provisions of deemed

extension of lease period of such lessee, as described in the contingencies referred

to in para-32 of the judgment in Common Cause (Supra).
</p>
<p id="p_109">       It is now necessary to address the legal issue on the meaning of the

expression 'Renewal and 'Extension'. There is difference between the extension of

lease and a renewal of lease. In the case of extension, it is not necessary to have a

fresh deed of lease executed as the extension of lease in the terms agreed upon,

shall be a necessary consequence of the clause for extension. The difference

between the two expression have been interpreted by the judgment rendered by the

Apex Court in the case of Provesh Chandra Dalui and others versus Biswanath

Banerjee and another [(1989P Supp. 1 SCC 487] relied upon in the case of

Gajraj Singh and others versus State Transport Appellate Tribunal and

others (1997) 1 SCC 650]. It is profitable to quote the opinion of the Apex Court

contained in para-27 of the judgment rendered in the case of <a href="/doc/12739362/" id="a_222">State of Gujarat &amp;

others vs. Nirmalaben S. Mehta &amp; another</a> etc. [JT 2016 (6) 508] wherein the

opinion of the Apex Court in the case of Gajraj Singh &amp; others (Supra) and

Provash Chandra Dalui (supra) on the distinction between the expression

'extension' and 'renewal' has also been referred and relied upon. Para-27 of the

judgment in the case of Nirmalaben S. Mehta (Supra) is quoted hereunder:

<blockquote id="blockquote_24">              "...a distinction between 'extension' and 'renewal' is chiefly that in

              by the performance of stipulated act. In other words, the word
              'extension' when used in its proper and usual sense in connection
              with a lease, means prolongation of the lease."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25">              38. It is settled law that grant of renewal is a fresh grant though it
              breathes life into the operation of the pervious lease or licence
              granted as per existing appropriate provisions of the Act, rules, or
              orders or acts intra vires or as per the law in operation as on the date
              of renewal. The right to get renewal of a permit under the Act is not
              a vested right but a privilege subject to fulfillment of the conditions
              precedent enumerated under the Act. Under Section 58 of the
              Repealed Act, renewal of a permit is a preferential right and refusal
              thereof is an exception. <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_224">But the Act</a> expresses different intention.

              Existence of the provisions of the Act consistent with the Repealed
              Act is a precondition. Grant of renewal under <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_229">Section 81</a> is a
              discretion given to the authority (STA or RTA) subject to the
              conditions and the requirement of law. Discretion given by a statute
              connotes making a choice between competing considerations
              according to rules of reason and justice and not arbitrary or whim
              but legal and regular. <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_230">Sections 70</a> and <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_231">71</a> read with <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_232">Section 81</a> do

'Renewal' and 'Extension', it is evident from the judgment rendered in the case of

Common Cause (Supra) that the power of the State Government to grant or

refuse renewal of a lease has been completely done away with in respect of

minerals other than those specified in Part-A and Part-B of the first schedule under

the amended <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_234">section 8A</a> of the Amendment Act, 2015. The Parliament, however,

has wherever considered necessary, given a definite role, power and jurisdiction to

the State Government such as in <a href="/doc/539619/" id="a_235">section 4A</a>, <a href="/doc/701072/" id="a_236">10</a>, <a href="/doc/978526/" id="a_237">10(2)(b)</a> under the amended Act

also. The silence on the role and jurisdiction of the State Government in the

amended provisions of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_238">section 8A</a>, on the contrary, is therefore eloquent. What

could not have been directly done in the absence of such an express power

conferred on the State Government to take a decision on the question of extension

of lease specified under the amended <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_239">section 8A</a>, cannot be done in a indirect

manner by assuming such power and jurisdiction upon itself. Reference may be

made to the principle of law on this point as laid down by the Apex Court in the

case of State of Tamil Nadu and others versus K. Shyam Sunder and others

[(2011) 8 SCC 737] and K.C. Gajapati Narayan Deo and others versus The

State of Orissa [ 1954 SCR 1 also see AIR 1953 SC 375].

Versus Finsbury Borough Council [(1951) 2 All England Reports 587 and held

</p><p id="p_112">80.    The case of all the writ petitioners are of first renewal. Respondent-State in

its counter affidavit have not refuted that these lease holders had made a valid

application 12 months before the date of expiry of the lease period in their case.

The application for renewal were admittedly not rejected before 12.1.2015 i.e.

coming into force of the Amended Act, 2015. In that way, the application for

renewal     made before the State Government on the part of individual writ

petitioners / lessees for first renewal were admittedly pending as on 12.1.2015 i.e.

cut off date. It is also undisputed that in none of these cases, the lease of the writ

petitioners/ lessees were 'terminated' or were 'determined' or were declared as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                         58</span>


'lapsed' by an express order passed by the State Government. None of the

conditions stipulated under <a href="/doc/737017/" id="a_241">Section 8(A)(9)</a> therefore applied to the case of the

writ petitioners / lessees to exclude their cases from the cover of the provisions

under Section 8 A (3), (5) and (6) of the Amended Act. Therefore in view of the

ratio rendered by the Apex Court in the case of Common Cause (supra), the State

Government could not have assumed an authority and jurisdiction to deny

extension to the individual writ petitioners / lessees under the provisions of

Section 8A of the M.M.D.R. Act, 1957.
</p>
<p id="p_113">81.   However, having said that it is equally imperative to remember the caveat

laid down by the Apex Court at Para 27 of the judgment in the case Common

Cause (supra), quoted in the earlier part of the judgment as well. The benefit of

extension of lease period postulated under Section 8A of the M.M.D.R. Act is

applicable subject to a further overriding condition namely that all the terms and

conditions of the lease have been complied with. The lease holder who does not

satisfy any of the required conditions of the lease, such as postulated clearance/

approval / consent would not be entitled to benefits extended under Sub-<a href="/doc/758150/" id="a_242">section 5</a>

and <a href="/doc/582772/" id="a_243">6</a> of the 8A of the M.M.D.R. Act. It is therefore clear that none of the lessees

who have not complied with the terms and conditions of the lease or have failed to

obtain postulated clearance/ approval/ consent would be entitled to benefit of the

extension period.
</p>
<p id="p_114">82.   It would not be out of place to mention again that in the case of Common

Cause (supra) itself, the Hon'ble Apex Court by order dated 16.5.2014 had

restrained 102 mining lease holders from carrying out any mining operations as

they had failed to obtain the statutory clearances / approval / consent required to

carry the mining operations. The judgment dated 4.4.2016 (supra) has in fact been

rendered on applications filed by these mining lease holders seeking revocation of

the order of suspension claiming to have obtained statutory clearances/approval/

consent etc. Therefore, every such lease holders whose lease shall be deemed to

have been extended by virtue of the provisions under <a href="/doc/737017/" id="a_244">Section 8(A)</a> (5) or (6) of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                         59</span>


Amended Act shall be required to comply with the terms and conditions of the

lease and also obtain all such postulated clearances / approval / consent, failing

which, the benefit of deemed extension would not be available to the lease

holders. Such lessee would therefore not be entitled to operate the mines till the

period such statutory clearances are obtained and terms and conditions of the lease

are satisfied.
</p>
<p id="p_115">       However, no such lessee can be allowed an indefinite length of time to

comply with the terms and conditions of the lease and / or obtain the statutory

clearance / compliance / consent to operate. Such compliances and statutory

clearances must be made and obtained within a reasonable time. The State

Government and the Statutory authorities under the M.M.D.R Act , M.C.R. Rules,

1960, M.C.D.R. Rules 1988, <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_245">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980, The Environment

( Protection ) Act, 1986, The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_246">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,1973

and The Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_247">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and other such

Statutes / Law covering the field, whose permission / clearance are mandatory to

undertake the mining operations, are required to act in accordance with law and

even stop any such lessee from carrying out the mining operations till such

clearances/ approval / consent are obtained and the terms and conditions of the

lease are complied with. Under the relevant provisions of M.C.D.R., 1988, all

mining operations are to be done as per the mining plan sanctioned by the Indian

Bureau of Mines which has the authority to monitor and oversee that mines are

operated as per the approved mining plan. Reference may be made to the

provisions of Chapter-III of M.C.D.R., 1988 relating to working of the mines, as

per the approved mining plan. It provides for the role and powers of Indian Bureau

of Mines. The provisions under Chapter-V of M.C.D.R., 1988 relate to protection

of environment and control of pollution while conducting any mining,

beneficiation or metallurgical operations. The M.C.D.R., 1988 lays down elaborate

provisions for conservation and development of minerals to be mandatorily

observed by any such lessee. In other words, the statutory authorities are obliged
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                          60</span>


to act in accordance with law in case of any such failure to obtain the clearance or

on breach of the terms and conditions of the lease itself. The State Government

being the lessor for that matter would be well within its power to stop mining

operations of any such lessee in the event of failure to comply the terms and

conditions of the lease or to remedy the breach, if any, within the stipulated period

under the provisions of the M.C.R. Rules, 1960, such as Rule 27(5) or on failure to

produce all mandatory / statutory clearance / approval / consent to operate. The

State Government as a delegate of the Parliament under the M.M.D.R. Act and the

rules framed thereunder have been conferred with specific powers to determine the

lease under the provisions of Rule 27(4), (5), 29, 37(B) and Part IX Clause 2,

form-K of the M.C.R,1960. It has also been conferred the power under Rule 4(A)

read with Rule 28 (A) of the M.C.R. Rules to declare the lease as lapsed on

satisfaction of the conditions laid down there in.
</p>
<p id="p_116">83.    However, resort to the 'subject to' clause under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_248">section 8A(5)</a> or (6) of the

Amended Act to refuse extension of lease by the State Government cannot be

tenable in law in view of the authoritative pronouncement of the Apex Court and

the background in which such regime change has been brought in the matter of

renewal of lease under the un-amended <a href="/doc/737017/" id="a_249">Section 8</a> by introduction of the amended

<a href="/doc/737017/" id="a_250">Section 8(A)</a> applicable to minerals other than those specified in Part-A and B of

the Schedule-I w.e.f 12.1.2015. The contentions of the State Government as well

as the Union of India on that point therefore does not merit acceptance. The

provisions of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_251">section 8A(3)</a> (5)(6) are indeed transitional provisions as also is the

case of Union of India reflected in the counter affidavit. It is further evident from

the reading of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_252">Section 8A(4)</a> that on expiry of the lease period, the lease would be

put up for auction as per the procedure specified in the Act. If the interpretation on

'subject to' clause advanced by the Union of India and the State is accepted, such

an exercise of power by the State Government to refuse extension would be

wholly unguided and uncanalized in the absence of any guidelines or conditions

prescribed under the Act and the Rules other than what have been specifically
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                           61</span>


laid down in the Act of 1957, M.C.R., 1960 , M.C.D.R, 1988. There might be

minor breach remediable in nature or a serious violation of terms and conditions of

the lease. In that event, the power of the State Government would be uncontrolled

and unguided by any prescribed guideline to refuse extension of the mining lease

itself. Such a proposition is also not legally sound and tenable to be accepted in the

scheme of the amended Act. [See: State of Tamil Nadu and others versus K.

renewal applications on the grounds of judicial review of administrative action.

Upon consideration of the submissions advanced on these issues by the learned

counsel for the petitioners and the State and on scrutiny of the impugned orders of

rejection, it is found that they also suffer on the following counts:-

</p><p id="p_119">       (i) the impugned orders in each individual cases contain the charges and

allegations relating to non compliance of the terms and conditions of the lease or

instances of delay or failure to obtain one or the other statutory clearances. It also

refers to the observations made in the report of Justice M.B. Shah Commission.

However, it completely fails to record any specific findings on consideration of the

reply of the writ petitioners / lessees on the aforesaid allegations / charges. The

order is therefore non speaking and suffer from non-application of mind.

</p><p id="p_120">       (ii) The impugned order in fact summarily records that the Committee

constituted by the State Government has found the violations of terms and

conditions of the lease and lack of one or the other statutory clearances on the part

of the lessees, whereas the Committee constituted by the State Government in its

report dated 07.09.2015 have rendered no specific finding in respect of any of the

lessees relating to the violations. It has left the exercise to be undertaken by the

State Government. The impugned orders therefore incorrectly records that the

Committee has come to a finding on the alleged violations by the lessees.

</p><p id="p_121">       (iii) The order of rejection of renewal application has been passed by the

Joint Secretary of Mines and Geology Department of the State of Jharkhand, but

the authority passing the order has not given any personal hearing to any of these

petitioners. Rather the opportunity of hearing was given by the Committee itself

who has not passed any order. It therefore amounts to violation of the principles of

natural justice. (see: Automotive Tyre Manufacturers Association versus

</p><p id="p_122">       (iv) In such circumstances, the impugned order being non speaking and

being in violation of the principles of natural justice as also incorrectly recording

that the Committee has come to findings on the violations by the lessees, are

susceptible to challenge under the well settled grounds of judicial review as laid

down by the pronouncement of the Apex Court.
</p>
<p id="p_123">       Since the order impugned have been found to be unsustainable in law and

facts on the aforesaid grounds of judicial review and in violations of principles of

natural justice, it is not necessary to go into the question relating to constitution of

the Committee by the State Government to enquire into the matter of extension of

lease of such lessee as raised by the writ petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_124">86.    Learned ASGI for the Union of India and Learned A.A.G. for the State both

have also raised a question of availability of an alternative statutory remedy of

revision before the Central Government Mining Tribunal. The discussions in the

foregoing paragraphs however unmistakably show that the instant matters raised

legal issues of substantial importance involving the interpretation of the provisions

of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_254">Section 8A</a>, specifically 8A(5) and 8A(6) of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_255">Amendment Act</a>, 2015, enacted

by the Parliament, which the Learned Central Government Mining Tribunal may
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                          63</span>


not be in a position to adjudicate upon being a creature of the Statute. Reference

may also be made herein to the observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in that

regard in the case of Sandur Manganese and Iron Ores Limited versus State of

Karnataka and others [(2010) 13 SCC 1] where the Apex Court had opined that

the Central Government Revisional Tribunal could not be an independent and

efficacious alternative forum in terms of the guidelines laid down by the

Constitution Bench in the case of Union of India versus R. Gandhi, President,

Madras Bar Association [(2010) 11 SCC 1]. As has been held hereinabove, the

impugned order also suffers from violation of principles of natural justice and

errors of law which are amenable to certiorari jurisdiction of this Court. Having

considered the matter at length in the aforesaid light, this Court is not inclined to

accept the plea raised by the Respondents on the question of availability of an

alternative statutory remedy.
</p>
<p id="p_125">87.    Having held as above, it is at the same time clarified in unambiguous terms

that no such lessee including the writ petitioners who have not complied with the

terms and conditions of the lease or have failed to obtain statutory clearances /

compliance/ consent to operate shall be entitled to carry out mining operations and

avail of the benefits of deemed extension. The writ petitioners on the one hand and

the State Government on the other hand have through their affidavits sought to

counter each other on the question of compliance of the terms and conditions of

the lease or in the matter of obtaining statutory clearances. The State Government

being the lessor, shall without any delay undertake the exercise by giving

opportunity to the individual lessees / writ petitioners to satisfy that the terms and

conditions of the lease have been complied with and that all postulated statutory

clearances / compliances / consent has been obtained by them for carrying out the

mining operations.
</p>
<p id="p_126">88.    Writ petitioners in WPC Nos. 2027/2016 &amp; 2207/2016 shall therefore

satisfy the lessor i.e. State Government regarding the compliance of the terms and

conditions of the lease and that all the statutory clearances / compliances / consent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                          64</span>


has been obtained, within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of such

notice. As per the assertion of the writ petitioner in WPC No. 2515/2016, it has not

obtained the mandatory statutory clearances and was not carrying out mining

operations. By the interim order dated 20.05.2016, it was also restrained from

carrying out mining operations. It is also required to satisfy the State Government

regarding compliance of the terms and conditions of the lease and that it has

obtained the statutory clearances / compliances / consent similarly within the

period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of such notice. Only if it is able to

satisfy the State Government that such compliances / clearances / consent has been

done / obtained, that it shall be allowed to commence the mining operations

thereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_127">89.    In view of the observations made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court at Para-27

of the judgment rendered in the case of Common Cause (Supra), such lease

holders who does not satisfy any of the required conditions of the lease and have

not obtained the postulated clearances / approval / consent, would not be entitled

to the benefits of deemed extension. Such lessee would therefore be not entitled to

operate the mines till such statutory clearances are obtained and terms and

conditions of the lease are satisfied. The State Government and the Statutory

authorities are obliged in law to examine any / all such instances relating to

compliance of terms and conditions of the lease or any breach thereof and

satisfaction of statutory clearances / compliance / consent by the individual lessees

before carrying out the mining operations. In case of any such instances being

noticed, the State Government and the Statutory authority are required to act in

accordance with law and as per the procedure prescribed under the M.M.D.R Act ,

M.C.R., 1960, M.C.D.R., 1988, <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_256">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980, The

Environment (Protection ) Act, 1986, The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_257">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>,1973 and The Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_258">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981

as well as any other Enactment / Statute / Notification applicable to such lessees.

The State Government and / or such other authorities may also direct stoppage of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                         65</span>


mining operations pending such decision in case of such violations or failure to

comply the terms and conditions of the lease within the time stipulated or failure

to obtain the statutory clearances / compliances / consent. It is important to state

here that no such lessee seeking the benefit of deemed extension under amended

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_259">Section 8A</a> should be granted an indefinite period of time to ensure compliance of

terms and conditions of the lease or to obtain such mandatory statutory clearances

/ compliance / consent. A reasonable period up to a maximum of 6 months at the

most can be stipulated for any such lessee to obtain the statutory clearances /

compliance / consent. Any such lessee is required to remedy the breach and

comply the terms and conditions of the lease within the time stipulated under the

M.C.R. 1960, failing which, the State Government should proceed to determine

the lease of such lease holder in accordance with law and the procedure prescribed

under the M.C.R., 1960. The intention of the parliament by introducing the

amended provisions under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_260">Section 8A</a> cannot be defeated by defaulting lease

holders by having a leash for an indefinite length of time thereby denying the

opportunity to open the lease hold land for auction through a competitive bidding

in the larger interest of the State and the Public Exchequer as conceived under

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_261">Section 8A(4)</a> of the amended Act.
</p>
<p id="p_128">90.    As an epilogue, this Court feels it necessary to also observe that during the

course of the proceedings of the instant matters, petitioners as well as the State

Government have brought to the notice of the Court the different methods and

procedures being adopted by other State Governments, such as the State

Government of Chhatisgarh and Rajasthan in the matter of grant of extension of

lease under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_262">Section 8A</a> of the amended Act. The State Government of Chattisgarh

has issued guidelines for the purpose and a check list to be fulfilled by such

lessees seeking extension. It includes a formal agreement for extension of mining

lease to be entered into between the State Government and such lessee. The check

list contains particulars relating to lease in question as also the compliance to be

undertaken under the MCR and MCDR Rules which are to be examined at the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                                          66</span>


time of execution of agreement for extension of period of mining lease. The

Government of Rajasthan has on its part also circulated a format in which the

extension of lease in terms of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_263">section 8A(5)</a> or (6) is to be entered into between the

State Government and the lessee. It has also referred to the Government of India's

letter dated 5.2.2015 referred to in the foregoing paragraphs of the judgment.

</p><p id="p_129">91.    It has been informed during the course of arguments that the Central

Government has framed certain guidelines under the powers prescribed under

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_264">Section 8A(8)</a> in respect of period of mining lease including existing mining lease

of Government Companies and Corporations. However, on being specifically

asked, learned ASGI has not brought to the notice of the Court any guidelines or

directions issued by the Central Government in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_265">Section

24</a> of the amended Act no. 10 of 2015 i.e. the 'Removal of Difficulty Clause'. It

would only be proper that in order to avoid divergence of views, approaches and

procedures adopted by different State Government in the matter of extension of

mining lease under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_266">section 8A</a> of the amended Act that the

Central Government lays down specific guidelines / circular to be followed in an

uniform manner in such matters.
</p>
<p id="p_130">92.    In the light of elaborate discussion made and for the reasons recorded

herein above and in view of the authoritative pronouncement of the Apex Court in

the Common Cause Case (supra) vide judgment dated 4.4.2016, the impugned

orders passed by the State Government cannot be upheld in the eye of law and are

accordingly quashed. Resultantly, all consequential action taken by the

Respondent State are also rendered nonest in the eye of law. The observations and

directions issued herein above are required to be carried out by the concerned

authorities and the lease holders scrupulously and in accordance with law. The writ

petitions are allowed in the manner and to the extent indicated herein above.
