    further urged that argument of not obtaining previous permission before

    changing the user of land is misconceived because the lands given to





    WCL are only for mining purposes and no other purpose. Acquisition of

    land for the purpose of coal mining itself amounts to sanctioning the use of

    land for non-agricultural purpose.    It is urged that sanction for such user

    deeming fiction under <a href="/doc/1877623/" id="a_34">Section 5</a> (2) of Nationalization Act has not been

    authority governing present controversy.        Again Form "K " Chapter 7
           

    Clause 1 of 1960 Rules is pointed out and it is canvassed that State has
        



    not argued that Leases granted to WCL were not as per said Form or then

    the terms thereof are not binding on it.      It is pointed out that the Hon

    municipal taxes on Airport Authority in Dum Dum Airport case (supra)

    issuance of the proper show cause notice or a supplementary notice to

    document was unregistered and State treated that document as in the

    nature of "sale".   It was found that second part of <a href="/doc/613871/" id="a_41">Section 54</a> of Transfer

    was by delivery of possession,      the other way was not shown to have




                                                          
    been followed.      The judgment then proceeds to consider the precedents

    cited to note that those judgments contemplated ownership of the property




                                                         
    and it was also noticed that definition of "owner" as contained in Andhra

    Pradesh Non-agricultural Assessment Act, 1963 was expanded even to




                                              
    include the Lessee in respect of the land owned by State Government.               It
                                
    was found that there was no parallel provision in Maharashtra Land
                               
    Revenue Code. In paragraph 17 the contentions of State Government

    about the wide meaning of expression "transfer" or "divesting" are noted

    with question whether in facts there had been a transfer by such action by
           


    which it could be gathered that land ceased to be property of the Central
        



    Government.      Then in paragraph 19, this Court held that petitioner before

    it was neither an owner not a grantee.       It is obvious that the question





    which is being raised before me by Petitioner-W. C. L. did not arise for

    consideration in this reported judgment. As the document purporting to





    effect transfer was found not to possess that effect and as facts on record

    did not establish divesting of any interest by Union of India,         this Court

    found that <a href="/doc/1353284/" id="a_42">Article 285</a> continued to apply and hence non-agricultural tax

    was not leviable.

    Government earlier devolved upon International Airport Authority by virtue
                               
    of <a href="/doc/1245728/" id="a_47">Section 12</a> (1) (a) of <a href="/doc/988937/" id="a_48">International Airports Authority Act</a>, 1971 ("1971

    to Central Government, <a href="/doc/1353284/" id="a_49">Article 285</a> of Constitution applied to it and not
           

    otherwise.    Paragraph 2 this judgment is important and it shows that in
        



    terms of <a href="/doc/1245728/" id="a_50">Section 12</a> (3) of said 1971 Act dispute of such nature was to be

    accordingly it was decided by Central Government holding that the land

    on which non-agricultural tax was demanded by State of Maharashtra

    continued to belong to Central Government and its ownership was not





    transferred to said Authority. In paragraph 11 of this judgment different

    shades of the meaning of word "vest" are noticed and in paragraph 12

    away the management of Airports from the Authority and entrust it to any

    other person.   In paragraphs 13 and 14 judgment of Hon Calcutta High




                                                      
    Court and Hon Gujarat High Court holding that the transfer was for limited

    purpose of administration and management are appreciated.           Thereafter




                                            
    in paragraph 15, it has been concluded that since the word "vest" is
                              
    capable of variable meanings, provisions of <a href="/doc/1245728/" id="a_51">Section 12</a> (1) (a) thereof
                             
    were of no assistance and other provisions of the 1971 Act needed to be

    looked into. In paragraph 16 it is noticed that no contract for sale of

    immovable property can be made by Airport Authority unless previously
           


    approved by Central Government and it had no power to lease if it was for
        



    period of more than 30 years without such previous approval. It has been

    therefore observed that vesting with Airport Authority was only for the





    management of Airports and Union Government remained the owner.

<p id="p_43">    Immunity conferred by <a href="/doc/1353284/" id="a_52">Article 285</a> was, therefore, held to be available and





    State Government could not impose any tax upon said land.         It is obvious

    that view taken is due to appreciation of scheme of 1971 Act as also of

    decision of Union of India in terms of its <a href="/doc/1245728/" id="a_53">section 12</a> (3). I find that the

    Central Government under Coal Bearing Act and therefore neither <a href="/doc/1907423/" id="a_103">Section

    10</a> (2) nor <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_104">Section 11</a> (2) have any application and Petitioners WCL




                                             
    cannot be treated as Lessee of State Government in relation to lands
                               
    received by it under this Enactment. It is apparent that all types of rights
                              
    can be acquired under Coal Bearing Act and vesting thereof is

    contemplated only under <a href="/doc/1907423/" id="a_105">Section 10</a> (1). <a href="/doc/1907423/" id="a_106">Section 10</a> (1) also covers

    vesting after acquisition of leasehold rights. <a href="/doc/1907423/" id="a_107">Section 10</a> (2) only provides
           


    for substitution of Central Government as lessee of State Government
        



    when rights under mining lease are acquired. The rights of original owner

    of those leasehold rights vest in Central Government under first part of





    <a href="/doc/1907423/" id="a_108">Section 10</a> and <a href="/doc/1907423/" id="a_109">Section 10</a> (2) only regulates the relationship between

    Central Government and State Government concerning such mining lease





    by superimposing Central Government as lessee and by prescribing

    maximum possible duration therefor.        Therefore, only <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_110">Section 11</a> (1)

    does not use or specify both parts of <a href="/doc/1907423/" id="a_111">Section 10</a> separately. Otherwise,

    there is no mechanism in <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_112">Section 11</a> enabling Central Government to

    transfer acquired mining lease to any Government Company. <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_113">Section 11</a>

    vesting. The argument in paragraph 18 about different shades of
                               
    expression "vest" is considered in paragraph 22 which also shows
                              
    consideration of argument that the vesting of properties in Airport

    and intention to transfer constitutional immunity of Central Government to
                                
    Government Company in said provisions. It is also clear that immunity
                               
    provided for by <a href="/doc/1759908/" id="a_146">Article 285(1)</a> is conferred by Constitution on Central

    Government and it is a constitutional privilege which cannot be transferred

    or made over to any other functionaries unless and until Constitution of
           


    India is itself amended. Because of this position, neither Coal Bearing Act
        



    or Nationalization Act can be construed as even dealing with such





    immunity and therefore, nor <a href="/doc/1230543/" id="a_147">Section 5</a> or <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_148">Section 11</a> thereof, as the case

    may be, can be viewed as engulfing this aspect of immunity while using

    the words "all the rights and liabilities of Central Government". The words





    "free from all encumbrances" in respective S.10(1) &amp; 3(1) of respective

    Acts do not cover constitutional rights &amp; liabilities. Moreover, even if

    "deeming scheme" in respective above Sections is presumed to cover

    within its sweep such immunity of Central Government, the same cannot

    be passed over to WCL by either Coal Bearing Act or <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_149">Nationalisation Act</a>.

     1973. The power to impose tax on lands and buildings
                 
     is derived by the State Legislature from Entry 49 of List
     II :   "Taxes on lands and buildings". The power of the

     been conferred by the State Legislature on the Special

     the power to levy that tax in order effectively to
   



     discharge the municipal functions which are passed on

     surface rent in respect of the surface area occupied or
     used by him. Demands were made upon the lessee for




                                             
     successive years for the payment of land cess under
     Secs. 78 and 79 of the Madras District Boards Act,
     1920. Those demands were challenged by the lessee on




                                            
     the ground, inter alia, that the provision imposing the
     land cess quoad royalty under the mining leases must
     be held to have been repealed by the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_172">Central Act</a> viz. the

     1948, and the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and
     <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_174">Development) Act</a>, 1957. This contention was repelled
                
     by this Court by holding that Sections 78 and 79 of the
     Madras District Boards Act had nothing to do with the
     development of mines and minerals or their regulation.
</p>      


<p id="p_110">     The proceeds of the land cess were required to be
   



     credited to the District fund which had to be used for
     everything necessary for or conducive to the safety,
     health, convenience or education of the inhabitants or





     the amenities of the local area concerned It was further
     held by the Court that the land cess was not a tax on
     mineral rights but was in truth and substance a "tax on





     lands" within the meaning Of Entry 49 of the State list.
     The reasoning adopted in this decision shows that it is
     not correct to say that the proparty tax provided for in
     the Act of 1973 is beyond the legislative competence of
     the State Legislature; that tax has nothing to do with
     the development of mines. The power conferred by the

    may not be equated with the land as ordinarily understood. Land in its

    ordinary meaning may be an agricultural land or a non-agricultural land. It

    may also be a mineral bearing land. Mineral bearing lands, however, are
           


    governed by the provisions of the 1957 Act and the Rules framed

    well as surface rent are payable. Therefore, as per minority view said

    Entry 49 of List II should be read in such a manner so that the surface

    from land cannot be said to be yield on coal bearing land so as to hold

    of tax vis-a-vis the nature and character thereof. While purporting to

    impose tax on land and buildings a State has the legislative competence

    in terms of Entry 49 of List II of the Constitution but it can not entrench
           


    upon Entry 52 or Entry 54 of List I thereof. The impugned levies under the

    levy did not concern itself with any aspects of land i.e. extent of land,

    nature, character, quality or location thereof. In the case of mineral, as it is





    already embedded in the earth minority view of Apex Court states that

    there was no question of any yield because there could be no annual yield

    available for the concept that under Entry 49 in List II the land remains a

    land without regard to the use to which it is being subjected. It is open for

    same time it is also permissible to identify, for the purpose of

    classification, the land by reference to its user.   While taxing the land it is





    open for the Legislature to consider the land which produces a particular

    growth or is useful for a particular utility and to classify it separately and

    tax the same. Different pieces of land identically situated otherwise, but





    being subjected to different uses, or having different potential, are capable

    of being classified separately without incurring the wrath of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_191">Art. 14</a> of the

    Constitution. The tax would remain a tax on land and would not become a

     capable of being comprised in the main subject of
     general legislative head by placing an extended
      

     construction, but that is not the rule for deciding the
     appropriate legislative field for taxation between List I
   



     and List II. As the fields of taxation are to be found
     clearly enumerated in Lists I and II, there can be no





     overlapping. There may be overlapping in fact but there
     would be no overlapping in law. The subject matter of
     two taxes by reference to the two Lists is different.
     Simply because the methodology or mechanism adopted





     for assessment and quantification is similar, the two
     taxes cannot be said to be overlapping. This is the
     distinction between the subject of a tax and the measure
     of a tax.

     mechanism and method chosen by Legislature for




                                  
     quantification of tax is not decisive of the nature of tax

     subject to the provisions of List I with respect to
     regulation and development under the control of the
     Union. Entries 52 and 54 of List I are both qualified by




                                             
     the expression "declared by Parliament by law to be
     expedient in the public interest". A reading in
     juxtaposition shows that the declaration by Parliament




                                 
     must be for the 'control of industries' in Entry 52 and
                  
     'for regulation of mines or for mineral development' in
     Entry 54. Such control, regulation or development must
                 
     be 'expedient in the public interest'. Legislation by the
     Union in the field covered by Entries 52 and 54 would
     not like a magic touch or a taboo denude the entire
      


     field forming subject matter of declaration to the State
   



     Legislatures. Denial to the State would extend only to
     the extent of the declaration so made by Parliament. In
     spite of declaration made by reference to Entry 52 or





     54, the State would be free to act in the field left out
     from the declaration. The legislative power to tax by
     reference to Entries in List II is plenary unless the entry





     itself makes the field 'subject to' any other entry or
     abstracts the field by any limitations imposable and
     permissible. A tax or fee levied by State with the object
     of augmenting its finances and in reasonable limits does
     not ipso facto trench upon regulation, development or
     control of the subject. It is different if the tax or fee
     sought to be levied by State can itself be called

     only to such subjects as are not included in Entries 45
     to 63 of List II. It follows that taxes on lands and

     Union. Taxes on mineral rights, a subject in Entry 50 of
   



     List II can also not be levied by the union though as

     limitations, if any, imposed by the Parliament by law

     mineral rights is with the States; the power to lay down
     limitations on exercise of such power, in the interest of
     regulation, development or control, as the case may be,
     is with the Union. This is the result achieved by
     homogeneous reading of Entry 50 in List II and Entries

<p id="p_139">     Taxes on mineral rights lie within the legislative
     competence of the State Legislature "subject to" any
     limitation imposed by Parliament by law relating to




                                  
     mineral development. The Central legislation has not
                  
     placed any limitation on the power of the States to
     legislate in the field of taxation on mineral rights. The
                 
     challenge to constitutional validity of State legislation is
     founded on non-availability of legislative field to State;
     it has not been the case of any of the writ petitioners
      


     that there are limitations enacted by Central legislation
   



     and the State of West Bengal has breached or crossed
     those limits. Simply because incidence of tax is capable
     of being passed on to buyers or consumers by the mine





     owners with an escalating effect on the price of the coal,
     it cannot be inferred that the tax has an adverse effect
     on mineral development. Entry 23 in List II speaks of





     regulation of mines and mineral developments, subject
     to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and
     development under the control of the Union. The
     Central Legislation has taken over regulation and
     development of mines and mineral development in
     public interest. By reference to Entry 50 of List II and

    record. Form "K" on which Petitioner WCL has placed reliance is model




                                                       
    form of mining lease prescribed by rule 31 of the Mineral Concession

    Rules 1960. These rules are framed under the Act no.67 of 1957 and by




                                                      
    virtue of <a href="/doc/802052/" id="a_242">Section 13</a> thereof. Said <a href="/doc/802052/" id="a_243">Section 13</a> enables Central Government

    to make rules for regulating the grant of mining leases by notification in




                                            
    Official Gazette. Petitioner WCL has specifically argued that it has not
                              
    received any lands under <a href="/doc/1732167/" id="a_244">Section 10</a> (2) or <a href="/doc/155306/" id="a_245">Section 11</a> (2) of Coal Bearing
                             
    Act as no rights under mining leases were acquired under that Act by

    Central Government.     It is therefore apparent that form "K" has no

    relevance insofar as lands coming to W. C. L. under Coal Bearing Act are
           


    concerned. First clause/paragraph of part VII which deals with the
        



    covenants of lessee in form "K" obliges Lessee to pay rent, water rate

    royalties, taxes, rates, assessments and impositions whatsoever being in





    the nature of public demand, except the land revenue. It is not in dispute

    before me that non-agricultural tax is land revenue and because of this





    paragraph "1" WCL states that it is exempt from paying non-agricultural

    tax to State Government. However, in none of the petitions there is

    specific assertion that WCL is lessee in relation to a particular land for

    which non-agricultural tax demand has been made from it. In spite of

    contention that lease agreements existed between earlier owners of Coal

    mines and State Government before nationalization. During arguments,




                                                        
    form "K" was sought to be relied upon with <a href="/doc/708418/" id="a_246">Section 5</a> (2) of <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_247">Nationalisation

    Act</a> to point out that WCL is lessee of State Government. It is clear that




                                             
    demand of amount of non-agricultural tax in relation to/of lands acquired

    negotiations has not been even attempted to be connected with said form

    "K". In relation to remaining lands received by it under Coal Bearing Act

    the only argument was that Central Government continues to be its owner
           


    and said lands do not vest in W. C. L. Hence, the fact that remaining
        



    lands with WCL i.e.      purchased     directly, acquired by it by paying

    compensation via <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_249">Land Acquisition Act</a>, Coal Bearing Act given to it
