(Annexure-8A and 8B) and on 03.01.2020 (Annexure-9A, 9B and

9C to the writ petition). When the petitioner was preparing for

causing the supply according to the said orders, he had suddenly

received a show cause notice from the respondent No.3 (the

Executive    Engineer, RD Santirbazar          Division) on 10.01.2020

(Annexure-15 to the writ petition) by which it was observed that

the   rate   of   the   bricks   for   financial   year   2019-2020   was

the said show cause notice dated 10.01.2020. It has been further

observed in the said show cause notice, the petitioner was found

only formal bidder. After scrutiny, further action, as noted was

taken.

certificate   for   consent   to   operate    was,   on   having   reliable

information, verified by the tendering scrutiny committee, it had

been found that the said certificate was invalid for the relevant

period. In view of invalidity of the environmental certificate,

submitted along with the tender documents and the confirmation

received in this regard from the TSPCB under their letter dated

06.01.2020, the tendering authority has observed that it is clear

that the petitioner had suppressed the fact of invalidity of the

certificate for consent to operate. It has also been observed in that

show cause notice dated 10.01.2020 that the said certificate for

consent to operate was issued on 23.06.2016 with validity up to

18.06.2026 by the letter dated 23.06.2016. However, the said

certificate was subsequently reviewed by the TSPCB and the said

Board considered its validity for one year and accordingly the said

certificate dated 23.06.2016 was valid up to 18.06.2017. In this

context, the Pollution Control Board had issued a letter dated

05.02.2016. The petitioner has never challenged that reduction. On
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                           Page 12 of 32</span>

the contrary, he had complied all directions in terms of the new

categorization.

authority that the petitioner was running a manufacturing unit of

bricks without a valid certificate for consent to operate since

19.06.2017. Hence, the TSPCB issued the closure notice dated

08.07.2019 and the said notice was published in the various

newspapers including the Dainik Sambad and Syandan Patrika on

16.06.2019 and 17.06.2019 respectively. Subsequently, the SDM,

Belonia had also issued a show cause notice on 30.07.2019.

Subsequently, the TSPCB had reissued the certificate for consent to

operate dated 22.11.2019 valid till 21.11.2029 in favour of the

petitioner, M/S Maa Kali Bricks Industry, NBC Nagar, Belonia,

South Tripura.

<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">13.         According to the tendering authority, the petitioner had

suppressed that it did not have the valid certificate for consent to

operate during the relevant period with mala fide intention. Thus,

the petitioner had violated the essence of the contract by

suppressing the relevant fact required by the General Terms and

Conditions of the DNIe-T. The petitioner was asked to explain why

the punitive action shall not be taken against him by barring his

participation in future tenders for next two years invoking the

condition under clause 29 of the tender. By the show cause notice,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                            Page 13 of 32</span>

the petitioner was asked to explain why its tender will not be

(Anenxure-16 to the writ petition) and stated inter alia, that the

'pollution clearance certificate' from the TSPCB, Gurkhabasti,

Agartala was required to be submitted with the tender. The

petitioner had submitted the respective certificate with the tender

which was on scrutiny found fit. Moreover, there is no provision for

submitting any environmental clearance certificate in the respective

DNIT, but in this regard, the petitioner has contended that the valid

documents    of   environmental   clearance   from   the   concerned

authority were submitted. There had been no suppression of

material facts according to the petitioner as it had submitted in the

reply that no such clause that the environmental clearance

certificate was to be uploaded in the tender form, it has been urged

for directing the respondents not to rescind the tender or declare

its tender as informal or to bar him from participating in the future

tenders for two years.

dated 23.06.2016 had expired and there had been no valid

certificate during the relevant period. Suppressing the fact relating

to validity of the certificate for consent to operate the petitioner

had breached the conditions and clause 29 of the General Terms

and Conditions of the DNIT. Hence, it was stated that the punitive

action would be initiated against the petitioner in accordance with

the DNIe-T.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">16.           The petitioner through one of its partners has further

stated that as per the norms of the DNIT it had obtained the

consent to operate from the respective authority w.e.f. 23.06.2016

to 18.03.2026, a copy of the said certificate was also sent to the

District Magistrate, South Tripura, the Director of Industries and

Commerce, Tripura, Labour Commissioner, Labour Department,

Tripura, SDM, Belonia, Block Development Officer, BC Nagar, South

Tripura, District Scientific Officer, DSTE, South Tripura, but, from

the publication in the daily newspapers the petitioner came to know

that the validity of the said certificate was cancelled without having

any basis. Even the petitioner was not informed by the respective

authority by any means. Moreover, the fees that was paid for long

ten years was not been refunded. Being aware of the development,

the   petitioner   had   approached   the   TSPCB   for   issuing   the

corrigendum deleting the name of the petitioner by the letter dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                              Page 15 of 32</span>

11.07.2019, but nothing had been communicated by them. As

such, there was no suppression of any material fact.


</p><p id="p_36">17.            The said communication dated 24.01.2020 (Annexure-

18 to the writ petition), as it appears, did not evoke any positive

response from the tendering authority and the tendering authority

issued the cancellation order dated 22.01.2020 (Anenxure-19 to

the writ petition). Along with that, they had issued a fresh NIeT

(Annexure-20 to the writ petition) on the same date with elaborate

instructions for the tenderers.

</p><p id="p_38">18.            The petitioner has enclosed the order dated 27.08.2019

as passed by this Court in a Public Interest Litigation being

WP(C)(PIL) No. 17 of 2019, but the relevance of the said order is

far-fetched.
</p>
<p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">19.            By the order dated 24.09.2019, subsequent to the

earlier order in the said PIL, the High Court had directed the brick

kiln owners to apply for obtaining necessary sanctions/permissions.

It was observed further that it shall be open for the authority(s)

concerned, including the regulator, i.e. State Pollution Control

Board, to issue necessary sanctions and permissions, be it in the

nature of provisional or otherwise, in accordance with law. It has

been categorically observed that such approvals can be afforded

only on receipt of the applications from 'the establishments' for

establishing fresh unit or running the existing units on payment of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                               Page 16 of 32</span>

costs, if not already deposited. Payment of costs means, the cost

that was imposed by this Court in the said Public Interest Litigation.


</p><p id="p_41">20.             By the other subsequent order dated 30.09.2019 the

earlier order was clarified that if the applications are made in

proper form, complete in all respects, the authority may consider

the same by relaxing the rules. By another order dated 03.10.2019

passed in the said PIL the consequential action as taken by the

authority has been noted. By the said order, the TSPCB was also

directed to take appropriate and expeditious action so that these

brick   kilns    can   be   made   functional   on   compliance   of   the

requirement of law. The other part of the order has no relation and

relevance with the present case.

<p id="p_42">
</p><p id="p_43">21.             Mr. Samarjit Bhattacharjee, learned counsel appearing

for the petitioner has submitted that the said order of cancellation

and issuance of the fresh NIe-T are grossly illegal and cannot be

sustained in law. According to him, the certificate for consent to

operate dated 23.06.2016 was valid up to 18.06.2026. But the

TSPCB compelled the petitioner to make a fresh application for

issuing consent to operate certificate. Having no other alternative,

the petitioner made such application and on 21.11.2019 the TSPCB

issued the consent to operate certificate valid till 21.11.2029 (See

Annexure-14 to the writ petition).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                           Page 17 of 32</span><p id="p_44">

</p><p id="p_45">22.         Mr. S Bhattacharjee, learned counsel for the petitioner

has further submitted that no question of suppression of facts can

arise in the context of the facts. Therefore, the punitive action as

proposed under Clause 29 of the General Terms and Conditions of

the DNIT is not sustainable and hence, is liable to be interfered

with as arbitrary, unreasonable and coercive in nature on depriving

the petitioner from complying the supply orders for making some

marginal benefits out of those. Mr. Bhattacharjee, learned counsel

has submitted that in the context, this Court will be inclined to

interfere with such action of the respondents.


</p><p id="p_46">23.         In support of his contention, Mr. Bhattacharjee, learned

cousenl has referred a decision of the Apex Court, Mansukhlal

Vithaldas Chauhan Vs. State of Gujarat reported in (1997) 7

SCC 622. Fundamentally, that was a case of sanction for

prosecution but Mr. Bhattacharjee, learned counsel has referred the

said decision in respect of the obligation of the authorities of the

state to act fairly. Unless that is done it has been observed by the

Apex Court, it would cause miscarriage of justice. It has been held

in Mansukhlal Vithaldas Chauhan (supra) that the obligation to

act fairly on the part of the administrative authorities was evolved

to ensure the rule of law and to prevent failure of justice. The

doctrine is complimentary to the principle of natural justice which

the quasi judicial authorities are bound to observe. It is true that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                             Page 18 of 32</span>

the distinction between a quasi judicial and administrative action

has become thin as pointed out by the Apex Court as far back as in

1970 in A.K. Kraipak Vs. Union of India reported in (1969) 2

SCC 262.
</p>
<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">24.           It has been further observed that even the extent of

judicial scrutiny/judicial review in the case of administrative action

cannot be larger than in the case of quasi-judicial action. If the

High Court cannot sit as an appellate authority over the decisions

and orders of quasi-judicial authorities it follows equally that it

cannot do so in the case of administrative authorities. In the matter

of administrative action, it is well known, more than one choice is

available to the administrative authorities, they have a certain

amount of discretion available to them. They have 'a right to

choose between more than one possible course of action upon

which there is room for reasonable people to hold differing opinions

as to which is to be preferred'. This observation has been made in

A.K. Kraipak (supra) having referred to the speech of Lord Diplock

in Secretary of State for Education and Science Vs. Tameside

Metropolitan Borough Council, (1976) 3 All ER 665. The court

cannot substitute its judgment for the judgment of administrative

authorities   in   such   cases.   Only     when   the   action   of   the

administrative authority is so unfair or unreasonable that no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                              Page 19 of 32</span>

reasonable person would have taken that action, can the court

intervene.

another decision of the Apex Court in Consortium of Titagarh

Firema Adler S.P.A.-Titagarh Wagons Ltd. Vs. Nagpur Metro

Rail Corporation Ltd., reported in (2017) 7 SCC 486 where the

Apex Court has observed, having referred to Consortium of

Titagarh     Firema    Adler    S.P.A.       Vs.   Nagpur   Metro   Rail

Corporation Ltd. reported in 2016 SCC Online Bom 14834 that

the decision making process of the Technical Evaluation Committee

has been guided by the relevant factors and it cannot be said that

they have not taken into consideration any of the relevant factors.

Hence, the decision of the Technical Evaluation Committee would

fall within the ambit of rationality.

<p id="p_51">
</p><p id="p_52">26.          In reply to the contention raised by Mr. Bhattacharjee,

learned counsel representing the petitioner, Mr. D Bhattacharjee,

learned GA has straightway submitted that the petitioner had

practiced fraud by presenting and uploading the certificate for

consent to operate dated 23.06.2016 (Annexure-3 to the writ

petition) which was amended much before the tendering period.

True it is that, initially the said certificate was made valid up to

18.06.2016. Even when the TSPCB had issued the closure notice,

as stated before, the petitioner was running the manufacturing unit
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                            Page 20 of 32</span>

of bricks without any valid certificate for consent to operate as the

earlier certificate dated 23.06.2016 was made valid till 18.06.2017

by the letter issued by the TSPCB on 20.12.2016. Therefore, it was

known to the petitioner that its certificate for consent to operate

was valid till 18.06.2017. The tender was floated on 17.06.2019

and closed on 08.07.2019. Thus, the certificate that was produced

and uploaded in the tender process was no more valid. In its place,

a new certificate was issued on 20.12.2016, but the petitioner has

deliberately suppressed that change of the tenure of the validity of

the certificate for consent to operate brought by the communication

dated 20.12.2016 from the tendering authority. The tendering

authority, on bona fide belief, cleared the tender of the petitioner

for two supplies but when the said fraud came to the notice of the

tendering authority, after giving due show cause notice, the

petitioner's tender was declared informal and the entire tendering

process was cancelled. Simultaneously, a new process was floated.


</p><p id="p_53">27.         The respondents No. 6, 7 &amp; 8 has filed an elaborate

affidavit. The respondent No.6, the Tripura State Pollution Control

Board is the authority to issue the certificate for consent to operate

for running a brick kiln. That certificate was issued on observing

the environmental clearance measures. In their affidavit, the

respondents No. 6, 7 &amp; 8 have stated that the certificate for

consent to operate was issued on 23.06.2016 initially with validity
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                           Page 21 of 32</span>

of 10 years but that was reviewed and the validity was granted for

one year meaning till 18.06.2017. It is evident that the unit was

operating during the period from 19.06.2017 to 21.11.2019

without obtaining the certificate for consent to operate from the

TSPCB. Only on 07.11.2019, the petitioner's unit had applied for

renewal of the consent to operate certificate. While issuing the

consent to establish and operate certificate in favour of the brick

kilns in Tripura, certain terms and conditions are imposed on the

manufacturers. One of which is submission of Environmental

Clearance (EC) Certificate. It has been so done as per the direction

of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) contained in the order dated

02.11.2016 delivered in OA No. 74/2015/EZ titled as Joydeep

Mukherjee Vs. Pollution Control Board and Anr.


</p><p id="p_54">28.        The respondents No. 6, 7 &amp; 8 have also admitted that

the certificate for consent to operate as issued on 22.11.2019 is

made valid till 21.11.2029. Since the petitioner was running the

brick kiln without the valid certificate for consent to operate, the

closure order was issued. They have stated in para 10 of their reply

that the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority

(SEIAA) notified by the Government of India is responsible for

issuance of the Environmental Clearance (EC) certificate. The unit

has obtained EC certificate from the Member Secretary, SEIAA.

</p><p id="p_55">29.         Mr. Ratan Datta, learned council appearing for the

respondents No. 6, 7 &amp; 8 has referred to the notification dated

28.05.2016 (Annexure-2 to their reply) where, in terms of the

modified direction under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1982 harmonization of classification of industrial sector in

red/orange/green/white categories has been made. In order to

bring uniformity in the classification across the country, the Central

Pollution Control Board issued direction regarding harmonization of

classification of industrial sector under red/orange/green and white

categories [See para 3 of the notification dated 28.05.2016]. As

stated, the four categories of the industries, operations, process

and activities have been dealt with by the said notification.


</p><p id="p_56">30.         Annexure-1 of the said notification has provided the list

of industries and their categories such as red, orange, green and

white. It appears that the brick fields (excluding the fly ash brick

manufacturing using lime process) fall under the orange category.

The orange categories of industries, process and operation of

activities would get renewal for consent to operate after every 10

years. Accordingly, when the certificate for consent to operate was

issued, it was issued for 10 years. Mr. Dutta, learned counsel has

stated that the fresh application was filed by the petitioner to have

the renewal certificate for consent to operate under the new
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                            Page 23 of 32</span>

categories on 14.01.2016 to the Member Secretary, Tripura State

Pollution Control Board and accordingly the earlier certificate dated

23.06.2016 was modified in terms of the new notification. In terms

of the said application the consent to operate was extended till

18.06.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_57">
</p><p id="p_58">31.           For this purpose, when the new notification came into

operation, the TSPCB by their letter dated 05.12.2016 informed the

petitioner that the Board will review all the certificates. It has also

been informed to the petitioner that the TSPCB had decided to

reconsider the validity of the consent certificate issued earlier for

one year (See the letter dated 05.12.2016 Annexure-5 to the reply

filed by the respondents No. 6,7 &amp; 8). But after the expiry of the

validity, which occurred on 18.06.2017, the petitioner did not apply

for the renewal but such application for renewal was made only on

07.11.2019 [see Annexure-6 to the reply filed by the respondents

No. 6, 7 &amp; 8] to the Member Secretary, TSPCB but the said unit of

the petitioner carried out operation illegally without any valid

certificate for consent to operate. That illegal operation invited the

closure in strict compliance of the order of the National Green

Tribunal which has been perused by this Court in a Public Interest

Litigation.

on Consortium of Titagarh Firema Adler S.P.A.-Titagarh

Wagons Ltd.(supra) to contend that the respondents have acted

fairly. In Consortium of Titagarh Firema Adler S.P.A.-Titagarh

Wagons Ltd. (supra), the Apex court has not only relied on Monte

Carlo Ltd. V. NTPC Ltd. reported in (2016) 15 SCC 272 but has

approvingly reproduced the following passage:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            30. ........ The two-Judge Bench took note of the fact
            that in Jagdish Mandal (supra) it has been held that, if
            the decision relating to award of contract is bona fide
            and is in public interest, courts will not, in exercise of
            power of judicial review, interfere even if a procedural
            aberration or error in assessment or prejudice to a
            tenderer, is made out. The decisions in <a href="/doc/1361651/" id="a_8">Master Marine
            Services (P) Ltd. v. Metcalfe &amp; Hodgkinson (P) Ltd.

            548 and Michigan Rubber (India) Ltd. (supra) have
            been referred to. The Court quoted a passage from
            Afcons Infrastructure Ltd. (supra) wherein the
            principle that interpretation placed to appreciate the
            tender requirements and to interpret the documents
            by owner or employer unless mala fide or perverse in
            understanding or appreciation is reflected, the
            constitutional Courts should not interfere. It has also
            been observed in the said case that it is possible that
            the owner or employer of a project may give an
            interpretation to the tender documents that is not
            acceptable to the constitutional Courts but that by
            itself is not a reason for interfering with the
            interpretation given. After referring to the said
            authority, it has been ruled thus:</blockquote><p id="p_63">

</p><p id="p_64">            "26. We respectfully concur with the aforesaid
            statement of law. We have reasons to do so. In the
            present scenario, tenders are floated and offers are
            invited for highly complex technical subjects. It
            requires understanding and appreciation of the nature
            of work and the purpose it is going to serve. It is
            common knowledge in the competitive commercial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                 Page 25 of 32</span>

field that technical bids pursuant to the notice inviting
tenders are scrutinized by the technical experts and
sometimes      third  party   assistance   from    those
unconnected with the owner's organization is taken.
This ensures objectivity. Bidder's expertise and
technical capability and capacity must be assessed by
the experts. In the matters of financial assessment,
consultants are appointed. It is because to check and
ascertain that technical ability and the financial
feasibility have sanguinity and are workable and
realistic. There is a multi-prong complex approach;
highly technical in nature. The tenders where public
largesse is put to auction stand on a different
compartment. Tender with which we are concerned, is
not comparable to any scheme for allotment. This
arena which we have referred requires technical
expertise. Parameters applied are different. Its aim is
to achieve high degree of perfection in execution and
adherence to the time schedule. But, that does not
mean, these tenders will escape scrutiny of judicial
review. Exercise of power of judicial review would be
called for if the approach is arbitrary or malafide or
procedure adopted is meant to favour one. The
decision making process should clearly show that the
said maladies are kept at bay. But where a decision is
taken that is manifestly in consonance with the
language of the tender document or subserves the
purpose for which the tender is floated, the court
should follow the principle of restraint. Technical
evaluation or comparison by the court would be
impermissible. The principle that is applied to scan
and understand an ordinary instrument relatable to
contract in other spheres has to be treated differently
than interpreting and appreciating tender documents
relating to technical works and projects requiring
special skills. The owner should be allowed to carry
out the purpose and there has to be allowance of free
play in the joints."

Corporation Ltd. v. CSEPDI-Trishe Consortium</a>, (2017)
4 SCC 318, the Court, after referring to Jagdish Mandal

</p>
<p id="p_66">"36. ... At this juncture we are obliged to say that in a
complex fiscal evaluation the Court has to apply the
doctrine of restraint. Several aspects, clauses,
contingencies, etc. have to be factored. These
calculations are best left to experts and those who
have knowledge and skills in the field. The financial
computation involved, the capacity and efficiency of
the bidder and the perception of feasibility of
completion of the project have to be left to the wisdom
of the financial experts and consultants. The courts
cannot really enter into the said realm in exercise of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                 Page 26 of 32</span>

it is neither ex facie erroneous nor can we perceive as

<p id="p_70">"58. ... In the instant case, we are unable to perceive
any arbitrariness or favouritism or exercise of power
for any collateral purpose in the NIA. In the absence
of the same, to exercise the power of judicial review is
not warranted. In the case at hand, we think, it is a
prudent decision once there is increase of revenue and
expansion of the range of service."
</p>
<p id="p_71">And again:
</p>
<p id="p_72">"59. It needs to be stressed that in the matters
relating to complex auction procedure having
enormous financial ramification, interference by the
Courts based upon any perception which is thought to
be wise or assumed to be fair can lead to a situation
which is not warrantable and may have unforeseen
adverse impact. It may have the effect potentiality of
creating a situation of fiscal imbalance. In our view,
interference in such auction should be on the ground
of stricter scrutiny when the decision making process
commencing from NIA till the end smacks of
obnoxious      arbitrariness   or    any    extraneous
consideration which is perceivable."

<p id="p_73">33. The learned counsel for the appellants invited our
attention to the authority in <a href="/doc/55804/" id="a_13">W.B. State Electricity
Board v. Patel Engineering Co. Ltd</a>. (2001) 2 SCC 451
wherein it has been ruled:

           this nature and magnitude where bidders who fulfil
           prequalification alone are invited to bid, adherence to
           the instructions cannot be given a go-by by branding it
           as a pedantic approach, otherwise it will encourage
           and provide scope for discrimination, arbitrariness and
           favouritism which are totally opposed to the rule of
           law and our constitutional values. The very purpose of
           issuing    rules/instructions    is   to   ensure    their
           enforcement lest the rule of law should be a casualty.
           Relaxation or waiver of a rule or condition, unless so
           provided under the ITB, by the State or its agencies
           (the appellant) in favour of one bidder would create
           justifiable doubts in the minds of other bidders, would
           impair the rule of transparency and fairness and
           provide room for manipulation to suit the whims of the
           State agencies in picking and choosing a bidder for
           awarding contracts as in the case of distributing
           bounty or charity. In our view such approach should
           always be avoided. Where power to relax or waive a
           rule or a condition exists under the rules, it has to be
           done strictly in compliance with the rules. We have,
           therefore, no hesitation in concluding that adherence
           to the ITB or rules is the best principle to be followed,
           which is also in the best public interest.

per the Delegation of Financial Powers Rules, Tripura, 2017 the

Head of Department shall be competent to accept the tender

recommended by the Lower Purchase Committee and the Secretary

of the Department shall be competent to accept the tenders
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                              Page 28 of 32</span>

recommended by the Higher Purchase Committee while the Minster

In-charge of the Department shall be competent to accept the

tenders recommended by the Departmental Purchase Committee.

(See rule 9). In the present exercise, no such acceptance is

available in the records. Therefore, in the legal terms, the supply

orders were informal in nature. Even the petitioner has not supplied

a single brick to any project for which the supply orders were

contemplated.

<p id="p_78">
</p><p id="p_79">35.         Mr. A Bhowmik, learned counsel for the respondent

No.9 has relied on Ramana Dayaram Shetty Vs. International

Airport Authority of India and Ors, reported in (1979) 3 SCC

489 to contend that the standard of eligibility held out in the notice

inviting tender cannot be departed arbitrarily. The tendering

authority is under obligation to act according to the adverted

conditions of the tenders.
</p>
<p id="p_80">
</p><p id="p_81">36.         In Ramana Dayaram Shetty (supra) the Apex Court

has further observed that it has been clearly stated that the

constitutional mandate of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_14">Article 14</a> as well as the judicially evolved

rule of administrative law herald that the authority is not entitled to

act arbitrarily in accepting the tender but the authority is bound to

conform to the standard or norm laid down in the notice inviting

tender. According to Mr. Bhowmik, since the petitioner was lacking

in one of the conditions as aforesaid, the tendering authority did
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                            Page 29 of 32</span>

not have any power to accept such tender. On revelation of the

'fraud' as exercised by the petitioner, the tendering authority has

rightly declared the tender informal and consequentially cancelled

the entire process as there was no other formal tenderer.


</p><p id="p_82">37.         On a similar point, he has referred Ram Gajadhar

Nishad Vs. State of UP &amp; Ors, reported in (1998) 2 SCC 486.


</p><p id="p_83">38.         Mr. Bhowmik has quite emphatically submitted that

suppression is a vice. It not only creates fraud, but it as well

pollutes the clear stream of justice. In this regard, he has referred

Kishore Samrite Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors., reported in

(2013) 2 SCC 398 where the Apex Court had observed that

whoever approached the constitutional courts with unclean hands,

without disclosing complete facts and misusing the judicial process,

exemplary action shall be taken against him. In Kishore Samrite

(supra) the Apex Court has not only dismissed the writ petition but

imposed the exemplary cost of Rs.5,00,000/- for abuse of process

of the court.
</p>
<p id="p_84">
</p><p id="p_85">39.         Having appreciated the rival contentions of the learned

counsel for the parties, this Court finds that the petitioner has

deliberately suppressed the decision of the TSPCB as reflected in

their communication dated 05.12.2016 (Annexure 5 to the reply

filed by the respondents No.6, 7 &amp; 8) that on reconsideration, the

validity of the consent certificate has been reduced to one year.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                               Page 30 of 32</span>

Despite knowledge of such development, the petitioner had

produced the certificate dated 23.06.2016 which showed that the

certificate of consent to operate was valid till 18.06.2026 whereas

by    the   decision   as   reflected    in   the   communication      dated

05.12.2016 the period of validity was reduced to 18.06.2017.


</p><p id="p_86">40.           The petitioner was well aware that he had no valid

certificate of consent to operate, to produce the same as the

Pollution Clearance Certificate. It may be noted that the said

certificate was accepted as the Pollution Clearance Certificate. Even

now,    the   respondents    have       shown   any   exception   to   such

acceptance. However, the first pollution clearance certificate was

issued on 17.10.2019 (Annexure-10 to the reply filed by the

respondents No. 6, 7 &amp; 8). Despite that he placed the said

certificate for consent to operate dated 23.06.2016 (Anenxure-4 to

the writ petition) for consideration. This is a deliberate act of

suppression of material facts and not less than exercising fraud.

The tendering authority (the respondent No. 3) having exposed to

the said fraud had taken immediate action by issuing show cause

notice dated 10.01.2020 (Annexure-15 to the writ petition) and

having considered the reply of the show cause, the decision of the

tendering authority was communicated to the petitioner by the

letter dated 21.01.2020 (Annexure 17 to the writ petition). The

further explanation of the petitioner dated 24.01.2020 was of no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                            Page 31 of 32</span>

utility for any purpose. In this regard, the court may take notice

that by DNIe-T dated 17.06.2019 valid and attested 'pollution

clearance certificate from Tripura State Pollution Control Board,

Gurkhabasti, Agartala, West Tripura' was directed to be uploaded.

Hence, the contention of Mr. Bhattacharjee, learned counsel should

be discarded and is discarded.
</p>
<p id="p_87">
</p><p id="p_88">41.         Accordingly, this Court does not find any infirmity in the

action taken by the respondent No.3. But this Court is unable to

accept the submission of Mr. Bhattacharjee, learned GA that there

was no acceptance by the competent authority as per rule 9 of

Delegation of Financial Powers Rules, Tripura, 2017 inasmuch as

the supply orders issued the respondent No.3 are annexed with the

writ petition. If it is such that the supply orders were issued without

compliance of Rule 9 the department may necessary inquiry.


</p><p id="p_89">42.         The petitioner has again indulged to abuse the process

of the court on the basis of the said certificate dated 23.06.2016

(Annexure-3 to the writ petition) by filing this writ petition without

any reference to the reduction of tenure of validity. Having regard
