          that petitioners are innocent persons and have been
          falsely implicated in the alleged crime. The learned
          counsel for the petitioners by referring the order passed
          by the learned court below pointed out that the learned
          court below has taken note of the submissions made by
          the petitioners with regard to       applicability of relevant
          provisions and the decisions rendered by the Hon'ble
          Apex Court that special law shall prevail        over general
          law. Thus despite discussing prevailing position         of law
          the learned court below did not pass orders in favour of
          the petitioner According to the learned counsel for the
 petitioners, the petitioners are not connected in any
manner with the alleged crime. However, they have been
falsely implicated in the alleged crime with a view to
harass them by misusing and abusing the process of
law .It is further submitted that present petitioners are
law abiding citizens and        are ready and willing to
cooperate in the investigation of the case and           shall
abide by the terms and conditions that may be imposed
by this court and therefore, the petitioners may be
granted anticipatory bail.

made in the FIR and also considering the gravity of the
offence   present   petitioners     may   not   be   granted
anticipatory bail. Learned A.P.P. further submitted that

bail is also rejected by the learned court below. It is also
submitted that anticipatory bail filed by the co-accused
persons in similar case has been rejected by this court.

and having regard to the facts and circumstances of the
present application and also prima facie looking to the
nature and gravity of the accusation against the present
petitioners in light of observation made by the learned
court below while describing the prevailing legal position
in view of decision      rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme
