 BEFORE THE MADURAI BENCH OF MADRAS HIGH COURT

DATED : 11/03/2009

Coram
The HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE K.K.SASIDHARAN

W.P.(MD)No.1773 of 2009
and
M.P.(MD)No.1 of 2009

A.Moses				... Petitioner

vs.

The Branch Manager,
ICICI Bank,
Tirunelveli.				... Respondent

PRAYER

Writ Petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India
praying for the issue of a Writ of Mandamus, forbearing the respondent or his
men or his agent from seizing the vehicle bearing Registration No.TN-76-C-7683.

!For Petitioner	... Mr.A.Moses
		    Party-in-person
^
				    ******

:ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">*****
		Though the Writ Petition is for a Writ of Mandamus forbearing the
respondent from seizing the hypothecated vehicle, the main grievance of the
petitioner is in respect of the alleged illegal action taken by the respondent
to take possession of the vehicle by deputing musclemen.
</p>
<p id="p_2">		2. Factual matrix:-
</p><p id="p_3">			The petitioner has taken financial assistance from the
respondent bank to the tune of Rs.11,40,000/- for the purpose of purchasing a
lorry and with the said loan, he purchased a lorry and the same was assigned the
registration mark, 'TN-76-C-7683 and the factum of hypothecation has also been
indicated in the Registration Certificate. As per the terms and conditions of
the agreement, the petitioner has to pay the loan amount in 47 monthly
installments at the rate of Rs.32,078/- and for the period from 05.09.2007 to
05.07.2011. The petitioner has regularly paid the installments and the
satisfactory way of making payment is also evident by the accounts statement
issued by the respondent for the period from 30.07.2007 to 08.12.2008.  The
lorry purchased by the petitioner was engaged in the business of transporting
sand from the State of Tamil Nadu to other States and on account of the order
passed by the Government of Tamil Nadu prohibiting transportation of sand to any
place outside Tamil Nadu, the  transport business of the petitioner was affected
and as a result, he was not in a position to pay the dues with effect from
January 2009. The petitioner met the Branch  Manager of the respondent and
requested to grant few months time to clear the arrears. However, to the
surprise of the petitioner, the respondent sent Goondas to his residence on
18.02.2009 and 03.03.2009 and abused his wife in filthy language and threatened
that they would take away the lorry and ransack the house, in case the dues were
not cleared. Therefore, the petitioner apprehends that the vehicle would be
seized by the respondent without following the procedure and as such, he has
come up with the present Writ Petition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">		3. MAINTAINABILITY OF WRIT PETITION:-
</p>
<p id="p_5">	 	The respondent is a private bank doing banking business and without
any duty of public nature and as such, the bank is not amenable to the writ
jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. The terms and
conditions of the agreement entered into between the petitioner and the bank
governs the matter and as such, this Court, exercising writ jurisdiction under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, cannot alter or vary such terms and
conditions. In case the agreement contains a provision that the bank is entitled
to seize the vehicle on account of the default committed by the petitioner, no
Mandamus could be issued to forbear the respondent from seizing the vehicle. The
bank as well as the customer is bound by the terms of contract. This Court
cannot re-write the terms of contract for the parties and jurisdiction under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is not intended for such purposes.
</p>

<p id="p_6">		4. The composition of a banking company and its nature of working
was considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_5">Federal Bank Ltd. v. Sagar Thomas
&amp; Ors</a>. reported in JT 2003(Suppl.1) SC 470, wherein it was held thus:-
</p><p id="p_7">			"40.....................
</p><p id="p_8">	But in the present case we are concerned with a banking company which has
its own resources to raise its funds without any contribution or shareholding by
the State. It has its own Board of Directors elected by it share-holders. It
works like any other private company in the banking business having no monopoly
status at all. Any company carrying on banking business with a capital of five
lacs will become a scheduled bank. All the same, banking activity as a whole
carried on by various banks undoubtedly has an impact and effect on the economy
of the country in general. Money of the shareholders and the depositors is with
such companies, carrying on banking activity. The banks finance the borrowers on
any given rate of interest at a particular time. They advance loans as against
securities. Therefore, it is obviously necessary to have regulatory check over
such activities in the interest of the company itself, the shareholders, the
depositors as well as to maintain the proper financial equilibrium of the
national economy. The banking companies have not been set up for the purposes of
building economy of the State on the other hand such private companies have been
voluntarily established for their own purposes and interest but their activities
are kept under check so that their activities may not go wayward and harm the
economy in general. A private banking company with all freedom that it has, has
to act in a manner that it may not be in conflict with or against the fiscal
policies of the State and for such purposes, guidelines are provided by the
Reserve Bank so that a proper fiscal discipline, to conduct its affairs in
carrying on its business, is maintained. So as to ensure adherence to such
fiscal discipline, if need be, at times even the management of the company can
be taken over. Nonetheless, as observed earlier, these are all regulatory
measures to keep a check and provide guideline and not a participatory dominance
or control over the affairs of the company. For other companies in general
carrying on other business activities may be manufacturing, other industries or
any business, such checks are provided under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_6">Companies
Act</a>, as indicated earlier. There also, the main consideration is that the
company itself may not sink because of its own mismanagement or the interest of
the shareholders or people generally may not be jeopardized for that reason.
Besides taking care of such interest as indicated above, there is no other
interest of the State, to control the affairs and management of the private
companies. The care is taken in record to the industries covered under the
industries (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_7">Regulation) Act</a>, 1951 that their production which is
important for the economy may not go down yet the business activity is carried
on by such companies or corporations which only remains a private activity of
the entrepreneurs/companies."
</p>
<p id="p_9">		5. The question as to whether a private bank is amenable to writ
jurisdiction was also considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the Federal
Bank Ltd's case and it was held thus:-
</p><p id="p_10">		"41. Such private companies would normally not be amenable to the
writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. But in certain
circumstances a writ may issue to such private bodies or persons as there may be
statutes which need to be complied with by all concerned including the private
companies. For example, there are certain legislations like the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_9">Industrial
Disputes Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_10">Minimum Wages Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_11">Factories Act</a> or for maintaining proper
environment say Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 or Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 etc. or statutes of the like
nature which fasten certain duties and responsibilities statutorily upon such
private bodies which they are bound to comply with. If they violate such a
statutory provision a writ would certainly be issued for compliance of those
provisions. For instance, if a private employer dispense with the service of its
employee in violation of the provisions contained under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_14">Industrial Disputes
Act</a>, in innumerable cases the High Court interfered and have issued the writ to
the private bodies and the companies in that regard. But the difficulty in
issuing a writ may arise where there may not be any non-compliance or violation
of any statutory provision by the private body. In that event a writ may not be
issued at all. Other remedies, as may be available, may have to be resorted to."
</p>

<p id="p_11">	42......
</p><p id="p_12">	43......
</p><p id="p_13">	44......
</p><p id="p_14">	45......
</p><p id="p_15">	46.Merely because the Reserve Bank of India lays the banking policy in the
interest of the banking system or in the interest of monetary stability or sound
economic growth having due regard to the interests of the depositors etc. as
provided under <a href="/doc/216565/" id="a_15">Section 5(c)(a)</a> of the Banking Regulation Act does not mean that
the private companies carrying on the business of or commercial activity of
banking, discharge any public function or public duty. These are all regulatory
measures applicable to those carrying on commercial activity in banking and
these companies are to act according to these provisions failing which certain
consequences follow as indicated in the Act itself. Provision regarding
acquisition of a banking company by the government, it may be pointed out that
any private property can be acquired by the government in public interest. It is
now judicially accepted norm that private interest has to give way to the public
interest. If a private property is acquired in public interest it does not mean
that the party whose property is acquired is performing or discharging any
function or duty of public character though it would be so for acquiring
authority."
</p>
<p id="p_16">		6. The question as to whether ICICI bank would come within the
meaning of "other authorities" as defined under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_16">Article 12</a> of the Constitution
of India was considered by the Division Bench of our High Court in ICICI Bank
Ltd. Vs. Lakshminarayanan [2008 (3) LLN 320] and after considering the matter in
extenso, the Division Bench held that the writ petition is not maintainable
against ICICI bank. The said judgment was followed by another Division Bench in
W.A.No.480 of 2007 (<a href="/doc/977238/" id="a_17">S.Sundaram and others v. ICICI Bank Ltd and another</a>,
judgment dated 09.02.2009), wherein it was clearly held that ICICI bank would
not come within the purview of  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_18">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_17">		7. Even though this Court cannot interfere in the realm of contract
entered into between the petitioner and the respondent bank, still the bank
cannot be heard to say that they are entitled to proceed against the petitioner
without resorting to the procedure recognized by law. The respondent bank is
bound to act as per the directions and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of
India from time to time. The practice adopted by the respondent bank in hiring
recovery agents and deputing musclemen to seize the vehicles were deprecated by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/819703/" id="a_19">ICICI Bank Ltd. v. Prakash Kaur</a> reported in 2007(2)
SCC 711. While supplementing the judgment delivered by His Lordship Mr.Justice
ALTAMAS KABIR, His Lordship Mr.Justice AR.LAKSHMANAN was pleased to indicate
certain factors, which were prevailing in the banking industry in the matter of
recovery. The factors so indicated would run thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_18">	"* Now the bank is the aggressor and the public is the victim. The first
step to recovery of the money due is through the so-called recovery/collection
agents. A very dignified term used for paid recovery agents who are individual
and independent contractors hired by the banks both to trace the defaulters and
to physically, mentally and emotionally torture and force them into submitting
their dues.
</p><p id="p_19">	* A man's self-respect, stature in society are all immaterial to the agent
who is only primed at recovery. This is the modernised version of Shylock's
pound of flesh. No explanation is given regarding the interest charge and the
bank takes cover under the guise of the holder of the card or loan having signed
the agreement whose fine print is never read or explained to the owner.
	* When a harassed man approaches the court or the police station he is not
armed with a recording phone and finds it difficult to give evidence of the
abuse he has suffered. Here the bank gets away with everything. Young and old
members of the family are threatened on streets, institutions and also at home
at godforsaken hours by these agents who have the full support of their
contractor bank. The stance taken by the bank in any suit alleging such
incidents is that no such agent has been appointed by them or their agents do
not misbehave in the manner aforesaid and if found guilty the agents have to
bear the cross and the bank gets away scot-free.
</p><p id="p_20">	* Using of the abusive language for recovery is the norm of the day for
most nationalised or multinational banks or non-nationalised banks.  Though some
are smart enough to record the abuse and proceed to establish the same through
the court of law, most of them are unfortunate not to have recourse to it. Such
people form the majority and such litigations are pending in large volumes
before the civil and consumer courts. Again the banks escape liability since
these agents are not salaried employees of the bank and hence not directly
liable for anything."
</p>
<p id="p_21">		8. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Prakash Kaur's case strongly
deprecated the practice of the respondent bank in removing the vehicle from the
possession of the debtor by hiring recovery agents in the following words:-
	"16. Before we part with this matter, we wish to make it clear that we do
not appreciate the procedure adopted by the Bank in removing the vehicle form
the possession of the writ petitioner. The practice of hiring recovery agents,
who are musclemen, is deprecated and needs to be discouraged. The Bank should
resort to procedure recognized by law to take possession of vehicles in cases
where the borrower may have committed default in payment of the installments
instead of taking resort to strong-arm tactics."
</p><p id="p_22">		9. The respondent bank being the appellant in the Prakash Kaur's
case cited supra, must take note of the strong observation made by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the matter of recovery, while taking steps to proceed against
the hypothecated vehicle involved in the present writ petition and their action
should be in accordance with the contract entered into between the parties and
it should also be in accordance with the procedure recognized by law.
</p>
<p id="p_23">		10. It is needless to mention that recovery through musclemen giving
them the title "Recovery Agents" is not permitted by law.
</p>
<p id="p_24">		11. The Writ Petition is disposed of, subject to the above
observation. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition is closed. There
shall be no order as to costs.
