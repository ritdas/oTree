ORAL
ORDER</pre> 

 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_1">Though
	served, no one appears for respondents nos.2 and 3.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_2">The
	challenge in this application filed by the applicant-Gujarat
	Pollution Control Board (for short  the Board ) is the order
	dated 29.08.2007 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, First
	Class, Jetpur below Exh.65 in Criminal case No.615 of 1993 by which
	application of the respondents Nos.2 and 3 for recalling witnesses
	came to be allowed at a very belated stage without recording any
	satisfaction.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_3">Learned
	counsel for the applicant submits that even as per the application
	submitted by the accused-applicant, the grounds for recalling
	witnesses was only the change of advocate and on earlier occasion
	when cross-examination took place, certain relevant questions of law
	and facts were not raised.  According to learned counsel for th
	applicant, same is not germane to exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1780550/" id="a_1">Section
	311</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure and no doubt a witness can be
	recalled at any stage if the court is satisfied that the same was
	not essential or needed for just decision in the case.  But in the
	present case, no sufficient ground or satisfaction was recorded by
	the learned Magistrate to recall the witnesses as prayed for by the
	respondents No.2 and 3 and particularly an opportunity was already
	given to cross-examine and final arguments were already submitted by
	the parties.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_4">Having
	heard learned counsel for the applicant and considering the facts
	and circumstances of the case and order passed by learned
	Magistrate, what transpires is that no satisfaction is recorded by
	the learned Magistrate for exercising powers under <a href="/doc/1780550/" id="a_2">Section 311</a> of
	the Code inasmuch as though objection was raised by the applicant
	herein by filing objection at Exh.66 and in view of the reliance
	placed on the decision of the High Court of Orissa in the case of
	<a href="/doc/175943/" id="a_3">Thomas Kujur v. Republic of India</a> reported in 2007(2) Crimes 188
	Orissa, above aspect is not considered at all.  It was specifically
	submitted that so far as two witnesses viz. Jayesh Devkaran Kalyan
	and Janardan Balakrishna Dave are concerned, they were
	cross-examined vide Exhs.51 and 52 as early as in July and
	September, 2005.  Not only that but further statement of the
	accused was also recorded on 01.10.2005.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_5">In
	view of the above, it cannot be said that there was a satisfaction
	on the part of the learned Magistrate to exercise power under
	<a href="/doc/1780550/" id="a_4">Section 311</a> of the Code.  The order impugned is de void of any merit
	much less any justification and deserves to be quashed and set
	aside.  Accordingly, this application is allowed and order dated
	29.08.2007 passed by the learned J.M.F.C., Jetpur below Exh.65 in
	Criminal Case No.615/93 is hereby quashed and set aside.  Rule is
	made absolute to the aforesaid extent only.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_6">Before
	parting, this Court has passed order on 28.01.2009 encompassing
	negligence of the applicant-Board and its officers to pursue
	criminal cases filed under the provisions of Gujarat Water
	(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.  In view of the
	detailed affidavit filed by the concerned advocate,  I deem it just
	and proper not to take any action against officers of the Board, at
	this stage.
</p>
