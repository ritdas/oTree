               Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.4082 (M/S) of 2010

PNC Infratech Limited                                     ..........Petitioner
                                     Versus
State of Uttar Pradesh and others                         ......Opposite parties


Hon'ble S.S. Chauhan, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">         Heard Sri S.M.K. Chaudhary, Senior Advocate, assisted by Sri
Vaibhav Pandey, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri V.S. Tripathi,
learned Addl. Chief Standing Counsel for the State as well as Sri K.D. Nag,
learned counsel for the Airport Authority of India.
</p><p id="p_2">         The petitioner, who happens to be a contractor has come forward to
challenge the levy of cess under the Building and Other Construction
Workers' <a href="/doc/1491333/" id="a_1">Welfare Cess Act</a>, 1996 (for short "Act No.28 of 1996") and the
Rules framed thereunder known as the Building and Other Construction
Workers' Welfare Cess Rules, 1998 (for short "the Cess Rules, 1998").
</p><p id="p_3">         Submission of learned counsel for the petitioner is that the petitioner,
who has engaged itself in the contract work with the Airport Authority of
India for extension and strengthening of construction of new taxiway at
Lucknow Airport cannot be subjected to the aforesaid charge of cess as
contemplated under Act No.28 of 1996 as the petitioner is not covered within
the definition clause and cess if any has to be imposed, then it cannot be
imposed in respect of construction work which has not to take place with the
approval of the local authority. To substantiate his argument reliance has
been placed by the learned counsel for the petitioner on <a href="/doc/1030703/" id="a_2">Section 3</a> of Act
No.28 of 1996.       It has also been submitted that the Cess Rules, 1998
contemplate that definition of establishment does not include the Airport
Authority and therefore, the petitioner cannot be subjected to cess in respect
of a contract which is being carried on by it with the Airport Authority of
India.
</p><p id="p_4">         Learned Addl. Chief Standing Counsel has submitted that the scheme
of Act No.28 of 1996 and the Rules framed thereunder is altogether different
from the scheme of the Building and Other Construction Workers'
(Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 (for short
"Act No.27 of 1996") and the Rules framed thereunder known as the Uttar
Pradesh Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of
Employment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2009 (for short "Rules of
2009"). Learned Addl. Chief Standing Counsel submits that Act No.27 of
1996 and the Rules framed thereunder apply in respect of the regulation of
employment and conditions of service of the workers and amenities to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        2</span>

provided and neither cess is assessed or the liability is fixed under the
aforesaid Act and the Rules. Penal provision is contained in the Act No.28
of 1996 and he has drawn the attention of the Court towards the language
employed in sub-section 2 of Section 3 and has submitted that in respect of a
building or other construction work of a Government or of a public sector
undertaking deduction has to take place at source and in case of advance
collection, deduction has to take place after the work is verified with the
approval of the authority. Submission is that in the case in hand, the work
which is being undertaken by the Airport Authority of India, which is a
public sector undertaking and therefore, the deduction of cess has to take
place at source. He has also submitted that deduction has already taken place
at source and therefore, there is no illegality in deducting the cess from the
petitioner at source. He also submitted that the statutory appeal is provided
against any assessment and therefore, the petitioner may approach the
appellate authority as contemplated under law if it wants to dispute the
liability of assessment.
</p><p id="p_5">       Having heard learned counsel for the parties, I find that the scheme of
Act No.28 of 1996 and the Rules framed thereunder deal with in respect of
determination of cess. <a href="/doc/1030703/" id="a_3">Section 3</a> (2) of Act No.28 of 1996 specifically
provides as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 "3 (2). The cess levied under sub-section (1) shall be
          collected from every employer in such manner and at such
          time, including deduction at source in relation to a building
          or other construction work of a Government or of a public
          sector undertaking or advance collection through a local
          authority where an approval of such building or other
          construction work by such local authority is required, as
          may be prescribed."</blockquote>

<p id="p_6">       From the language of sub-section 2 of Section 3 of Act No.28 of 1996,
it is evident that the cess has to be levied under sub-section (1) and has to be
collected from every employer in such manner and at such time, including
deduction at source in relation to a building or other construction work of a
Government or of a public sector undertaking. The word 'or' clearly denotes
that advance collection through a local authority where on approval of such
building or other construction work by such local authority is required to be
read disjunctively and they cannot be read in conjunction with the earlier part
of the Section where the word 'or' has been used repeatedly. Therefore,
argument of the learned counsel for the opposite parties is that the levy of
tax has to take place in advance where a construction takes place with the
approval of the local authority or where the construction is taking place in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        3</span>

respect to building of a Government or of a public sector undertaking the
cess has to be deducted at source as is clear from sub-section 2 of Section 3
of Act No.28 of 1996. Cess Rules, 1998 also deal with the levy of cess and
sub-rule 3 of Rule 4 of the Cess Rules, 1998 also provides that where the
levy of cess pertains to building and other construction work of a
Government or of a public sector undertaking, such Government or the
public sector undertaking shall deduct or cause to be deducted the cess
payable at the notified rates from the bills paid for such works.
</p><p id="p_7">       The aforesaid language also goes to indicate that deliberately the
Legislature has not used the word 'with the approval of the local authority'
whereas in subsection 2 of Section 3 of Act No.28 of 1996 the word 'with the
approval of the local authority' has been used, therefore, the interpretation
which has to be adopted has to be in consonance with the language employed
in the two provisions i.e. <a href="/doc/1030703/" id="a_4">Section 3</a> (2) of Act No.28 of 1996 and Rule 4 (3)
of the Cess Rules, 1998. Rule 4 (3) of the Cess Rules, 1998 is quoted as
under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                  "4 (3). Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-rule (1)
           and sub-rule (2), where the levy of cess pertains to building
           and other construction work of a Government or of a public
           sector undertaking, such Government or the public sector
           undertaking shall deduct or cause to be deducted the cess
           payable at the notified rates from the bills paid for such
           works."</blockquote>

<p id="p_8">       Reliance placed by the learned counsel for the petitioner on Act No.27
of 1996 i.e. the Building and Other Construction Workers' (Regulation of
Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 and the Rules of 2009 are
in regard to the Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service and
operate in different field and the definition, if any, appended therein has to be
read in respect of establishment of the Board and welfare measures to be
adopted in respect of the workers, who are working with the contractor at
site. Elaborate provisions have been made in that regard, therefore, in the
aforesaid circumstances, the argument of the learned counsel for the
petitioner fails.
</p><p id="p_9">       Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon a
judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/625579/" id="a_5">M/s Saraswati Sugar
Mills and others vs. Haryana State Board and others</a>, (1992) 1 SCC 418,
to emphasise that the two Acts operate in different fields and they cannot
come to the aid and support of each other and the cess is to be determined
under the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_6">Cess Act</a>, which has been framed to raise revenue for augmenting
the resources of the Pollution Control Boards. Paragraphs 5, 11 and 19 of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                       4</span>

the aforesaid judgment are reproduced hereunder:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       "5. The object of the Act is to control the water pollution and
       to ensure that industrial affluents are not allowed to be
       discharged into the water coarses without adequate treatment.
       <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_7">The Cess Act</a> is not an enactment to regulate and control
       pollution but a fiscal measure to raise revenue for augmenting
       the resources of the Pollution Control Boards. The levy and
       collection of cess provided under the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_8">Cess Act</a> is on water
       consumed by persons carrying on the industries specified in
       the Schedule. The Cess is levied on the person carrying on
       the specified industry. The question is whether industries
       manufacturing sugar are covered by Entry 15 that is
       "processing of vegetable product industry".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             11. The interpretation of one of the entries in Schedule I
      to the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_9">Cess Act</a> came up for consideration in Member-
      Secretary, A.P. State Board for <a href="/doc/918244/" id="a_10">Prevention and Control of
      Water Pollution v. A. P. Rayons Ltd. and others</a>, (1989) 1 SCC
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      44. The question for consideration was whether manufacturing
      of rayon grade pulp a base material for manufacturing of
      synthetics or man-made fabrics is an industry as mentioned in
      Schedule I to the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_11">Cess Act</a>. It was held:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                     "[W]hether a particular industry is an industry as
             covered in Schedule I of the Act, it has to be judged
             normally by what that industry produces mainly. Every
             industry carries out multifarious activities to reach its
             goal through various multifarious methods. Whether
             a particular industry falls within the realm of taxation,
             must be judged by the predominant purpose and process
             and not by any ancillary or incidental process carried
             on by a particular industry in running its business."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      This Court also observed:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">             "It has to be borne in mind that this Act with which we
             are concerned is an Act imposing liability for cess. <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_12">The
             Act</a> is fiscal in nature. <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_13">The Act</a> must, therefore, be
             strictly construed in order to find out whether a liability
             is fastened on a particular industry. The subject is not to
             be taxed without clear words for that purpose; and also
             that every Act of Parliament must be read according to
             its natural construction of words. See the observations
             In Re. Nicklethwait, (1885) 11 Ex. 452, 456. Also see the
             observations in Tennant v. Smith (1892) AC 150 (and
             Lord Halsbury's observations at page 154). See also the
             observations of Lord Simonds in <a href="/doc/736324/" id="a_14">St. Aubyn v. A.G</a>.
             (1951) 2 All. ER, 473, 485. Justice Rowlatt of England
             said a long time ago, that in a taxing Act one has to
             look merely at what is clearly said. There is no room for
             any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There
             is no presumption as to tax. Nothing is to be read in,
             nothing is to be implied. One has to look fairly at the
             language used. See the observations in Cape Brandy
             Syndicate v. IRC, (1921) 1 KB 64, 71. This Court has
             also reiterated the same view in <a href="/doc/1338548/" id="a_15">Gursahai Saigal v. CIT</a>,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                        5</span>

             (1963) 3 SCR 893, <a href="/doc/386457/" id="a_16">CIT v. V.MR. P. Firm, Muar</a>, (1965)
             1 SCR 815, <a href="/doc/1326572/" id="a_17">Controller of Estate Duty v. Kantilal
             Trikamlal</a>, (1976) 4 SCC 643.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">             The question as to what is covered must be found out
             from the language according to its natural meaning fairly
             and squarely read. See the observations in IRC v. Duke
             of Westminster, (1963) AC 1, 24 and of this Court in
             <a href="/doc/1350547/" id="a_18">A.V. Fernandez v. State of Kerala</a>, 1957 SCR 837.
             Justice Krishna Iyer of this Court in <a href="/doc/1983544/" id="a_19">Martand Dairy &amp;
             Farm v. Union of India</a> (1975) 4 SCC 313 has
             observed that taxing consideration may stem from
             administrative experience and other factors of life and
             not artistic visualisation or neat logic and so the literal,
             though pedestrain, interpretation must prevail."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">              19. We are unable to appreciate the reasonings of the
             learned judges. <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_20">Pollution Act</a> may be a regulating Act
             but <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_21">Cess Act</a> is a fiscal enactment, as is held by this
             Court in Member Secretary, A. P. State Board for
             <a href="/doc/918244/" id="a_22">Prevention and Control of Water Pollution v. A. P.
             Rayons Ltd</a>. and <a href="/doc/1959505/" id="a_23">Others and Rajasthan State Electricity
             Board v. Cess Appellate Committee, JT</a> (1990) 4 SC
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">             123. Therefore we have to look merely at what is
             clearly said. There is no room for any intendment and
             there is no room for bringing within the provision of
             the Act anything by implication. Unless we give the
             botanical meaning to the word 'vegetable' it is not
             possible to conclude sugarcane as vegetable."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">      The law propounded by the Apex Court also goes to indicate that the
<a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_24">Cess Act</a> has been given an independent recognition and the liability of cess
is to be assessed under the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_25">Cess Act</a> only. The argument of learned counsel
for the petitioner, therefore, taking aid and help from the other Act and the
Rules of 2009 is misconceived and is rejected.</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">      The writ petition is devoid of merit. It is accordingly dismissed. The
petitioner, if so chooses, may prefer an appeal before the appropriate
authority as contemplated under law.
