                Writ petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the  Constitution  of
India praying for issuance of a Writ of Mandamus as stated therein.

:O R D E R
</pre><p id="p_1">                The  prayer  is  for  a Mandamus to forbear respondents 1 to 3
from giving permission to the fifth respondent  for  the  purpose  of  playing
microphone  in  a  private temple within the premises bearing Door No.64 Nehru
Street,  Karaikal,  Union  Territory  of   Pondicherry,   on   the   following
allegations:
</p><p id="p_2">                The  fifth  respondent,  a resident of Karaikal, had purchased
the property at Door No.64, Nehru Street, and illegally put up a  construction
and using it as Kalyana Mandapam.  He had not obtained a sanctioned plan.  The
plan  originally sanctioned has no connection whatsoever with the construction
put up by him.  The petitioner has complained to the authorities and they have
also initiated legal action to prosecute  the  fifth  respondent.    The  said
construction adjoins the petitioner's compound wall.  The fifth respondent has
installed an Amman statue.  During December and January, he secured permission
from  respondents  1  to  3  and  played music through microphone at odd hours
causing immense nuisance to neighbours.  The petitioner's family was  directly
affected on  account  of  the  noise  emanating from that place.  The distance
between the temple and the petitioner's house is hardly one foot.  The  fourth
respondent has  also  given  electricity  supply  to  the  temple.   The third
respondent permitted the fifth respondent to play music at  odd  hours.    The
fifth respondent  did  not  adhere to the timings.  There is unabated nuisance
caused.  During the previous year, the petitioner had  given  objection,  but,
the same  was  rejected  by  the  first  respondent.  The fifth respondent was
instructed to follow the timings and  to  reduce  the  volume  to  the  barest
minimum.  The  directions  were  not followed.  The Tamil Nadu Legislature has
also passed a legislation regulating the use of  sound  amplifiers  in  public
places.  Any violation of the licence conditions should result in cancellation
of licence.    However, so far as Union Territory of Pondicherry is concerned,
to the knowledge of  the  petitioner,  no  legislation  corresponding  to  the
provisions of  the  Madras  City  Police  Act  has  been  passed.    The fifth
respondent had deliberately turned  the  microphone  facing  the  petitioner's
house  and  caused  great  nuisance and harassment to the petitioner's family.
The petitioner has an aged mother, who is  unable  to  bear  the  nuisance  on
account of  the  noise.  There is no law or principle that mandates playing of
music in temples, and that too, film songs.  In these circumstances, the  writ
petition has been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                2.  The respondents have been served.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                3.   The fifth respondent has filed a detailed counter stating
inter alia as follows:
</p><p id="p_5">                        The petitioner has suppressed the material facts  with
mala  fide  intention  to  prevent  the fifth respondent from doing his lawful
business in running the Kalyana Mandapam.  The fifth  respondent  obtained  an
approved  plan  in  Plan No.604/kpa/98, dt.17.3.1999 from the Chairman and the
Member-Secretary of Karaikal Town Planning authority for putting up a  Kalyana
Mandapam.   He  constructed as per the approved plan and completed the work in
2001.  At the time of construction, nobody objected to the sanction.  The writ
petitioner is residing at 219, Church Street, Karaikal.  The microphone is  in
Door  No.62,  Nehru  Street,  which  is  on the south-east of the petitioner's
property.  The fifth  respondent  purchased  the  property  bearing  Old  Door
No.218,  lying  immediately  on  the  south  of Door No.219, owned by the writ
petitioner, and on the west of the Kalyana Mandapam put  up  by  him.    There
arose  a  litigation  between  the writ petitioner and the vendor of the fifth
respondent, and the same is still pending.  The fifth respondent, as Power  of
Attorney of  his  vendor,  is  handling  the  litigation.   The petitioner was
enraged by purchase of the property by the fifth respondent and putting up  of
construction, and  his pursuing the litigation.  The petitioner sent telegrams
dt.22.10.2001 and 24.10.2001 to the Town Planning Authority, containing  false
allegation  that  the  Kalyana  Mandapam  had  been put up in violation of the
approved plan.  Complaints were also made after completion of the construction
work.  The Planning Authority sent a  letter  dt.24.5.2001  stating  that  the
construction  had been going for more than 2+ years, that the construction was
almost over, and that there was no violation in putting  up  the  construction
and therefore   the  construction  could  not  be  stopped.    The  petitioner
suppressed the above facts and filed W.P.No.1859 of 2002 for  a  direction  to
the   Karaikal  Town  Planning  Authorities  to  remove  the  alleged  illegal
construction made,  violating  the  Country  Planning  and  Regulations.    On
31.1.2002, this Court passed an order directing the Member-Secretary, Karaikal
Town   Planning  Authority,  to  inspect  the  premises  and  dispose  of  the
representation made by the writ petitioner within four weeks from the date  of
receipt of  a  copy of the order.  On 26.3.2002, the Planning Authority sent a
communication to the petitioner informing him that a reply would be  furnished
within seven  days  in  consultation  with  the  Committee  Members.   Without
awaiting the  reply,  the  petitioner  filed  O.S.No.26  of  2002  before  the
Additional District Judge, Karaikal, for a mandatory injunction, directing the
Karaikal Town Planning Authorities to remove the construction alleged to be in
deviation of  the  approved  plan.    The Additional District Judge, Karaikal,
without considering the bar  of  Civil  Court's  jurisdiction  provided  under
Section 75 of the Pondicherry Town and Country Planning Act, 1959, entertained
the suit, and on the very same day passed orders in I.A.  80 of 2002, granting
an  order  of injunction restraining the Town Planning Authorities from giving
'No Objection Certificate' for  running  the  Kalyana  Mandapam.    The  fifth
respondent  approached  this  Court in CRP No.858 of 2002 under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">Article 227</a> of
the Constitution of India for striking off the suit as an abuse of process  of
Court.   The Civil Revision Petition was allowed on 2.12.2002 and the suit was
struck-off on the same  day.    Immediately  thereafter,  on  16.12.2002,  the
present writ  petition has been filed with an ulterior motive.  While the main
prayer is for a relief preventing the fifth respondent from playing microphone
in respect of private temple located at Door 64, Nehru Street,  Karaikal,  the
interim  injunction  is sought for against installation of microphone and also
public address system in the entire premises  at  Door  No.64,  Nehru  Street.
This  would clearly prove the intention of the petitioner to prevent the fifth
respondent from making use of his lawfully constructed premises as  a  Kalyana
Mandapam.  Subsequent to the disposal of the Civil Revision Petition, the Town
Planning  Authorities,  Karaikal,  have  given  'No Objection Certificate' for
running a Kalyana Mandapam at No.62,  Nehru  Street,  Karaikal.    The  fourth
respondent  is  going  to  provide the fifth respondent a power supply service
connection to the Kalyana Mandapam shortly.  At this stage,  taking  advantage
of  the blanket interim order obtained from this Court, the writ petitioner is
giving a wide publicity in Karaikal region that the fifth respondent has  been
prevented  from  using  mike and loudspeakers in OM SAKTHI THIRUMANA MANDAPAM.
Based on this, the persons who have already reserved the petitioner' s Kalyana
Mandapam for performing marriages, are making enquiries and  contemplating  to
change the  venue.    Earlier  in  M.C.No.158 of 2001, the first respondent by
order dt.31.12.2001 held that there was no public nuisance  in  the  grant  of
permission  to  the  fifth  respondent  by the second respondent herein to use
loudspeakers for Amman Temple from 16.12.2001 to 16.1.2003  between  6.00  and
7.30  hrs.,  and instructions were given to the fifth respondent to follow the
timings and lessen the volume of the loudspeakers.  The second respondent  was
also directed to keep a vigil on the fifth respondent and see that he followed
the timings  and  reduction  of  sound in blaring the loudspeakers.  The fifth
respondent has followed the instructions given to him by the first respondent.
Thereafter, there was no complaint at all.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                Though, originally  the  fifth  respondent  had  not  obtained
sanction  in  the planing permission for construction of a small worship place
near the Kalyana Mandapam while construction  was  going  on,  he  thought  of
constructing  an Amman Temple measuring 4' x 10' near the Kalyana Mandapam, so
that people performing their marriages could  have  their  prayer  before  the
Amman at  the  time  of  marriages.    The  fifth respondent also subsequently
applied for the revised plan showing the temple, and the same  also  has  been
approved.   The  fifth respondent is not at all interested in playing music in
the private temple and so, he need not apply for permission from respondents 2
to 4 for the purpose of playing microphone in the private temple.  If  at  all
such  a  permission  is  required,  he will apply for the same after obtaining
necessary direction from this Court.  He undertakes that he will not apply for
permission from respondents 2 to 4 for the purpose of  playing  microphone  in
the  private  temple,  within  the premises bearing Door No.64 , Nehru Street,
Karaikal, Union Territory of Pondicherry, and this could be recorded  by  this
Court.  There  are  no  merits  in  the  writ  petition  and  the  same may be
dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                4.  Though the scope of the petition is rather limited, having
regard to the high incidence of aural aggression it has  become  necessary  to
deal with the subject rather elaborately.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                5.   Under  our  Constitution,  we  have  solemnly resolved to
secure to all the citizens liberty of thought, expression, belief,  faith  and
worship,  besides  social,  economic and political justice, equality of status

<p id="p_21">                6.  <a href="/doc/456839/" id="a_6">In  ROMESH  THAPPAR v.  STATE OF MADRAS</a> [AIR 1950 SC 124 :
1950 SCR 594] the Supreme Court observed that freedom of speech and expression
includes freedom of propagation of ideas, and that freedom is ensured  by  the
freedom of circulation.  It goes without saying that this circulation could be
by word of mouth, in writing or through audio visual instrumentalities that is
to say through print media as well as through radio and television.
</p>
<p id="p_22">                7.   More  often  than  not,  citizens who claim protection of
their rights regarding freedom of speech and expression, close their faculties
to sub-clause  (2)  which  provides  that  the  said  rights  are  subject  to
restrictions  on  grounds  of  public order, decency, morality or other public
interests which may be compendiously described as social welfare  [HARI  KHEMU
GAWALI v..  DCP  [AIR  1956  SC  559].    As  pointed  out by DAS, J.  in A.K.
GOPALAN v..  STATE OF MADRAS, AIR 1950 SC 27, individual liberty will have  to
be subordinated to other greater social interests.  It has been pointed out in
MRF LTD.   v..    INSPECTOR,  KERALA  GOVERNMENT,  (1998)  8 SCC 227, that the
Directive Principles of State Policy have to be kept  in  mind  by  the  Court
while considering the reasonableness    of  the restrictions though one member
of the Constituent Assembly characterised the Chapter on Directive  Principles
as "a veritable dustbin of sentiment", and that the said restrictions must not
be  arbitrary  or of an excessive nature so as to go beyond the requirement of
the interest of the general public.  There must be just balance struck between
the restriction imposed and  the  social  control  envisaged;  the  prevailing
social  values  as  also  social  needs  which are intended to be satisfied by
restrictions imposed have to be borne in mind; and there must be a direct  and
proximate  nexus or a reasonable connection between the restrictions imposed a

.....   some  of  the topics mentioned in clause (2) would, under the American
and the English laws, come within the concept of  "public  order",  but  that,
having  regard  to  the  fact  that  these  subjects have also been separately
mentioned in the same clause,  they  cannot  be  included  in  the  expression
"public order".
</p><p id="p_25">Ultimately, the Supreme Court held -
</p><p id="p_26">        ".....   the expression "public order" was used in a limited sense and
that "it can be postulated that  "public  order"  is  synonymous  with  public
peace, safety and  tranquillity".    ....    in  order  to  justify a piece of
legislation on the ground of its being "in  the  interest  of  public  order",
there  must  be  a  proximate  connection  between  the  restriction  and  the

<p id="p_32">                12.   Noise Pollution is a very serious menace that the people
are facing.  Loudspeakers, heavy and light vehicles, three  wheelers  and  two
wheelers without silencers and impatient honking of horns are the main sources
of the  malady.    A.G.GARDINER  in his lively piece "On the Rule of the Road"
with particular reference to horns says -
</p><p id="p_33">"When I hear the aggressive, bullying horn which some  motorists  deliberately
use,  I confess that I feel something boiling up in me which is very like what
I felt when Germany came trampling like a bully over Belgium.  By what  right,
my  dear  sir, do you go along our highways uttering that hideous curse on all
who impede your path?  Cannot you  announce  your  coming  like  a  gentleman?
Cannot you  take your turn?  Are you someone in particular or are you simply a
hot gospeller of the prophet Nietzsche?  I find myself wondering what sort  of
person  it  is who can sit behind that hog-like outrage without realising that
he is the spirit of  Prussia  incarnate,  and  a  very  ugly  spectacle  in  a
civilised world."

CALCUTTA 222] the Calcutta High Court was dealing with the mandatory provision
as provided in R.114(d) of the Bengal Motor Vehicles  Rules,  1940  that  each
transport  vehicle  namely  stage  carriages  which include private buses, and
State Buses, contract carriers, mini buses, lorries etc.  Could not be  fitted
with any  other  form of horn excepting a bulb horn.  But no transport vehicle
owner followed such Rule and the transport vehicles were  using  electric  and
air horn  in  reckless  manner.    It was observed by the High Court that in a
congested State like the State of West Bengal, sudden blowing of such horn  by
transport   vehicles   produced  rude  shock  in  the  human  system  and  was
acknowledged to have serious effect on various aspects of human life including
blood pressure, mental and nervous system.   "It  is  also  matter  of  common
knowledge  that such transport vehicles even for overtaking another vehicle on
the road small or big continuously blow such electric and/or  air  horn  which
produces  a  shrill and loud noise and which creates annoyance to everyone who
resides by the side of the road and to all pedestrians including  the  persons
travelling in  the vehicles.  The indiscriminate use of such horn is amounting
to noise pollution in the city of Calcutta and  the  congested  areas  of  the
State  of  West  Bengal  and  that  the same have adverse effect on the public
health of the people  which  creates  many  a  complication  including  mental
restlessness,  blood  pressure  and  heart  trouble and it is necessary in the
interest of the public at large in the State of West Bengal to stop such noise
pollution arising out of  unnecessary  use  of  such  electric  and  air  horn
deliberately.   The transport authorities are under a statutory obligation and
duty under  S.112  of  the  Motor  Vehicles  Act  to  punish  the  person  who
contravenes the provision of R.114(d) of the Rules."
</p>
<p id="p_35">                14.   Noise, it is common knowledge, has adverse effect on the
public health of the  people  and  as  pointed  out  in  PA  JACOB  v..    THE
SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE, AIR 1993 KERALA 1 -
</p><p id="p_36">"Exposure  to  high  noise,  is  a  known  risk  and  it  is  proved  to cause
bio-chemical  changes  in  man,  elevating  levels  of  blood   catecholamine,
cholesterol, white  cell  counts  and lymphocytes.  Laboratory studies made by
monitoring  electro  encephalo  graphic  (EEG)  responses   and   changes   in
neurovegetative  reactions  reactions  during  sleep, show that disturbance of
sleep becomes increasingly apparent as ambient noise levels  exceed  about  35
dB(A) Leq.         noise    produces    different    reactions    along    the
hypothalamohypophyseal-adrenal    axis,    including    an     increase     in
adenocorti-cotropic  hormone  (ACTH),  affecting  sympathetic  division of the
autonomic nervous system.   Eye  dilation,  bradycardia,  and  increased  skin
conductance are  proportional  to  the  intensity of noise above 7 0 dB.  SPL.
incidence of peptic ulcer is high among noise exposed groups.    Noise  causes
contraction  of the flexor muscles of the limbs and the spine, and is reckoned
as an environmental stress that could lead to non-specific  health  disorders.
Exposure  to  high  noise in every day life may contribute to eventual loss of
hearing (socio-acusis), and this in  turn  can  affect  speech  communication.
Vasoconstruction  or  vasodilation  of  blood  vessels also is induced by high
levels of noise during acute exposures (Rosecrans et al (1966)).    Complaints
of nystagmus (rapid voluntary side to side movements), Vertigo (dizziness) and
balance problems  have  also  been  reported  due  to  noise  exposure.  'WHO'

Park and  K.    Park  'Text  Book of Preventive and Social medicine', 7th Edn.

</p>
<p id="p_38">                16.  In the case before the Supreme Court of the United States
</p><p id="p_39">- SAMUEL SAIA v.  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORD [92 LAW.  ED.1574 :  334  US
558],  a  municipal ordinance prohibited the use of amplifying devices casting
sound upon streets and public places, except with the permission of the  chief
of  police,  without prescribing standards for the exercise of his discretion.
A majority of the court, led by DOUGLAS, J.,  thought  that  it  violated  the
constitutional right of free speech.  However, FRANKFURTER, J.  with whom REED
and BURTON,  J.J.    concurred,  characterised amplifying devices as affording
"too  easy  opportunities  for  aural  aggression,"  and  thought   that   the
constitutional  right of free speech does not require denial of the right of a
state to so control amplifying devices as to safeguard the  rights  of  others
not to  be  assailed  by  intrusive  noise.  Referring to the fact that in the
instant case permission to broadcast from a sound truck a religious lecture in
a public park was refused because of complaints  consequent  upon  a  previous
permit, and to the absence of a showing of arbitrary action or discrimination,
he  thought  that  it was not beyond constitutional limits to refuse a licence
for the time and place requested.
</p><p id="p_40">        JACKSON, J., also dissented on the ground that society has  the  right
to  control as to place, time, and volume the use of loud-speaking devices for
any purpose provided its regulations are not unduly arbitrary, capricious,  or
discriminatory and that under the circumstances of the case the refusal of the
permit was neither unreasonable nor discriminatory.
</p><p id="p_41">        In that case, the appellant was a Minister of the religious sect known
as Jehovah's  Witnesses.    He obtained permission from the Chief of Police to
use sound equipment, mounted atop his car, to amplify  lectures  on  religious
subjects.   The  lectures  were  given  at  a  fixed place in a public park on
designated Sundays.  When this permit expired, he applied for another one  but
was refused  on  the  ground  that complaints had been made.  Nevertheless, he
used his equipment as planned on four occasions, but without permission.    He
was tried  in Police Court for violations of the ordinance.  It was undisputed
that he used his equipment to amplify speeches in the park and that they  were
on religious subjects.  Some witnesses testified that they were annoyed by the
sound,  though  not by the content of the addresses; others were not disturbed
by either.  The Court upheld the ordinance  against  the  contention  that  it
violated  appellant's rights of freedom of speech, assembly, and worship under
the Federal Constitution.   Fines  and  jail  sentences  were  imposed.    His
convictions  were  affirmed  without  opinion  by the County Court for Niagara
County and by the New York Court of Appeals.  The aggrieved Minister moved the
United States' Supreme Court.  As already mentioned, the  majority  held  that
the  relevant  Section  was  unconstitutional  as  it  established  a previous
restraint on the right of free speech in  violation  of  the  First  Amendment
which was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against State action.
</p><p id="p_42">        "Loud-speakers are today indispensable instruments of effective public
speech.    The  sound  truck  has  become  an  accepted  method  of  political
campaigning.  It is the way people are reached.  Must a candidate for governor
or the Congress depend on the whim or caprice of the Chief of Police in  order
to use  his sound truck for campaigning?  Must he prove to the satisfaction of
that official that his noise will not be annoying to people?"
</p><p id="p_43">        "Ordinance in question would be a dangerous weapon if it were  allowed
to get  a  hold  on  the  public  life.   Noise can be regulated by regulating
decibels.  The hours and place of public discussion can be controlled.  But to
allow the police to bar the use of loud-speakers  because  their  use  can  be
abused is  like  barring  radio  receivers because they too make a noise.  The
police need not be given the power to deny a man the use of his radio in order
to protect a neighbour against sleepless nights.
</p><p id="p_44">        Any abuses which loud-speakers create can be  controlled  by  narrowly
drawn statutes.    When  a  city  allows  an  official  to  ban  them  in  his
uncontrolled discretion,  it  sanctions  a  device  for  suppression  of  free
communication of  ideas.  In this case a permit is denied because some persons
were said to have found the sound annoying.  In the next one a permit  may  be
denied because some people find the ideas annoying.  Annoyance at ideas can be
cloaked in  annoyance at sound.  The power of censorship inherent in this type
of ordinance reveals its vice."
</p><p id="p_45">        "Courts must balance the various community interests in passing on the
constitutionality of local regulations of the character involved here.  But in
that process they should  be  mindful  to  keep  the  freedoms  of  the  First
Amendment in a preferred position."
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">        However, the dissenters observed as follows:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                "The  native  power  of human speech can interfere little with
the self-protection of those who do not wish to listen.  They may easily  move
beyond  earshot,  just  as those who do not choose to read need not have their
attention bludgeoned by undesired reading matter.  And so utterances by speech
or pen can neither be forbidden nor licensed, save in the familiar classes  of
exceptional situations.......  But modern devices for amplifying the range and
volume  of  the  voice, or its recording, afford easy, too easy, opportunities
for aural aggression.  If uncontrolled, the result is intrusion into cherished
privacy.   The  refreshment  of  mere  silence,  or   meditation,   or   quiet
conversation,  may  be  disturbed  or precluded by noise beyond one's personal
control..........  The State was entitled to authorize the  local  authorities
of  Lockport  to determine that the well-being of those of its inhabitants who
sought  quiet  and  other  pleasures  that  a  park  affords,  outweighed  the
appellant's right  to  force  his  message  upon  them.  Nor did it exceed the
bounds of reason for the chief of police  to  base  his  decision  refusing  a
license  upon  the  fact that the manner in which the license had been used in
the past was destructive of the enjoyment of the park by those for whom it was
maintained.  That people complained about an annoyance  would  seem  to  be  a
pretty solid basis in experience for not sanctioning its continuance..........
</blockquote><p id="p_46">It  is  not  unconstitutional  for  a  State  to vest in a public official the
determination of what is in effect a nuisance merely  because  such  authority
may  be  outrageously  misused  by  trying  to  stifle  the expression of some
undesired opinion under the  meretricious  cloak  of  a  nuisance.    Judicial
remedies are available for such abuse of authority, and courts, including this
Court, exist to enforce such remedies."
</p><p id="p_47">        "We  are  dealing  with new technological devices and with attempts to
control them in order to gain their benefits while  maintaining  the  precious
freedom of  privacy.    These  attempts,  being  experimental, are bound to be
tentative."
</p><p id="p_48">JACKSON, J.  observed:
</p><p id="p_49">        "It is  astonishing  news  to  me  if  the  Constitution  prohibits  a
municipality  from  policing,  controlling  or  forbidding  erection  of  such
equipment by a private party in a public park.  Certainly precautions  against
annoyance  or  injury from operation of such devices are not only appropriate,
but I should think a duty of the city in  supervising  such  public  premises.
And  a very appropriate means to supervision is a permit which will inform the
city's police officers of the time and place when  such  apparatus  is  to  be
installed in  the  park.    I  think  it  is  a  startling  perversion  of the
Constitution to say that it wrests away from the states and their subdivisions
all control of the public property so that they cannot  regulate  or  prohibit
the  irresponsible  introduction  of  contrivances  of  this  sort into public
places."
</p><p id="p_50">The learned Judge referred to the words of HUGHES, CJ:
</p><p id="p_51">                "Civil liberties, as guaranteed by the Constitution, imply the
existence of an organized  society  maintaining  public  order  without  which
liberty itself would be lost in the excesses of unrestrained abuses."

<p id="p_52">                17.  In  CHARLES KOVACS v.  ALBERT COOPER, JR., [93 L ED 513 :
336 US 77] it was held that a city ordinance prohibited the operation upon the
streets of sound amplifiers or  other  instruments  which  emitted  "loud  and
raucous  noises"  and were attached to vehicles operated or standing upon such
streets.  A conviction for a violation of  this  ordinance,  affirmed  by  the
state  appellate  courts,  was  further  affirmed by a majority of the Supreme
Court of the United States as against the objections that  the  ordinance  was
lacking in definiteness and that it infringes upon the constitutional right of
free speech.
</p><p id="p_53">        Eight  members of the Court - all except MURPHY, J., agreed that sound
amplification  in  streets  and  public  places  is  subject   to   reasonable
regulation,  and, at least, did not disagree that an ordinance prohibiting the
emission  of  "loud  and  raucous  noises"  does  not  go  beyond   reasonable
regulation.  Two  of  the  eight - FRANKFURTER and JACKSON, JJ.  - go further,
holding that the use of sound trucks in streets may be  absolutely  prohibited
without violating the constitutional right of free speech.
</p><p id="p_54">        BLACK,   J.,  joined  by  DOUGLAS  and  RUTLEDGE,  JJ.,  dissent  from
affirmance of the case on the ground that the defendant was charged  with  and
convicted  of operating a sound truck, without allegation or proof that it was
emitting "loud and raucous noises."
</p><p id="p_55">        To enforce freedom of speech in disregard  of  the  rights  of  others
would be harsh and arbitrary in itself.
</p><p id="p_56">        Mr.  JUSTICE FRANKFURTER observed as follows:
</p><p id="p_57">                Wise  accommodation between liberty and order always has been,
and ever will be,  indispensable  for  a  democratic  society.    So  long  as
legislation  to  this  end  does not abridge the constitutional liberty of one
rightfully upon the  street  to  impart  information  through  speech  or  the
distribution  of  literature,  it  may  lawfully regulate the conduct of those
using the streets.
</p><p id="p_58">        So long as a legislature does not prescribe what ideas may be  noisily
expressed  and  what  may  not be, nor discriminate among those who would make
inroads upon the public peace, it is not for us to supervise  the  limits  the
legislature  may  impose  in safeguarding the steadily narrowing opportunities
for serenity and reflection.  Without such opportunities  freedom  of  thought
becomes  a mocking phrase, and without freedom of thought there can be no free
society.

</p><p id="p_60">- the appellant was charged with using a noisy instrument during the course of
a  public  meeting  without  permission  from the Chief of Police, contrary to
section 5 of the Public Meetings and Processions Act 1969.   He  admitted  the
fact of using a loudspeaker without the permission of the Chief of Police, but
contended  that section 5 of the Act of 196 9 was ultra vires the Constitution
in that it  curtailed  his  fundamental  right  of  freedom  of  communication
contained in   section  10  of  the  St.    Christopher,  Nevis  and  Anguilla
Constitution Order 1967.  The magistrate referred for the determination of the
High Court  the  question  whether  section  5  of  the  Public  Meetings  and
Processions Act  1969  offended  against  <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_13">section 10</a> of the Constitution.  The
High Court held that <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_14">section 5</a> of the Act did  not  infringe  the  fundamental
rights  and  freedoms  guaranteed  by <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_15">section 10</a> of the Constitution and their
decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.
</p><p id="p_61">        On appeal by the appellant to the Judicial Committee:-  it  was  held,
dismissing  the appeal, that the control of loudspeakers at public meetings by
<a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_16">section 5</a> of  the  Act  of  1969  was  not  contrary  to  <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_17">section  10</a>  of  the
Constitution,  for  public order required that the public, who did not wish to
hear the speaker, be protected from any excessive noise.
</p><p id="p_62">        Per curiam.  A wrongful refusal of permission to use a loudspeaker  at

interference with freedom of communication.

not  make  himself a nuisance to others." Man, as a rational being, desires to
do many things, but in a civil society his  desires  have  to  be  controlled,

individuals.  Liberty has, therefore, to be limited in order to be effectively

Council in <a href="/doc/740802/" id="a_19">FRANCIS v.  CHIEF OF POLICE</a> [(1973) 2 All ER 251] said that the two
conflicting  considerations  to  be  reconciled  are  the  differing  opinions
delivered in the United States Supreme Court in SAIA v.  NEW YORK [(1948)  334
US 558] and KOVACS v.  COOPER [(1949) 336 US 77].
</p>
<p id="p_67">        After noticing the two differing opinions of the United States Supreme
Court Lord Pearson said:
</p><p id="p_68">        "The  American judgments show the principles and policy considerations
involved, but may not be a guide to the detailed construction of Section 10 of
the Constitution of the State of St.  Christopher Nevis and Anguilla,  because
the First and Fourteenth Amendments have no provision corresponding to <a href="/doc/202193/" id="a_20">Section
10(2)</a>.  The American Judges look for the inherent limitations which there must
be  in the fundamental freedoms of the individual if the freedom of others and
the interests of the community are not to be infringed.  There are two ways of
construing <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_21">Section 10</a>.  One way is to read into sub-section (1) the  necessary
limitations  as  inherent  in  the  fundamental  freedoms  of  expression  and
communication.  The other way is to look  first  at  sub-section  (1)  to  see
whether  according  to the literal meaning of the words there is a prima facie
hindering  of  or  interference  with   the   freedoms   of   expression   and
communication,  and,  if  there  is, look on to sub-section (2) to see whether
such hindering or intercourse is justifiable.  If the second way  is  adopted,
the  phrase 'public order' must be given a meaning wide enough to cover action
taken for the avoidance of excessive  noise  seriously  interfering  with  the
comfort or  convenience  of a substantial number of persons.  The phrase would
of course cover action for the avoidance of any behaviour likely to lead to  a
breach  of  the  peace,  and perhaps excessive noise can be brought under that
heading.
</p><p id="p_69">        Whatever may be the exact construction of <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_22">Section 10</a>, it must be clear
that (1) a wrongful refusal of permission to use a  loudspeaker  at  a  public
meeting  (for  instance  if  the  refusal is inspired by political partiality)
would be an  unjustified  and  therefore  unconstitutional  interference  with
freedom   of   communication,   because   it   would  restrict  the  range  of
communication, and (2) some regulation of the use of loudspeakers is  required
in  order  that citizens who do not wish to hear what is said may be protected
against 'aural aggression' if that might reach unbearable intensity."

has been held  that  use  of  mechanical  instruments  like  loudspeakers  and

expression.  The learned Judge further held that a bye-law of  a  municipality
which  requires  permission  of the Executive Officer for using a loud-speaker
does not infringe <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_24">Art.19 (1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.

the use  of  loudspeakers was being considered.  The learned judge observed as
follows:
</p><p id="p_72">......  In order that disorder may not take place on account of  the  user  of
loudspeakers,  it  is  quite  obvious that the authorities concerned must have
previous knowledge about the persons who are to make use of loudspeakers,  and
the times  and  the  places  at  which  they  are  to  be used.  This previous
knowledge can be acquired only if a system  of  licensing  is  introduced,  so
that,  when  an  application for licence comes to be made, the authorities may
come to know beforehand who intends to make use of the  loudspeaker,  at  what
time and place, and under what circumstances.  This would give the authorities
a  chance  to consider whether any disturbance of public peace or tranquillity
is or is not likely to arise by the use of the  loudspeaker  at  a  particular
time and place, and, if there is any such danger, what measures they must take
for the  preservation  of public peace and order.  Then it will be the duty of
the officer to consider whether he should prohibit the use of the loudspeakers
absolutely or whether he should only control the same."

freedom  of  the  speaker  or  the  person  who wants to express his ideas and

are effectively communicated to the audience.  But at the same time the  State

where the phrase 'public order' was equated with 'order publique' plus absence
of all acts which are a danger to the security of the State, it was held  that
the  question  whether  excessive  noise  could  always  be  classified as not
conducive to 'public order' required further scrutiny and study.    The  Court
observed:
</p><p id="p_76">        "....   that  the  overlap  of public order and public tranquillity is
only partial.  The terms are not always synonymous.   The  latter  is  a  much
wider  expression and takes in many things which cannot be described as public
disorder.  The words 'public order' and 'public  tranquillity'  overlap  to  a
certain extent but there are matters which disturb public tranquillity without
being a  disturbance  of public order.  A person playing loud music in his own
house in the middle of the night may disturb public tranquillity,  but  he  is
not causing public disorder.  'Public order' no doubt also requires absence of
disturbance of  a  state of serenity in society but it goes further.  It means
what  the  French  designate  order  publique,  defined  as  an   absence   of
insurrection, riot, turbulence, or crimes of violence.  The expression 'public
order'  includes absence of all acts which are a danger to the security of the
state and also acts which are comprehended by the expression 'order  publique'
explained above but not acts which disturb only the serenity of others."

1993 KERALA 1], already referred to, it has been stated as follows:
</p><p id="p_79">        "The right to speech implies,  the  right  to  silence.    It  implies
freedom, not to listen, and not to be forced to listen.  The right comprehends
freedom to  be free from what one desires to be free from.  Free speech is not
to be treated as a promise to everyone with opinions and beliefs, to gather at
any place and at any time and express their views in any manner.  The right is
subordinate to peace and order.  A person can decline to read  a  publication,
or switch  off  a radio or a television set.  But, he cannot prevent the sound
from a loudspeaker reaching him.  He could be forced to hear what , he  wishes
not, to  hear.  That will be an invasion of his right to be let alone, to hear
what he wants to hear, or not to hear, what he does not wish to hear.  One may
put his mind or hearing to his own uses, but not that of another.  No one  has
a  right  to  trespass  on  the mind or ear of another and commit auricular or
visual aggression.  A loudspeaker is a mechanical device, and it has  no  mind
or thought process in it.  Recognition of the right of speech or expression is
recognition accorded   to   a  human  faculty.    A  right  belongs  to  human
personality, and not to a mechanical device.  One may  put  his  faculties  to
reasonable uses.   But,  he  cannot  put his machines to any use he likes.  He
cannot use his machines to injure others.  Intervention with a machine, is not
intervention with, or invasion of a human faculty or  right.    No  mechanical
device can  be  upgraded  to a human faculty.  A computer or a robot cannot be
conceded the rights under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_28">Art.19 (though they may be useful to man to  express
his faculties).</a>   No  more,  a  loud speaker.  The use of a loudspeaker may be
incidental to the exercise of the right.  But, its use  is  not  a  matter  of
right, or part of the right."
</p><p id="p_80">                "......   in  the  matter of denying the use of a loudspeaker,
Police cannot act arbitrarily.  All State action is amenable to  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_29">Art.14.</a>    If
the  authority  charged  with the power to regulate use of loud speakers under
the Kerala Police Act, acts beyond the authority law  confers  upon  him,  his
action is liable to be interdicted."

</p><p id="p_82">- <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_30">Article  21</a>  guarantees  freedom from tormenting sounds.  What is negatively
the right to be let alone, is positively the right to be free from noise.
</p><p id="p_83">        ......
</p><p id="p_84">        Sound levels generally caused by loudspeakers transgress  safe  limits
by a  wide  margin.    Loud  speakers  have  become part of political, social,
religious and cultural life of this country.  To allow  advocates  of  various
persuasions to commit unlimited aural aggression on unwilling listeners, would
be  to  allow  them  to subjugate the right of life of unwilling listeners, to
their aggressions.  Protests made by sufferers like the student  community  or
sick, generally fall on heedless ears.  Very recently, the 'Malayala Manorama'
(5-5-1992) came  out  with  an  editorial against noise pollution.  The Indian
Medical Association is reported to have protested against  high  noise  output
through loudspeakers,   pointing  out  the  risks......    (Malayala  Manorama
21-5-1992, Mathrubhumi  dt.21-5-1992).    Compulsory  exposure  of   unwilling
persons  to  dangerous and disastrous levels of noise, would amount to a clear
infringement of their constitutional guarantee of right to life under  Article

conditions for issue of licence for use of amplifiers and loudspeakers and for
directing Director General, Police (Law and Order) to impose total ban on  use
of  horn  type  loudspeakers  and amplifiers and air horns of automobiles were

</p><p id="p_101">                This decision has been approved by the Supreme Court in CHURCH
OF GOD IN INDIA v..  K.K.R.  MAJESTIC COLONY WELFARE ASSOCIATION [AIR 20 00 SC
2773 :  2000 (7) SCC 282].
</p><p id="p_102">That was an appeal against the decision of a learned single judge (AKBAR BASHA
KHADIRI, J.) of this Court in a criminal original petition, filed by a Welfare
Association, invoking the inherent jurisdiction of this  Court  under  <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_32">Section
482</a>   of   the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  directing  the  police  -  the
Superintendent of Police and the Inspector General of Police  to  take  action
against  the  sixth respondent/the appellant before the Supreme Court to abate
noise pollution.  The details are as under:
</p><p id="p_103">"The appellant was a minority, denominational Church against  whom  complaints
had  been  lodged  by  the  respondent  welfare  association for causing noise
pollution during  the  course  of  their  regular  prayer  service.    It  was
undisputed  that  the  Church  used  loudspeakers, drums and other instruments
during prayers.  The Joint Chief Environmental  Engineer  of  the  Tamil  Nadu
Pollution  Control  Board  on  23.5.1996 wrote to the Superintendent of Police
concerned directing him to take action on  the  complaint;  on  12.6.1996,  he
wrote  again  to  the  Superintendent  and enclosed the analysis report of the
ambient noise level survey, which had been conducted in the  neighbourhood  of
the appellant  Church.    The report indicated that the vehicles plying on the
nearby main road were significant contributors to the high noise level.
On behalf of the Church it was contended that the  petition  was  a  motivated
one,  aimed  at  disrupting  the  religious activities of a minority religious
institution.  It was also pointed out that much of the noise  was  contributed
by vehicular  traffic  nearby.   This Court relying on Appa Rao's case (supra)
directed the police to take the steps necessary to reduce the noise  level  to
the extent  permitted  under the guidelines laid down in Appa Rao's case.  The
police was also directed to take action in respect of the vehicles and also to
ensure that the Church loudspeakers were kept at a lower level.    This  Court
also  found  that  there was no malice or objectionable motive in the petition
filed by the Welfare Association.  A definite stand was taken  by  the  Church
that  the President of the Welfare Association was a member of RSS and that he
had a malicious desire to put an end to the prayers held in the church.    The
learned  Judge  found, on a perusal of the complaint and other documents, that
at the time when the complaint was preferred, one  Parimala  Sekaran  was  the
President, one Shabbir, a Muslim was the Vice President, who had preferred the
complaint,  one Christopher a Christian was the Secretary, the Joint Secretary
was a Muslim, the Treasurer was a Christian and  the  General  Adviser  was  a
Hindu.   The  General  Advisor  later became the President of the Association.
The learned Judge did not find any tinge of malice and malicious wish to cause
any hindrance to the free practice of religious faith of the Church.
</p>
<p id="p_104">        The Supreme Court confirmed the decision of this  Court  and  approved
Appa Rao's case.  It observed as follows:
</p><p id="p_105">        Undisputably  no  religion prescribes that prayers should be performed
by disturbing the peace of others nor does  it  preach  that  they  should  be
through voice-amplifiers  or beating of drums.  In the name of religion nobody
can be permitted to add to noise pollution or violate noise  pollution  norms.
Even  if  there be a religious practice to use voice amplifiers, it should not
adversely affect the rights of others including that of being not disturbed in
their activities.
</p><p id="p_106">        "In our view,  in  a  civilized  society  in  the  name  of  religion,
activities  which  disturb old or infirm persons, students, or children having
their sleep in the early hours or during day-time or other persons carrying on
other activities cannot be permitted.  It should not be forgotten  that  young
babies  in the neighbourhood are also entitled to enjoy their natural right of
sleeping in a peaceful atmosphere.  A student preparing for his examination is
entitled to concentrate on his studies without  their  being  any  unnecessary
disturbance by  the  neighbours.    Similarly,  old and infirm are entitled to
enjoy reasonable quietness during their leisure hours without there being  any
nuisance of  noise  pollution.    Aged,  sick,  people  afflicted with psychic
disturbances as well as children up to 6 years of age  are  considered  to  be
very sensible to noise.  Their rights are also required to be honoured.
</p><p id="p_107">        <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_33">Under   the  Environment  (Protection)  Act</a>,  1986,  rules  for  noise
pollution level are framed which prescribe  permissible  limits  of  noise  in
residential, commercial,  industrial areas or silence zone.  The question is -
where the appellant can be permitted to violate the said provisions and add to
the noise pollution?  In these days, the problem of noise pollution has become
more serious with the increasing trend towards industrialization, urbanization
and modernization.  Noise is having many evil effects including danger to  the
health.   It  may  cause  interruption of sleep, affect communication, loss of
efficiency,  hearing  loss  or  deafness,  high  blood  pressure,  depression,
irritability,   fatigue,  gastro-intestinal  problems,  allergy,  distraction,
mental stress and annoyance.  This also affect animals alike.  The  extent  of
damage depends  upon  the  duration  and the intensity of noise.  Sometimes it
leads to serious law and order problem.  Further,  in  an  organized  society,
rights are  related  with  duties  towards  others  including neighbours.  The
relevant rules under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control)  Rules  2000

Protection Act</a>, 1986.  Rule 3 of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and  Control)

that it is necessary to do so in  order  to  prevent  annoyance,  disturbance,
discomfort  or  injury  or  risk  of anno urbance, discomfort or injury to the
public or to any person who dwell or occupy property on the vicinity, he  may,
by  a  written order issue such directions as he may consider necessary to any

either in person or by a person representing him and showing cause against the
order  and shall, if it rejects any such application either wholly or in part,
record its reasons for such rejection."
</p><p id="p_126">        Further,  it  is  to  be  stated  that  because  of  urbanization   or
industrialization the noise pollution may in some area of a city/town might be
exceeding  permissible limits - prescribed under the rules, but that would not
be a ground for permitting others to increase the same by beating of drums  or
by  use of voice amplifiers, loudspeakers or by such other musical instruments
and, therefore, rules prescribing reasonable restrictions including the  rules
for  the use of loudspeakers and voice amplifiers framed under the Madras Town
Nuisance Act, 1889 and also  the  Noise  Pollution  (Regulation  and  Control)
Rules, 2000 are required to be enforced.  There is lack of awareness among the
citizens as well as the Implementation Authorities about the Rules or its duty
to implement  the  same.  Noise polluting activities which are rampant and yet
for one reason or the other, the aforesaid rules or  the  rules  framed  under
various State Police Acts are not enforced."

NADU [1997 MLJ (Crl) 142] decided by another Division  Bench  of  this  Court,
consisting of  SWAMI, C.J.  and LAKSHMANAN, J (as the learned Judge then was),
a right to take Vinayaga idol in  procession  along  a  particular  route  was
claimed.   The  Bench  held  that  it was not an absolute right but subject to
regulation and imposition of restrictions.  The Bench  pointed  out  that  the
rights  guaranteed under Arts.19(1)(b), 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India
could not be claimed as absolute rights and observed that any right claimed as
absolute right would not be exercisable as there would be  no  orderliness  in
exercising  such a right and as a result thereof it would affect the rights of
the other persons who also enjoyed similar rights  that  Articles  25  and  26
opened  with  the  words  'subject  to public order, morality and health' that
temporary orders for prohibition of meeting or procession to prevent  imminent
breach of peace were reasonable restrictions.

plaintiff  brought  an  action for injunction against the defendant for having
let his house to people to perform Pujas on which  occasions  loud  music  and
noise  in  connection with the ceremonies caused such disturbance as to amount
to an actionable nuisance and it was actually found that the  noise  was  such
that  it  prevented  the  people in the neighbourhood from having proper sleep
during nights.  It was held that since there could be no doubt that the  noise
in  the  case  was  not  produced by ordinary music but by loud and discordant
instruments like the tom-tom, cymbals, and so on, and when such noise was made
long after the hour when people would ordinarily  retire  for  the  night,  it
should necessarily  amount  to an actionable nuisance.  There were two English
decisions referred to by the learned judge.  It would be  worthwhile  to  cull
out the material portions from those judgments.

common  law,  it  is  not  necessary  to  establish  that a civil action would
succeed.  Examples of noise held to  constitute  a  nuisance  include  barking
dogs,  quarry  machinery,  overnight  use  of  facilities provided by a garage
forecourt, amplified music from a pub and noise made by poultry.    Where  the
noise  is caused maliciously, this is taken into account in determining if the
noise constitutes a nuisance."

served in respect of noise emitted from a dwelling, and that at  any  time  in
the period
specified  in  the  notice  and  exceeds  the permitted level as measured from
within the complainant's dwelling.

things near human habitation and the pollution control has to immediately find
means to check this very unhealthy practice.
</p><p id="p_138">                33.  In BAMFORD v.    TURNLEY  [(1862)  3  B.    &amp;<a href="/doc/597714/" id="a_35"> S.  66</a>] the
plaintiff complained of the smoke and smell arising from the burning of bricks
by the defendant on his land not far from  the  plaintiff's  house.    At  the
trial, Lord  COCKBURN  C.J.    directed  the jury, on the authority of HOLE v.
BARLOW (1858) 4 C.B.  (N.S.) 334; 140 E.R.  1113, that if  they  thought  that
the  spot  was convenient and proper, and the burning of bricks was, under the
circumstances, a reasonable  use  by  the  defendant  of  his  own  land,  the
defendant would be entitled to a verdict, independently of the small matter of
whether there  was  an interference with the plaintiff's comfort thereby.  The
jury accordingly found a verdict for the defendant.  The plaintiff moved for a
rule calling upon the defendant to show cause why  a  verdict  should  not  be
entered for the plaintiff for 40s., but the Court of Queen's Bench refused the
rule.
</p>
<p id="p_139">WILLIAMS, J.:   ....    If  it  be  good law, that the fitness of the locality
prevents the carrying on of  an  offensive  trade  from  being  an  actionable
nuisance,  it appears necessarily to follow that this must be a reasonable use
of the land.  But if it is not good law, and if the  true  doctrine  is,  that
whenever,  taking  all  the  circumstances  into  consideration, including the
nature and extent of the plaintiff's enjoyment before the acts complained  of,
the  annoyance  is sufficiently great to amount to a nuisance according to the
ordinary rule of law, an action will lie, whatever the locality may  be,  then
surely  the  jury cannot properly be asked whether the causing of the nuisance
was a reasonable use of the land.
</p>
<p id="p_140">POLLOCK C.B.  (dissenting):  I do not think that the  nuisance  for  which  an
action will lie is capable of any legal definition which will be applicable to
all cases  and  useful  in deciding them.  The question so entirely depends on
the surrounding circumstances - the place where, the time  when,  the  alleged
nuisance,  what,  the  mode  of  committing  it,  how, and the duration of it,
whether temporary or permanent, occasional  or  continual  -  as  to  make  it
impossible  to  lay  down  any rule of law applicable to every case, and which
will also be useful in assisting a jury to come to a satisfactory  conclusion:
it  must  at  all  times  be  a  question  of  fact  with reference to all the
circumstances of the case.
</p><p id="p_141">        Most certainly in my judgment it  cannot  be  laid  down  as  a  legal
proposition or doctrine, that anything which, under any circumstances, lessens
the comfort or endangers the health or safety of a neighbour, must necessarily
be an  actionable  nuisance.  That may be a nuisance in Grosvenor Square which
would be none in Smithfield Market, that may be a  nuisance  at  midday  which
would  not  be  so  at midnight, that may be a nuisance which is permanent and
continual which would be no nuisance if temporary or occasional only.  A clock
striking the hour, or a bell ringing for  some  domestic  purpose,  may  be  a
nuisance,  if  unreasonably  loud and discordant, of which the jury alone must
judge; but although not unreasonably loud, if the owner,  from  some  whim  or
caprice,  made  the  clock  strike the hour every 10 minutes, or the bell ring
continually, I think a jury would be justified in considering it to be a  very
great nuisance.   In general, a kitchen chimney, suitable to the establishment
to which it belonged, could not be deemed a  nuisance,  but  if  built  in  an
inconvenient  place or manner, on purpose to annoy the neighbours, it might, I
think, very properly be treated as one.  The compromises that belong to social
life, and upon which the peace and comfort of it  mainly  depend,  furnish  an
indefinite number of examples where some apparent natural right is invaded, or
some  enjoyment  abridged,  to  provide  for  the  more general convenience or
necessities of the whole community; and I think the more the  details  of  the
question  are examined the more clearly it will appear that all the law can do
is to lay down some general and vague proposition which will be  no  guide  to
the jury in each particular case that may come before them.

sources,  inter  alia,  industrial  activity, construction activity, generator
sets, loudspeakers, public address systems, music systems, vehicular horns and

psychological well being of the people; it is considered necessary to regulate
and  control  noise  producing  and  generating  sources with the objective of
maintaining the ambient air quality standards in respect of noise."
</p>
<p id="p_148">The other material rules have already been set out from the  judgment  of  the

</p><p id="p_149">                35.   It  is  a  sad  reflection  on the state of affairs that
statutory authorities have to be, very often, told what their duties are.
</p>
<p id="p_150">                36.  In REGINA v.  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE OF  THE  METROPOLIS,
Ex parte BLACKBURN [1968 2 QB 118] it has been stated as follows:
</p><p id="p_151">        "...   mandamus  is a very wide remedy which has always been available
against public officers to see that they do their public duty.  It went in the
old days against justices of the peace both in their  judicial  and  in  their
administrative functions.    The legal status of the Commissioner of Police of
the metropolis is still that he is a justice  of  the  peace,  as  well  as  a
constable.   No doubt the party who applies for mandamus must show that he has
sufficient interest to be  protected  and  that  there  is  no  other  equally
convenient remedy.    But  once  this  is  shown,  the  remedy  of mandamus is
available, in case of need, even against the Commissioner  of  Police  of  the
Metropolis.
</p><p id="p_152">        ...But the day  of  reckoning  is  at  hand.    ....   The law must be
sensibly interpreted so as to give effect to the intentions of Parliament; and
the police must see that it is enforced.  The rule of law must prevail."
SALMON L.J.  In my judgment the police owe the public a clear  legal  duty  to
enforce  the  law  -  a  duty  which  I have no doubt they recognise and which
generally they perform most conscientiously and efficiently.  In the extremely
unlikely event, however, of the police failing or refusing to carry out  their
duty, the court would not be powerless to intervene.
</p><p id="p_153">EDMUND DAVIES  L.J.    - Thomas Fuller in the seventeenth-century asserted "Be
you never so high, the law is above you".    ........    the  law  enforcement
officers  of  this country certainly owe a legal duty to the public to perform
those functions which are the raison d'etre of their existence.   How  and  by
whom that duty can be enforced is another matter, and it may be that a private
citizen,  such as the applicant, having no special or peculiar interest in the
due discharge of the duty under consideration, has himself no legal  right  to
enforce it.    But  that is widely different from holding that no duty exists,
enforceable either by a relator action or  in  some  other  manner  which  may
hereafter have to be determined.
</p><p id="p_154">                37.  The public interest litigation serves two public purposes
</p><p id="p_155">-  (1)  in  highlighting the very real anxiety which many responsible citizens
manifestly entertain as to  the  adequacy  of  the  steps  hitherto  taken  to
determinate  a  shocking  and  growing  cancer in the body politic; and (2) in
clarifying the duty of the police in relation to law enforcement generally.

<p id="p_156">                38.  The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/666476/" id="a_43">STATE OF M.P.  vs..  KEDIA LEATHER &amp;
LIQUOR LTD</a>.  [(2001) 9 SCC 605] has held that the  statutory  authorities  are
required  to  discharge  their functions without there being any directions by
the Court in that respect.  The Supreme Court has expressed dismay that if the
statutory  authorities  fail  to  discharge  their  functions  by  overlooking
apparent defaults, no purpose would be served in maintaining them.
</p>
<p id="p_157">                39.  Laws alone cannot serve the purpose except increasing the
thickness of  the  statute book, if they are not strictly enforced.  As far as
implementation of laws is concerned we are still far behind in  achieving  our
goal.
</p><p id="p_158">                The sanctions are to be rigid and greater responsibilities are
to be imposed on authorities to implement laws.

respondent  has  given an undertaking that he will not apply for permission to

Nehru Street, Karaikal.  This undertaking, as desired by him, is recorded.  In
view  of the authoritative pronouncement by the Supreme Court in CHURCH OF GOD

<p id="p_162">                42.  <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_46">Article 51-A</a> was added to the Constitution  by  the  42nd
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_47">Amendment  Act</a>,  1976  in  accordance with the recommendations of Swaran Singh
Committee to bring  our  Constitution  in  line  with  <a href="/doc/421731/" id="a_48">Article  29(1)</a>  of  the
Universal  Declaration  of  Human Rights and the Constitutions of Japan, China
and the then U.S.S.R, the idea being that the individual should  not  overlook
his duties  to  the  community  in  exercise  of  his fundamental rights.  The
Committee suggested empowering Parliament to impose punishment for  breach  of
such duties.    The  suggestion  was, however, not accepted while drafting the
Bill.
</p><p id="p_163"><a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_49">Article 51-A</a> runs as follows:
</p><p id="p_164">"It shall be the duty of every citizen of India-
</p><p id="p_165">        (a)  to  abide  by  the  Constitution  and  respect  its   ideal   and

</p><p id="p_168">        (d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon

</p><p id="p_169">        (e) to promote harmony and the spirit of  common  brotherhood  amongst
all  the  people  of  India transcending religious; linguistic and regional or
sectional diversities; to renounce practices  derogatory  to  the  dignity  of
women;
</p><p id="p_170">        (f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;
</p><p id="p_171">        (g)  to protect and improve the natural environment including forests,

</p><p id="p_174">        (j)  to  strive  towards  excellence  in all spheres of individual and
collective activity, so that the nation constantly rises to higher  levels  of
endeavour and achievement."
</p>
<p id="p_175">                43.  In  the words of the Dr.  Durgadas Basu in his Commentary
on the Constitution of India:
</p><p id="p_176">"The citizen, it is expected, should be his own monitor while  exercising  and
enforcing  his  fundamental  rights,  -  remembering  that  he owes the duties
specified in <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_50">Article 51-A</a> to the State and that if he does not  care  for  his
duties, he  should  not  deserve the rights.  For instance, a person who burns
the Constitution, in violation of the duty in <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_51">Article 51-A(a</a>),  cannot  assert
that  the  meeting  or  assembly at which it was burnt by way of demonstration
against the Government should be protected by the  freedom  of  expression  or
assembly guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_52">Article 19.</a>  Of course, the duty as such is not legally
enforceable in the Courts; but if the State makes a law to prohibit any act or
conduct  in  violation of any of the duties, the Courts would uphold that as a
reasonable restriction on the relevant fundamental right,  just  as  they  did
uphold  any  law  implementing a Directive Principle under the Constitution of
1949, i.e.  before the insertion and expansion of <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_53">Article 31-C."</a>
</p>
<p id="p_177">                44.  Liberty is not a  personal  affair  only,  but  a  social
contract.  It is an accommodation of interests.  In matters which do not touch
anybody else's  liberty,  of  course,  one  may  be as free as he likes.  Such
persons have a whole kingdom in which they rule  alone,  could  do  what  they
choose, be  wise  or ridiculous, harsh or easy, conventional or odd.  But when
they step out of that  kingdom,  their  personal  liberty  of  action  becomes
qualified by  other  people's  liberty.    A  reasonable consideration for the
rights or feelings of others is the foundation of social conduct.
</p><p id="p_178">                        (A.G.GARDINER - ON THE RULE OF THE ROAD)

"It is in the small matters of conduct, in the observance of the rule  of  the
road,  that we pass judgment upon ourselves, and declare that we are civilised
or uncivilised.  The great moments of heroism and sacrifice are rare.   It  is
the  little  habits  of  commonplace intercourse that make up the great sum of
life and sweeten or make bitter the journey."
</p>
<p id="p_179">                45.  Where do human rights begin?  In small  places  close  to
home,  so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any map of the world.
Yet they are the world of the individual person; the neighbourhood he lives in
.....  factory, farm or office where he works.   Such  are  the  places  where
every  man and woman and child seeks justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity
without discrimination.  Unless these rights have  meaning  there,  they  have
little meaning anywhere.
</p>
<p id="p_180">                46.   It  is  the duty of the State to protect the fundamental
right to life of the citizen.  <a href="/doc/78536/" id="a_54">In  F.C.    MULLIN  v.    ADMINISTRATOR,  UNION
TERRITORY OF DELHI</a> [(1981) 1 SCC 608].  It has been held as follows:
</p><p id="p_181">        "The  right  to life includes the right to live with human dignity and
all that goes along with it, namely, the bare  necessities  of  life  such  as
adequate  nutrition,  clothing and shelter and facilities for reading, writing
and expressing oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about  and  mixing  and
commingling with  fellow  human  beings...  Every act which offends against or
impairs human dignity would constitute deprivation pro tanto of this right  to
live..."
</p>
<p id="p_182">                47.   Rule  of  law  more than anything else requires that all
laws as enacted by Parliament and State Legislatures be faithfully executed by
officials, that orders of  Courts  be  obeyed;  that  individuals  wishing  to
enforce  the  law  should have reasonable access to the Courts; that no person
should be  condemned  unheard,  and  that  power  should  not  be  arbitrarily
exercised.

</p><p id="p_184">                48.  As one  columnist  has  lamented:    In  India,  we  have
brilliant well thought out laws in place.  But no one enforces them.
</p>
<p id="p_185">                49.   In  our  daily  lives  discipline  has been a casuality.
There is no discipline in observing the rules - in obeying  the  laws  of  the
land  -  on  the road there is no discipline - in the bus stop, in the railway
station, given the chance we jump the queue - at signals - if the policeman is
there we stop if not no - we form several  rows  of  cars  there  is  no  road
discipline - We are impatient to wait.  The VIPs are the worst culprits.  They
have no rules to follow.  They are a law unto themselves.  The fatal accidents
involving  the  security  personnel  accompanying them in escort vehicles have
failed to make any impact on them.  Their drivers continue to  ignore  traffic
rules.   Except  in  emergencies,  they  should not be allowed to have the red
lights on.  The despicable philosophy of 'might is right' should make  way  to
the wholesome 'rule of law'.  It is heartening to note that recently one Chief
Minister  blew  the  fuse  and  banned the use of red lights and sirens by all
VVIPs using official and non-official vehicles.  Only  the  Governor  and  the
judiciary have been spared.
</p>
<p id="p_186">                50.    We  cry  hoarse  about  our  fundamental  rights  being
