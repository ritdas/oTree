	The writ petition has been preferred by the petitioner Association against the proceedings No.TNPCB/DEE/CHN/PB/Z-111 dated 11.3.2002 issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_2">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2.  The grievance of the Association is that the Pollution Control Board is interfering with the matter of petroleum outlets, by issuing such notice to its members.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3.  According to the learned counsel appearing on behalf of M/s. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., the consent of the Pollution Control Board is not required for opening a petrol bunk, as, it no manner pollutes either water or air.  It is stated that only in cases where servicing centre is located within the petrol bunk, it is advised to obtain consent from the Pollution Control Board, as effluent  may be discharged on cleaning and washing of car and motor bikes.
</p><p id="p_4">	4.  Similar stand has been taken by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the third respondent and fourth respondent, viz. M/s. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and M/s. Bharath Petroleum Corporation Ltd. respectively.   According to him, no consent is required from the Pollution Control Board for running the petrol bunk and the Pollution Control Board has no jurisdiction to issue such notice. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5. The learned counsel for the Pollution Control Board requested to dismiss the writ petition on the ground that it has been filed by the Association of petroleum dealers and not by the individuals who have been served with the notice.  But, there being public interest involved in the matter, we are not inclined to dismiss the writ petition on such ground.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	6. It is submitted on behalf of the Pollution Control Board that while dispensing the stored petroleum products to the consumers vehicle, there is every possibility of spillage of petroleum products. This results in ground water pollution, either by way of washing away by rain water or direct percolation into the ground, thereby polluting the precious ground water sources available.  Apart from this, if there is any leakage from underground petroleum product storage tanks, it will also lead to pollution of ground water. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">	7.  The above submission cannot be accepted, as the notice does not relates to pollution of ground water nor any such allegation has been made in the impugned notice dated 11.3.2002 and such notice has been given only under the  Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.  The non application of mind of the Pollution Control Board will be evident from the notice dated 11.3.2002, which is quoted hereunder:
</p><p id="p_8">	"The Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as amended in 1987 is enforced in Tamilnadu.  The Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board enforces the above Act.  Entire State of Tamilnadu has been declared as Air Pollution Control Area as required under the Act.
</p><p id="p_9">	As per the existing Acts and rules all the units whose activities result in emission of air pollutants in the air pollution control area should obtain prior consent of the Board.
</p><p id="p_10">	<a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_6">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as amended in 1987 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) prohibits any person from operating any plant for the purpose of any industry in an Air Pollution Control Area without the consent of the Board.  Contravention of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_8">Section 21</a> is an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_9">Section 37</a> of the Act with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year and six months but which may extent to six years and with fine and in case the failure continues, with an additional fine 

which may exceed to five thousand rupees from every day during which such failure continues after the conviction for the first such failure.

it was noticed that the spillage of petroleum products and lubricants leads to hydrocarbon emissions which pollutes the air.  Hydrocarbon emission has also been noted through the vent attached to the underground storage tanks and also the fuelling nozzle of the pump.  The dispensing of petrol with addition of 'loose' oil to two stroke, two and three wheelers leads to the emission of unburnt fuel as well as high concentration of CO and hydrocarbon.  Further the high concentration of benezene in petrol leads to atmospheric air pollution.
</p><p id="p_13">	The unit is also operating without the consent of the Board as required under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_10">Section 21</a> of the said Act, since the occupier of the said petrol bunk premises has not obtained prior consent of the Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board and thereby violating the provisions of the said Act. 
</p><p id="p_14">	Hence, you are directed to show cause within 15 days from the date of receipt of this notice as, to why penal action for an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_11">section 37</a> of the Act should not be initiated against you for operating the unit in the air pollution control area without 

air pollution control measures and without obtaining the consent of the Board and for violation of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_12">Section 21</a> of the said Act and also issue directions under 31<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_13">A of the Act</a> for closure of the unit, stoppage of power supply etc., to it.
</p><p id="p_15">	It is informed that non-receipt of any reply within the prescribed period will be construed as you are having no satisfactory explanation to offer for the above contravention and action will be taken against you on merits in accordance with law."
</p>
<p id="p_16">	8.  From the said notice, it will be evident that the Pollution Control Board has not stated anything as to the date on which inspection was made, whether it was made in the presence of the petitioner and who has submitted a report that spillage of petroleum products and lubricants leads to hydrocarbon emission which pollutes the air.  In the common life, every day, persons are visiting petroleum outlets for filling up petrol or petroleum gas for their vehicles.  If spillage of petroleum products and lubricants leads to hydrocarbon emission, in that case, it may be stated that there will be hydrocarbon emission even in the matter of filling up the petroleum products in the vehicle.  But, that is not generally found, nor reported anywhere in India.  
</p>
<p id="p_17">	9.  In this background, we are of the view that without application of mind, the Pollution Control Board has issued the impugned notice dated 11.3.2002.  Further, this Court is of the opinion that before deciding the question whether it is mandatory to have consent from the concerned State Pollution Control Board for opening a petroleum bunk, it is desirable that the Pollution Control Board should discuss the matter with petroleum companies, who are well versed with the ill effect of spillage of petroleum products and lubricants.  The petroleum companies and other companies like Oil and Natural Gas Company etc. are the expert bodies.  Their opinion should be taken by the Pollution Control Board before taking any such decision.
</p>
<p id="p_18">	For the reasons stated above, we set aside the impugned notice dated 11.3.2002 and allow the writ petition.  However, there shall be no order to costs.  Consequently, WPMP No.15500 of 2002 is closed.
