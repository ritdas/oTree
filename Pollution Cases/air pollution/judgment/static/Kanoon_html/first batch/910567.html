<p id="p_1">Heard
	learned Advocates for the parties.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_2">Gujarat
	Pollution Control Board through its Assistant Legal Officer  
	original complainant has approached this Court under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_1">Section 378</a> of
	the Code of Criminal Procedure challenging the order of acquittal
	dated 03.07.1993 passed by Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad
	in Criminal Case No.1705/1989 acquitting the accused respondent
	hereinabove of the charge of committing offences punishable under
	<a href="/doc/1445515/" id="a_2">Section 39</a> read with <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_3">Section 40</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control
	of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 hereinafter referred as the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">AIR Act</a> for the
	sake of brevity.  The facts in brief leading to filing of this
	appeal deserve to be set out as under.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_3">The
	complainant is Assistant Legal Officer of Gujarat Pollution Control
	Board, Ahmedabad.  The accused no.1 is a Private Limited Company
	running in the name of Kashiram Textile Mills Private Limited,
	accused no.2 and 3 are directors of the said company and those
	responsible for the business of the company which is stated to have
	engaged in processing synthetic clothes.  The present complainant
	was compelled to file a complaint before the Chief Metropolitan
	Magistrate's Court against the accused respondents as according to
	him and according to the Board, the accused had committed offences
	by not complying with provisions of <a href="/doc/81321022/" id="a_6">Section 26(1)</a> read with Rule
	12(1) of the Act and rules made thereunder and therefore, incurred
	liability to be convicted and punished under <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_7">Section 39</a> and <a href="/doc/506633/" id="a_8">Section
	40</a> of the AIR Act. The accused no.1 was granted consent for carrying
	out its operations vide order and letter dated 30.04.1986.  The said
	consent was accorded on terms and conditions mentioned thereunder. 
	As per provision of <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_9">Section 26</a>, the Board or its empowered employee
	has power to take sample by air or emission and it prescribes
	procedures for collecting the sample of the emission.  Rule 12(1) of
	the Gujarat Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1983
	makes it incumbent upon the occupier and the trade to have port
	holes or devices so as to enable the inspecting staff or the Board
	to collect the sample of emission. The accused respondent No.1 did
	not have any device to reach up to the top of the chimney and
	collect the sample of emission being emitted therefrom.  The factory
	premises was visited by the complainant on 06.05.1989 and was unable
	to collect the sample on account of non-availability of those
	facilities which were prescribed under Rule 12 and which were
	compulsorily to be provided by accused No.1 on his premises.  The
	Court after appreciating the evidence came to the conclusion that
	vital documentary evidence going to the root of the matter namely
	notification declaring the area to be air pollution areas had not
	come on record.  The Court therefore, recorded the acquittal and
	passed the acquittal order dated 03.07.1993 which is impugned in the
	present appeal under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_10">Section 378</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_4">Mr.
</p><p id="p_5">	K.L. Dave learned Advocate appearing for the appellant-Board
	contended that the defaulters data sheet as well as the testimony of
	the original complainant go to show that the existing notification
	which has been referred and relied upon in unequivocal terms
	inasmuch even the notification no. is mentioned, the date of
	issuance is mentioned.  Therefore, it was the Courts duty to take it
	to be existing covering the present industry also.  Therefore, Mr.
	Dave further submitted that the industry ought to take consent for
	running the industry in itself pre-supposes that the area wherein
	industry is located was falling under the pollution control area as
	declared by the State under <a href="/doc/1384966/" id="a_11">Section 19</a> of the AIR Act.  In view of
	this and in view of the pointed question put to the complainant with
	regard to the non publication and / or lack of evidence to show the
	notification being published and the complainant's answer that the
	notification was published in two daily newspapers should have been
	sufficient for establishing the factum with regard to existence of
	notification and declaration of area to be  Pollution Control Area
	and when these factors are said to have been proved, then the
	violation was very much clear upon the factors of the case inasmuch
	as it is an admitted position that there was no facility to reach
	upto the end of the chimney for collecting the emission and/or any
	air emitted through the chimney.  In view of this, the order of
	acquittal deserves to be quashed and set aside and appropriate
	conviction order with punishment be passed.  Mr. Dave further
	submitted that the accused need to be dealt with sternly and there
	being period of three years available to the accused for providing
	such facilities as the consent was given three years prior to the
	date of inspection, i.e. 06.05.1989, they did not provide any
	facility which was incumbent upon them as per provision of Rule 12
	of the Air Pollution Rules.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_6">Mr.
</p><p id="p_7">	K.V. Shelat learned Advocate for the respondent submitted that the
	breach is sought to be pleaded on the basis of issuance of
	notification copy whereof has not been produced at all before the
	Court.  The criminal liability cannot be fastened upon anyone
	without there being cogent evidence available clearly pointing to
	the guilt of the accused.  In instant case, the defence who asked
	pointed question to complainant that no such notification is
	existing and/or and it was a fresh publication, the answer came with
	there was a publication. That means when the question of
	notification was questioned, it was duty cast upon the prosecution
	to make their case good based upon production and proof of the said
	notification.  In absence of notification and proof thereof, the
	entire exercise was an exercise in futility.  In a criminal trial,
	the presumption with regard to existence of document even if it is
	in form  of a notification is not permissible, unless and until, it
	is proved that the same would be basis for determining the guilt or
	no guilt on part of the accused.  Mr. Shelat in response to the
	statement with regard to accused taking consent and therefore,
	prosecution's duty to direct them for production of document being
	restricted, he submitted that the mere existence of notification is
	not sufficient.  As per Rule 8 of the AIR Pollution Rules, proper
	publication is required to such notification so that public at large
	may have knowledge thereof.  So it was the duty cast upon the
	prosecution impugned to establish the promulgation and publication
	of the notification in question. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_8">This
	Court has heard the learned Advocates and perused the record and
	proceedings.  The Court is unable to agree with the submission of
	Mr. Dave for reversing the order of acquittal for the following
	reasons :-
</p>	 


	 

<p id="p_9">The
	allegation in the complaint revolves around the non-providing of a
	facility for reaching the upper end of the chimney for collecting
	the sample of emission.  It was contended that providing of facility
	for the inspecting staff to reach the upper end of the chimney is
	under Rule 12 of the AIR Pollution Rules. The accused no.1
	therefore, was under obligation to make provision so as to enable
	the inspection staff to reach at the upper end of the chimney for
	collecting the sample of the emission.  The non-providing of the
	same is amounting to violation of Rule 12 which in turn was
	violative of <a href="/doc/935528/" id="a_12">Section 26(1)</a> and hence, punishment under <a href="/doc/1255168/" id="a_13">Section 39</a>
	and <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_14">Section 40</a> of the AIR Pollution Act and Rules.  At this stage,
	it is of much importance to note that on coming into force of the
	<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Air Pollution Act</a>, the State is empowered to notify and declare
	certain areas or area within the State to be air pollution control
	area for the purpose of this Act.  Thus, <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_16">Section 19</a> pre-supposes
	possibility of declaration of area to be pollution control area or
	area and alteration of such area and/or revocation of such
	notification for such areas.  Rule 8 of AIR Pollution Rules provides
	manner of promulgating such notification.  The publication  makes it
	incumbent upon the State to have the notification gazetted and
	published in such a fashion as to make people of the area aware
	about the promulgation of such notification so as to make the Act
	and its provisions applicable.  The detailed reading of <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_17">Section 19</a>
	and the relevant provisions would go to show that norms of apparatus
	and standards for emissions are to be prescribed dependent upon the
	local and physical requirements of the area wherein the Act is to be
	made applicable.  Thus,   this practice would go to show that when
	someone is to be visited with serious breach as alleged, offence
	proved against the Trade, the company or its Director, then the
	prosecution was under duty to produce and prove the notification and
	the norms etc. prescribed thereunder.  The Court has to add here in
	the instant case the norms would not have been so important looking
	to the nature of the breach alleged but existence of notification
	and the dates are very important.  At this stage it is important to
	note as submitted by Mr. Shelat for the respondents, that in
	Paragraph 5 of the complaint, it is stated that the factory premises
	was visited on 06.05.1989 and the testimony of the P.W.-1, i.e.
	original complainant which has come on record, as could be seen from
	Page 31 of the paper book that the notification was published in
	Gazette dated 06.08.1989, i.e. subsequent to the date on which the
	factory was visited. This is sufficient to show that prosecution did
	not have a cast iron case so as to prove the guilt on part of the
	accused.  That there could be some mistake in mentioning and
	incorporating the dates or making reference to the notification as
	the consent is admittedly accorded to the company way back in the
	year 1998 but this is sufficient evidence to deal a serious blow to
	the case of the prosecution. In such a situation, prosecution was
	under obligation to explain properly this apparent discrepancy.  In
	view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the Court is of the
	view that the order of acquittal, in exercise of powers under
	<a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_18">Section 378</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not call for any
	interference.  In the end, the appeal fails and is hereby rejected.
