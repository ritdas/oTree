<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
 

Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee, J.
</p> 

<p id="p_2">1. In this writ application, the petitioner, a religious organisation, claims that the respondents should not interfere with the right of user of microphones, loud-speakers, and for amplifying human voice and for amplifying other sounds while playing daily pujas and other religious activities and display of religious songs. The petitioner prayed for a writ in the nature of Mandamus commanding the District Magistrate and/or the Sub-Divisional Officer, Ghatal, to accord necessary permission in favour of the said society in terms of <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_1">Section 34A</a> of the Police Act, 1963, (West Bengal Amendment).
</p> 

<p id="p_3">2. The point raised in this writ application is of great public importance and significance. <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_2">Section 34A</a> of the Police Act, 1861, as amended by the <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_3">West Bengal Act</a> 38 of 1963, reads as follows:
</p>  

<p id="p_4">"34A. Power to prohibit, restrict, regulate or impose conditions on the use of microphones, etc., (1) If, in the opinion of the Magistrate of the district or any Sub-Divisional Magistrate or Magistrate of the first class, it is necessary so to do for the purpose of preventing annoyance to, or injury to the health of, the public or any section thereof, or for the purpose of maintaining public peace and tranquillity, he may, by order, prohibit, restrict, regulate or impose conditions on, the use or operation, in any area with his jurisdiction or in any vehicle within such area of microphones, loud-speakers or other apparatus for amplifying human voice or for amplifying music or other sounds.
</p> 

<p id="p_5">(2) The State Government may, on its own motion or on the representation of any person or persons aggrieved, modify, alter or cancel any order made under Sub-section(l).
</p> 

<p id="p_6">(3) A police officer, not below the rank of Sub-Inspector, may take such steps or use such force as may be reasonably necessary for securing compliance with any order made under Sub-section (1) or any such order as modified or altered by the State Government under Sub-section (2) and may seize any microphone, loud-speaker or other apparatus used or operated in contravention of the order."
</p> 

<p id="p_7">3. It is the case of the petitioner that microphones are required by the society during puja performance, arati, nitya puja, etc., and that nobody ever raised any objection to the performance of the aforesaid religious activities in the manner and in the way as had been done, but the Sub-Divisional Officer, Ghatal, directed the petitioner/society not to use any microphone while performing puja and other religious activities without serving any notice in the month of September, 1993.
</p> 

<p id="p_8">4. It also appears that the petitioner filed an application before the Sub-Divisional Officer, Ghatal, on October 11, 1993, so that permission would be granted in favour of the said society for use of microphones.
</p> 

<p id="p_9">5. Similar application was filed by the petitioner before the Circle Inspector of Police, Ghatal, on 17th October, 1993, so that necessary permission may be granted in favour of the said society for the use of the microphones for the aforesaid purpose.
</p> 

<p id="p_10">6. The petitioner has alleged inaction on the part of the District Magistrate or the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to deal with and dispose of the petitioner's application for permission to use microphone.
</p> 

<p id="p_11">7. <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_4">Section 34A</a> of the Police Act, 1861, provided power to prohibit, restrict, regulate or impose conditions on the use of microphones, if in the opinion of the Magistrate of the District or any Sub-Divisional Magistrate or a Magistrate of the First Class it is necessary so to do for the purpose of preventing annoyance or injury to health of the public or any section thereof or for the purpose of maintaining public peace and tranquillity, such officer may, by an order, prohibit, restrict or regulate or impose conditions on the use or operation in any area within his jurisdiction or in any vehicle within such area of microphones or loudspeakers or other apparatus for amplifying human voice or for amplifying music and other sounds.
</p> 

<p id="p_12">8. Under Sub-section (3) thereof, the police officer not below the rank of Sub-Inspector, may also take such steps or use such force as may be reasonably necessary for securing compliance with any order made under Sub-section (1) and may also take penal action.
</p> 

<p id="p_13">9. It is not in dispute that for use of microphones permission is required from the authorities and that the authority, it appears that, is the sole authority to allow or not to disallow and/or to prohibit and/or to restrict, regulate and/or to control the use of microphones.
</p> 

<p id="p_14">10. The rights of the petitioner or any association, religious or otherwise, cannot be said to be absolute, nor it can be said that the District Magistrate, Sub-Divisional Officer or the police authorities are the absolute authority in the matter of granting of such permission without having any regard to other factors.
</p> 

<p id="p_15">11. <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_5">Article 19(1)(a)</a> provides Fundamental Rights on all citizens to Freedom of Speech and Expression, and that this right is only subject to restriction imposable under <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_6">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution. The reasonable restriction on the exercise of freedom of speech and expression could be imposed in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with the foreign State, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of Court, defamation, incitement to an offence.
</p> 

<p id="p_16">12. The freedom of speech and expression of a citizen should not be interfered with save and except in accordance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_7">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution. It is a matter to consider whether the public are captive audience or listeners when permission is given for using loud-speakers in public and the person who is otherwise unwilling to bear the sound and/or the music or the communication made by the loud-speakers, but he is compelled to tolerate all these things against his will and health. If permission is granted to use microphones at a louder voice, such a course of action takes away the rights of a citizen to speak with others, the right to read or the right to know and the right to sleep and rest or to think any matter. Can it be said that a person and/or an organization simply applying a permission and after obtaining permission is entitled to display loud-speakers from local authorities? Does it concern simply a law and order situation? Does it not generate sound pollution? Does it not affect the other known rights of a citizen? Even if a citizen is ill and even if such a sound may create adverse effect on his physical and mental condition, yet he is made a captive audience to listen.
</p> 

<p id="p_17">13. Freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_8">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India includes, by necessary implication, freedom not to listen and/or to remain silent. One cannot exercise his right at the cost and in total deprivation of others' rights. A right cannot be conferred by the authorities concerned upon a person or a religious organization to exercise their rights suspending and/or taking away the rights of others.
</p> 

<p id="p_18">14. In this connection, Mr. Samanta, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, submitted that right to propagate religion is guaranteed under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_9">Article 25</a> of the Constitution. <a href="/doc/86224/" id="a_10">Article 25(1)</a> of the Constitution provides that subject to public order, morality and health and to other provisions of Part-Ill of the Constitution, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience, and that right to freely profess, practise and propagate religion.
</p> 

<p id="p_19">15. It is well-settled that the right to propagate one's religion means the right to communicate a person's belief to another or to expose the tenets of that faith. The question is whether the right to propagate religion includes the right to use loud-speakers and microphones for the purpose of chanting religious tenets or religious texts and/or the indiscriminate use of microphones or loud-speakers during religious performance in the society.
</p> 

<p id="p_20">16. Freedom of speech is guaranteed to every citizen so that he may reach with the minds of willingness and not coerced unwillingness.
</p> 

<p id="p_21">17. There cannot be any dispute that sound is a known source of pollution. The adverse and ill effect of sound on human body is also known. It has a tremendous impact on the nervous system of human being.
</p> 

<p id="p_22">18. The American Supreme Court, in the case of Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 US 781, upheld the city regulations designed to regulate the volume of excessively amplified music at the Naumberg Acoustic Bandshell in New York City's Central Park, to protect those who use a quiet, recreational area of the park called the Sheep Meadow and also to protect resistance in Central Park West area.
</p> 

<p id="p_23">19. In this case, the American Supreme Court rejected the challenge to these city noise regulations.
</p> 

<p id="p_24">20. The religion that has been performed by the petitioner and others, is nothing new, but the same is there for several centuries. It cannot be said that the religious teachers or the spiritual leaders who had laid down these tenets, had any way desired the use of microphones as a means of performance of religion. Undoubtedly, one can practise, profess and propagate religion, as guaranteed under <a href="/doc/86224/" id="a_11">Article 25(1)</a> of the Constitution, but that is not an absolute right. The provisions of <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_12">Article 25</a> is subject to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_13">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution. On true and proper construction of the provisions of <a href="/doc/86224/" id="a_14">Article 25(1</a>), read with <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_15">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution, it cannot be said that a citizen should be coerced to hear anything which he does not like or which he does not require.
</p> 

<p id="p_25">21. Amplifier and microphone create tremendous noise and sounds which may travel at least half to one kilometre away. Having regard to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_16">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution, it cannot be said that the District Magistrate, Sub-Divisional Officer and the police authorities are the sole authority who can grant at will permission without having any regard to the fundamental rights of the fellow citizens. Such authorities, by granting permission to display microphone, cannot make the public the captive listeners. The citizens have a right enjoy lives in the way they like, without violating any of the provisions of the law. A citizen has a right to leisure, right to sleep, right not to hear and right to remain silent. He has also the right to read and speak with others. Use of microphones certainly takes away the right of the citizens to speak with others, their right to read or think or the right to sleep. There may be heart patients or patients suffering from nervous disorder may be compelled to bear this serious impact of sound pollution which has had an adverse effect on them. It may create health problems.
</p> 

<p id="p_26">22. Pollution is a factor which has now a prime importance in the modern society. The effect of sound on human bodies is very serious.
</p> 

<p id="p_27">23. Accordingly, no authority would grant permission to use microphones without having any regard to the rights of the fellow citizens or the people of the area. Such a sound pollution cannot be altogether stopped, but the sound level has to be reduced in such a manner and in such a form so that the sound may not travel beyond a certain limit, as for example, in a public meeting microphones or amplifiers may be necessary so that the listeners may hear the speeches delivered by the leaders and for that purpose the sound has to be regulated in such a manner so that it may not travel beyond a reasonable limit and/or such a sound cannot be allowed to travel beyond the zone in which the listeners are there.
</p> 

<p id="p_28">24. In a religious place or congregation, the use of microphones should be limited to the persons or the followers or the disciples who are there so that they may hear and know, they may follow and understand what is meant for them. No. person and/or organization cannot be allowed to use microphones at a high noise level or without any volume control.
</p> 

<p id="p_29">25. So far as right of religious organisations to use loudspeaker or amplifier is concerned that right is not an independent right under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_17">Article 25</a> of the Constitution of India. <a href="/doc/86224/" id="a_18">Article 25(1)</a> of the Constitution of India provides that subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of this part, all persons and equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion.
</p> 

<p id="p_30">26. The Supreme Court in the case of Narendra Prasad v. State of Gujarat, , has considered the aspect of the matter that <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_19">Article 19(1)</a> confers various rights specified therein from (a) to (g) of the said Article for the citizen. The right under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_20">Article 25</a> of the Constitution is subject to the rights of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_21">Article 19.</a> This case is the clear authority for the proposition that while exercising a right under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_22">Article 25</a> no person can interfere with, take away or abridge the right of a citizen guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_23">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.
</p> 

<p id="p_31">27. Any provision of law authorising the police and/or the administration to grant permission for using of loud-speaker cannot be absolute, uncontrolled and independent of constitutional rights. All laws in this behalf are subject to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_24">Article 19</a> of the Constitution as there cannot be any law which may interfere with, abridge or take away the right as guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_25">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution save and except the provisions laid down in <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_26">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution. Use of loud-speaker cannot be said to be a reasonable restriction on the freedom of speech and expression. Even <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_27">Article 25</a> of the Constitution grants freedom of conscience and expression. Freedom of conscience is followed up by the right to free profess, practice and propagation of religion. Use of loud-speaker emanates noise which is not only a nuisance, but also a pollution. In United Kingdom for the purpose of controlling noise it is mandatory to keep a register in accordance with the regulations which is known as 'Control of Noise (Measurement and Register) Regulation, 1976 and that the said register must be open to free public inspection at the public office of the authorities at all reasonable hours and with all reasonable facilities for obtaining copies of entries at a reasonable charge. There is a specific Act known as 'Control and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_28">Pollution Act</a>, 1974'.
</p> 

<p id="p_32">28. In West Bengal there is an authority known as 'West Bengal Pollution Control Board'. The tremendous sound and/or noise emanated from use of loud-speaker has to be controlled by all means inasmuch as use of such loud-speaker and/or microphones is a serious threat to public life and health.
</p> 

<p id="p_33">29. Accordingly, it must be held that powers of the Police, District Magistrates or Sub-Divisional Officers to grant permission to use microphones is subject to certain restrictions and conditions which are necessary in order to protect and preserve a very fundamental right of citizen under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_29">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India on the following terms:
</p>  

<p id="p_34">(a) The Pollution Control Board shall maintain noise level registers for measuring the level of noise;
</p> 

<p id="p_35">(b) The said authority shall indicate the level of noise which could be permitted by use of microphones on any occasion;
</p> 

<p id="p_36">(c) Powers of the District Magistrates, Sub-Divisional Officers and other authorities are subject to any direction and/or conditions imposed by the West Bengal Pollution Board;
</p> 

<p id="p_37">(d) The person or persons or any business house dealing with or letting or selling the microphones/loud-speakers and the operating apparatus shall be bound to seal the volume and the noise level according to the directions of the Pollution Control Board, before letting or parting with or selling such apparatus for any purpose. In default thereof, they should not be permitted to deal with such items. For this purpose, the Pollution Control Board shall issue directions from time to time in this behalf.
</p>
