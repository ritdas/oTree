ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre><p id="p_1"> :
</p> 

 
 


 

<p id="p_2">1.	The
appellant - Gujarat Pollution Control Board has preferred the present
appeal u/s 378  of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and
challenged the judgment and order of acquittal rendered on 5-3-1998
by learned Chief Metropolitan   Magistrate, Ahmedabad  in Criminal
Case No. 443 of 1995 acquitting accused respondents No. 1  to 5  for
the offence punishable u/ss  43, 44  read with <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_1">Section 47</a> of the
Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution)  Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter
referred to as  the Act ).
</p> 

 
 


 

<p id="p_3">2.	According
to the prosecution case, accused No. 2  is the Manager   and accused 
No.3 to 5 are the Directors and the persons  in charge of conduct of
business of accused No.1  - Shri Ganesh Filament &amp; Fabrics
Manufacturing Pvt. Ltd.,  Narol, Ahmedabad. The accused are engaged
in the business of  processing and finishing of grey cloth. The
accused had established the factory in the year 1976. 	The accused
company  was required to obtain necessary consent before
establishment of the company  under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_3">Section 24</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_4">25</a> of the Act. The
accused company had applied for consent by application dated 
23-10-1985 before the appellant  Gujarat Pollution Control  Board but
it was refused  by their letter dated     15-1-1986. The officers of
the Board  carried out   inspection  of the plant and took sample of
water for analysis. It was found  during the inspection that as there
was no treatment  plant  polluted  water was being  discharged in 
Sabarmati River through the outlet created without the consent  of
the Board. The  sample of  water  collected was sent for analysis.
The report revealed that  the polluted matters were in excess than
the standards laid down by the Board  and hence, the prosecution was
launched against the  accused,
 

 
 


 

</p><p id="p_4">3.	Learned
trial Judge framed charge Exh. 24 against the accused for the
aforesaid offences. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charge and
hence the prosecution adduced evidence.
</p> 

 
 


 

<p id="p_5">4.	After
hearing learned A.P.P. and the learned advocate for the accused, the
learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Ankleswhar acquitted
accused giving them the benefit of doubt. Being aggrieved by the said
decision, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board has preferred this
appeal.
</p> 

 
 


 

<p id="p_6">5.	I
have heard learned advocate Mr. Sunil Mehta for the appellant and
learned A.P.P. Ms. Panchal at length and in great detail. I have also
perused the impugned judgment and record and proceeding of the  trial
court.
</p> 

 
 


 

<p id="p_7">6.	Rule
27 of the Gujarat Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules
1976 (hereinafter referred to 'the Rules, 1976 ) provides the
procedure for submitting samples to the State Water Laboratory. It
provides that :
</p> 

 
 


 

<p id="p_8">	(a)	The
sample shall be collected 	preferably 		in polythene container and
	shall be labelled 		giving the following 	details, namely :-
</p> 

<p id="p_9">	(i)		the
source, and nature of sample,
 

</p><p id="p_10">	(ii)		the
date and time of collection,
 

</p><p id="p_11">	(iii)	the
method of preservation used.
</p> 

<p id="p_12">	(b)	Atleast
 2.5   litres of       the materials 		required to be       analyse 
shall be sent 		in a 	container, the capacity    of which 		shall not
be 	less than 3 litres and not be 		more than 5 litre.
</p> 

<p id="p_13">	(c)	The
sample shall  accompany with the letter 		from the concerned
authority  and shall give 		the number of parameters to be analysed.
</p> 

<p id="p_14">	(d)	The
sample shall be preferably transported 		to the laboratory by a
messenger.
</p> 

<p id="p_15">	(e)	The
messenger shall take  receipt of sample 		from the laboratory.
</p> 

<p id="p_16">	(f)	Fees
for analyses shall be paid either  in 		advance  or at the time of
submission of 		sample.
</p> 

<p id="p_17">	(g)	The
samples shall be preserved as per the 		instruction given in
IS-2488-1966 and 1968 		(Part I, II and III) and IS-4733-1968.  
</p>
 

 
 


 

<p id="p_18">7.	The
evidence of P.W. 2 Bina J. Bhatt Exh. 11 indicates that   the tag
Exh.19 did not mention  the method of collection of sample and that
it was collected in polythene container and that  the sample was
preserved in ice.   The evidence of this witness does not clearly
indicate  the capacity  of the container in which the sample  was
collected.  It also appears from the evidence of this witness that
the sample was not preserved  as required under Rule 27 (g).
</p> 

 
 


 

<p id="p_19">8.	In
the decision  of <a href="/doc/979263/" id="a_5">Dahyabhai Kalubhai Solanki V. Devine Intermediates &amp;
Chemicals &amp; Ors</a>., reported in 1996 (1) G.L.R. 729, this Court has
held  that when requirements of Rule 27 of the  Rules 1976 are not
complied with the accused is entitled to acquittal. 
</p>
 

 
 


 

<p id="p_20">9.
	In view of above,  the evidence of P.W. 2 indicates  that   there
was breach of  Rule 27 of  the Rules 1976. Therefore,   the accused 
were entitled for acquittal and the learned Magistrate was justified
in passing the impugned judgment. 
</p>
 

 
 


 

<p id="p_21">10.	It
also appears that acquittal was recorded as there was no evidence
with regard to liability of the accused. <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_6">Section 47</a> of the Act
provides  that where an offence is  committed by a company every
person, who at the time of offence was committed was in charge of and
was responsible for the conduct of the business of the company shall
be deemed to be guilty for the offence. The evidence of P.W. 1
Dahyabhai Kalubhai Exh. 3 indicates that  he did not make inquiry
with regard to person in charge of and responsible  for the conduct
of business of the company. Therefore, there is no evidence to
indicate that accused No. 2 to 5 were in charge of and were
responsible for the conduct of the business of the company under
<a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_7">Section 47</a> of the Act. Therefore, the trial Court was justified in
acquitting the accused. 
</p>
 

 
 


 

<p id="p_22">11.	As
regards authority to file  complaint,  in the decision of M/s.
Nicosulf Industries &amp; Exports Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Another V/s. State
of Gujarat  &amp; Another reported in 2002 (2) G.L.R. 1580, this
Court held that the Chairman had no authority to file complaint. The
matter was carried to the Hon'ble Supreme Court.  The court  in
Criminal Appeal No.9 of 2002 decided on December 4, 2008,  held that
delegation to the Chairman  of the power to sanction prosecution by
the Board was valid and effective for the purpose of <a href="/doc/1650626/" id="a_8">Section 49(1)</a>
</p><p id="p_23">(a) of the Act. Therefore, the trial Court committed error in coming
to the conclusion that the complainant  had no authority to file
complaint. 
</p>
 

 
 


 

<p id="p_24">12.	For
the foregoing reasons, appeal fails
and stands dismissed and  judgment and order  of acquittal rendered
on 3-4-1998 by learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Ankleshwar
in Criminal Case No. 1755 of 1989 is confirmed.
</p>
