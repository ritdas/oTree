            W.P.(C) NOs. 16336 &amp; 21000 OF 2010
         =============================

        Dated this the 16th day of September, 2010

                        J U D G M E N T
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     Petitioner in WP(C) No.16336/10 is M/s.Cheerans Mayura

Industries (hereinafter referred to as "M/s.Cheerans" for short)

and the petitioner in WP(C) No.21000/10 is the Kerala State

Pollution Control Board (hereinafter referred to as "Board" for

short). Both have filed this writ petition challenging the order

passed by the Appellate Authority under Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a> in Appeal No.15/2008 filed by

M/s.Cheerans.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.    For convenience, I shall be referring to the documents

produced in WP(C) No.16336/10 filed by M/s.Cheerans.

</p><p id="p_3">     3.    Briefly stated, the facts of the case are that

M/s.Cheerans is engaged in the manufacture and installation of

incinerators operated using coconut shell as its fuel. It is stated

that on 6/11/2002, M/s.Cheerans filed Ext.P21 application to the

Board requesting for the issue of Board approval and certificate.

It is stated that after a long process, the Board issued to

M/s.Cheerans, Ext.P1 certificate of approval of consultant dated

WPC Nos.16336 &amp; 21000/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                :2 :</span>



7/2/2004 and valid till 6/2/2007. The certificate contained seven

conditions, the last of which being relevant, is that, the design of

the incinerator should confirm to the standards and guidelines

prescribed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the

Central Pollution Control Board. It is stated that, based on Ext.P1,

Government of Kerala issued Ext.P4 according sanction to all

Urban Local Bodies in the State to use the incinerators

manufactured by M/s.Cheerans. It is also pointed out that, by

Ext.P5, Ext.P4 was modified and the order was made applicable to

the Grama Panchayats in the State also.        M/s.Cheerans would

state that based on the Government Orders referred to above,

they have installed incinerators at various places, the list of which

are Exts.P2 and P3.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     4.    While matters stood thus, the Board issued Ext.P6

dated 6/3/06, an order of cancellation of Ext.P1, the certificate of

approval of consultant. Ext.P6 referred to show cause notice

dated 20/11/2005 and the letter dated 2/12/05 allegedly issued

by M/s.Cheerans in reply to the show cause notice. According to

M/s.Cheerans, neither such a show cause notice was issued nor

did they   give any reply. Therefore they submitted Ext.P7 for

WPC Nos.16336 &amp; 21000/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                :3 :</span>



copies of show cause notice and its reply. There was no response

to the request made and therefore they approached this Court by

filing WP(C) No.18000/06 seeking a direction to the Board to issue

them a copy of the show cause notice and the reply allegedly

given by them. That writ petition was heard and by Ext.P10

judgment rendered on 13/6/07, the writ petition was disposed of

recording that the learned Judge was not satisfied that a show

cause notice was actually served on M/s.Cheerans. Taking note of

this aspect and also the allegations of malafides raised against

the then Member Secretary of the Board, this Court directed that

the Chairman of the Pollution Control Board should examine the

issue afresh after affording an opportunity of hearing to

M/s.Cheerans. On that basis, quashing Ext.P6, the writ petition

was disposed of directing the Chairman to issue the show cause

notice to the petitioner allowing M/s.Cheerans to file its objections

and directing the Chairman to pass orders after hearing

M/s.Cheerans.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.   It is stated that accordingly show cause notice was

issued and reply was also filed. A hearing was also given, which

again gave rise to several controversies. Finally along with

WPC Nos.16336 &amp; 21000/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  :4 :</span>



Ext.P14 dated 15/5/2008, the Chairman issued his proceedings

upholding Ext.P6 order cancelling Ext.P1. Ext.P14 proceedings

were again challenged before this Court in WP(C) No.29511/08.

That writ petition was disposed of by Ext.P17 judgment relegating

M/s.Cheerans to file an appeal before the Appellate Authority.

Accordingly, appeal was filed and by Ext.P18 order of the

Appellate Authority, the appeal was allowed. A reading of the

appellate order shows that the Appellate Authority framed the

following points for consideration:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      1)   Whether the appeal is maintainable?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      2)   Whether the appellant is entitled to function and operate
           the incinerators by using coconut shell as the fuel?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      3)   Whether the order passed by the 2nd respondent is liable to
           be set aside?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      4)   Reliefs and costs.</blockquote><p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">      6.   On merits, all the points were found in favour of

M/s.Cheerans.    Considering the nature of the controversy now

arising for resolution by this Court, it is profitable to quote para

12, 13 and 14 of Ext.P18 order,which reads as under;

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       12.  Bio-Medical Waste as defined in the said rules
       means any waste which is generated during the diagnosis
       treatment or immunisation of human beings or animals or
       in research activities pertaining thereto or in the
       production  of testing of biologicals and including
       categories mentioned in Schedule I by Medical waste
       treatment facilities. As per the above rules, treatment

WPC Nos.16336 &amp; 21000/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  :5 :</span>



     means any facility wherein treatment disposal of Bio-
     medical waste or processes incidental to such treatment
     or disposal is carried out and includes common treatment
     facilities. The operating standards and omission standards
     are shown in schedule 5 of the said rules. The note
     contained in the above schedule assumes importance and
     they are as follows:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">            "1.   Suitably designed pollution control devices
     should be installed/retrofitted with the incinerator to
     achieve the above emission limits, if necessary.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">            2.    Wastes to be incinerated shall not be
     chemically treated with any chlorinated disinfectants.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">            3.    Chlorinated plastics shall not be incinerated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">            3.    Toxic metals in incineration ash shall be
     limited within the regulatory quantities as defined under
     th Hazardous Waste (Management and Handling) Rules,
     1989.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">            5.    Only low sulphur fuel like L.D.O/L.S.H.S/Diesel
     shall be used as fuel in the incinerator".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">     13.    The learned counsel for the respondent would argue
     that since as per the above rules only low sulphur fuel
     like L.D.O, L.S.H.S, Diesel etc. shall be used as fuel, no
     solid could be used as fuel in the incinerator. On the
     other hand, the learned counsel for the appellant would
     argue that there is no bar against using solid fuel and if a
     solid fuel meets the requirements covered by the above
     rules, solid fuel also can be used in the incinerator. No
     doubt fuel stated in the note does not specifically
     mention any solid fuel. But that cannot be interpreted to
     mean that solid fuel cannot be used in the incinerator.</blockquote><p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">     The main requirement under note 5 is that the fuel used
     should be low sulphur fuel.      If the solid fuel is a low
     sulphur fuel the use of such a fuel will not violate Note 5
     of the above Rule.      The respondent do not have         a
     contention that coconut shell is not a low sulphur fuel. It
     is significant to note that the respondents had earlier

WPC Nos.16336 &amp; 21000/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  :6 :</span>



     permitted the appellant to install incinerators operated by
     coconut shells as fuel. Unless it is shown that coconut
     shell is a fuel which does not satisfy the requirements
     other than the one shown under Note 5 above, then and
     then alone the respondent can object the design and
     operation of the incinerator. As already pointed out the
     main contention of the respondent is that the incinerators
     installed by the appellant do not meet condition No.7 of
     the Certificate of Approval, issued by the Board. As
     already pointed out, Condition No.7 in Ext.P1 is as follows;

</p><p id="p_10">           "The toxins of incinerators shall conform to the
     standards and guidelines prescribed by the Ministry of
     Environment and Forest and Central Pollution Control
     Board". The standards and guidelines prescribed by the
     Ministry of Environment and Forest are no doubt reflected
     in the Bio-Medical Waste (Management and Handling)
     Rules 1998 and the Municipal Solid Waste (Management
     and Handling) Rules, 2000. The fact is that the powers
     and functions of the Central Pollution Control Board as
     regards grant or refusal of consent are equally exercised
     by the State Pollution Control Board in relation to such
     matters.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     14.   The learned counsel for the respondents would
     argue that the appellant should obtain clearance from the
     Central Pollution Control Board and also the Ministry of
     Environment and Forest for using coconut shell as fuel
     due to the reason that coconut shell is not permitted to
     be used as a fuel as per the rules. The above argument
     cannot legally sustain. As already pointed out, the said
     rules prescribe parameters and the criteria for installing
     incinerators and the State Pollution Control Board has to
     consider the above aspects while granting or refusing a
     request for consent. This would definitely apply in relation
     to the use of fuel also in the incinerator. Even though
     coconut shell is not specifically shown as a fuel at Note 5
     of the above rules, it cannot be inferred that the said fuel
     is excluded from the purview of the above Rules. As
     already pointed out, Note No.5 mandates that only low
     sulphur fuel should be used. This would definitely take
     within its fold solid fuel also. Admittedly coconut shell is

WPC Nos.16336 &amp; 21000/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  :7 :</span>



      an organic material and it is a low sulphur fuel. Therefore,
      the contention that use of coconut shell as fuel is
      violative of the above rules is absolutely untenable. The
      finding of the Board that coconut shell being a solid fuel is
      not prescribed under the said rules cannot stand to a
      reason. Therefore the cancellation order is unsustainable.

</p><p id="p_12">     7.    Recording the aforesaid findings, the appeal was

disposed of with the following directions;
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">       In the result the appeal is allowed and the order
       passed by 2nd respondent is set aside and the
       appellant     is    permitted      to   submit      fresh
       proposal/application for obtaining consent for the
       design and operation of the incinerator by using
       coconut shell as fuel and the respondents, on receiving
       such proposal/application shall re-examine the same in
       the light of the relevant Rules and also in the light of
       the observations contained in this judgment and
       dispose the matter afresh treating that coconut shells
       can be used as fuel provided it satisfies the other
       requirements as per Rules.</blockquote><p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">     8.    This   order   shows     that   although     M/s   Cheerans

succeeded in the appeal, they were relegated back to the

Chairman with a direction to make a fresh proposal/application

and fresh orders were ordered to be passed on such application.

</p><p id="p_15">     9.    M/s.Cheerans      have      filed   WP(C)      No.16336/10

contending that having upheld all their contentions in the appeal

on merits, Appellate Authority ought to have set aside Ext.P6 and

reinstated Ext.P1.    They also contend that Ext.P6 proceedings

WPC Nos.16336 &amp; 21000/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                :8 :</span>



were issued by the then Member Secretary of the Board, and that

the then Member Secretary of the Board is presently the

Chairman of the Board and that their contention that Ext.P6

issued by him was vitiated by malafides has been taken note of

by this Court in Ext.P10 judgment. On this basis, they contend

that if they are again asked to take their chance before the same

person, they will not get justice from him.      It is with these

allegations, seeking to quash Ext.P18 to the extent the matter is

remitted back to the Chairman and for consequential reliefs, this

writ petition is filed.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      10. In this context, one development which is to be taken

note of is that when this writ petition came up for orders before

this Court on 27/5/2010, this Court admitted the writ petition and

passed an interim order that without prejudice to the contentions

of M/s.Cheerans, they shall file an application as directed in

Ext.P18 and that orders will be passed thereon. Accordingly

M/s.Cheerans filed Ext.P19 application which has been produced

along with IA 8694/10. That application was considered and the

Chairman passed Ext.P20 order dated 16/6/2010 rejecting the

application. In this order, for the first time, the Chairman has

WPC Nos.16336 &amp; 21000/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                 :9 :</span>



chosen to state that vide Circular No.PCB/T4/115/97 dated

2/11/2007, the Board has discontinued the system of approval of

consultants and that for getting the consent of the Board for

establishing/operating     incinerators,  the   occupier    of   the

industry/institution establishing the incinerator has to apply in the

prescribed form. It is stated that if and when system of approval

of consultants is resumed, M/s.Cheerans shall be provided an

opportunity to make their application.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      11. The      Pollution  Control   Board    has   filed  WP(C)

No.21000/10, challenging Ext.P18 order referred to above passed

by the Appellate Authority in its entirety.       According to the

Pollution Control Board, in view of the provisions contained in the

Bio Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998 and

Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000,

only Light Diesel Oil (LDO), Low Sulphur Heavy Stock (LSHS) and

Diesel shall be used as fuel in incinerator. On this basis, they

contend that the finding in Ext.P18 order of the Appellate

Authority that incinerator can be worked using coconut shell as

fuel is illegal and unsustainable.

concerned, it is stated that in terms of Clause 7 of Exts.P1 and P4

referred to above, M/s Cheerans ought to have produced approval

of the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Central

Pollution Control Board. According to them, M/s Cheerans did not

produce such approval, and therefore, Ext.P6 cancellation order

was issued. It was further contended by the Pollution Control

Board that once the Board and its officers, who are experts in the

field, have taken a view on a technical matter like this, it is

impermissible for the Appellate Authority to sit in judgment over

those conclusions. It is therefore contended that the Appellate

Authority ought not have interfered with Ext.P18 order.

</p><p id="p_19">      13. I have considered the submissions made.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      14. The     sustainability    of   the   prayer    sought    by

M/s.Cheerans in their writ petition will depend upon the outcome

of the challenge raised by the Pollution Control Board against the

order passed by the Appellate Authority. In other words, if the

order of the Appellate Authority is interfered with in the writ

petition filed by the Pollution Control Board, necessarily, the writ

petition filed by M/s Cheerans will have to be dismissed. In that

view of the matter, I shall first deal with the contentions raised by

WPC Nos.16336 &amp; 21000/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                :11 :</span>



the Pollution Control Board in the writ petition filed by them.

</p><p id="p_21">     15. Before I deal with the contentions raised by both

parties, I must record that although M/s Cheerans were claiming

cancellation of Ext.P6 and reinstatement of Ext.P1 certificate of

approval of consultant, when the writ petition was taken up for

hearing, their main apprehension was that even if Ext.P1 is not

reinstated, the Pollution Control Board shall not reject an

application made by an institution, which has installed the

incinerators manufactured by them on the ground that coconut

shell is the fuel used.     It was answering this contention of

M/s.Cheerans that the counsel for the Pollution Control Board also

addressed his arguments. The question whether this contention of

M/s Cheerans can be accepted or not, will depend upon the

correctness or otherwise of the findings of the Appellate Authority

contained in para 12, 13 and 14 of Ext.P18 order. It is on this

basis, that I proceed to examine the issues raised by the parties.

</p><p id="p_22">     16. In para 12 to 14 of the order, the Appellate Authority

has rejected the plea of the Board that only LDO, LSHS and Diesel

can be used as fuel in the incinerator. The contrary finding of the

Appellate Authority is based upon the provisions of the Bio

WPC Nos.16336 &amp; 21000/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                  :12 :</span>



Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 1998 and the

Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 2000.

In so far as the fuel to be used in the incinerator is concerned,

Schedule V of the Bio Medical Waste (Management and Handling)

Rules 1998 and the provisions in the Municipal Solid Waste

(Management and Handling) Rules provides that "only low sulphur

fuel like LDO/LSHS/Diesel shall be used as fuel in the incinerator".

As already noticed, it is interpreting this provision of the Rules

that the Board contended that only LDO/LSHS/Diesel shall be used

as fuel. Interpreting this provision, the Appellate Authority has

held that the rule only provides that low sulphur fuel should be

used and the rule does not exclude           fuels other than those

enumerated in the rule. It is on this basis that the Appellate

Authority has rejected the plea of the Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_23">      17. While interpreting a statutory rule, this Court is bound

to give full effect to the provisions of the Rule. Rule only says that

only low sulfur fuel 'like' the enumerated ones shall be used as

fuel.   In my view, the terms of the Rules do not warrant the

restricted interpretation that is canvassed by the Pollution Control

Board. On the other hand, the Rule permits usage of other low

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                 :13 :</span>



sulfur fuels like those enumerated in the Rule also as fuel in the

incinerators. The word 'like' as defined by Webster means equal in

quantity, quality or degree; exactly corresponding. <a href="/doc/1785188/" id="a_2">In Andhra

Cement Co. Ltd. v. A.P. State Electricity Board</a> (AIR 1991 AP

</p><p id="p_24">269), it has been held that the word 'like' means only 'similar' and

not same. From Words and Phrases, Permanent Edition, it is seen

that the word 'like' has been judicially defined to mean "having

the same or nearly the same appearance, qualities, or

characteristics; resembling; similar to; equal in quantity, quality or

degree. Taking into account the above and also the terms of the

provisions of the Rules, I am inclined to hold that the Rules permit

usage of fuels like LDO/LSHS or Diesel in the incinerator, so long

as such fuels are low sulphur fuels.
</p>
<p id="p_25">     18. In the writ petition filed by the Pollution Control Board,

they have no case that coconut shell used by M/s Cheerans in its

incinerator is not a low sulfur fuel. On the other hand, in ground

(G), what is contended by the Pollution Control Board is that ash

content and moisture content in coconut shell is more as

compared to fuels like LDO/HSD and LSHS. It is also stated that

the calorific value of coconut shell is less as compared to the

WPC Nos.16336 &amp; 21000/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                 :14 :</span>



calorific value of fuel such as LDO/HSD and LSHS. In the absence

of a case for the Board that the coconut shell is not a fuel having

low sulphur content and as the rule permits other low sulphur also

as fuel for incinerator, I uphold the conclusions contained in para

12 to 14 of Ext.P18 order of the Appellate Authority.

</p><p id="p_26">      19. Now what remains is the contention of the Board that

the petitioner did not produce approval from the Ministry of

Environment and Forests and the Central Pollution Control Board

and that it was therefore that they issued Ext.P6 cancelling

Ext.P1. A reading of Clause 7 of Ext.P1 shows that the only

condition imposed by the Pollution Control Board is that the

design of the incinerator should confirm to the standards and

guidelines prescribed by Ministry of Environment and Forests and

the Central Pollution Control Board. This condition has been

reiterated by the Government in Ext.P4 order also. A plain reading

of this clause shows that this clause did not oblige M/s.Cheerans

to obtain any approval from the Ministry of Environment and

Forests and the Central Pollution Control Board. If that be so, the

premise on which the Pollution Control Board has initiated action

resulting in Ext.P6 also cannot be upheld.

</p><p id="p_28">      20. In that view of the matter, no grounds have been made

out by the Pollution Control Board warranting interference with

Ext.P1. However, fact remains that although belatedly, Pollution

Control Board has taken the stand in Ext.P20 order that the

system of approval of consultants has been discontinued by

circular dated 2/11/2007. M/s.Cheerans were not in a position to

show me any statutory provision in the         Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a> authorising the Board to issue a

certificate in the nature of Ext.P1. Therefore, I am not persuaded

to direct the Board to reinstate Ext.P1. However, on the basis of

the submissions made by both sides, I am clear that the

provisions of the Bio Medical Waste (Management and Handling)

Rules, 1998 and the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and

Handling) Rules, 2000 do permit usage of coconut shell also as a

fuel for incinerators.
</p>
<p id="p_29">      21. For    the   above   reasons,   it  is  ordered   that  if

M/s.Cheerans or      any   establishment using     the   incinerator

manufactured by them apply for consent to establish or operate

incinerators, such applications shall not be rejected on the ground

that the fuel used is coconut shell.

    In the result, WP(C) No.16336/10 filed by M/s.Cheerans will

stand disposed of with the above direction and WP(C)

No.21000/10 filed by Board will stand dismissed.
