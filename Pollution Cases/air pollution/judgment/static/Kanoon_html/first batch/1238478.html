<p id="p_1">SINGHVI, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">1.         The above noted appeals are directed against order dated 25.4.2000 passed

by Goa Bench of the High Court of Bombay in Writ Petition No.330 of 1991 <a href="/doc/548160/" id="a_1">Shri

Minguel Martins vs. M/s Sociedade</a> e Fomento Industries Pvt. Ltd. and others, Writ

Pinto vs. State of Goa and others</a> whereby directions have been given for demolition

of construction made in survey No.803 (new No.246/2) within the area of Gram

Panchayat, Taleigao, for resumption of the land acquired on behalf of appellant No.1,

Fomento Resorts and Hotels Limited, earlier known as M/s. Gomantak Land

Development Pvt. Ltd. and keeping public access to the Vainguinim beach from point

`A' to point `B' shown in plan Exhibit-A open without any obstruction of any kind.

</p><p id="p_4">2.         For deciding the questions arising in the appeals, it will be useful to notice

the relevant facts:
</p><p id="p_5">(i)        Dr. Alvaro Remiojo Binto owned several parcels of land in Village

Taleigao, District Tiswadi, Goa. He sold plots bearing survey Nos.803 and 804 (new

Nos.246/2 and 245/2) to Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto and plots bearing survey

Nos.787 and 805 (new Nos.246/1 and 245/1) to M/s. Sociedade e Fomento Industries

Pvt. Ltd. (appellant No.2 herein).
</p>
<p id="p_6">(ii)       After purchasing the land, appellant No.2 leased out the same to appellant

No.1. The latter submitted an application to Gram Panchayat Taleigao (for short `the

Gram Panchayat') for grant of permission to construct hotel complex near

Vainguinim beach.     On a reference made by the Gram Panchayat, Chief Town

Planner, Government of Goa, Daman and Diu vide his letter dated 1.8.1978 informed

that the plans submitted by appellant No.1 are in conformity with the regulations in

force in the area but observed that right of the public to access the beach must be

maintained by providing necessary footpath. Paragraph 2 of that letter reads as

under:-
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "The road leading to the hotel complex is at present used by
           general public to approach the Vainguinim Beach which is
           popular picnic spot for the people of Panaji, as well as other parts
           of Goa. It will need to be ensured that the right of access to the
           beach is maintained by the applicant by providing the necessary
           footpath to the beach at an appropriate place. The parking
           facilities provided will also have to take care of the parking of
           vehicles of such members of the public in an appropriate manner.
           This will ensure that the beach remains open to public as it is at
           present and that the public is not deprived of this beautiful and
           frequently used beach."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                                             [emphasis added]



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">(iii)      Thereafter, the Gram Panchayat issued letter dated 22.8.1978, whereby

appellant No.1 was permitted to lay access road linking Dona-Paola-Bambolim Road

to the construction site and construct the hotel subject to the conditions specified in

the letter including the one relating to public access to the beach. This was reiterated

by the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat in his letter dated 1.12.1978.
</blockquote><p id="p_8">(iv)      In furtherance of the permission granted by the Gram Panchayat,

appellant No.1 commenced construction of the hotel, which is now known as Hotel

Cidade de Goa on the land forming part of survey No.787 (new No.246/1) and

completed the same by May, 1983 in different stages, the details of which are given

below:-

(v)       During construction of the hotel building, appellant No.1 made an

</pre><p id="p_10">application dated 29.9.1979 to the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat, for permission

to change the location of the footpath and parking area by stating that in view of
installation of 10,000 Kg. gas tank (poisonous gas at high pressure), pressurized

water tank and high voltage electric transformer near the hotel building, it will not

be in public interest to locate the footpath and parking area at the sanctioned site.

</p><p id="p_11">(vi)       The Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat neither forwarded the application

of appellant No.1 to the Town and Planning Department for eliciting its views nor

placed the same before the Gram Panchayat. Instead he, on his own, wrote letter

dated 29.9.1979 to appellant No.1 giving an impression that the Gram Panchayat

does not have any objection to the change of location of the footpath and parking

area. Thereafter, appellant No.1 is said to have shifted access to the beach from the

location originally sanctioned.    However, the maps produced before this Court

during the course of hearing show that the footpath is still near the gas tank.

</p><p id="p_12">(vii)      In the meanwhile, Shri Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto, Smt. Surana

Pepfira Pinto and Miss Befta Sara Da Costa Pinto filed Special Civil Suit

No.313/1978/A in the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division, at Panaji against

appellant No.2, Dr. Alvaro Remiojo Binto and four others for a decree of possession

by pre-emption in respect of the land comprised in survey Nos.787 and 805 and also

to restrain the defendants, their agents, servants, etc. from changing, alienating or

raising any construction on the suit land by alleging that they were owners of

property bearing survey Nos.803, 804, 806, 807, 788 and 789 situated at Taleigao and

since time immemorial they and their predecessors were using footpath passing

through survey Nos.787, 805 and 769 for going to Panaji-Dona Paola-Bambolim

road, which was sought to be obstructed. Defendant No.1 in the suit (appellant No.2

herein) filed written statement to contest the suit. After some time, the parties

compromised the matter in terms of which the plaintiffs gave up their claim for pre-

emption in respect of plot bearing survey Nos.787 and 805 and defendant No.1

agreed to exchange the plot bearing survey No.790 with plots bearing survey Nos.788

and 789 belonging to the plaintiffs and also that it will have no right of access
through any of the properties of the plaintiffs. As a sequel to this, the plaintiffs

applied for withdrawal of the suit. By an order dated 20.12.1978, the Civil Judge

permitted them to do so.
</p>
<p id="p_13">(viii)     Soon after withdrawal of the suit for pre-emption, appellant No.1 made an
application dated 15.11.1978 to Shri Shankar Laad, Minister of Revenue,
Government of Goa for acquisition of land comprised in survey Nos.788, 789, 803,
804, 806 and 807 (new Nos.246/3, 246/4, 246/2, 245/2, etc.) of Village Taleigao, Dona
Paula for construction of Beach Resort Hotel Complex by highlighting its benefit to
the State. Paragraphs 3 to 6 of the application, which have bearing on the decision of
these appeals, read as under:
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">           "3.        It is proposed to put up a hotel complex in the two
           phases, in the first phase it is proposed that a hotel building is put
           up in Plot No. 787 in the second phase it is proposed that a Yoga
           Centre, Health Club and Water Sports facilities for promoting
           tourism are put in Plot No. 805. Our Hotel Project which is
           estimated to cost Rs.150 lakhs and will have 100 rooms in its first
           phase will add to meeting the much needed demand for
           accommodation by the international tourists.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">
</blockquote><p id="p_15">4.         In the first phase of the hotel complex it is necessary to develop plot
No.787 and to immediately proceed to construct the Hotel Building thereon. The
land in plot No.787 consists of hilly and rocky area and the land abutting on the
beach is also of different levels. In order to put up a hotel building in this plot it
would be necessary to undertake cutting of rock which would disturb the topography
of the area entailing considerable expense. It is, therefore, necessary that the lay-out
for the hotel building is finalized in a manner that the rock cutting is minimized and,
at the same time, the natural surroundings of the rock and foliage is maintained.
Exclusive cutting of rock is also likely to result in land-slides and may pose danger to
the foundation of the hotel buildings and its residents. It is, therefore, necessary to
construct the hotel building as near the beach as possible, i.e. on the lowest level of
the land abutting the beach.
</p>
<p id="p_16">5.         There are two small plots bearing No.788 and 789 area abutting the beach.
Those two small plots fall almost midway along the beach frontage of our said plot
No.787 and project into the said plot. Those two small plots are in the lowest level of
the land and as such are most suited for including in the lay-out plan of the hotel.
These two small plots being closest to the beach it is essential for us to install a first
aid post and a medical aid centre for providing safety measures to the people using
the beach facilities. Besides it is a precondition for a beach resort hotel giving
comforts to provide those facilities both for the residents and for public at large.
Keeping in view those factors it is necessary that these two small plots of land are
immediately acquired and included in the lay-out plan of the hotel. It is also
necessary that the acquisition of these two small plots of land is urgently completed
and possession handed over to enable the lay out plan of the hotel building to be
readjusted at this initial stage itself, on the ground prepared by proper leveling and
terracing before the actual construction work could begin. It is, therefore, necessary
that the two plots of land be urgently acquired in the first instance so that there is no
delay whatsoever in implementing the first phase of the hotel project.

</p><p id="p_17">6.           In order to take in hand the second phase of the hotel complex it would be
desirable to acquire plot Nos. 803 and 804 which intervene between our second Plot
No. 805 and our first plot No. 787 and plot Nos. 806 and 807 which adjoin our second
plot No. 805. This would enable us to undertake the second phase of the project as
described above. The entire complex will then become one composite unit and these
facilities could then be easily availed of by the hotel residents and the resident of this
territory. The facilities provided by the hotel will be open for use on membership to
non-residents also. Such facilities are not readily and easily available to the people of
this."
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">(ix)       Acting on the application made by the developer, the Government of Goa

issued notification No.HD/LQN/315/78 dated 29.10.1980 under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_4">Section 4(1)</a> of Land

Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short `the 1894 Act') for acquisition of the plots comprised

in survey No.803 (new No.246/2) and survey No.804 (new No.245/2).



</p><p id="p_20">(x)        After holding enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_5">Section 5A</a> of the 1894 Act, the State

Government issued declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_6">Section 6</a>, which was published in Gazette

dated 27.10.1983.
</p>
<p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">(xi)       Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto and some others filed Writ Petition

No.8/1984 for quashing the aforementioned notifications on various grounds

including the one that before acquiring the land, government did not make enquiry

as per the requirement of Rule 4 of the Land Acquisition (Companies) Rules, 1963

(for short `the Rules').     The writ petitioners also highlighted discrepancies in

different notifications issued by the State Government. Respondent No.2 in the writ

petition (appellant No.1 herein) filed reply affidavit stating therein that Rule 4 of the

Rules is not mandatory and non compliance thereof did not affect legality of the
acquisition. In paragraphs 67 and 76 of the reply affidavit, it was averred that part

of the project i.e. hotel is complete and has started functioning. In paragraph 79, it

was averred that besides the hotel project, cottages were proposed to be constructed

on plot bearing survey No.805 and the acquired land in survey Nos.803 and 804 will

be used for putting up health club, yoga centre, water sports and other recreational

facilities, which are integral part of the project.

</p><p id="p_24">(xii)      By an order dated 26.6.1984, Goa Bench of the High Court of Bombay

allowed the writ petition and quashed the impugned notifications only on the ground

of non compliance of Rule 4 of the Rules. That order was reversed by this Court in

<a href="/doc/303393/" id="a_7">M/s. Fomento Resorts and Hotels Ltd. vs. Gustavo Renato Da Cruz Pino and Others</a>

[(1985) 2 SCC 152] and the case was remitted to the High Court for deciding other

grounds of challenge. It, however, appears that after the judgment of this Court, the

parties compromised the matter and the writ petition was withdrawn on 26.3.1985.



</p><p id="p_25">(xiii)     In the meanwhile, appellant No.1 entered into an agreement with the

government as per the requirement of <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_8">Section 41</a> of the 1894 Act. The agreement was

signed on 26.10.1983. The opening three paragraphs and Clauses 3, 4 and 6 of the

agreement read as under:-
</p>

                     recreational amenities within the time specified in the

improvements, if any, affected thereon,       shall be liable to resumption by the
Government subject however, to the condition that the amount spent by the

</p><p id="p_41">(xiv)      Although, the agreement was signed on 26.10.1983, possession of the

acquired land was given to appellant No.1 only after withdrawal of Writ Petition

No.8 of 1984 for which permission was granted on 26.3.1985.
</p>
<p id="p_42">

</p><p id="p_43">(xv)       After delivery of possession of the acquired land, Smt. Anju Timblo,

Director of appellant No.1, made an application to Panjim Planning and

Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as `the Development Authority')

under <a href="/doc/889229/" id="a_11">Sections 44(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_12">Section 49(1)</a> of the Goa, Daman &amp; Diu Town and

Country Planning Act, 1974 (hereinafter described as `Town &amp; Country Planning

Act') for grant of permission for extension of the existing hotel building on survey

Nos.246/1, 246/3 and 246/4 (old survey Nos.787, 788 and 789). The applicant did not

seek extension of hotel building to survey No.246/2 apparently because of the express

embargo contained in Clause 4(viii) of the agreement that the company shall never

construct any building or structure in the acquired land.
</p>
<p id="p_44">

(xvi)      The aforementioned application was considered by the EEC in its 23rd

meeting held on 11.6.1987 and was favourably recommended subject to the condition

that pedestrian path along the beach may be made available by constructing an

access from the jetty so that public can reach the beach during the high tide period.
Thereafter, the matter was considered in the meeting of the EDC held on 11.9.1987

and it was decided to accept the recommendations of the EEC, subject to the

condition regarding pedestrian path. The decision of the EDC was communicated to

Smt. Anju Timblo by the Chief Town Planner vide his letter dated 14.10.1987, the

relevant portion of which read as under:
</p>
<p id="p_45">"In continuation of this office letter No. DE/4757(DZ/2009)3055/87 dated 10.7.87, it is
to inform that the project was discussed in the 10th meeting of the Eco Development
Council held on 11.9.87 and the Council has cleared the project as per the plans
submitted by you with condition that pedestrian path be made available by
construction an access from the jetty so that the public can reach the beach even
during high tide."
</p>
<p id="p_46">
(xvii)      In furtherance of the decision taken by the EDC, the Development

Authority issued an order under <a href="/doc/889229/" id="a_13">Section 44(3)(c)</a> read with Section 49(2) of the Town

and Country Planning Act whereby permission was granted to appellant No.1 for

extension of the existing hotel building. The opening paragraph and Clause 10 of the

conditions incorporated in that order, read as under:
</p>
<p id="p_47">"Whereas an application has been made by Shri/Smt. Anju Timblo, Development
permission is issued for extension to the existing Hotel Building with respect to
his/her land zoned as commercial zone bearing Survey No. 246 approved Sub No. 1, 3
and 4 Chalta No. - P.T. Sheet No. ___ of Taleigao Village Town in accordance with
the provisions of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_14">Section 44(1)</a>/<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_15">49(1)</a> of the Goa, Daman and Diu Town and Country
Planning Act, 1974, read with Rule 13 of the Planning &amp; Development Rules 1977
framed thereunder. And whereas, a development charge affixed at Rs.84,170/- has
been paid by him/her.
</p><p id="p_48">Therefore, under the powers vested in this Authority under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_16">Section 44(3)</a>) / 49(2) of
the Goa, Daman &amp; Diu Town &amp; Country Planning Act, 1974, the above said
applicant is granted development permission to carry out development in accordance
with the enclosed plans subject to the following conditions:-
"........
</p><p id="p_49">10)        The Pedestrian path has to be made available by constructing an access
from the jetty so that the public can reach the beach even during high tide."


(xviii)     After some time another application was made on behalf of appellant No.1

under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_17">Section 46</a> read with Section 44 of the Town and Country Planning Act for

renewal of the permission granted vide order dated 15.4.1988 with a deviation in

respect of plots bearing survey Nos.246/1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, for the first time, a
request was made for raising construction in survey No. 803 (new No.246/2) in the

garb of making deviation from the permission already granted. This application was

not put up either before the EEC or EDC and was straightaway considered by the

Goa Town and Country Planning Board (for short `the Board') in its meeting held on

20.6.1991 as an additional item and the following decision was taken:-

"The proposal relating to extension/deviation of Hotel Cidade de Goa which also
involves relaxation in number of floors was considered and approved subject to the
condition that the height shall not exceed the stipulated limit of 17.5 mts. which was
applicable at the time when the project was approved".
</p>
<p id="p_50">
(xix)      The above reproduced decision of the Board was forwarded by the State

Government to the Development Authority.         However, without even waiting for

consideration by the competent body, appellant No.1 appears to have started

construction by deviating from the approved plan. This compelled the Chairman of

the Development Authority to send letter dated 12.7.1991 to appellant No.1 requiring

it to refrain from going ahead with further construction.
</p>
<p id="p_51">

(xx)       It is not borne out from the record that matter relating to extension of the

hotel building on plot bearing survey No.803 (new No.246/2) was ever placed before

the EDC, but the Development Authority suo moto passed order dated 20.4.1992 vide

which permission was granted to appellant No.1 to carry out the development on plot

bearing survey No.246/1, 2, 3 and 4 subject to the terms and conditions specified

therein, including the following:
</p>
<p id="p_52">"The condition No.10 of the Order No.PDA/T/7471/297/88 dated 15.4.1988 should be
strictly adhered to."
</p>
<p id="p_53">
(xxi)      When appellant No.1 started extension of the hotel building in violation of

the permission accorded by the EDC, Shri Minguel Martins, who claims to have

purchased plots carved out of survey No.792 (new No.242/1), popularly known as

`Machado's Cove', filed Writ Petition No.330/1991, for issue of a direction to the
State Government, Village Panchayat Taleigao and other official respondents to

remove the illegal construction made by appellant No.1, to refrain from granting any

permission for construction or regularizing the construction already made by

appellant No.1 and also revoke the permission granted vide order dated 15.4.1988.

He further prayed for issue of a direction to respondent Nos.1 and 2 in the writ

petition (appellants herein) to keep the traditional access to the beach open and not to

put up any further construction on plots bearing survey Nos.787 and 803, which

would interfere with the public road, parking lot and public access to the beach. In

paragraph 3 of his petition, Shri Minguel Martins made a mention of the alleged

violation of the conditions contained in letters dated 1.8.1978 and 22.8.1978 issued by

the Chief Town Planner and Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat respectively by

asserting that respondent Nos.1 and 2 (appellants herein) have closed the road and

footpath to the beach and commenced construction of the parking, which he has been

challenged in Writ Petition No.284/1991.      In paragraphs 5 to 7, he referred to

agreement dated 26.10.1983, and alleged that in complete violation of the mandate

thereof, respondent Nos.1 and 2 have made construction in survey No.803 and

blocked public access to the beach. He also pleaded that even though the land was

acquired for sports and recreational facilities and use thereof for any other purpose

is prohibited by the terms of agreement, the official respondents are trying to

regularize illegal structures put up by respondent Nos.1 and 2 and even violation of

CRZ is being ignored.      Another plea taken by Shri Minguel Martins was that

respondent Nos.1 and 2 have constructed sewerage treatment plant and laundry

without obtaining permission from the competent authority under the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_19">Environment Protection Act</a>,

1986.
</p>
<p id="p_54">

(xxii) In the reply affidavit filed on behalf of respondent Nos.1 and 2 in Writ Petition
No.330/1991 (appellants herein), it was pleaded that the petitioner is liable to be non-

suited on the ground of laches and also on the ground that disputed questions of fact

are involved. It was further pleaded that the writ petition has been instituted with an

oblique motive at the instance of Dr. Alvaro de Souze Macahdo, one of the co-owners

of survey No.792 and developer of Machado's Cove, namely, M/s. Alcon Real Estate

Private Ltd., who filed Civil Suit No.67 of 1986 for similar relief but could not

persuade Civil Judge, Junior Division, Panaji to entertain their prayer for temporary

injunction. The appellants alleged that after having failed to secure injunction from

the civil court, Victor Albuquerque, the partner of M/s. Alcon Real Estates Private

Ltd. filed Writ Petition No.284/1991 and Minguel Martins filed Writ Petition

No.330/1991 and this was indicative of the fact that the petitioner was in collusion

with the developer of Machado's Cove.        They also questioned, the locus of the

petitioner by stating that plot bearing survey No.792 has not been sub-divided and he

does not have any interest in that property. On merits it was averred that road, car

parking facilities and footpath leading to the beach have been provided in accordance

with the condition imposed by the Chief Town Planner and Gram Panchayat and the

same are in existence since 1979 and are being used by the public without any

obstruction. The appellants denied existence of a pathway through survey Nos.792

and 803 and pleaded that members of the public do not have the right to access the

beach through survey No.803. The appellants also relied on <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_20">Section 16</a> of the 1894 Act

and averred that even if there existed access to the beach through the acquired land,

the same stood extinguished after vesting of the land in the government, possession of

which was given to appellant No.1 on 26.3.1985. On the issue of extension of hotel

building, the appellants pleaded that additional construction was made in accordance

with the permission granted vide order dated 15.4.1988 and after obtaining approval

of the proposed deviation from the competent authority. As regards, the laundry and

water treatment plant, it was averred that temporary sheds were constructed for
laundry after obtaining permission from the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat and

that treated effluent are intended to be used for gardening, manuring and other

purposes for which no separate permission was necessary. The appellants referred to

Suit No.313/1978/A filed by Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto and others for decree of

possession by pre-emption and averred that the so called admissions made in the

written statement about the existence of public pathway through plots bearing survey

Nos.792 and 803 is not binding on them because contents of the written statement

were not verified by the authorized representative of appellant No.2, on the basis of

personal knowledge and in their rejoinder, even the plaintiffs had not accepted the

existence of such pathway. In support of their plea that there is no public pathway or

access to the beach through survey Nos. 792 and 803, the appellants relied on the

judgment of Special Civil Suit No. 67/1986 - Alvaro De Souza Machado and another

vs. Sociedade De Fomento Industrial Pvt. Ltd. and another.
</p>
<p id="p_55">

(xxiii) The Goa Foundation, which is the registered society and is engaged in the

protection of ecology and environment in the State of Goa and Dr. Claudo Alvares,

Secretary of the Goa Foundation filed Writ Petition No.36/1992 with prayers similar

to those made in Writ Petition No. 330/1991. They also invoked <a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_21">Article 51(g)</a> of the

Constitution of India and pleaded that the Vainguinim beach, which is a public asset,

is sought to be privatized by the respondents (appellants herein) and they have

advertised the hotel in foreign country as having a private beach. In paragraph 9 of

Writ Petition No.36/1992, the petitioners claimed that the villagers of Taleigao and

general public have been using access to the beach that run through plots bearing

survey Nos.792 and 803 (new Nos.242/1 and 246/2) in addition to the path running

along the boundary of survey No.787 (new No.246/1). They relied on the admissions

contained in the written statement filed on behalf of appellant No.2 in Special Civil

Suit No.313/1978/A to show that public access to the beach exists through survey
No.803 and pleaded that in complete disregard of agreement dated 26.10.1983, the

appellants have constructed hotel building without obtaining permission from the

competent authority and they have unauthorisedly put up wall encircling those plots

and thereby privatized Vainguinim beach.
</p>
<p id="p_56">

(xxiv) Shri Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto, who had earlier filed Special Civil Suit

No.313/78/A for pre-emption, also joined the fray by filing Writ Petition No.141/1992.

He claimed that public access to the beach through plot bearing survey No.803 has

been blocked in utter violation of the conditions specified in agreement dated

26.10.1983. Another plea taken by Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto was that the land

was acquired under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_22">Section 40(1)(b)</a> of the 1894 Act and, therefore, the respondents

in the writ petition are duty bound to provide amenities to the public in terms of

agreement dated 26.10.1983, which they have failed to do.
</p>
<p id="p_57">

(xxv)     The reply affidavits filed in Writ Petition Nos.36/1992 and 141/1992 were

substantially similar to the counter filed in Writ Petition No.330/1991 except that in

the reply affidavit of Writ Petition No.36/1992, the appellants denied that they were

trying to privatize Vainguinim beach. They claimed that the disputed construction is

located at a distance of 200 meters from high tide line and about 1000 meters from

Dona Paula jetty. According to the appellants, the beach in question is not a type of

coastal beach but has exclusiveness and in that sense it was advertised as a private

beach. While defending Writ Petition No.141/1992, Smt. Anju Timblo claimed that

there has been no violation of agreement dated 26.10.1983 and the construction has

been made after obtaining permission from the competent authority.           She also

enclosed permission granted by the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat for putting up

temporary shed for washing machines.
</p><p id="p_58">(xxvi) A separate reply affidavit was filed by Shri Moraed Ahmed, Member Secretary

of Development Authority in Writ Petition No.330/1991.          The substance of his

affidavit was that the Development Authority has neither granted approval to the

deviation nor renewed the development permission of appellant No.1.           He also

referred to the illegal construction found at the time of inspections conducted on

15.5.1990 and 14.5.1991 which blocked public access to the river or reduced its width

and averred that on being asked to do so, appellant No.1 demolished the

obstruction/illegal construction.
</p>
<p id="p_59">

</p><p id="p_60">3.         At the hearing of the writ petitions, learned counsel appearing on behalf of

the petitioners did not press the grounds of challenge involving violation of CRZ

Regulation and construction of sewerage treatment plant without obtaining

permission/consent from the competent authority. After taking note of their

statement, the High Court considered other issues raised before it and held that the

land was acquired under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_23">Section 40(1)(b)</a>; that the extension of the hotel building on

an area measuring 1000 square meters of survey No.803 (new No.246/2) and other

constructions were legally impermissible. The High Court negatived the argument of

the appellants' counsel that in view of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_24">Section 16</a> of the 1894 Act encumbrance, if

any, stood wiped out by observing that traditional public right of way cannot be

strictly treated as an encumbrance and existence of the way which was in use from

time immemorial by the public openly, peacefully and continuously can not be

affected, more so, because in the agreement itself, access through survey No.803 (new

No.246/2) is acknowledged in the form of Clause 4(ix). The High Court also rejected

the explanations given by the appellants for advertising the beach as a private beach

and held that they cannot obstruct the passage by putting up wall/barbed wire

fencing. In the end, the High Court observed that after executing agreement dated

26.10.1983, the State Government totally abandoned its duty and did not bother to
ensure compliance of the condition incorporated in it.
</p>
<p id="p_61">

</p><p id="p_62">4.         On the aforesaid premise, the High Court allowed the writ petitions and

gave the following directions:-

                  ten weeks by the Government to the hotel to show cause as to why,
                  in the circumstances, the acquired land should not be resumed.

</p><p id="p_65">6.        It is also apposite to mention that while issuing notice in Writ Petition

No.141/1992, the High Court passed an interim order directing appellant No.1 to

maintain the public access from point `A' to `B' in survey No.803 (new No.246/2). In

the special leave petitions, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the directions contained in High

Court's order and action initiated for resumption of the land were stayed, but at the

same time, the Court recorded that learned counsel for the petitioner has agreed that

pathway from point `A' to `B' in survey No.246/2 as shown at page 49 of Volume II of

the paper book in SLP (C) No.9875/2000 shall be maintained till further orders, [This

No.246/2) through which the public path passes from point `A' to `B'].



</p><p id="p_66">7.        Shri Anil B. Divan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant,

argued that land in survey Nos.803 and 804 was acquired under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_25">Section 40(1)(aa)</a>

and not under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_26">Section 40(1)(b)</a> of the 1894 Act and the High Court committed serious

error in recording a finding that the acquisition was under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_27">Section 40(1)(b)</a>. Learned

senior counsel submitted that the expression "public purpose" appearing in clause
(aa) of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_28">Section 40(1)</a> is relatable to the purpose of company and not as the term is

generally understood in the context of the provisions contained in Part II of the 1894

Act. Shri Divan further submitted that in the absence of a specific stipulation to that

effect in the notification published under <a href="/doc/875938/" id="a_29">Section 4(1)</a> of the 1894 Act and agreement

dated 26.10.1983, the High Court was not justified in issuing a mandamus for

providing access to the beach through that survey number. An alternative argument

of Shri Divan is that the so called public access to the beach through survey No.803

was running parallel to the nallah dividing survey No.803 on the one hand and

survey Nos.804 and 805 on the other hand and no useful purpose will be served by

insisting on maintaining that access because new path has been made available for

access to the beach by constructing road, car parking, etc. in compliance of the

condition imposed by the Chief Town Planner in his letter dated 1.8.1978 and by the

Gram Panchayat while granting permission for construction of hotel in survey

No.787. Learned senior counsel referred to the affidavit filed on behalf of the State

Government before this Court and argued that when parties to the agreement have

clearly understood the terms thereof and the EDC gave permission for construction

of sports facilities and amenities without insisting that the same should be allowed to

be used by members of the public, except on paying the specified fees, the High Court

committed an error by issuing a mandamus for resumption of the land on the ground

of the alleged violation of agreement dated 26.10.1983.        Learned senior counsel

extensively referred to the pleadings of three writ petitions and additional documents

filed in these appeals to show that hotel building was extended on plot bearing survey

No.803, after obtaining permission from the EDC and Development Authority and

submitted that the irregularity, if any, committed in that regard will be deemed to

have been regularized by order dated 20.4.1992 passed by the Development

Authority. Shri Divan relied on Clause 6 of the agreement and argued that even if

the appellants can be said to have violated any of the conditions of agreement, it is for
the Government to take action for resumption of the land, after giving opportunity to

them to rectify the defect, etc. and the High Court could not have usurp the power of

the Government and directed demolition of the disputed construction.         Learned

senior counsel also referred to judgment dated 13.3.2006 passed in Special Civil Suit

No.67/1986 and argued that in the face of unequivocal finding recorded by the

competent court that there is no pathway from survey No.792 (Machado's Cove) to

survey No.803, the direction given by the High Court for resumption of the land on

the ground that access to the beach available to the public through survey No.803

(new No.246/2) has been blocked in violation of the terms of agreement dated

26.10.1983, is liable to be set aside. He further argued that the so-called admissions

made in the written statement filed in Special Civil Suit No.313/78/A cannot be read

against the appellants because the written statement was not signed by authorized

representative of appellant No.2 on personal knowledge and, in any case, the finding

recorded by the competent court in Special Civil Suit No.67/1986 should be treated as

conclusive on the issue of non-existence of passage through survey No.803.         In

support of this argument, learned senior counsel relied on the judgment of this Court

in Nagubai Ammal &amp; ors. Vs. B. Shama Rao &amp; ors. [(1956) SCR 451] and of

Allahabad High Court in <a href="/doc/1003986/" id="a_30">Anurag Misra vs. Ravindra Singh and another</a> [AIR 1994

Allahabad 124].

<p id="p_67">

</p><p id="p_68">8.        Shri Pallav Shihsodia, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the

State of Goa and other official respondent, adopted the arguments of Shri Anil Divan

and submitted that right of the public to use the traditional passage through private

land bearing survey No.803 (new No.246/2) could, at the best, be treated as

easementary right which stood extinguished with the acquisition of land under

<a href="/doc/875938/" id="a_31">Section 4(1)</a> of the 1894 Act, and vesting thereof in the State Government in terms of

<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_32">Section 16</a>. Shri Shishodia referred to the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the
State in these appeals and submitted that once possession of the acquired land was

taken by the Government free from all encumbrances, the writ petitioners could not

have asked for an access to the beach through survey No.803 for members of the

public. He submitted that if public is allowed to use survey No.803, there will always

be a possibility of threat to the security of the inmates of the hotel, which will affect

inflow of tourist in the area and have adverse impact on the economy of the State.



</p><p id="p_69">9.         Ms. Indira Jaising, learned senior counsel for the Goa Foundation,

referred to notification dated 29.10.1980 and agreement dated 26.10.1983 to show

that the land in dispute was acquired for execution of work for the benefit of general

public and argued that the High Court did not commit any error by recording a

finding that the acquisition was under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_33">Section 40(1)(b)</a>.      She pointed out that the

land was acquired with the sole object of enabling appellant No.1 to develop sports

and recreational facilities/amenities which could be used by the occupants of the hotel

rooms as also the general public and argued that the same cannot be said to be for the

purposes of the company. Ms. Jaising emphasised that on the date of acquisition, the

appellant No.1 had already constructed the hotel and argued that in the garb of

creating facilities and amenities for the occupants of the hotel rooms, it could not

have extended hotel building on 1000 sq. meters of plot bearing survey No.803, and

that too in violation of the express bar contained in Clause 4(viii) of agreement dated

26.10.1983.   She argued that order dated 20.4.1992 passed by the Development

Authority permitting construction on plot bearing survey No.803 is liable to be

ignored in view of Clause 4(viii) of the agreement. She further argued that even if

this Court comes to the conclusion that appellant no.1 could construct building on

survey No.803 by way of extension of the existing hotel, the disputed construction

cannot be saved because permission of the EDC was not obtained. Ms. Jaising

invoked the doctrine of public trust and argued that in view of the unequivocal
condition incorporated in Clause 4(ix) of the agreement that access to the beach will

be maintained without any obstruction, right of the members of public to go to the

beach through survey No.803 cannot be stultified by putting up wall/barbed wire

fencing or by creating any other impediment. Learned senior counsel submitted that

the beach in question is not a private beach and, therefore, the public at large cannot

be denied the right to access the beach. She further submitted that if appellants are

allowed to prevent the public from going to the beach through the traditional path

from Dona-Paola-Bambolim Road through survey Nos.792 and 803, the same would

amount to privatization of the public beach, which is legally impermissible.         As

regards the judgment in Special Civil Suit No.67/1986, Ms. Jaising submitted that the

same is not relevant for deciding the issues raised in these appeals because neither

any of the writ petitioners nor the State Government were parties to that litigation

and, in any case, in view of the unequivocal stipulation contained in Clause 4(ix) of

the agreement, appellant No.1 cannot wriggle out of its statutory obligation to

maintain passage through plot bearing survey No.803. She countered the submission

of Shri Divan that in view of the availability of alternative access to the beach

through the road, car parking and footpath constructed by appellant No.1, the High

Court should not have insisted on continuing access to the beach through survey No.

803 by asserting that the said access has been provided in terms of letter dated

1.8.1978 of the Chief Town Planner and permission granted by the Gram Panchayat

vide letter dated 22.8.1978 in lieu of the access available to the public through survey

No.787 and the same cannot be made basis for depriving members of the public to

continue to avail access to the beach through the traditional path available to them

survey No. 803. Learned senior counsel also pointed out that the alternative access is

totally illusory because it ends on the rocks through which no person can easily go to

the beach.

</p><p id="p_72">11.             The decision of this question depends on the interpretation of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_37">Sections 40</a>

(1) and 41 of the 1894 Act. However, before adverting to those sections, we deem it

proper to notice other relevant provisions. <a href="/doc/875938/" id="a_38">Section 4</a> provides for publication of a
preliminary notification evidencing prima facie satisfaction of the government that

land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose. This

section prescribes the mode of publication of notification and also indicates the steps

which could be taken for survey etc. of the land for deciding whether the same is fit

for the purpose for which it is needed. <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_39">Section 5A</a> postulates giving of an opportunity

to any person interested in the land to raise objection against proposed acquisition

and casts a duty on the Collector to hear the objector in person and submit his report

to the Government.      <a href="/doc/587621/" id="a_40">Section 6</a> postulates making of a declaration containing

satisfaction of the appropriate Government arrived at, after considering the report, if

any, made under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_41">Section 5A(2)</a> that the particular land is needed for a public

purpose or for a company. This is subject to the provisions of Part VII of the Act.

<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_42">Section 39</a>, which finds place in Part VII, lays down that the provisions of <a href="/doc/587621/" id="a_43">Sections 6</a>

to <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_44">37</a> (both inclusive) shall not be put in force for acquiring land on behalf of a

company under that part without the previous consent of the appropriate

Government, and unless the company executes an agreement in terms of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_45">Section 41</a>.



</p><p id="p_73">12.        <a href="/doc/1981888/" id="a_46">In R.L. Arora vs. State of U.P</a>. [(1962) Suppl. 2 SCR 149] (hereinafter

referred to as `first R.L. Arora case'), the Constitution Bench considered the legality

of the acquisition made on behalf of Lakshmi Ratan Engineering Works Limited,

Kanpur, which was engaged in manufacture of textile machinery parts.               The

appellant, who was owner of the land, challenged the acquisition on the ground that

it was not for a public purpose. It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the

impugned acquisition cannot be treated to have been made under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_47">Section 40(1)(b)</a>,

merely because the products of the company, for which land is sought to be acquired

will be useful to the public. It was urged that, if <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_48">Section 40(1)</a> is given such an

interpretation, the Government will become an agent for acquiring lands on behalf of

the companies engaged in producing something which may be used by the public.
The respondents argued that <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_49">Section 40(1)(b)</a> is of wide amplitude and land can be

acquired under the Act for any company when the work set up by it is likely to prove

useful to the public. The majority of the Constitution Bench held that <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_50">Section 40(1)</a>

</p><p id="p_74">(b) must be read in conjunction with <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_51">Section 41</a> to find out the intention of the

legislature when it provides for acquisition of land for a company through the agency

of the Government, and rejected the argument of the respondents by making the

following observations:
</p>
<p id="p_75">

"............ If we were to give the wide interpretation contended for on behalf of the
respondents on the relevant words in<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_52"> ss. 40</a> and <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_53">41</a> it would amount to holding that
the legislature intended the Government to be a sort of general agent for companies
to acquire lands for them, so that there owners may make profits. It can hardly be
denied that a company which will satisfy the definition of that word in<a href="/doc/82904/" id="a_54"> s. 3(e)</a> will be
producing something or other which will be useful to the public and which the public
may need to purchase. So on the wide interpretation contended for on behalf of the
respondents, we must come to the conclusion that the intention of the legislature was
that the Government should be an agent for acquiring land for all companies for such
purposes as they might have provided the product intended to be produced is in a
general manner useful to the public, and if that is so there would be clearly no point
in providing the restrictive provisions in<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_55"> ss. 40</a> and <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_56">41</a>. The very fact therefore that
the power to use the machinery of the Act for the acquisition of land for a company is
conditioned by the restrictions in<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_57"> ss. 40</a> and <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_58">41</a> indicates that the legislature intended
that land should be acquired through the coercive machinery of the Act only for the
restricted purpose mentioned in<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_59"> ss. 40</a> and <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_60">41</a>, which would also be a public purpose
for the purpose of<a href="/doc/875938/" id="a_61"> s. 4</a>. ......................"
</p>
<p id="p_76">
"Let us therefore turn to the words of<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_62"> s. 40(1)(b)</a>, which says that acquisition should
be for some work which is likely to prove useful to the public. Now if the legislature
intended these words to mean that even where the product of the work is useful to the
public, land can be acquired for the company for that purpose, the legislature could
have easily used the words "the product of" before the words "such work". The very
fact that there is no reference to the product of the work in<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_63"> s. 40(1)(b)</a> shows that
when the legislature said that the work should be likely to prove useful to the public
it meant that the work should be directly useful to the public through the public
being able to use it instead of being indirectly useful to the public through the public
being able to use its product. We have no doubt therefore that when<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_64"> s. 40(1)(b)</a> says
that the work should be useful to the public it means that it should be directly useful
to the public which should be able to make use of it. This meaning in our opinion is
made perfectly clear by what is provided in the fifth term in<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_65"> s. 41</a>. Before the
machinery of the Act can be put into operation to acquire land for a company, the
Government has to take an agreement from the company, and that agreement must
provide, where acquisition is needed for the construction of some work and that work
is likely to prove useful to the public, the terms on which the public shall be entitled
to use the work. ........"

the land in survey Nos.803 (new No.246/2) and 8042 (new No. 245/2) was not acquired

</p><p id="p_90">15.       The dispute between the parties centers round the remaining two clauses

of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_76">Section 40(1)</a>. According to the appellants, the acquisition was under Clause (aa),

whereas writ-petitioners (private respondents herein) pleaded that the acquisition

was under Clause (b). A careful reading of the two clauses shows that while Clause

(aa) envisages acquisition for the construction of some building or work for a

company which is engaged or is taking steps for engaging itself in any industry or
work which is for a public purpose, Clause (b) refers to acquisition for construction

of some work which is likely to prove useful to the public. The difference in the

language of the two clauses clearly brings out this distinction. In the second part of

Clause (aa), the legislature has used the expression `in any industry or work which is

for a public purpose'. This means that the particular acquisition can be treated to

have been made under that clause if it is for construction of some building or work

for a company which is engaged or is likely to engage itself in any industry or work

which may not necessarily be useful to the public in general.          As against this,

usefulness of the construction of some work to the general public is sine qua non for

acquisition under Clause (b). The expression "public purpose" used in Clause (aa)

was interpreted in <a href="/doc/1521043/" id="a_77">R.L. Arora vs. State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; others</a> [(1964] 6 SCR 784]

(herein after referred to "second R.L. Arora's case") which was instituted by the

land owner for striking down the amendment made in 1961 for validating the

acquisition, which was quashed in the first R.L. Arora's case. It was argued on

behalf of the petitioner that even if the amendment was not treated ultra vires the

provisions of the Constitution, the disputed acquisition is liable to be annulled

because the condition prescribed in Clause (aa) of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_78">Section 40(1)</a> was not fulfilled,

inasmuch as the acquisition was not for a public purpose. It was submitted that

unless there was any direct connection or close nexus between the articles produced

by the company and general good of the public, the impugned acquisition cannot be

treated as covered by Clause (aa). The majority of the Constitution Bench rejected

this argument and held:-
</p>
<p id="p_91">
"In approaching the question of construction of this clause, it cannot be forgotten
that the amendment was made in consequence of the decision of this Court in R.L.
Arora case and the intention of Parliament was to fill the lacuna, which, according to
that decision, existed in the Act in the matter of acquisitions for a company ....
Further, a literal interpretation is not always the only interpretation of a provision in
a statute and the court has to look at the setting in which the words are used and the
circumstances in which the law came to be passed to decide whether there is
something implicit behind the words actually used which would control the literal
meaning of the words used in a provision of the statute.

</pre><p id="p_92">Therefore, we have to see whether the provision in clause (aa) bears another
construction also in the setting in which it appears and in the circumstances in which
it was put on the statute book and also in view of the language used in the clause. The
circumstances in which the amendment came to be made have already been
mentioned by us and the intention of Parliament clearly was to fill up the lacuna in
the Act which became evident on the decision of this Court in R.L. Arora case . . . . It
was only for such a company that land was to be acquired compulsorily and the
acquisition was for the construction of some building or work for such a company i.e.
a company engaged or about to be engaged in some industry or work which is for a
public purpose. In this setting it seems to us reasonable to hold that the intention of
Parliament could only have been that land should be acquired for such building or
work for a company as would subserve the public purpose of the company; it could not
have been intended, considering the setting in which clause (aa) was introduced, that
land could be acquired for a building or work which would not subserve the public
purpose of the company .... Further, acquisition is for the construction of some
building or work for a company and the nature of that company is that it is engaged
or is taking steps for engaging itself in any industry or work which is for a public
purpose. When therefore the building or work is for such a company it seems to us
that it is reasonable to hold that the nature of the building or work to be constructed
takes colour from the nature of the company for which it is to be constructed. We are
therefore of opinion that the literal and mechanical construction for which the
petitioner contends is neither the only nor the true construction of clause (aa) and
that when clause (aa) provides for acquisition of land needed for construction of some
building or work it implicitly intends that the building or work which is to be
constructed must be such as to subserve the public purpose of the industry or work in
which the company is engaged or is about to be engaged. In short, the words `building
or work' used in clause (aa) take their colour from the adjectival clause which
governs the company for which the building; or work is being constructed . . . . It is
only in these cases where the company is engaged in an industry or work of that kind
and where the building or work is also constructed for a purpose of that kind, which
is a public purpose, that acquisition can be made under clause (aa). As we read the
clause we are of opinion that the public purpose of the company for which acquisition
is to be made cannot be divorced from the purpose of the building or work and it is
not open for such a company to acquire land under clause (aa) for a building or work
which will not subserve the public purpose of the company".

</p><p id="p_94">16.        The same question was again considered in <a href="/doc/658418/" id="a_79">State of West Bengal and

another vs. Surendra Nath Bhattacharya and another</a> [(1980) 3 SCC 237]. In that

case, acquisition was made on behalf of a company which was carrying on the

business of manufacturing of sodium silicate, plaster of paris etc. The manufactured

goods of the company were widely used all over India, saving large amount of foreign

exchange which was earlier used for importing similar goods. The Division Bench of
Calcutta High Court quashed the acquisition on the ground that it was not for a

public purpose. After noticing the majority judgment in second R.L. Arora's case,

the Court held:-
</p>
<p id="p_95">
 "The effect of the observations made above leads to the irresistible conclusion that
the words "public purpose" are not to be interpreted in a restricted sense but takes
colour from the nature of the industry itself, the articles that it manufactures and the
benefit to the people that it subserves. This Court clearly indicated that the land
should be acquired for building or work which would serve the public purpose of the
company and not public purpose as it is generally understood. In the instant case, we
have also set out the nature of the products of the company and have stressed the fact
that the articles produced by the company are used for the benefit of the people and
as it saves lot of foreign exchange, it is unmistakably for the general good of the
country particularly from the economic point of view. In these circumstances, it
cannot be said that the object of the company in extending its operations by enlarging
the area of its production was not for the public purpose of the company. Taking an
overall picture of the nature of the products of the company, its various activities, the
general public good that it seeks to achieve and the great benefit that the people
derive, it cannot be said that the acquisition, in the present case, was not for a public
purpose. According to the test laid down by this Court, it is sufficient if it is shown
that the building sought to be built or the work undertaken subserves the public
purpose of the company which is completely fulfilled in this case."




</p><p id="p_96">17.              <a href="/doc/1045847/" id="a_80">In Pratibha Nema and others vs. State of M.P. and others</a> [(2003) 10 SCC

626], this Court analysed the provisions of Part II and VII of the 1894 Act, referred

to the earlier judgments in Somwanti vs. State of Punjab [AIR 1963 SC 151], second

R.L. Arora's case, <a href="/doc/20367/" id="a_81">Jage Ram vs. State of Haryana</a> [(1971) 1 SCC 671], <a href="/doc/588752/" id="a_82">Bajirao T.

Kote vs. State of Maharashtra</a> [(1995) 2 SCC 442] and observed:-


"These decisions establish that a public purpose is involved in the acquisition of land
for setting up an industry in the private sector as it would ultimately benefit the
people. However, we would like to add that any and every industry need not
necessarily promote public purpose and there could be exceptions which negate the
public purpose. But, it must be borne in mind that the satisfaction of the Government
as to the existence of public purpose cannot be lightly faulted and it must remain
uppermost in the mind of the court.
</p><p id="p_97">..............
</p><p id="p_98">Thus the distinction between public purpose acquisition and Part VII acquisition has
got blurred under the impact of judicial interpretation of relevant provisions. The
main and perhaps the decisive distinction lies in the fact whether the cost of
acquisition comes out of public funds wholly or partly. Here again, even a token or
nominal contribution by the Government was held to be sufficient compliance with
the second proviso to <a href="/doc/587621/" id="a_83">Section 6</a> as held in a catena of decisions. The net result is that
by contributing even a trifling sum, the character and pattern of acquisition could be
changed by the Government. In ultimate analysis, what is considered to be an
acquisition for facilitating the setting up of an industry in the private sector could get
imbued with the character of public purpose acquisition if only the Government
comes forward to sanction the payment of a nominal sum towards compensation. In
the present state of law, that seems to be the real position."




</p><p id="p_99">18.        <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_84">Section 41</a> lays down that if the appropriate Government is satisfied, after

considering the report, if any, of the Collector under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_85">Section 5A(2)</a> or on the report of

the officer making an inquiry under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_86">Section 40</a>, that the proposed acquisition is for

any of the purposes referred to in clause (a) or (aa) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) of

<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_87">Section 40</a>, then it shall require the company to enter into an agreement on the

matters enumerated in Clauses 1 to 5. Clause 4(A) of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_88">Section 41</a>, which is relatable to

an acquisition under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_89">Section 40(1)(aa)</a>, requires that the agreement must indicate the

time within which and the conditions on which the building or work shall be

constructed or executed. Clause (5) of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_90">Section 41</a>, which is relatable to an acquisition

under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_91">Section 40(1)(b)</a>, also postulates indication of time within which work is

executed or maintained and the terms on which public shall be entitled to use the

considered a question similar to question No.1 framed by us and observed:



"..... Generally speaking the appropriate government would not state in so many
words whether it was proceeding under Clause (a), or Clause (aa) or Clause (b). The
question whether consent has been given under one clause or the other or more than
one clause has to be decided on the basis of the agreement and the notification under
<a href="/doc/587621/" id="a_93">Section 6</a>. We have also no doubt that it is open to the appropriate government to give
consent on being satisfied as to one of the three clauses only or as to more than one
clause. In the present case reliance has been placed on behalf of the State
Government on all the three clauses and particularly on clauses (aa) and (b), to show
that the consent was given after keeping in mind all the three clauses of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_94">Section 40(1)</a>.
The question as to which clause of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_95">Section 40(1)</a> was acted upon by the State
Government to give consent is important because on that will depend the nature of
the agreement which has to be made under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_96">Section 41</a>. Where the purpose of the
acquisition is as mentioned in Clause (a), the agreement has to provide for the time
within which, the conditions on which and the manner in which the dwelling houses
or amenities shall be erected or provided. Where the consent is based on Clause (aa),
the agreement is to provide for the time within which and the conditions on which,
the building or work shall be constructed or executed. Where the consent is given on
the basis of Clause (b), the agreement, is to specify the time within which and the
conditions on which the work shall be executed and maintained, and the terms on
which the public shall be entitled to use the work. It will be seen from the above that
there are bound to be differences in the terms to be embodied in an agreement under
<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_97">Section 41</a> depending upon whether the consent was given."
</p>
<p id="p_102">


</p><p id="p_103">20.        In the light of the above, we shall now consider whether on a conjoint

reading of notification dated 29.10.1980 and agreement dated 26.10.1983, acquisition

of survey Nos.803 and 804 (new Nos.246/2 and 245/2) can be treated as having been

made under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_98">Section 40(1)(aa)</a> or it was an acquisition under 40(1)(b) of the 1894 Act.

A brief recapitulation of the facts shows that soon after commencing work for

construction of the hotel, appellant No.1 approached the State Government for

acquisition of land comprised in various survey numbers including survey Nos.803

and 804 (new Nos.246/2 and 245/2) by indicating that the first phase of its project

envisages construction of hotel building in survey No.787 and in the second phase, it

was intending to put up a yoga centre, health club and water sports facilities in

survey No.805 for promoting tourism, which will also be useful to the general public.

Appellant No.1 pointed out that two small plots bearing survey Nos.788 and 789,

abutting the beach, are required for installing a first aid post and a medical aid

centre, which are necessary for beach resort hotel and for providing safety measures

and facilities to the residents of the hotel and also for the public at large, using the

beach. Appellant No.1 then submitted that for second phase of the hotel complex, it

will be desirable to acquire survey Nos.803 and 804 so that the entire complex will

become one composite unit. In the end, appellant No.1 indicated that the facilities

provided by the hotel will be open for use to the non-residents on membership basis.

The notification issued by the State Government under <a href="/doc/875938/" id="a_99">Section 4(1)</a> shows that the
land was needed for a public purpose, namely, the tourism development project -

construction of hotel at Curla, Vainguinim, Taleigao. In our view, as appellant No.1

was engaged in executing a project of tourism development, i.e., construction of hotel

along with amenities like yoga centre, health club and water sports facilities,

acquisition of survey Nos.803 and 804 (new Nos.246/2 and 245/2) was clearly

relatable to its project. This is also borne out from the language of agreement dated

26.10.1983, which records satisfaction of the Government that the land was needed

for the purpose of executing tourism development project of appellant No.1. Clause 4

</p><p id="p_104">(ii) of the agreement shows that appellant No.1 was required to undertake the work

of creation of sports and recreational facilities / amenities within one year of getting

possession and complete the same within three years.         This work was certainly

ancillary to the tourism development project being executed by appellant No.1.

Therefore, there is no escape from the conclusion that the acquisition was under

<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_100">Section 40(1)(aa)</a> of the 1894 Act and the contrary finding recorded by the High

Court is legally unsustainable. It is also necessary to bear in mind that tourism is an

important industrial activity in Goa which attracts tourists from all over the country

and abroad. A huge amount of foreign exchange is generated by this industry apart

from providing employment and ancillary benefits to a large section of the population

of the State.   Therefore, acquisition of land for tourism development project is

certainly for a public purpose.

Re: 2



</p><p id="p_106">21.        For deciding the question whether public access to the beach was available

through survey No.803 (new No.246/2) before its acquisition in the year 1980, it will

be profitable to notice the pleadings of the parties and contents of the documents

produced by them. In all the writ petitions, the petitioners claimed that there exists

passage through survey No.803 which is being used by the public for many years for
going to the beach. In para 6 of his writ petition, Minguel Martins referred to the

affidavit of Avdhut Kamat filed by appellant No.2 in civil suit for a decree of pre-

emption instituted by Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto and two others. In other two

petitions, the writ petitioners relied on the averments contained in the written

statement filed on behalf of appellant No.2 in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A to

support their assertion regarding existence of access to the beach through survey

No.803. Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto also placed on record a copy of the affidavit

of Avdhut Kamat and plan prepared by him showing access to the beach from point

`A' to `B' in survey No.803. In that plan starting point of access from the beach was

at point `B' in survey No.803 and it ended at point `A' touching northern boundary

of that survey number towards Machado's Cove.
</p>
<p id="p_107">

</p><p id="p_108">22.        In paragraphs 2F to 2O, 2R, 2S, 3E and 3H of the written statement filed

on behalf of appellant No.2 in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A, the following

averments were made:
</p>
<p id="p_109">
"2F.       As shown before, the properties 803, 804, 787, 788, 789 and 805 are
bounded on the South by seashore beyond which the river zuari lies. A part of this
shore which forms the boundary to the said properties is used as public way. This
public way after passing through the seashore and some private road goes upto Dona
Paula jotty. This, public way is used by the members of the public including the
fisher folk to go from th said seashore upto Dona Paula jetty and vice-versa, from
time immemorial, without objection whosoever, openly, peacefully and continuously
and as a matter of right.
</p>
<p id="p_110">2G.         The beach existing at the south of property 803 and 787 is a public resort
and it is visited by members of the public from all parts of llhas Taluka. For this
purpose there is a ramp (stone construction) built on the ground in property 803 as a
means of access to the beach. There is also a similar ramp in the property 787. The
existence of the ramps and the date of their construction is lost in antiquity but has
been known to exist at least for the last seventy years.
</p>
<p id="p_111">2H.        In order to have access to the portion of the beach existing in the property
803, there is a footpath starting from the ramp and going towards North upto the
culvert linking property 803 with property 792 of Machado therefrom after crossing
the property of Machado in the same direction, it touches the public footpath going
from Dona Paula to Calapur. At present, the said footpath touches the Panaji-Dona
Paula-Bambolim road and crosses the property of Machado.
</p><p id="p_112">2I.       The way mentioned in the proceeding para 2H is being used by members
of the public living in the village Calapur and also by other members of the public
coming from different parts of Taluka llhas. This way is clearly visible on site.

2J.         The Plaintiffs family have access to the properties 803, 804, 788 and 789
through the said way mentioned in para 2H and they have been using this access for
the last fifty years. The family of the Plaintiffs have their residential house at St.
Cruz village and this way in the nearest way for them.
</p>
<p id="p_113">2K.       The access to the property 788 and 789 of the Plaintiff's family is through
the property 803 and through the portion of the beach used as a public way and
standing on the Southern side.
</p>
<p id="p_114">2L. The access to the property 804 is through the property 803 and for that purpose
there exists a culvert.
</p>
<p id="p_115">2M.        The access to the property 806 is in the continuation of the way leading
from 803 and 804 and then going to the beach and to property 806. 806 has also
direct access to the seashore which is used as public way.
</p>
<p id="p_116">2N.       It is not true that that the way to 806 goes from property 805 as
represented in the map annexed to the Plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_117">2O.            The access to the property 807 is through the property of Machadio
Survey No. 792 and more particularly the way which goes just in line with the
Eastern boundary of property of Machado. This latter was given access also to
property 806 after passing through properties which stand at the East of property
807 and 805. As represented in the map annexed to the Plaint, 807 has access
through 804 and 803.
</p><p id="p_118">.................
</p>
<p id="p_119">2R.        The members of the public coming through the way mentioned in Para 2P
were using either the portion of beach in property 787 or portion of beach in
property 803. Whenever they were using the ramp existing in the property 803, they
used the way which connects the footpath mentioned in Para 2P with the footpath
stated in Para 2H and thereafter they were going to the ramp through the way to 2
(H).
</p>
<p id="p_120">2S.            The ways mentioned in Para 2F, 2H and 2P have been used by the
members of the public and villagers from immemorial times, openly, peacefully,
continuously in order to come to the beach and they are public ways and have been so
dedicated as is evidenced by the long and continuous user.
</p><p id="p_121">...............
</p>
<p id="p_122">"3E.       From this parking place a footpath is maintained alongside the Eastern
boundary of property 787 and Western boundary of property 803 going to the south
upto the Sea Shore.
</p>
<p id="p_123">3H.        The Plaintiffs have not come to the Court with clean hands and hence
deliberately omitted to represent in the map annexed to the plaint the ramps existing
in the properties 787 and 803 and giving access to the beach. Similarly the Plaintiffs
have deliberately omitted to represent in the map the public way mentioned in Para
2H and 3E, the Plaintiffs have further deliberately, in order to snatch injunction,
wrongly represented the way mentioned in 2(k)."

</p><p id="p_125">23.       Along with the written statement, appellant No.2 filed affidavit of Shri

Avdhut Kamat, who was engaged as consulting engineer for the hotel project. In

paragraph 2 of his affidavit, Shri Kamat stated as under:
</p>
<p id="p_126">
"2.         I say that under instructions from said Fomento, I have prepared a plan of
property bearing survey No. 787 to 807. The properties with survey No.787, 790, 798,
800, 801, 802 and 805 have been purchased by said Fomento from Defendants No.2 to
</p><p id="p_127">5. The plan has been drawn by me taking into consideration the old survey, new
survey and present position on the site. The new numbers of the survey are also
shown in the plan. On the said plan, I have shown existing public pathways by red
pencil lines. From the said plan it appears that none of the Defendant's lands (all of
which are hatched on the plan) are, in fact, enclosed property, since all of them have
access to public ways. The pathways marked red in the plan have been personally
checked by me with the assistance of my assistants Engineers and can be verified on
the site."
</p><p id="p_128">                                                                    [Emphasis added]




          The affidavit of Shri Kamat was accompanied by the plan marked as

Exhibit-A which depicted various pathways including the one going from the beach

to Dona-Paola-Bambolim Road through survey Nos.803 and 792.



</p><p id="p_129">24.       In the reply affidavit filed in Writ Petition No.141/1992, appellant No.1 did

not dispute the correctness of the written statement filed in Special Civil Suit

No.313/1978/A or the affidavit of Shri Avdhut Kamat and plan prepared by him after

personally inspecting the site. The High Court relied on the averments contained in

the written statement and held that the existence of public access to the

beach/pathway leading to the beach through survey No.803 cannot be doubted.



</p><p id="p_130">25.       Shri Anil Divan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants

heavily relied on judgment dated 13.3.2006 passed by Civil Judge, Panaji in Special

Civil Suit No.67/1986 - Alvaro De Souza Machado and another v. Sociedade De
Fomento Industrial Pvt. Ltd. and another and argued that the finding recorded by

the High Court on the issue of existence of public access to the beach through survey

No.803 should be treated as redundant because the same is entirely based on

admissions made in the written statement filed on behalf of appellant No.2 in Special

Civil Suit No.313/1978/A and the competent court has found that the same are not

binding on the appellants (who were defendants in Special Civil Suit No.67/1986). He

pointed out that learned Civil Judge, Panaji has found that written statement was not

verified by the concerned person on personal knowledge and, therefore, admissions

made therein cannot be made basis for recording an adverse finding against the

defendants in the suit. In the first blush, this argument of the learned senior counsel

appears attractive but on a closure scrutiny, we do not find any merit in it. The

learned Civil Judge who decided the suit filed by Alvaro De Souza Machado and

another relied upon the judgments of this Court in <a href="/doc/1010762/" id="a_101">Nagubai Ammal &amp; others v. B.

Shama Rao &amp; others</a> (supra) and of the Allahabad High Court in <a href="/doc/1003986/" id="a_102">Anurag Misra vs.

Ravindra Singh and another</a> (supra) and held that the admissions made in the earlier

suit in paragraphs 2A, 2C, 2E, 2F to 2S, etc. cannot be treated as binding on the

defendants because contents of the written statement were verified by using the

words "true to the best of my information which I believe as true" and not on

personal knowledge. This approach of the learned Civil Judge was clearly contrary

to Order VI Rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides for verification

of pleadings. Sub-rule (1) of Rule 15 lays down that save as otherwise provided, by

any law for the time being in force, every pleading shall be verified at the foot by the

party or by one of parties pleading or by some other person proved to the satisfaction

of the court to be acquainted with the facts of the case. Sub-rule (2) lays down that

the person verifying shall satisfy, by reference to the numbered paragraphs of the

pleadings, what he verifies of his own knowledge and what he verifies upon the

information received and believed to be true.         Sub-rule (3) requires that the
verification shall be signed by the person making it and shall state the date on which

and the place at which it was signed. By amending Act No. 46/1999 the requirement

of filing an affidavit by the person verifying the pleadings was incorporated but that

provision does not have any bearing on this case.
</p>
<p id="p_131">

</p><p id="p_132">26.        The plain language of Order VI Rule 15(2) makes it clear that the

pleadings can be verified by the concerned person on his own knowledge or upon the

information received and believed to be true by him/her. The written statement filed

on behalf of appellant No.2 in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A was verified by Smt.

Anju Timblo who represented the appellants cause before various functionaries of

the State Government and its instrumentalities and also filed reply affidavits in

different writ petitions. Smt. Anju Timblo did not claim that she is acquainted with

the topography/geography of the area which included survey Nos.792 and 803.

Therefore, she could not have verified the written statement containing the admission

regarding existence of passage/pathway to beach through survey No.803 on her own

knowledge. Therefore, verification of the written statement containing admission

about the existence of passage through Machado's Cove and survey No.803 on the

basis of information which she believed to be true was in consonance with Order VI

Rule 15(2) and the learned Civil Judge committed an error in holding that the

admissions contained in the written statement of the earlier suit were not binding on

the defendants. Another error committed by the learned Civil Judge was that he

altogether overlooked the statement made by Smt. Anju Timblo, who appeared as a

witness on behalf of the defendants in Special Civil Suit No.67/1986 and candidly

accepted in the cross-examination that the written statement filed in Special Civil

Suit No.313/1978/A contained admissions about existence of access to the beach

through survey No.803. It is also significant to note that neither the writ petitioners

nor the State of Goa were parties to the second suit and, therefore, they did not get
opportunity to show that admissions contained in the written statement of appellant

No.2 in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A were rightly relied upon by the High Court

and the learned Civil Judge could not have taken a contrary view.


</p><p id="p_133">27.       It was neither the pleaded case of the appellants before the High Court nor

it was argued on their behalf that the admissions contained in the written statement

filed in the previous suit about existence of access to the beach from Dona-Paola-

Bambolim Road through survey Nos.792 (Machado's Cove) and 803 were made

under a bonafide mistake and the affidavit of Shri Avdhut Kamat and the sketch

prepared by him were contrary to the actual physical status of various survey

numbers mentioned therein. Therefore, the High Court cannot be said to have erred

in relying upon the admissions made in the written statement of appellant No.2 in

Special Civil Suit No. 313/1978/A that there existed access to the beach through

survey Nos.792 and 803 before its acquisition by the State Government.



</p><p id="p_134">28.       The propositions of law laid down in Nagubai Ammal's case and

Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri's case on which reliance has been placed by Shri Divan

do not have any bearing on the cases in hand. In Nagubai Ammal's case, this Court

considered the legality of the sale made in execution of decree passed on a mortgage

deed. The appellants, who were defendants in the suit for declaration of title to

certain building sites, resisted the respondents' claim based on the purchase made in

execution of mortgage decree. That suit was decreed in 1921 and the lands were

purchased by the decree holder in 1928. The mortgager was adjudged an insolvent in

1926. Suit to enforce the mortgage deed was brought in 1933 impleading the official

receiver and the purchaser in execution of the maintenance and charge decree, but

the appellants were not impleaded as parties. In execution of the decree passed in the

second suit, the lands were sold to a third party. The respondents' father purchased

the land in 1938 from the said third party. The learned District Judge held that the
appellants' title acquired by the purchase of 1920 stood extinguished by the sale held

in execution of the charge decree by operation of <a href="/doc/1634925/" id="a_103">Section 52</a> of the Transfer of

Property Act. Before the Supreme Court, the appellants relied on the admission

made by Abdul Huq (predecessors of respondents), and the respondents themselves

that the decree and sale in the suit instituted in 1920 were collusive. While rejecting

the argument, this Court observed:
</p>
<p id="p_135">
"An admission is not conclusive as to the truth of the matters stated therein. It is only
a piece of evidence, the weight to be attached to which must depend on the
circumstances under which it is made. It can be shown to be erroneous or untrue, so
long as the person to whom it was made has not acted upon it to his detriment, when
it might become conclusive by way of estoppel. In the present case, there is no
question of estoppel, as the title of Dr. Nanjunda Rao arose under a purchase which
was longer prior to the admissions made in 1932 and in the subsequent years. It is
argued for the appellants that these admissions at the least shifted the burden on to
the plaintiff of proving that the proceedings were not collusive, and that as he gave no
evidence worth the name that these statements were made under a mistake or for a
purpose and were, in fact, not true, full effect must be given to them. Reliance was
placed on the well-known observations of Baron Park in Slatterie v. Pooley [[1840] 6
M. &amp; W. 664, 669; 151 E.R. 579, 581], that "what a party himself admits to be true
may reasonably be presumed to be so", and on the decision in <a href="/doc/99435/" id="a_104">Rani Chandra Kunwar
v. Chaudhri Narpat Singh</a> : <a href="/doc/99435/" id="a_105">Rani Chandra Kunwar v. Rajah Makund Singh</a> [[1906-
07] L.R. 34 I.A. 27], where this statement of the law was adopted. No exception can be
taken to this proposition. But before it can be invoked, it must be shown that there is
a clear and unambiguous statement by the opponent, such as will be conclusive unless
explained. It has been a already pointed out that the tenor of the statements made by
Abdul Huq, his legal representatives and the plaintiff was to suggest that the
proceedings in O. S. No. 100 of 1919-20 were fraudulent and not collusive in
character. Those statements would not, in our opinion, be sufficient, without more, to
sustain a finding that the proceedings were collusive."

<p id="p_136">


</p><p id="p_137">           In Anurag Misra's case (supra), the learned Single Judge of the Allahabad

High Court held that vague allegations about the ownership of the premises made by

the tenant in his written statement filed in a suit for eviction cannot be treated as

admission about the contract of tenancy with the plaintiff/landlord and the tenant

cannot be estopped from subsequently disputing the relationship of landlord and

tenant by pleading that somebody else is the owner of the premises in question.
</p><p id="p_138">29.        In neither of the afore-mentioned cases, this Court or Allahabad High

Court considered whether unequivocal admission made by a party in a

contemporaneous litigation can be ignored on the ground of so-called defect in

verification.   That apart, as we have already found, verification of the written

statement filed on behalf of appellant No.2 in Special Civil Suit No. 313/1978/A was in

conformity with Order VI Rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the High Court

rightly relied upon the same for holding that existence of public access to the beach

through survey No.803 (new No.246/2) cannot be doubted.
</p>
<p id="p_139">

</p><p id="p_140">30.        The appellants attempt to confuse the existence of access to the beach from

point `A' to `B' in survey No.803 with the so-called access running along side nallah

deserves to be discarded because no such case was projected before the High Court

and no argument was advanced on that score. It is also worth mentioning that in his

letter dated 1.12.1978 the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat had made a specific

mention of public footpath which runs on survey No.787 and forms the boundary of

survey No.803 and the parking area which was shown as situated on the Northeast

corner of survey No.787 adjacent to survey No.803.     There is no mention in any of

the documents of the so-called access along side the nallah dividing survey No.803

(new No.246/2) on the one hand and survey Nos.804 and 805 on the other hand.



</p><p id="p_141">31.        Once it is held that there existed public access to the beach through survey

No.803 (new No.246/2) before its acquisition by the State Government in 1980, the

appellants are duty bound to act in accordance with Clause 4(ix) of the agreement,

which has the force of law by virtue of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_106">Section 42</a> of the 1894 Act. That clause casts a

duty on appellant No.1 to maintain access to the beach without obstruction of any

kind whatsoever. The argument of Shri Anil Divan and Shri Pallav Shishodia,

learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants and the State of Goa respectively,
that the Court may relieve the appellants of the obligation to maintain access to the

beach through survey No.803 (new No.246/2) because an alternative access has been

provided by constructing road, parking area and public footpath, in furtherance of

the permission accorded by the Gram Panchayat for construction of hotel in survey

No. 787, cannot be accepted for the simple reason that the agreement was executed

between the President of India and appellant No.1 in the backdrop of acquisition of

survey No.803 (new No.246/2) and 804 (new No.245/2) and survey No.787 on which

the hotel was constructed has nothing to do with the acquisition proceedings.

Therefore, the alternative road, parking and public footpath provided by appellant

No.1 in lieu of the access available through survey No.787 cannot be made basis for

depriving members of the public of their age old right to go to the beach through

survey No.803 (new No. 246/2).
</p>
<p id="p_142">

</p><p id="p_143">32.       The matter deserves to be considered from another angle. The public

trust doctrine which has been invoked by Ms. Indira Jaising in support of her

argument that the beach in question is a public beach and the appellants cannot

privatize the same by blocking/obstructing traditional access available through

survey No.803 (new No.246/2) is implicitly engrafted by the State Government in

Clause 4(ix) of the agreement. That doctrine primarily rests on the principle that

certain resources like air, sea, waters and the forests have such a great importance to

the people as a whole that it would be wholly unjustified to make them a subject of

private ownership. These resources are gift of nature, therefore, they should be

freely available to everyone irrespective of one's status in life. The public trust

doctrine enjoins upon the Government to protect the resources for the enjoyment of

the general public rather than to permit their use for private ownership or

commercial purposes. This doctrine puts an implicit embargo on the right of the

State to transfer public properties to private party if such transfer affects public
interest, mandates affirmative State action for effective management of natural

resources and empowers the citizens to question ineffective management thereof. The

heart of the public trust doctrine is that it imposes limits and obligations upon

government agencies and their administrators on behalf of all the people and

especially future generations. For example, renewable and non-renewable resources,

associated uses, ecological values or objects in which the public has a special interest

(i.e. public lands, waters, etc.) are held subject to the duty of the State not to impair

such resources, uses or values, even if private interests are involved. The same

obligations apply to managers of forests, monuments, parks, the public domain and

other public assets. Professor Joseph L. Sax in his classic article "The Public Trust

Doctrine in     Natural Resources Law: Effective Judicial Intervention" (1970),

indicates that the Public Trust Doctrine, of all concepts known to law, constitutes the

best practical and philosophical premise and legal tool for protecting public rights

and for protecting and managing resources, ecological values or objects held in trust.

The Public Trust Doctrine is a tool for exerting long-established public rights over

short-term public rights and private gain. Today, every person exercising his or her

right to use the air, water, or land and associated natural ecosystems has the

obligation to secure for the rest of us the right to live or otherwise use that same

resource or property for the long term and enjoyment by future generations. To say

it another way, a landowner or lessee and a water right holder has an obligation to

use such resources in a manner as not to impair or diminish the people's rights and

the people's long term interest in that property or resource, including down-slope

lands, waters and resources.

</p><p id="p_145">33.        In Illinois Central Railraod Co. vs. People of the State of Illinois [146 US

387], the United States Supreme Court considered whether the State could abdicate

its general control over the sub-merged land. In the year 1869, the Illonois legislature

made a substantial grant of sub-merged land - a mile strip along the shores of Lake
Michigan extending one mile out from the shoreline - to the Illinois Central Railroad.

This was repealed in 1869. The State of Illinois sued to quit title. The Supreme

Court while accepting the stand of the State of Illinois held that the title of the State

in the land in dispute was a title different in character from that which the State held

in lands intended for sale. It was different from the title which the United States held

in public lands which were open to pre-emption and sale. It was a title held in trust

</p><p id="p_146">-- for the people of the State that they may enjoy the navigation of the water, carry

on commerce over them and have liberty of fishing therein free from obstruction or

interference of private parties. The abdication of the general control of the State over

lands in dispute was not consistent with the exercise of the trust which required the

Government of the State to preserve such waters for the use of the public.

nature study and recreation" for highway use.

<p id="p_148">
</p><p id="p_149">35.        In National Audubon Society vs. Superior Court of Alpine County [33 Cal

3d 419], the Supreme Court of California considered whether a permit can be

granted to the Department of Water and Power of the City of Los Angeles to

appropriate water of four of the five streams flowing into Mono Lake, which is the

second largest lake in California. Some environmentalists, using the public trust

doctrine, brought law suit against Los Angeles Water Diversions. The Supreme

Court of California explained the concept of public trust doctrine in the following

words:
</p>
<p id="p_150">
" `By the law of nature these things are common to mankind -- the air, running
water, the sea and consequently the shores of the sea.' (Institutes of Justinian 2.1.1)
From this origin in Roman law, the English common law evolved the concept of the
public trust, under which the sovereign owns `all of its navigable waterways and the
lands lying beneath them as trustee of a public trust for the benefit of the people.' "



</p><p id="p_151">           While dealing with the State's power as a trustee of public property, the

Court observed:-
</p>
<p id="p_152">"Thus, the public trust is more than an affirmation of State power to use public
property for public purposes. It is an affirmation of the duty of the State to protect
the people's common heritage of streams, lakes, marshlands and tidelands,
surrendering that right of protection only in rare cases when the abandonment of
that right is consistent with the purposes of the trust...."



</p><p id="p_153">           The Court recorded its conclusion in the following words:-
</p>
<p id="p_154">"The State has an affirmative duty to take the public trust into account in the
planning and allocation of water resources, and to protect public trust uses whenever
feasible. Just as the history of this State shows that appropriation may be necessary
for efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it
demonstrates that an appropriative water rights system administered without
consideration of the public trust may cause unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust
interests. (See Johnson, 14 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 233, 256-57/; Robie, Some Reflections
on Environmental Considerations in Water Rights Administration, 2 Ecology L.Q. 695,
710-711 (1972); Comment, 33 Hastings L.J. 653, 654.) As a matter of practical
necessity the State may have to approve appropriations despite foreseeable harm to
public trust uses. In so doing, however, the State must bear in mind its duty as trustee
to consider the effect of the taking on the public trust (see United Plainsmen v. N.D.
State Water Cons. Comm'n [247 NW 2d 457 (ND 1976)] at pp.462-463, and to
preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the uses protected by the trust."




</p><p id="p_155">36.        The Indian society has, since time immemorial, been conscious of the

necessity of protecting environment and ecology. The main moto of social life has

been "to live in harmony with nature". Sages and Saints of India lived in forests.

Their preachings contained in Vedas, Upanishadas, Smritis etc. are ample evidence of

the society's respect for plants, trees, earth, sky, air, water and every form of life. It

was regarded as a sacred duty of every one to protect them. In those days, people

worshipped trees, rivers and sea which were treated as belonging to all living

creatures. The children were educated by their parents and grandparents about the
necessity of keeping the environment clean and protecting earth, rivers, sea, forests,

trees, flora fauna and every species of life.
</p>
<p id="p_156">

The Constitution of India, which was enforced on 26th January, 1950 did not contain

any provision obligating the State to protect environment and ecology, but the people

continued to treat it as their social duty to respect the nature, natural resources and

protect environment and ecology. After almost three decades of independence, the

legislature recognized the importance of protecting and improving environment and

safeguarding forests and wild life and <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_107">Article 48A</a> was inserted in Part IV of the

Constitution by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 whereby a

duty was imposed on the State to endeavour to protect and improve the environment

and safeguard forests and wild life of the country. By the same amendment <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_108">Article

51A</a> was inserted in the form of Part IVA which enumerates fundamental duties of

every citizen. <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_109">Article 51A(g)</a> declares that it shall be the duty of every citizen of India

to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and

wild life and to have compassion for living creatures.          Thereafter, the Courts

repeatedly invoked Articles 48A and 51A for protecting environment and ecology and

several orders were passed in public interest litigation mandating the State to take

action for protecting forests, rivers and anti pollution measures.



The importance of the public trust doctrine was also recognized by this Court and the

same was applied for protecting natural resources which have been treated as public

properties and are held by the government as trustee of the people. <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_110">In M.C. Mehta v.

Kamal Nath and others</a> [(1997) 1 SCC 388], this Court considered whether a private

company running tourists resort in Kullu-Manali valley could block the flow of Beas

river and create a new channel to divert the river to at least 1 kilometer down stream.
After adverting to the theoretical and philosophical basis of the public trust doctrine

and some judgments on the subject, this Court observed:
</p>
<p id="p_157">
"We are fully aware that the issues presented in this case illustrate the classic
struggle between those members of the public who would preserve our rivers, forests,
parks and open lands in their pristine purity and those charged with administrative
responsibilities who, under the pressures of the changing needs of an increasingly
complex society, find it necessary to encroach to some extent upon open lands
heretofore considered inviolate to change. The resolution of this conflict in any given
case is for the legislature and not the courts. If there is a law made by Parliament or
the State Legislatures the courts can serve as an instrument of determining legislative
intent in the exercise of its powers of judicial review under the Constitution. But in
the absence of any legislation, the executive acting under the doctrine of public trust
cannot abdicate the natural resources and convert them into private ownership, or
for commercial use. The aesthetic use and the pristine glory of the natural resources,
the environment and the ecosystems of our country cannot be permitted to be eroded
for private, commercial or any other use unless the courts find it necessary, in good
faith, for the public good and in public interest to encroach upon the said resources.

Allahabad High Court which quashed the decision of Lucknow Nagar Mahapalika

permitting appellant - M.I. Builders Pvt. Ltd. to construct an underground shopping

complex in Jhandewala Park, Aminabad Market, Lucknow, and directed demolition

of the construction made on the park land. The High Court noted that Lucknow

Nagar Mahapalika had entered into an agreement with the appellant for construction

of shopping complex and given it full freedom to lease out the shops and also to sign

agreement on its behalf and held that this was impermissible. On appeal by the

builders, this Court held that the terms of agreement were unreasonable, unfair and

atrocious. The Court then invoked the public trust doctrine and held that being a

trustee of the park on behalf of the public, the Nagar Mahapalika could not have

transferred the same to the private builder and thereby deprived the residents of the

area of the quality of life to which they were entitled under the Constitution and

Municipal Laws.

"This is an articulation of the doctrine from the angle of the affirmative duties of the
State with regard to public trust. Formulated from a negatory angle, the doctrine
does not exactly prohibit the alienation of the property held as a public trust.
However, when the State holds a resource that is freely available for the use of the
public, it provides for a high degree of judicial scrutiny on any action of the
Government, no matter how consistent with the existing legislations, that attempts to
restrict such free use. To properly scrutinise such actions of the Government, the
courts must make a distinction between the Government's general obligation to act
for the public benefit, and the special, more demanding obligation which it may have
as a trustee of certain public resources [Joseph L. Sax "The Public Trust Doctrine in
Natural Resource Law: Effective Judicial Intervention", Michigan Law Review, Vol.
68, No. 3 (Jan. 1970) pp.471-566]. According to Prof. Sax, whose article on this
subject is considered to be an authority, three types of restrictions on governmental
authority are often thought to be imposed by the public trust doctrine [ibid]:
</p><p id="p_161">1.        the property subject to the trust must not only be used for a public
purpose, but it must be held available for use by the general public;
</p><p id="p_162">2.         the property may not be sold, even for fair cash equivalent;
</p><p id="p_163">3.         the property must be maintained for particular types of use (i) either
traditional uses, or (ii) some uses particular to that form of resources."



</p><p id="p_164">39.        The Court then held that the government orders are violative of principle

Nos.1 to 3, mentioned in the article of Professor Joseph L. Sax and directed that no

further construction be made in Peruru and Avilala tanks and corrective measures be

taken for recharging them.
</p>
<p id="p_165">
</p><p id="p_166">40.        We reiterate that natural resources including forests, water bodies, rivers,

sea shores, etc. are held by the State as a trustee on behalf of the people and

especially the future generations. These constitute common properties and people are

entitled to uninterrupted use thereof.       The State cannot transfer public trust

properties to a private party, if such a transfer interferes with the right of the public
and the Court can invoke the public trust doctrine and take affirmative action for

protecting the right of people to have access to light, air and water and also for

protecting rivers, sea, tanks, trees, forests and associated natural eco-systems.



</p><p id="p_167">41.        As a sequel to the above discussion, we hold that Clause 4(ix) of the

agreement is binding on the appellants and appellant No.1 is under a statutory

obligation to maintain access/road to the beach through survey No.803 (new

No.246/2) without any obstruction of any kind and the High Court did not commit

any error by issuing a mandamus in that regard.

</p><p id="p_169">42.        <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_114">Section 16</a> of the 1894 Act which constitute the foundation of the

arguments of the appellants and State that the public access to the beach, if any

available, through survey No.803 (new No.246/2) stood extinguished with the vesting

of land in the State Government, reads as under:-

<p id="p_170">

</p>
<p id="p_171">


</p><p id="p_172">43.        The argument of Shri Anil Divan, learned senior counsel appearing for the

appellants is that even though access to the beach may have been available through

survey No.803 before its acquisition and the general public may have been using the

same as of right for going to the beach, the said right got terminated as soon as

possession of the land was taken by the government. His further argument is that

public access to the beach through survey No.803 was in the nature of encumbrance
on the land which stood extinguished on vesting of the land in the Government in

terms of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_116">Section 16</a> of the 1894 Act. Shri Pallav Shishodia, learned senior counsel

appearing for the State adopted this argument and emphatically submitted that

access to the beach available to the public through survey No.803 (new No.246/2)

before its acquisition was obliterated once the acquired land vested in the

Government.
</p>
<p id="p_173">

</p><p id="p_174">44.        Although, no exception can be taken to the appellants coming forward

with such an argument despite the fact that in terms of Clause 4(ix) of the agreement

which has, by virtue of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_117">Section 42</a> of the 1894 Act, the force of law, they are required

to maintain public access to the beach, we are quite surprised with the stance adopted

by the State Government. Admittedly, the agreement was executed by appellant No.1

under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_118">Section 41</a> of the 1894 Act in the backdrop of acquisition of survey No.803

(new No.246/2) and survey No.804 (new No.245/2). It is also not in dispute that in

terms of Clause 4(ix), appellant No.1 is required to maintain access to the beach

without any obstruction. This shows that despite <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_119">Section 16</a> of the 1894 Act, the

parties had consciously decided to protect the traditional right of the members of

public to go to the beach by using the existing pathway through the acquired land.

Both, the appellants and State functionaries knew that there exist public access to the

beach through survey No.803 (new No.246/2), that members of public were using the

same since time immemorial and that it was necessary to protect that right.

Therefore, it is not possible to find any fault with the view taken by the High Court

that access to the beach is not an encumbrance and in any case, the traditional

pathway available to the public for going to the beach through survey No.803 (new

No.246/2) cannot be treated as having been extinguished in the face of specific

provision contained in the agreement which is statutory in character.

judgment, two-Judges bench referred to the judgments of Allahabad and Calcutta
High Courts wherein it was held that the word `encumbrance' means burden or

charge upon property for a claim or lien upon State or land and it would include

easementary right over the land.
</p>
<p id="p_178">

</p><p id="p_179">47.       The last mentioned judgment was considered by another bench of two-

Judges in <a href="/doc/1695760/" id="a_127">H.P. State Electricity Board and others vs. Shiv K. Sharma and others</a>

[(2005) 2 SCC 164]. The facts of that case were that appellant-board purchased

10.10. bighas out of the holding of one Rikhi Ram.        The sale deed specifically

mentioned that respondent Nos.1 to 3 shall have access to their land from the land of

the seller. Thereafter, the State Government acquired an area of 41.06 bighas of land

for construction of 60 KW Sub-Station. The acquired land included the remaining

land of Rikhi Ram from whom respondent Nos.1 to 3 had purchased the land. After

acquisition, the entire property was fenced of by barbed wire and electric sub-station

and living quarters of the employees of appellant were also constructed thereupon.

In the process, the appellant blocked off the passage being used as access to the land

of the respondents. Respondent Nos.1 to 3 unsuccessfully sued the appellant-board

for mandatory injunction to remove the barbed wire fence blocking access to their

land. On appeal, the learned District Judge reversed the judgment of the trial Court

and decreed the suit. The High Court confirmed the appellate judgment. Before this

Court, reliance was placed on the judgment in Tarsem Singh's case and it was argued

that even if respondent Nos.1 to 3 had a right of way by easement over the land of

Rikhi Ram, the said land having been acquired stood vested in the State Government

under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_128">Section 16</a> absolutely free from all encumbrances including such easementary

right. The High Court drew a distinction between easement of an ordinary nature in

respect of which compensation could have been claimed in the land acquisition

proceedings and an easement of necessity like a right of passage and held that such

right was not extinguished by reason of acquisition. For this purpose, the High Court
relied on the observations made in Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri's case.            While

confirming the High Court's verdict, the two-Judges bench observed:


"This judgment of Collector of Bombay was a judgment by a Bench of three learned
Judges of this Court. Learned counsel for the appellants drew our attention to the
judgment in State of H.P. rendered by a Bench of two learned Judges and contended
that this judgment clearly holds that the phrase "free from all encumbrances" used in
<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_129">Section 16</a> of the Act is wholly unqualified and would include in its compass every
right including an easementary right which affects the land. He particularly drew our
attention to para 10 of the judgment where the Court took the view:
"All rights, title and interests including the easementary rights stood extinguished
and all such rights, title and interests vested in the State free from all encumbrances."
In the first place, it is difficult for us to read the judgment in Tarsem Singh case as
taking a view contrary to and differing from the law laid down by a larger Bench in
Collector of Bombay. Secondly, we notice that the decision in Tarsem Singh is not in
respect of an easementary right arising out of necessity. There does not seem to be
any discussion on the said aspect of the matter in this judgment. The view taken in
Collector of Bombay therefore, appears to hold the field, particularly where the
nature of easementary right claimed is not capable of being evaluated in terms of
compensation and arises out of sheer necessity."
</p>
<p id="p_180">


</p><p id="p_181">48.        By applying the ratio of the judgments in Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri's

case and H.P. State Electricity Board's case to the facts of this case, we hold that

when the State volunteered to take possession of the land subject to the right of the

members of public to access the beach through the acquired land and a specific

provision to that effect was incorporated in the agreement executed under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_130">Section 41</a>

(5), <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_131">Section 16</a> of the 1894 Act cannot be invoked for nullifying the right of the public

to access the beach through survey No.803 (new No.246/2).
</p>
<p id="p_182">

</p><p id="p_183">49.        We also do not find any substance in the argument of Shri Anil Divan that

Court should not insist on continuance of public access to the beach through survey

No.803 (new No.246/2) because the pathway going to Dona Paula-Bambolim Road

which was available through survey No.792 (new No.242/1) (Machado's Cove) does

not exist any more. The premise on which Shri Divan has made this argument,

namely, non-availability of pathway through survey No.792 does not find support
from the record of these appeals. Therefore, it is neither proper nor justified for this

Court to deny the people of their traditional right of access to the beach through

survey No.803 (new No.246/2) which goes to Dona-Paola-Bambolim Road by using

the roads provided in survey No.792 (new No.242/1) (Machado's Cove).



Re: 4



</p><p id="p_184">50.        For deciding this question, we shall have to again advert to the factual

matrix of the case. Appellant No.2 purchased survey Nos.787 and 805 from Dr.

Alvaro Remiojo Binto and leased out the same to appellant No.1. The latter obtained

permission from the Gram Panchayat for constructing hotel building in survey

No.787. The construction commenced in 1978 and was completed in May 1983.

Alongside construction of the hotel building, appellant No.1 approached the State

Government for acquisition of land in various survey numbers including survey

Nos.803 and 804 (new Nos.246/2 and 245/2). In paragraph 3 of the application

addressed to Shri Shankar Laad, Minister of Revenue, Government of Goa, appellant

No.1 gave out that in the first phase of the project hotel building was proposed to be

constructed in survey No. 787 and in the second phase, yoga centre, health club and

water sports facilities were proposed to be put up in survey No.805 for promoting

tourism.   In paragraph 5, appellant No.1 offered justification for acquisition of

survey Nos.788 and 789 which abut the beach. In paragraph 6, appellant No.1

pointed out that for second phase of the hotel complex, it would be desirable to

acquire survey Nos.803 and 804 which will make the entire area one composite unit.

It is thus evident that at the time of making application to the State Government for

acquisition of land, appellant No.1 did not have any proposal for construction and/or

extension of hotel building in survey No.803. The State Government initiated

acquisition proceedings by issuing notification dated 29.10.1980 under <a href="/doc/875938/" id="a_132">Section 4(1)</a> of
1894 Act, which were finalized in 1983. After Government took possession of the

acquired land, appellant No.1 entered into an agreement as per the requirement of

<a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_133">Section 41</a>. Clauses 3, 4 (ii), (iv), (v) and (vii) of the agreement enumerate affirmative

actions required to be taken by appellant No.1 for achieving the object of acquisition,

whereas Clause 4(i), (vi), (viii) and (ix) contain various negative covenants including

the one against the use of land for any purpose other than for which it was acquired.

A conjoint reading of these clauses unmistakably shows that appellant No.1 was to

use the acquired land only in furtherance of and for the purpose for which it was

acquired, namely, creation of sports and other recreational facilities/amenities and to

maintain the same in good order and condition and was not to use the land for any

other purpose. The first part of Clause 4(viii) contains an express embargo against

construction of any building or structure on the acquired land by appellant No.1.

The second part of that clause envisages that prior approval of EDC of the

Government of Goa will be obtained before undertaking activities for its

development, besides other statutory requirements under the existing laws. The

management of appellant No.1 was very much aware of the embargo contained in

first part of Clause 4(viii) against construction of any building or structure on the

acquired land and this is the reason why in the application made by Smt. Anju

Timblo to the Development Authority under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_134">Section 44(1)</a> read with Section 49 of

Town and Country Planning Act for grant of permission for extension of the existing

hotel building, survey No.246/2 was not mentioned. The EEC and EDC considered

that application and approved extension of the existing hotel building on land in

survey Nos.246/1, 246/3 and 246/4 (old Nos.787, 788 and 789) subject, of course, to the

condition of maintaining pedestrian path. The order issued by the Development

Authority on 15.4.1988 was also for extension of the existing hotel building on land

bearing survey No.246/1, 3 and 4. Neither in the minutes of EEC or EDC nor in the

order issued by the Development Authority under <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_135">Section 44(3)(c)</a> read with Section
49(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act, there was any mention of survey

No.246/2. This shows that till that stage, appellant No.1 had consciously refrained

from putting up even a proposal for constructing any building or structure on the

acquired land. For the first time a request to that effect was made in the garb of

making an application for renewal of permission granted by order dated 15.4.1988

with a deviation. A mention of four sub-divisions of survey No. 246 (1, 2, 3 and 4)

was made instead of three sub-divisions, i.e., 1, 3 and 4. With a view to avoid scrutiny

by the EEC and EDC, the appellants managed consideration of the application for

extension and deviation of hotel building by the Board constituted under Section 4 of

the Town and Country Planning Act.            The Board considered and approved

extension/deviation albeit in violation of the negative covenant contained in first part

of Clause 4(viii) of the statutory agreement. While doing that, the Board was fully

cognizant of the fact that in view of Clause 4 (viii), appellant No.1 cannot use the land

for constructing any structure and also that even for undertaking any activity

relating to development, approval of the EDC will be necessary. That is why the

State Government forwarded the decision of the Board to the Development Authority

for its consideration.    Unfortunately, the Development Authority without even

bringing the matter to the notice of the EDC, passed order dated 20.4.1992 and

permitted appellant No.1 to carry out construction on plot bearing survey No.246/2.

In our considered view, neither the State Government nor the Board could allow

extension of the hotel building on the acquired land in violation of first part of Clause

4(viii) of agreement dated 26.10.1983 which, at the cost of repetition, we would like to

emphasise, has the force of law by virtue of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_136">Section 42</a> of the 1894 Act. Section 8 of

the Town and Country Planning Act, which enumerates functions and powers of the

Board reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_185">

"8. Functions and powers of Board.--(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and the
rules made thereunder, the functions of the Board shall be to guide, direct and assist
the Planning and Development Authorities, to advise the Government in matters
relating to the planning, development and use of rural and urban land in the Union
Territory, and to perform such other functions as the Government may, from time to
time, assign to the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_186">
(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions,
the Board may, and shall if required by the Government so to do--


</p><p id="p_187">(a)      direct the preparation of development plans by the Planning and
Development Authorities;
</p>
<p id="p_188">
</p><p id="p_189">(b)        undertake, assist and encourage the collection, maintenance and

</p><p id="p_192">(e)       perform such other functions as are incidental, supplemental or
consequential to any of the functions aforesaid or which may be prescribed.


(3) The Board may exercise all such powers as may be necessary or expedient for the
purpose of carrying out its functions under this Act."
</p>
<p id="p_193">


</p><p id="p_194">51.        A reading of the above reproduced section makes it clear that the Board is

required to guide, direct and assist the Planning and Development Authorities; to

advise the Government in matters relating to the planning, development and use of

rural and urban land in the Union Territory, and to perform other functions

assigned to it by the Government. In terms of <a href="/doc/919464/" id="a_137">Section 8(2)</a>, the Board can direct the

preparation of development plans by the Planning and Development Authorities;

undertake, assist and encourage the collection, maintenance and publication of

statistics, bulletins and monographs on planning and its methodology; co-ordinate

and advise on the planning and implementation of physical development programmes
and perform such other functions which are incidental to the enumerated functions.

The role of the State Government primarily relates to approval of regional plan

(S.44), revision of regional plan (S.17), declaration of planning areas, their

amalgamation, sub-divisions, etc. (S.18), power to withdraw planning area from

operation of the Act (S.19) and constitution of Planning and Development Authorities

for the planning area (S.20). <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_138">Section 22</a>, which enumerates functions and powers of

Planning and Development Authority reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_195">

"22. Functions and powers of Planning and Development Authorities.--Subject to the
provisions of this Act and the rules framed thereunder and subject to any directions
which the Government may give, the functions of every Planning and Development

and for these purposes, it may carry out or cause to be carried out, surveys of the
planning area and prepare report or reports of such surveys, and to perform such
other functions as may be prescribed."
</p>
<p id="p_204">


</p><p id="p_205">52.        Chapter VII of the Town and Country Planning Act contains provisions

relating to control of development and use of land. <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_139">Section 44</a> lays down that any

person intending to carry out any development in respect of, or change of use of, any

land shall make an application in writing to the Planning and Development Authority
for permission in such form containing such particulars and accompanied by such

documents and plans as may be prescribed. <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_140">Section 44(2)(b)</a> and (c) deal with the

situation in which the Development Authority objects to the proposal for

development, in which case the matter has to be placed before the Government for its

decision.   <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_141">Section 44(3)</a> lays down that the Development Authority can grant

permission, conditionally or unconditionally for carrying out any development or

change of use of the land. While doing so, the Development Authority is required to

take note of the provisions of the development plan, if any, in force, relevant bye-

laws, regulations, etc.



</p><p id="p_206">53.         None of the above noted provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act

empowers the Board and/or the Development Authority to modify, amend, alter or

change an agreement entered into as per the requirement of <a href="/doc/1980025/" id="a_142">Section 41</a> of the 1894

Act or allow violation thereof by the company. Therefore, the decision taken by the

Board in its meeting held on 20th June, 1991 and order dated 20th April, 1992 issued

by the Development Authority were non est and the High Court rightly did not give

any credence to those decisions while adjudicating the issue relating to legality of

construction made on survey No.803 (new No.246/2).
</p>
<p id="p_207">

</p><p id="p_208">54.         We are also of the opinion that even the EDC which was empowered

under second part of Clause 4(viii) of the agreement to grant approval to the

activities relating to development could not have permitted construction/extension of

the hotel building on a portion of survey No.803 (new No.246/2). Any such decision

by the EDC would also have been declared nullity on the ground of violation of the

mandate of first part of Clause 4(viii) of the statutory agreement.
</p><p id="p_209">55.        The argument of Shri Divan that extension of the hotel building on 1000

sq. mts. of survey No.803 (new No.246/2) falls within the definition of "development"

contained in Section 2(10) of the Town and Country Planning Act which

comprehends carrying out of building activities and, therefore, the High Court

should not have ordered demolition of the extended portion of the hotel, but we are

unable to agree with him and reiterate that neither the Board nor the Development

Authority could sanction violation of agreement dated 26.10.1983.



</p><p id="p_210">56.        For the reasons stated above, we hold that the High Court did not commit

any error by declaring that extension of the hotel building on 1000 sq. mts. of survey

No.803 (new No.246/2) is illegal and directed its demolition after following the

procedure prescribed under Clause 6 of agreement dated 26.10.1983.



Re: 5.
</p>
<p id="p_211">

</p><p id="p_212">57.        This question deserves to be answered in favour of the appellants. A

reading of application dated 15.11.1978 made by appellant No.1 makes it clear that it

had no intention of making available the facilities of yoga centre, health club and

amenities like water sports to the general public.      Rather in paragraph 6 of its

application, appellant No.1 made it clear that the facilities provided by the hotel will

be open for use by non-residents also on membership basis.           Agreement dated

26.10.1983 is totally silent on the issue of making the facilities created by the

appellants open for public use without permission and payment of fees. Therefore, it

is not possible to agree with Ms. Jaising that the facilities and amenities created by

the appellant should be made available to the general public free of costs.
</p><p id="p_213">58.           In the result, the appeals are dismissed. Since execution of most of the

directions given by the High Court remained stayed during the pendency of these

in the open area of the property bearing survey No. 789 (new No. 246/4) was rejected,

BACKGROUND FACTS:
</p>
<p id="p_217">(i)        Dr. Alvaro Remiojo Binto owned several parcels of land in Village

Taleigao, District Tiswadi, Goa. He sold plots bearing survey Nos.803 and 804 (new

Nos.246/2 and 245/2) to Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto and plots bearing survey

Nos.787 and 805 (new Nos.246/1 and 245/1) to M/s. Sociedade e Fomento Industries

Pvt. Ltd. (respondent No.2 herein).
</p>
<p id="p_218">

</p><p id="p_219">(ii)       After purchasing the land, respondent No.2 leased out the same to
respondent No.1. The latter submitted an application to Gram Panchayat Taleigao

(for short `the Gram Panchayat') for grant of permission to construct hotel complex

near Vainguinim beach. On a reference made by the Gram Panchayat, Chief Town

Planner, Government of Goa, Daman and Diu vide his letter dated 1.8.1978 informed

that the plans submitted by respondent No.1 are in conformity with the regulations in

force in the area but observed that right of the public to access the beach must be

maintained by providing necessary footpath. Paragraph 2 of that letter reads as

under:-
</p>
<p id="p_220">"The road leading to the hotel complex is at present used by general public to
approach the Vainguinim Beach which is popular picnic spot for the people of
Panaji, as well as other parts of Goa. It will need to be ensured that the right of
access to the beach is maintained by the applicant by providing the necessary
footpath to the beach at an appropriate place. The parking facilities provided will
also have to take care of the parking of vehicles of such members of the public in an
appropriate manner. This will ensure that the beach remains open to public as it is
at present and that the public is not deprived of this beautiful and frequently used
beach."

(iv)        In furtherance of the permission granted by the Gram Panchayat,

</pre><p id="p_231">respondent No.1 commenced construction of the hotel, which is now known as Hotel

Cidade de Goa on the land forming part of survey No.787 (new No.246/1) and

completed the same by May, 1983.
</p>
<p id="p_232">(v)         During construction of the hotel building, respondent No.1 made an

application dated 29.9.1979 to the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat, for permission

to change the location of the footpath and parking area by stating that in view of

installation of 10,000 kg gas tank (poisonous gas at high pressure), high pressure

water tank and high voltage electric transformer near the hotel building, it will not
be in public interest to locate the footpath and parking area at the sanctioned site.


</p><p id="p_233">(vi)           The Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat neither forwarded the application

of respondent No.1 to the Town and Planning Department nor placed the same

before the Gram Panchayat. Instead, he wrote letter dated 29.9.1979 to respondent

No.1 giving an impression that the Gram Panchayat does not have any objection to

the change of location of the footpath and parking area. Thereafter, respondent No.1

shifted access to the beach to the new site.

</p><p id="p_235">       (vii)   In the meanwhile, Shri Gustavo Renato Da Cruz Pinto, Smt. Surana

               Pepfira Pinto and Miss Befta Sara Da Costa Pinto filed Special Civil Suit

               No.313/1978/A in the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division, at Panaji

               against respondent No.2, Dr. Alvaro Remiojo Binto and four others for a

               decree of possession by pre-emption in respect of the land comprised in

               survey Nos.787 and 805 and also to restrain the defendants, their agents,

               servants, etc. from changing, alienating or raising any construction on the

               suit land by alleging that they were owners of property bearing survey

               Nos.803, 804, 806, 807, 788 and 789 situated at Taleigao and since time

               immemorial they and their predecessors were using footpath passing

               through survey Nos.787, 805 and 769 for going to Panaji-Dona Paula-

               Bambolim road, which was sought to be obstructed. Defendant No.1 in the

               suit (appellant No.2 herein) filed written statement to contest the suit.

               After some time, the parties compromised the matter in terms of which the

               plaintiffs gave up their claim for pre-emption in respect of plot bearing

               survey Nos.787 and 805 and defendant No.1 agreed to exchange the plot

               bearing survey No.790 with plots bearing survey Nos.788 and 789

               belonging to the plaintiffs and also that it will have no right of access

               through any of the properties of the plaintiffs. As a sequel to this, the
         plaintiffs applied for withdrawal of the suit. By an order dated 20.12.1978,

         the Civil Judge permitted them to do so.
</p>
<p id="p_236">(viii)   Soon after withdrawal of the pre-emption suit, Respondent No. 1

         represented to Shri Shankar Laad, Minister of Revenue, Government of

         Goa for acquisition of land comprised in survey Nos. 788, 789, 803, 804,

         806 and 807 of village Taleigao, Dona-Paola for construction of Beach

         Resort-Hotel complex.       The State Government partially accepted the

         request of respondent No. 1 and issued notification dated 29.10.1980 under

         <a href="/doc/875938/" id="a_143">Section 4</a> (1) of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_144">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894 for acquiring survey Nos. 803

         and 804. After holding an enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_145">Section 5A</a> of the Act, the State

         Government issued declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_146">Section 6</a>, which was published in

         Gazette dated 27.10.1983.
</p>
<p id="p_237">(ix)     Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto and some others filed Writ Petition No.

         8/1984 for quashing the aforementioned notifications on various grounds

         including the one that before acquiring the land, government did not make

         enquiry as per the requirement of Rule 4 of the Land Acquisition

         (Companies) Rules, 1963 (for short `the Rules'). The writ petitioners also

         highlighted discrepancies in different notifications issued by the State

         Government. Respondent No. 2 in the writ petition (respondent No. 1

         herein) filed reply affidavit stating therein that Rule 4 of the Rules is not

         mandatory and non compliance thereof did not affect legality of the

         acquisition. In paragraphs 67 and 76 of the reply affidavit, it was averred

         that part of the project, i.e., hotel is complete and has started functioning.

         In paragraph 79, it was averred that besides the hotel project, cottages

         were proposed to be constructed on plot bearing survey No. 805 and the

         acquired land in survey Nos. 803 and 804 will be used for putting up

         health club, yoga centre, water sports and other recreational facilities,
        which are integral part of the project.
</p>
<p id="p_238">(x)     By an order dated 26.06.1984, Goa Bench of the High Court of Bombay

        allowed the writ petition and quashed the impugned notifications only on

        the ground of non compliance of Rule 4 of the Rules. That order was

        reversed by this Court in <a href="/doc/303393/" id="a_147">M/s Fomento Resorts and Hotels Ltd. vs.

        Gustavo Renato Da Cruz Pinto and Others</a> [(1985) 2 SCC 152] and the

        case was remitted to the High Court for deciding other grounds of

        challenge. It, however, appears that after the judgment of this Court, the

        parties compromised the matter and the writ petition was withdrawn on

        26.3.1985.
</p>
<p id="p_239">(xi)    In the meanwhile, respondent No. 1 entered into an agreement with the

        Government as per the requirement of <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_148">Section 41</a> of the 1894 Act.

</p><p id="p_240">(xii)   After taking possession of the acquired land, Respondent No. 1 extended

        the hotel building on survey Nos. 787, 788, 789 and 803 in the garb of

        permission granted by the Development Authority under the Goa, Daman

        and Diu Town and Country Planning Act, 1974. Respondent No. 1 also

        closed public access to the beach available through survey No. 803 (new

        No. 246/2). The same was challenged in Writ Petition No.330 of 1991 <a href="/doc/548160/" id="a_149">Shri

        Minguel Martins vs. M/s Sociedade</a> e Fomento Industries Pvt. Ltd. and

        others, Writ Petition No.36 of 1992 <a href="/doc/1409295/" id="a_150">Goa Foundation and another vs.

        of 1992 Shri Gustavo Renato da <a href="/doc/1651526/" id="a_151">Cruz Pinto vs. State of Goa and others</a>.

        By an order dated 25.4.2000 the Division Bench of the High Court allowed

        the writ petitions and issued directions for demolition of the construction

        made in survey No. 803 (new No. 246/2) after complying with Clause 6 of

        agreement dated 26.10.1983. The High Court further directed that access

        to the beach shown in plan Exhibit-A filed along with Writ Petition
         No.141/1992 shall be kept open without obstruction of any kind.

</p><p id="p_241">(xiii)   Shri Victor Albuquerque and the appellants herein filed another set of

         Writ Petition Nos. 284 of 1991 and 37 of 1992 for issue of a direction to the

         respondents (including respondent Nos. 1 and 2 herein) for restoration of

         public access to Vainguinim beach and the car parking area through

         survey No. 787 (new no. 246/1) and for demolition of the construction

         made in the open area of survey No. 789 (new No. 246/4).
</p>
<p id="p_242">(xiv)    In their writ petition, the appellants claimed that while approving the plan

         for construction of hotel project in survey No. 787 (new No. 246/1), the

         Chief Town Planner had directed respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to maintain

         access to the beach through that survey number by providing necessary

         footpath and also provide facility for parking of the vehicles and this was

         reiterated by the Gram Panchayat, but respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have

         shifted access to the beach to another location on the basis of permission

         allegedly granted by the Sarpanch who had no authority to do so.

         According to the appellants, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were and are not

         entitled to shift the public access to some other location and, as a matter of

         fact, instead of ending at the beach, new road leads to the rocks through

         which public cannot go to the beach. It was also the appellants' case that

         the location of new road is extremely dangerous because it is adjacent to

         10,000 Kg. poisonous gas tank.
</p>
<p id="p_243">

</p><p id="p_244">(xv)     In their counter-affidavit, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 pleaded that the

         sanction accorded by the Chief Town Planner was subject to the condition

         that public access to the beach should be maintained by providing

         necessary footpath at appropriate place and facilities should be provided

         for parking of the vehicles but no particular location was identified for
      that purpose.   It was further their case that in the first instance, car

      parking was identified at North-East corner of property bearing survey

      No. 787 and the footpath alongside its Eastern boundary, but during

      execution of the project, it was found that existence of road near 10,000

      Kg. poisonous gas tank, high pressure water tank, electric transformer will

      be dangerous to the public and, therefore, application was made to the

      Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat for shifting the location of public road,

      car parking and footpath and construction thereof at the new site was

      undertaken after seeking permission from the Sarpanch. Respondent Nos.

      1 and 2 also pleaded that since 1979 members of the public are using access

      to the beach through alternative road and footpath.
</p>
<p id="p_245">(xvi) The High Court referred to letter dated 1.8.1978 of the Chief Town

      Planner, letter dated 1.12.1978 of the Sarpanch, two letters dated 29th

      September, 1979, one of which was written by respondent No. 1 to the

      Sarpanch, and the other by the Sarpanch and held that even though access

      provided by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 is not at the site initially approved by

      the Gram Panchayat, the same is being maintained at the new location

      since 1979. The High Court noted that while approving the plan prepared

      by respondent No.1 for construction of hotel complex, the Chief Town

      Planner did not identify the particular location at which public road, car

      parking and footpath were to be constructed and even when inspection

      was carried out on 16th October, no objection was raised to the change of

      alignment of the public road etc. and, therefore, it cannot be said that

      respondents have violated the conditions of sanction. The High Court also

      took cognizance of the photographs produced by the writ petitioners and

      observed that the access to the beach is not maintained in proper manner

      and that the same leads to rocks and is inaccessible during high tide.
          Accordingly, directions were issued to the respondents to maintain tarred

          road of three meters width throughout, proper area for parking of cars

          and ensure that the access goes up to beach. However, the prayer of the

          writ petitioners for demolition of the construction made in survey No. 789

          (new No. 246/4) was rejected by observing that the so-called construction

          is in the form of road and there is no legal prohibition against such

          construction.    The relevant extracts of paragraphs 12 and 13 of the

          impugned order which also contain the directions given by the High Court

          read as under:
</p>
<p id="p_246"> "All said and done, once, it is not in dispute that the members of the public are
entitled to have their access through the property bearing survey no. 787, it cannot be
disputed the Respondents are duty bound to maintain a proper access for the public
to the said beach and sufficient area for parking of cars. Both these things are to be
maintained through and in the property bearing survey no. 787. It is the contention
of the Respondents that they have already provided such access and that the same is
being used by the public. However, the photographs of such access which are placed
on record by the Petitioners and not disputed by the Respondents clearly disclose
that such access is not maintained in proper manner and/or as is otherwise required
to be maintained in terms of the directions given by the Chief Town Planner. It is the
contention of the Petitioners that the said access leads not to the beach but to the
rocks and the beach is absolutely unaccessable during the hightide by the said access.
The fact that members of the public cannot have access to the beach during the high
tide is also admitted by the respondents in the Affidavit-in-replies filed in both the
Petitions. In Writ Petition No. 37/92, it has been clearly stated in Affidavit-in-reply
in para 20 "and that the Respondents state that in compliance with the said condition
from the point of steps, where also there is a jetty the Respondents built retaining
wall with access over it to the extent of 60 metres giving access over it to the public
through the beach even during the high tide". Similarly, in Writ Petition No. 284/91
in the Affidavit-in-reply it is stated in para 13(d) that "the Respondents state that in
compliance with the said condition from the point of steps where also there was a
jetty, the Respondents have built a retaining wall with access over it giving access to
the public through the beach even during the high tide." The Affidavit-in-reply in
Writ Petition No. 284/91 was filed in September, 1991 whereas the Affidavit-in-reply
in Writ Petition No. 37/92 was filed in January, 1992. This clearly shows that the
Respondents are fully aware that the access which has been stated to have been
maintained by the Respondents as it stands today is not at all convenient for free
access to the public to the said beach. Once, it is not disputed that the public have
right to free access to the beach through the said property and the project of
construction of hotel was approved with the condition that such access is to be
maintained, it is the duty of the Respondents to maintain a proper access through the
property to the beach. It has been stated across the bar and delineated in a sketch
produced by the Petitioners and not disputed by the Respondents that alternative
access as exists at present provided by the Respondents for the public is through the
western half of the property bearing old survey no. 787. It leads to the steps
constructed near the retaining wall by the side of the jetty leading to the sea situated
on the said Vainguinim Beach. Once, it is clear that the said access does not lead to
the beach directly but to the steps and further to the rocks, it is necessary to give
appropriate directions to the Respondents to extend the said access upto the beach
along the retaining wall referred to in para 20 of the Affidavit-in-reply in Writ
Petition No. 37/92 to such an extent that the said access directly leads to the said
beach and not to the rocks or some other place. It is also necessary that such road
should be maintained of 3 metres in width all throughout, and also that the said road
to be tarred and maintained in proper condition. The Respondents shall also
maintain proper area for parking of the cars and the area should be maintained in a
usable condition for the members of the public and the responsibility in that regard
shall also be of the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2. There shall not be any obstruction
caused on the said access or car park area either by construction of any fencing or
any gate or otherwise and the same should be kept open all 24 hours of day and
night.
</p>
<p id="p_247">13.                   Considering the fact that neither of the parties have bothered to
place on record a proper plan with dimension and to scale, a further direction in that
regard is necessary to the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 who shall file a proper plan
drawn by a recognized surveyor showing the location of the access and car park
maintained in accordance with directions of this Court and such plan should be filed
along with the Affidavit regarding the compliance of maintenance of such access
within a period of four weeks from today. The said access shall be at the location
corresponding to the one disclosed in the sketch produced by the Respondents and
placed on record and marked at `X' for identification. However, an alteration in the
location of the access shall be made as regards the space near the gas tank shown in
the said sketch and sufficient space should be maintained from the location of the gas
tank so as to avoid hardship or injury to the members of the public using the said
access and the distance between the gas tank and the access shall not be less than 20
metres under any circumstances. It shall also be the responsibility of the Respondent
No.5 in Writ Petition No. 37/92 as well as other authorities to have periodical checks
and to ensure the maintenance of the said access and the car park area in the said
property."
</p><p id="p_248">                                                                  [underlining is ours]



</p><p id="p_249">2.                    Ms. Indira Jaising, learned senior counsel appearing for the

appellants argued that even though the letter dated 1.8.1978 of the Chief Town

Planner did not identify the location where footpath and parking facilities were

required to be provided by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 for access to the beach, but if the

same is read in conjunction with permission granted by the Gram Panchayat vide

letter dated 22.8.1978 and letter dated 1.12.1978 of the Sarpanch, it becomes clear

that respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were required to provide parking area, on the north-

east corner of survey No. 787 adjacent to survey No. 803 and public footpath was to

be provided in a manner that it would run on survey No. 787 and form the boundary
of survey No. 803 but they manipulated the so-called permission from the Sarpanch

of the Gram Panchayat and changed the location of public road and car parking.

She vehemently argued that access provided at the new site ends on the rocks and it is

impossible for the public to go to the beach even during the normal period what to

say of high tide period and the High Court committed grave error by declining the

appellants' prayer for issue of mandamus to respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to provide

access to the beach through survey No. 787 in terms of the approval accorded by the

Chief Town Planner vide his letter dated 1.8.1978 read with the permission granted

by the Gram Panchyat on 22.8.1978. Shri Anil B. Divan, learned senior counsel

appearing for the respondents, submitted that the directions given by the High Court

are just and proper and do not call for interference, because public road, car parking

and access to the beach had been constructed in 1979 after obtaining permission from

the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat and public has been using the same for last

almost 20 years. Learned senior counsel produced some photographs to show that

tarred road has been constructed and access provided through footpath goes right up

to the beach.
</p>
<p id="p_250">

</p><p id="p_251">3.                   We have considered the respective submissions. Since it is not

in dispute that respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have provided access to the beach at the

alternative site in 1979 and the same is in existence for last almost 20 years and is

being used by the public, it is not possible to agree with Ms. Indira Jaising that the

High Court committed an error by not taking cognizance of the approval accorded

by the Chief Town Planner and the permission granted by the Gram Panchayat on

22.8.1978. It is true that Sarpanch did not place before the Gram Panchayat letter

dated 29.9.1979 written by respondent No.1 for permission to change the location of

the footpath and parking area from the site originally sanctioned and the Gram

Panchayat did not pass any resolution sanctioning such change, but the fact remains
that pursuant to letter dated 29.9.1979 written by the Sarpanch of the Gram

Panchayat, respondent No.1 laid access to the beach at alternative site and made it

operational sometime in 1979 and the same is being used by the public since then.

The photographs produced during the hearing of the appeal also prima facie show

that access to the beach is available at the alternative site. It is not the appellants'

pleaded case that they were unaware of the change of location of public access to the

beach and construction of road, parking area, etc. at the alternative site in 1979.

Therefore, the writ petition filed by them in 2000 was highly belated, and the High

Court may have been justified in non-suiting them only on the ground of delay.

However, as the High Court has dealt with the matter on merits, we do not consider it

necessary to deal with this issue in detail, more so because we are convinced that the

directions given by the High Court to respondent Nos. 1 and 2 for ensuring that

public road is shifted from the site near 10,000 Kg. poisonous gas tank and access to

the beach ends on the beach and not on the rocks are just and proper and are in

consonance with public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_252">
</p><p id="p_253">4.                    In the result appeal is dismissed.      Needless to say that if

respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have not carried out the directions given by the High Court

in toto and access to the beach still ends at the rock or there is any other deficiency

in the implementation of the order impugned in this appeal, then the appellants or

any other interested person shall be free to bring this to the notice of the High Court

for appropriate order and action.
