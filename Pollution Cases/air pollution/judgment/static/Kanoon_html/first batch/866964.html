     PRESENT :

          THE HONOURABLE CHIEF JUSTICE MR V. GOPALA GOWDA
                                AND
                THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE B. P. DAS

          __________________________________________________
                    Date of Judgment - 16 .11.2010
          __________________________________________________

V. GOPALA GOWDA, C.J.       These petitions have been filed by the owners of the

     land acquired by the State Government in favour of the opposite party

     Anil Agarwal Foundation (hereinafter in short called as ‗Foundation') for

     establishment of a University in exercise of its eminent domain power

     under the provisions of Part-VII of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894

     (hereinafter called as the ‗<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_1">L.A. Act</a>' in short). The public interest litigation

     petitions have been filed both on behalf of the land owners who have no

     access to justice and also on behalf of the public of the locality of the

     lands whose public interest is affected by violating Rule of Law in

     acquiring vast tract of both Government, Temple and private lands in

     favour of the Foundation.       They were listed and heard together by

     consent of the learned counsel for the parties and are disposed of by this

     common judgment. With a view to avoid repetition of pleadings and rival

     legal contentions urged on behalf of the parties, we would briefly state

     the necessary facts and advert to the pleadings and legal submissions

     made on behalf of the parties while answering the points that are framed

     in these cases.

     2.          The facts stated in all these writ petitions are almost the same

     and the impugned notifications have been challenged on identical

     grounds. It is therefore not necessary to refer to the facts of all the writ
                                   8


petitions.   We have therefore, referred to the facts of W.P.(c) No.7163 of

2008 &amp; W.P.(C) No.10325 of 2008.

3.            Shorn of unnecessary details, the brief facts of the case are

that on 23.6.2006 one Mohit Kumar Rana, Principal, A.T.Kearney Limited

filed an application before the State Government stating that M/s.Vedanta

Resources Limited is contemplating to set up a University in Orissa to

impart education     in under-graduate    and post-graduate     courses in

Engineering, Medicine, Management, General Science and Humanities etc.

It was further stated in the application that the Group had given a

presentation to the Hon'ble Chief Minister, Orissa during April, 2006. Their

team after visiting different sites in Orissa have selected a site on the

outskirt of Puri on the Puri-Konark marine drive to be the place ideal for

establishment of the University. Therefore, it was, inter alia, prayed that

Government of Orissa should make available 15,000 acres of contiguous

land around Nuanai, in the district of Puri in Bhubaneswar-Puri-Konark

marine drive. It was further prayed that the Government of Orissa should

coordinate the land acquisition process by appointment of a Special Land

Acquisition Officer. The Group prayed that they require 1500 acres of land

for Phase-I to be acquired by September, 2006 and the balance by

December, 2006.       Thereafter, a Memorandum of Understanding was

signed between Government of Orissa and Vedanta Foundation on

19.7.2006 and Government of Orissa confirmed the availability of

contiguous land of about 8000 acres and to make endeavour to provide

an additional contiguous land and other facilities as required by the

Foundation. It is the case of the petitioners that a Private Limited
                                  9


Company incorporated in the name and style of Sterlite Foundation

changed its name to Vedanta Foundation under <a href="/doc/501652/" id="a_2">section 25</a> of the

Companies Act of 1956 and accordingly fresh certificate of incorporation

consequent on change of name was issued in July, 2004. After signing of

the MOU, necessary steps were taken by the State Government for

allotment of the land to the Foundation and the Vice President of the

Vedanta Foundation was directed to deposit 20% of the estimated

investment cost which was subsequently reduced to 10% without any

basis and reasoning and necessary direction was issued to the Collector,

Puri to obtain administrative approval of the project from the Higher

Education Department and to produce the approval along with the

proposal before the Government. In the meantime the opinion of the Law

Department was sought on the questions (a) whether the Foundation is

an educational foundation? and (b) whether the land is required to be

acquired for public purpose? The Law Department opined that <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_3">Sections 4</a>,

<a href="/doc/66420479/" id="a_4">5</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_5">6</a> of the L.A. Act provide that the Government can acquire land for

any public purpose or for a Company and such company would mean as

per definition contained in the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_6">Companies Act</a>, 1956 (hereinafter called

―the Act, 1956‖) a company incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_7">Companies Act</a>, a

society registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_8">Societies Registration Act</a> or a Co-operative

Society. Law Department further opined that the file does not indicate

that ―Vedanta Foundation‖ is a company, or a Society under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_9">Societies

Registration Act</a> or a Co-operative Society. With the aforesaid opinion the

Law Department required the Administrative Department to find out the

legal status of Vedanta Foundation and whether it comes within the
                                     10


purview of sub-clause (vi) of Clause (f) of <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_10">Section 3</a> of the L.A. Act.

Thereafter the Administrative Department, i.e., the Revenue and Disaster

Management Department again submitted the file to the Law Department

for opinion drawing its attention to the certificate of incorporation of the

Foundation under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_11">Companies Act</a>, the amended certificate on name

and the Memorandum of Association of the Company. This time the Law

Department opined that land can be acquired for a private company if

such acquisition comes within the purview of clause (a) of sub-section (1)

of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_12">Section 40</a> of the Land Acquisition Act which provides that acquisition

of land can be done for erection of dwelling houses for workmen

employed in the Company or for the provisions of amenities directly

connected therewith and considering the proposal of Vedanta with

reference   to   the   aforesaid   provision,   it   further   opined   that   said

requirement does not fall within the purview of clause (a) of sub-section

(1) of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_13">Section 40</a> of the L.A. Act. Law Department further observed that

land can be acquired for the proposed educational scheme under the Act if

the appropriate Department of the Government sponsors a Scheme to

carry out that.    Alternatively land can be acquired for an educational

scheme sponsored by a Society but with the prior approval of the

Government. So observing, Law Department opined that under the Act,

land can be acquired for public purpose provided Government sponsors to

carry out an educational scheme or for a registered society with prior

approval of the Government. Alternatively, it also opined that the

Administrative Department may verify if acquisition of land can be made

under section 15 of the Orissa Industrial Infrastructural Development
                                  11


<a href="/doc/979883/" id="a_14">Corporation Act</a>, 1980. After the aforesaid opinion was received, the

administrative department was of the view that the second option to go

through IDCO was not feasible and suggested to consider as to whether

Higher Education Department will sponsor and own the project directly

and whether it would be done through a Society to be framed by the

Higher Education Department.     After consideration of the above, it was

decided to explore the alternative of the Private Company to be converted

to a public company on which, the views of the Law Department was

again sought.   This time the Law Department opined that land can be

acquired for a ‗Public Company' under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_15">Land Acquisition Act</a> in

accordance with Part VII.      Thereafter the company is said to have

changed its status from Private Company to Public Company with the

change of name as Anil Agarwal Foundation.           Thereafter the State

Government issued notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_16">section 4(1)</a> of the Land Acquisition

Act for acquisition of land on behalf of Anil Agarwal Foundation for setting

up of Vedanta University. The case of the petitioners is that the proposal

for acquisition of land was initially made by Vedanta Resources Limited

whereas the MOU was signed by the Vedanta Foundation but, on and from

6th September, 2006 Vedanta Foundation no more existed and Anil

Agarwal Foundation came into being. Even though no valid document was

produced before the State Government with regard to conversion of the

status of the company from ‗private' to ‗public', the State Government

issued notifications under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_17">section 4</a> (1) of the Act treating the company as

a public company proposing to acquire the lands in its favour to establish

a University. On the complaint of some of the petitioners before the local
                                   12


M.L.A. that the company not being a public company has made such a

claim, the MLA approached the Union Minister to know the exact status of

the company who in turn sought the required information from the

Registrar of Companies.    By letter dated 7th May, 2008, Mr.D.K.Gupta,

Registrar of Companies, Maharashtra intimated the Media Advisor to

Minister of State for Rural Development, Government of India as under:

                ―Kindly refer to your letter dated 7th May, 2008
          regarding Anil Agarwal Foundation. In this connection, it
          is stated that Sterlite Foundation, a <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_18">Section 25</a> company
          was incorporated on 12.5.2004. A copy of certificate of
          incorporation, Memorandum of Association and Articles of
          Association is enclosed herewith. Thereafter the company
          has changed its name from Sterlite Foundation to
          Vedanta Foundation. A copy of Fresh Certificate of
          Incorporation consequent upon Change of name is also
          enclosed herewith. Anil Agarwal Foundation had filed its
          latest Annual Return (Form 21A) made upto 24.9.2007
          and latest Balance Sheet (Form 23AC and 23 ACA) as at
          31.3.2007 which are enclosed herewith. It is further
          mentioned that this is a <a href="/doc/179135584/" id="a_19">Section 25</a> Company as per
          <a href="/doc/501652/" id="a_20">Section 25</a> of the Companies Act, 1956 and not a Public
          Limited Company.‖

4.          It is alleged by the petitioners that Laxmi Narayan Agarwal,

one of the Directors of Vedanta Foundation though expired on 2.4.2006,

the resolution dated 23rd November, 2006 passed for the conversion of

the company from ‗private' to ‗public' company, the said Laxmi Narayan

Agarwal has been shown as one of the Directors of Anil Agarwal

Foundation which demonstrates the mala fide intention of the company to

obtain conversion so as to have eligibility for acquisition of land under the

provisions of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_21">L.A. Act</a>. The further allegation of the petitioners is that

though the certificate from the competent authority with regard to

change of status has not been produced, yet the State has considered the
                                  13


Anil Agarwal Foundation as a Public Company and proceeded to acquire

lands on its behalf for establishment of Vedanta University. Referring to

Clause 6 of the Memorandum of Understanding, the petitioners would

submit that under the said clause complete autonomy is sought to be

given to the Vedanta University in the matter of administration,

admission, fee structure, curriculum and faculty which is not permissible.

In view of the aforesaid clause, the State Government would not have

any control over the functioning of the university which may at its

discretion charge such fees etc. which the students of State of Orissa can

never afford. It is the further case of the petitioners that Clause 6(ix) of

the MOU requires that people residing within 5 K.M. radius from the

University boundary shall lose their fundamental rights relating to

development of their residential houses. They shall have to obtain

permission from the Company for the purpose of any development of

their residential houses. The allegation of the petitioners is that the

University in question has neither been sponsored by any other University

of our State nor has it been formed under any scheme of the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_22">Universities

Act</a>. Though the State Government had earlier signed MOU with Vedanta

Foundation, again it has signed an agreement with Anil Agarwal

Foundation on 31.7.2007. Referring to the quantum of land and area of

the various reputed universities in the country like Utkal University,

Jawaharlal Nehru University, IITs and abroad, the petitioners contend

that the requirement of land put forward by the Company in question is

very much excessive.     It is the case of the petitioners that the real

purpose of requiring such vast extent of property cannot be said to be
                                   14


only for the purpose of the University; the real purpose sought to be

achieved has been masked. There is some hidden agenda for the

beneficiary company. Land acquisition being an ex proprietary legislation,

the requirement of transparency is a paramount consideration mandated

by the Statute. It is the case of the petitioners that 80% of the lands

sought to be acquired is agricultural land and the owners of the land and

their family members depend on the said land for their livelihood. It is

contended that the Company is not at all a public company. So the

declaration made by the company as well as the authorities is nothing but

a colourable exercise of power with the mala fide intention to grab the

agricultural properties of the land owner petitioners and other land

owners. It is further contended that as per <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_23">Section 3(f)(vi)</a> of the L.A.Act

land acquired for educational purposes which is a public purpose is to be

sponsored by the Government or by any authority established by the

Government; or with the prior approval of the appropriate Government or

by the local authority; or by a society registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_24">Societies

Registration Act</a> or any other corresponding law for the time being in

force in a State or a co-operative society within the meaning of any law

relating to co-operative societies for the time being in force in any State.

Anil Agarwal Foundation which is a company registered under the

<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_25">Companies Act</a> does not fall under any of the categories of the authorities

for whom a valid land acquisition process can be launched to acquire land

for serving the aforesaid public purpose. Therefore, the acquisition of land

for M/s. Anil Agarwal Foundation for setting up an educational institution

directly falls foul of the aforesaid legal stipulations in <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_26">Section 3(f)(vi)</a> of
                                  15


the Act. Public purpose has been defined in <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_27">Section 3(f)</a> of the Act which

says that ‗public purpose' does not include acquisition of land for

companies. The further contention of the petitioners is that the present

acquisition of vast tract of lands has been done by the State Government

under the provisions in Chapter VII of the L.A. Act which deals with

acquisition of land for the Companies. <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_28">The Land Acquisition Act</a> being an

ex-proprietary legislation, the provisions of Chapter VII read with Land

Acquisition (Companies) Rules, 1963 is to be strictly complied with by the

State Government. <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_29">Section 39</a> of the L.A. Act provides for previous

consent of appropriate Government and execution of agreement by the

beneficiary Company in favour of the State Government. <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_30">Section 40</a> of

the L.A. Act mandates that such consent shall not be given unless the

appropriate Government be satisfied either on the report of the Collector

under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_31">Section 5-A</a>, sub-section (2) or by an enquiry held as provided

therein. Rule 4 of the Land Acquisition (Companies) Rules, 1963

mandates the procedure of enquiry. It is the case of the petitioners that

admittedly no such enquiry has been conducted by the Collector under

Rule 4(1) of the Land Acquisition (Companies) Rules, 1963 in absence of

which issuance of notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_32">sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_33">6</a> of the L.A. Act is

bad in law. It is contended by the petitioners that from the information

furnished by the State Government under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_34">Information Act</a> it

appears that no such enquiry has been conducted under Rule 4 of the

Land Acquisition (Companies) Rules, 1963 prior to issuance of the

notification. Hence the notifications are liable to be struck down for non-
                                   16


compliance of the mandatory provisions of Chapter VII of the L.A. Act and

Rules.

5.          Gopabandhu      Daridranarayan       Seva   Sangha,     a      society

registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_35">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860, the first petitioner

in W.P.(C) No.10325 of 2008 and others have questioned the legality and

validity of the acquisition notifications published under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_36">sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_37">6</a> of

the L.A.Act on various grounds including the ground that acquisition of

vast tract of land in favour of the Foundation, which is actually a ‗private

company' and subsequently claimed that it has converted to a ‗public

company' which falls within the definition of <a href="/doc/21390555/" id="a_38">Section 3(1)(iv)</a> of the Act,

1956 and its conversions is not permissible in law. It could not have been

converted to a public company under <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_39">section 25</a> and registered under

<a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_40">section 12</a> of the Act. Therefore, the requisition made by the Vedanta

Foundation to the State Government to acquire land in its favour by its

representation   dated   23.6.2006     for   establishing   non-existing    multi

discipline University is a fraud played upon it and its registration, if any,

as a public company after conversion under <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_41">section 25</a> read with <a href="/doc/775416/" id="a_42">sections

2(23)</a>, <a href="/doc/1790890/" id="a_43">12(2)(b)</a>, <a href="/doc/772284/" id="a_44">13(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1705443/" id="a_45">27(2)</a> of the Companies Act and the

regulations framed there under. A joint reading of <a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_46">sections 2</a>, <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_47">3</a>, <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_48">12</a>,

with the Companies Regulations, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as ‗the

Regulations' in short) would indicate that the details of the objects,

formation and other particulars regarding a ‗Company' registered under

<a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_60">section 25</a> of the Act with liabilities not limited by any share capital but

limited by ‗Guarantee'. The ceiling/maximum of liability of any member of
                                   17


the present ‗Company' registered under <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_61">section 25</a> of the Act is Rs.5000/-

only. Therefore, the Foundation is not a public company as pleaded by it

before the State Government for acquisition of lands in its favour for

establishment of a University. The certificate under <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_62">section 25</a> of the Act

of 1956 obtained by the Foundation on the basis of Memorandum and

Articles of Association attracts the mischief of fraud on public power of the

State Government and it does not satisfy the mandate of <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_63">section 25</a> read

with <a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_64">sections 2</a>, <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_65">3</a>, <a href="/doc/306303/" id="a_66">12(2)</a> (b), 13(2) and 27(2) of the Act, 1956 and

regulations including the statutory annexure annexed thereto. ‗Sterlite

Foundation' first altered its name to ‗Vedanta Foundation' and still later

further altered its name to ‗Anil Agarwal Foundation'. The registration of

the company purporting to have converted from ‗private limited company'

to ‗public company' was and is a fraud on the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_67">Companies Act</a>, inter alia,

as the contents of the Memorandum of Association and Articles of

Association were/are repugnant to the mandates of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_68">Companies Act</a>

read with the Regulations. The Foundation having indulged in such

illegalities and having fraudulently represented facts to the State

Government that ‗Vedanta/Anil Agarwal Foundation was a Private Limited

Company under the Act (which category of company it never was and can

never be), the said illegal ‗body corporate' indulged in further fraud on the

Act, 1956, the U.G.C. Act and the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_69">Land Acquisition Act</a> and the Regulation

by carrying out a conversion of ‗Company' registered under <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_70">section 25</a> of

the Act to a so called ‗public limited company', which is not legally

permissible under the aforesaid Acts &amp; Regulations. The entire exercise on

the part of the Foundation and the State Government is contrary to the
                                          18


mandate of the law governing the field for acquisition of land. Further it is

stated that the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Foundation

continued to have the same irremediable infirmities in it and do not

satisfy the mandatory requirements of the aforesaid provisions of the

<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_71">Companies Act</a> as its incorporation itself by less number of persons that

are required to register a company under <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_72">section 25</a> of the Act, 1956 and

the stipulation regarding membership is contrary to the provisions of the

Act. The Foundation's registration as a limited company was through

unusual     means        projecting   itself   as   a   public   limited    company    by

misrepresentation of facts in a designed way to the State Government

with an ulterior motive to avail the benefit of the provisions of the L.A.Act

to acquire the vast extent of lands for establishment of a non existent

University, thereby it has played fraud on the State Government. A

company registered under <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_73">section 25</a> of the Act enjoys several privileges

of which a private limited company does not have. Such company is

partially   or   fully     exempted     from    the     operation   of     <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_74">Sections   147</a>,

<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_75">160(1)(aa)</a>, <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_76">166(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_77">171(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_78">177</a>, <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_79">93</a>, <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_80">209</a> (4A), 219, 255, 256, 257, 259,

263, 264(1), 285, 292, 299, 301 and 303 (2) of the Act, 1956. The

structure and nature of the company is pre-determined at the time of

grant of license and registration under <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_81">Section 25</a> of the Act and it is

stated that no such conversion is granted in its favour as it has failed to

comply with certain aspects as mentioned in the letter dated 22 nd

November, 2006 issued by the Regional Director of Company Affairs.

6.           There is no occasion for the Foundation to get conversion of a

company by guarantee under <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_82">section 25</a> to be converted into a public
                                    19


limited company to come within the definition under <a href="/doc/21390555/" id="a_83">section 3(1)(iv)</a> of

the Act,1956. In collusion with the other opposite parties, the Foundation

succeeded in perpetrating the fraud and proceeded to sign an illegal, non

est and void MOU dated 31.7.2007 after final notifications were published

with the State of Orissa for patently illegal purposes and the same has

been implemented by the State Government in gross violation of the

mandatory provisions of Part VII of the L.A. Act read with Companies

Rules. The impugned decision of the State Government to acquire vast

extent of lands of good number of villages on the basis of the

Memorandum of Understanding, the acquisition proceedings from the

initial stage on the basis of the illegal agreement is wholly without any

authority   of   law   and,   therefore,   the   impugned   notifications   and

consequential action taken by the State Government and its offices are

liable to be quashed.

7.          Counter affidavit has been filed by the State Government

through the Collector in each of the cases. The beneficiary company has

also filed counter affidavit in each of the writ petitions traversing the

petition averments.

8.          In the Counter Statement filed on behalf of opposite party

nos. 1 to 3, State Government in the PIL petition W.P.(C) No. 10325 of

2008, it has been stated that the public interest litigation is not

maintainable in view of the judgment of this Court in W.P.(C) 8636 of

2008. Petitioner no.1 and 2, who claim that their lands have been

acquired have never filed objections under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_84">Section 5-A</a> of the Land

Acquisition Act for which the writ petition is not maintainable. It is further
                                   20


stated that after deposit of money by the Foundation with the Special

Land Acquisition Officer, the acquisition file was opened on 18.11.2006,

after which <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_85">Section 4</a> notification was made and public notice was issued.

The objections that were received were heard and disposed of. Report

under <a href="/doc/1183388/" id="a_86">Section 5-A(2)</a> was sent indicating the number of objections

received   from some villages and no objections were received from the

other villages. Thereafter the matter was placed before the Government.

On 12.4.2007, the Government considered the report of the Collector

under <a href="/doc/1183388/" id="a_87">Section 5-A(2)</a> and examined the matter for entering into the

agreement and steps were taken for entering into an agreement in a

Standard Form. The agreement was entered deleting Clause 9 and 10.

The aforesaid agreement has been executed and notified on 31.7.2007.

In the counter affidavit the averment made in the writ application have

been denied. It is stated that allegation of collusion and fraud without any

material is not admissible and therefore such allegation is denied. There

was no collusion, illegality or fraud bereft of details is not admissible. The

allegation about validity of agreement under <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_88">Section 41</a> of the Land

Acquisition Act and notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_89">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_90">6</a> are denied. It is

further stated that land belonging to the Government can be transferred

by the State Government on consideration of public interest for immense

use of the public and therefore the petitioners in the PIL writ petitions

have no locus standi to question the same.

9.          Counter affidavit has also been filed on behalf of the State

Government and the various authorities of the State, opposite party nos.

1 to 5 traversing the petitioner's averments in W.P.(C) No. 7360 of 2008.
                                  21


It is stated that Vedanta Resources submitted representation to the

Hon'ble Chief Minister of Orissa during the month of April, 2006 for setting

up a University at Puri which will have Under Graduate, Post Graduate

Courses in Engineering, Medicines, Management, General Sciences and

Humanity etc. Thereafter memorandum of understanding was signed

between Government of Orissa and Vedanta Foundation which was later

named as Anil Agarwal Foundation on 19.7.2006 for establishment of

World class multi disciplinary University at Puri. It required contiguous

land of 8000 acres. Accordingly, by letter dated 29.11.2006 issued by the

Government    of   Orissa,   Department   of    Higher   Education   to   the

Commissioner-cum Secretary to Government, Revenue and Disaster

Management, administrative approval was given for acquisition of lands in

22 villages mentioned therein for the proposed Vedanta University by Anil

Agarwal   Foundation.    Thereafter,   the     Foundation   deposited     the

establishment cost and the opinion of the Law Department was obtained.

The entire procedure contemplated under Chapter VII of the Land

Acquisition Act and the Land Acquisition Companies Rules, 1963 have

been complied with except notifying in the Official Gazette of the

Committee to Advise the Government. A Core Committee was constituted

which examined the matter from time to time and is also monitoring the

same. It is further stated in the Counter Affidavit that by the time the

Counter was filed 2338 acres of the land pertaining to 18 villages had

already been acquired and compensation to the tune of Rs. 29,10 crore

had already been paid     to 1234 numbers of awardees. Apart from the

above, Rs. 15. 70 crores has already been disbursed as ex gratia by the
                                       22


Project Authority. The question of rehabilitation and resettlement of the

displaced persons has been well taken care of having regard to the

Rehabilitation and Resettlement policy, 2006. The Committee which has

been    constituted    by     notification       dated     17.8.2006      issued   by   the

Department of Higher Education is a Core Committee to coordinate the

activities relating to lease of Government land and acquisition of private

land facilitating rehabilitation of displaced families as per the policy and

for    other   ancillary    matters         is    consisted     of;   the    Development

Commissioner,       Orissa,     Principal        Secretary     to     Government,       Law

Department, Commissioner- cum Secretary to Government, Higher

Education      Department,       R.D.C.,         Central      Division,     Secretary    to

Government, Works Department, Special Secretary to Government,

Finance Department and the Collector, Puri. The further case of the

opposite party nos. 1 to 5          is that most of the lands proposed to be

acquired are inferior type, completely rain fed and there is no irrigation

facilities available to the said lands. The allegation of the petitioners that

the lands under acquisition are good agricultural land has been denied. It

is further stated that due to acquisition of land in 18 villages only 94

families are going to be displaced as per the socio economic studies

conducted by the Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar.                            As

regard acquisition of land of Sri Jagannath                 Mahapravu Bije at Puri is

admitted in the counter affidavit. So far an amount of Rs. 8,78,94,399/-

has been paid to the Administrator of Sri Jagannath Mandir Parichalana

Committee for an area of 605. 87 acres in respect of ten villages and an

amount of Rs. 4,09, 73,327/- has already deposited in the SBI, Puri for an
                                   23


area of 300.92 as per the direction of this Court. The opposite parties

have stated that for the establishment of University by the Foundation an

area of Ac.6`150.00 is required out of which Ac. 5488.00 is private land

and Ac. 702.00 are Government Land. The aforesaid lands do not come

under the purview of Balukhanda Wild Life Sanctuary. Therefore, the

allegation of the petitioner that the establishment of the University will

affect the environment, wild life and deprive the bread and butter of the

petitioners is baseless. The further case of the opposite parties is that

Vedanta University will promote the educational activities of international

standard and shall impart education at par with Oxford, Standford and

Cambridge University etc. and it shall be a non-profit making University,

therefore, the signing of MOU for the purpose of establishment of the

University is genuine and there is no mala fide intention in it. The villages

of the project area are outside the Balukhanda Konark Wild Life

Sanctuary, therefore, it shall have no adverse effect on environment. The

Existence of two rivers namely, Nuanai and Ciarcut inside the project area

is admitted. Further a stand is taken that Anil Agarwal Foundation has

changed its status from Private Company to Public Company and the

procedure for land acquisition as prescribed in the Act and the Rules has

been meticulously followed and the Law Department has been consulted

whenever required. Notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_91">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act has been

issued after the Government was satisfied that the Anil Agarwal

Foundation has changed its status from Private to Public Company. It is

the further case of the opposite parties that the though the provision of

Rule 4 of the Land Acquisition Companies Rules, 1963 have not been
                                  24


complied with in letters, it is deemed to have been complied with in spirit

as all the step required under the said Rules have been broadly seen to be

complied. It is further submitted that the land which comes under the

Project Area is not sensitive to ecology, and on the basis of the letter

dated 28.11.2007 of the Conservator of Forest (WL), Bhubaneswar, the

opposite parties have stated that no information about area if any

reserved by Government for development of eco-tourism is available in

the office of the Principal CCF. Further by letter dated 11.12.2007, the

Director, Tourism has informed the Joint Secretary to the Government,

Revenue and Disaster Management Department that the 8000 acres of

land at Puri-Konark Marine Drive as mentioned in paragraph-7 of W.P.(C)

no. 11607 of 2007 has not been reserved by Tourism Department under

Orissa Tourism Policy for development of eco tourism. The other side of

the land between the sea and the road has not been declared as bird

sanctuary under Orissa Tourism Policy. Therefore, it is submitted that the

area is not coming under the purview of wild life zone or eco tourism and

further stated that after <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_92">Section 4(1)</a> notification was published, there

was enough scope for filing objection under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_93">Section 5A</a> of the Act, but in

response to the notification, nobody filed any objection under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_94">Section 5A</a>

of the L.A.Act. The petitioner in W.P.(C) 7360 of 2007 also did not file any

objection either during the statutory   period or thereafter. The stand of

the opposite party nos. 1 to 5 is that the process for acquisition of land

for the proposed Vedanta University was started only after the status of

the Company was changed from Private to Public Company. The

notifications under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_95">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act were published in two daily
                                  25


newspapers and also at conspicuous places of the village and G. P.

Headquarters for wide publicity. A lot of deliberation and inter-action had

been made with the villagers, hence, ample opportunities has been

provided to the land losers and the villagers to file objection under

<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_96">Section 5A</a> of the L.A.Act. Even then, nobody came forward to file

objection. Therefore, opposite parties 1 to 5 have prayed for dismissal of

the writ petition.

10.         Counter affidavit has also been filed by the Collector, Puri in

W.P.(C) No. 11607 of 2007       in which the prayer is for excluding the

petitioner's land in mouza Beladala from the purview of acquisition. The

stand of the Collector is that mouza Beladala was included in the <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_97">Section

4(1)</a> notification though initially Ac. 1052.43 decimals of land were

notified for acquisition in the said village, subsequently 226.52 acres were

excluded as the above land had already been acquired previously for

other purposes.

11.         Counter affidavit has been filed by the beneficiary companies

entirely traversing the allegations made in respective writ petitions. The

stand of the Company is that Anil Agarwal Foundation is a non-profit

making charitable public company taking steps for the establishment of

Vedanta University which is for a public purpose. The provisions of Part

VII of the L.A. Act have been complied with and the State Government

has given its consent under <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_98">Section 39</a> of the Act for acquisition of the

land. The agreement under <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_99">Section 41</a> of the Act has been executed

between the State Government and the Public Company containing the

conditions for advance payment of the cost of acquisition and reversion of
                                   26


the acquired land to the State Govt. in the event Company failed to

complete the work within the stipulated period. Their main thrust of

argument is that the PILs are not maintainable because it is not filed bona

fide but with a mala fide intention and oblique motive. The petitioners

have no locus standi to maintain a PIL as only persons interested has

right to object to the land acquisition proceeding in respect of their

interest in the land. According to them after publication of the notification

under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_100">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act about 10 numbers of objections were filed

under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_101">Section 5A</a> which were disposed of by the competent authority and

the petitioners who have filed the PIL have never made any written

objections    though      they     have     the     knowledge      of     the

notifications/declarations made under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_102">Section 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_103">6</a> of the Act

respectively. There is no document to show that the lands of the

petitioner no. 2 and in W.P.(C) No. 10325 of 2008 are sought            to be

acquired. It is the contention of the beneficiary company that land losers

cannot file writ petition in the nature of PIL in representing capacity for

other land losers especially when no objections have been filed under

<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_104">Section 5A</a> of the Act after issuance of notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_105">Section 4</a> of the

Act. It is further stated that acquisition proceedings of 18 villages are at

different stages. Out of 18 villages, in respect of 7 villages, namely,

Nilakanthapada, Rahanagiria, Gaindol, Nalihana, Kantasila, Sirihana and

Fanafana, and acquisitions proceedings have already been completed by

making of awards, and after disbursement of compensation amount to the

owners/interested persons, possession of 1871 acres was taken by the

State and has already been delivered to the beneficiary company. In
                                   27


respect of three villages only declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_106">Section 6</a> of the Act has

been made and in 8 villages, awards under <a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_107">Section 11</a> of the Act have

been passed in respect of 868.35 acres of land and delivery of possession

is awaited. It is stated that about 2700 persons have received the

compensation amount from the State Government.           Further case of the

beneficiary company is that the PIL has been filed after more than one

and half year of the publication of the notification Under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_108">Section 4(1)</a> of

the Act. Therefore, the PIL petitioners are estopped from raising

allegation of violation    of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_109">L.A. Act</a> and non-

compliance of the Rule 4 of the Land Acquisition Companies Rules, 1963

as the persons affected have acquiesced to the land acquisition

proceeding pursuant to the notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_110">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act.

Further the land oustees/villagers on whose behalf the PIL petitioners

espoused the cause have never filed objection under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_111">Section 5-A</a> of the

Act on the ground of violation of legal right nor have the PIL petitioners

come forward within the stipulated period to file statutory objection

alleging procedural improprieties in the land acquisition process or any

illegality or irrationality in the administrative decisions. Since this Court

has already declined to interfere in the land acquisition process, in

W.P.(C) No. 6981 of 2008 filed by way of PIL, the subsequent PIL writ

petitions   for the self same cause are not maintainable in law and

therefore prayed for dismissal of the same. Similar stand has also been

taken in the counter affidavit filed in the connected writ petitions.

12.         Having regard to the pleadings of the parties, the following

points arise for consideration.

Answer to Point Nos. 1 &amp; 2.

13.         Mr. Jayant Das, learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the public

interest writ petitioners in W.P.(c) No. 10325 of 2008 urged that <a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_140">Section

2</a> (23) of the Act states that ‗limited company' means a company limited

by shares or by guarantee. <a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_141">Section 2(35)</a> defines ‗private company'.

<a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_142">Section 2</a> (37) states about ‗public company'. <a href="/doc/21390555/" id="a_143">Section 3(1)(iii)(b)(i)</a>, (c)

and (d) deals with private company and Clause (iv)(a)(b) and (c) of sub-

section (1) of <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_144">Section 3</a> refers to public company, which shall have a

minimum paid-up capital of five lakh rupees or such higher paid up

capital, as may be prescribed. However, sub-section (6) of <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_145">Section 3</a>

provides that a company registered under <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_146">Section 25</a> of the Act, 1956

before or after the commencement of <a href="/doc/498296/" id="a_147">Companies (Amendment) Act</a>, 2000

shall not be required to have minimum paid-up capital specified in the

section. Public company is a residuary company.

14.         Mr. Das with reference to <a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_148">section 2(23)</a> and <a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_149">2</a> (27) read with

section 3(1) (III),(a)(b) and <a href="/doc/575822/" id="a_150">section 27(3)</a> contends that for a public

limited company there shall be seven or more shareholders but for a

private company two or more persons associated for a lawful purpose. In

the instant case it is a Company limited by guarantee as mentioned in the

Memorandum of Association to the tune of Rs.5000.00. Shares of a

company limited by guarantee is neither transferable nor convertible like
                                  32


public limited company. Public limited company shares cannot be allowed

to travel to public company under <a href="/doc/21390555/" id="a_151">section 3(1)(iv)</a> of the Act. There is no

provision in the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_152">Companies Act</a> to convert from a private limited company

to public limited company as the structure and guarantee to it co-

terminates. He has placed strong reliance upon the affidavit of the

Assistant Registrar of Companies filed in the instant case pursuant to the

direction issued by this Court in these proceedings. The Assistant

Registrar is also a Registrar in terms of definition of <a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_153">Section 2(40)</a> of the

Act,1956.

15.         On the other hand, Mr. Anil Diwan, Learned Senior counsel on

behalf of the Foundation placing strong reliance upon the statement of

counter filed by it in W.P.(C) No. 10325 of 2008 and also the affidavit of

the Assistant Registrar of Companies and Annexures-R/13 and R/14 to

the affidavit and counter affidavit of opposite party no.3 of the paper

book and <a href="/doc/1216959/" id="a_154">sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/354101/" id="a_155">44</a> of the Companies Act, submits that the

Foundation is not a limited share holding. He submits that the certificate

has been issued by the Registrar of Companies in favour of the

Foundation evidencing the fact that it is a public company. Therefore he

submits that acquisition of land by the State Government in favour of the

Foundation for establishing the University in the acquired lands is for a

public purpose to impart world-class education institutions in various

courses to the students of the country and also other foreign students. He

further submits that the various legal contentions urged on behalf of the

petitioners that the Foundation is not converted into a public limited

company from private company is wholly untenable in law as the same is
                                     33


contrary to facts and law and therefore requested to reject the contention

urged in this regard. Accordingly, he requests this Court to answer the

point on this aspect in favour of the Foundation and consequently the

other points that would arise for consideration also in its favour as the

acquisition of lands by the State Government is permissible under the

provisions of Part VII of the L.A.Act and it is also for public purpose.

16.          With reference to the rival legal contentions urged on behalf of the

parties with regard to Point Nos. 1 and 2, our answer to the above points is

against the Foundation for the following reasons. It would be necessary for us

to extract the provisions of <a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_156">Sections 2(23)</a>, <a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_157">2(27)</a> and <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_158">3</a> (1)(iii) (a)(b)(c)(d) and

(iv)(a)(b)(c) of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_159">Companies Act</a>, which read thus:

                 ― 2(23). ―limited company‖ means a company limited
         by shares or by guarantee.

                    2(27) ―member‖ in relation to a company, does
         not include a bearer of a share-warrant of the company
         issued in pursuance of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_160">section 114</a>;

                    3 (1) ― Definition of ‗company',' existing company',
         ‗private company' and ‗public company'.- (1) In this Act,
         unless the context otherwise required, the expressions
         ―company‖, ―existing company‖, ―private company‖ and
         ―public company‖, shall, subject to the provisions of sub-
         section (2), have the meanings specified below:-

                      xxx                xxx        xxx                xxx

                (iii) ―private company‖ means a company which has a
         minimum paid-up capital of one lakh rupees or such higher
         paid-up capital as may be prescribed, and by its articles.-

         (a)    restricts the right to transfer its shares, if any;

         (b)    limits the number of its members to fifty not including-

             (i) persons who are in the employment of the company;
             and
                                  34


           (ii) persons who, having been formerly in the employment
           of the company, were members of the company while in
           that employment and have continued to be members after
           the employment ceased; and

        (c)  prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for
        any shares in, or debentures of, the company.

        (d) Prohibits any invitation or acceptance of deposits from
        persons other than its members, directors or their relatives:

             Provided that where two or more persons hold one or
        more shares in a company jointly, they shall, for the purposes
        of this definition, be treated as a single member.‖

            (iv) ―public company‖ means a company which-

             (a)   is not a private company;

             (b) has a minimum paid-up capital of five lakh rupees
             or such higher paid-up capital, as may be prescribed;

             (c) is a private company which is a subsidiary of a
             company which is not a private company.

17.        <a href="/doc/1672733/" id="a_161">Section 12(1)</a> of the Act, 1956 deals with mode of forming

incorporated company which provision states that any seven or more

persons, or where the company to be formed will be a private company,

any two or more persons associated for any lawful purpose may, by

subscribing their names to a Memorandum of Association and otherwise

complying with the requirements of this Act in respect of registration,

form an incorporated company, with or without limited liability. <a href="/doc/575822/" id="a_162">Section 27</a>

speaks of regulations required in case of unlimited company, company

limited by guarantee or private company limited by shares. Sub-section

(2) of the aforesaid provision provides that in the case of a company

limited by guarantee, the articles shall state the number of members with

which the company is to be registered. <a href="/doc/411174/" id="a_163">Section 37</a> states that in the case

of a company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital and
                                   35


registered on or after the first day of April, 1914, every provision in the

memorandum or articles or in any resolution of the company purporting

to give any person a right to participate in the divisible profits of the

company otherwise than as a member shall be void. As could be seen

from paragraph 6 of the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar of Company &amp;

Corporate Affairs on behalf of opposite party no. 13 (Regional Director)

and 14 (Registrar of Companies) in W.P.(C) No.10325 of 2008, who has

been authorized on behalf of the Registrar of Companies at Mumbai to file

the affidavit, has filed affidavit pursuant to the direction of this Court in

these proceedings stating that M/s.Vedanta Foundation was originally

incorporated with the Registrar of Companies, Maharashta, Mumbai on

12.5.2004 under <a href="/doc/501652/" id="a_164">section 25</a> of the Companies Act, 1956 as Sterlite

Foundation, a private limited company as defined under <a href="/doc/21390555/" id="a_165">section 3(1)(iii)</a>

of the Act and subsequently changed its name to M/s.Vedanta Foundation

pursuant to <a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_166">section 21</a> read with <a href="/doc/1564986/" id="a_167">Section 23(1)</a> of the Companies Act,

1956 and again changed its name to M/s. Anil Agarwal Foundation vide

fresh certificate of incorporation dated 6.9.2006 issued consequent upon

the said change of its name. Further at paragraph 9 of the affidavit, it has

been stated that opposite party No.13,       in the said PIL    writ petition

considered the conversion of the status of opposite party No.6 Foundation

from Private to a Public Company subject to compliance of the provisions

of <a href="/doc/31609/" id="a_168">sections 23</a>, <a href="/doc/624098/" id="a_169">31</a>, <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_170">189(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_171">192</a> of the Act but the said Foundation did

not furnish to opposite party no.14 certified copy of the Memorandum and

Articles of Association as required under the provisions of sub-section

(2A) of <a href="/doc/624098/" id="a_172">Section 31</a> of the Act. Further the Assistant Registrar has stated at
                                  36


para 10 of the affidavit that change of status of the Foundation from

private to public was subject to compliance of the aforesaid provisions of

the Act and the same is not complied with by the beneficiary company,

therefore it has not acquired the status of a ‗public company'. Further the

company has been promoted by four members the names and addresses

of whom have been furnished at para 10(a) of the affidavit. Further at

paragraph 10(b), it is stated by the Assistant Registrar that as per the

Articles of Association, Sterlite Foundation has been incorporated as a

company limited by guarantee and not having share capital. The above

said Directors were first Directors of the Company. As per details

mentioned in Form No.32 filed on 19.7.2006, one Laxminarayan Agarwal

ceased to be a Director and member of the Company with effect from

2.4.2006 due to his death. Therefore, the company is presently having

three Directors on its Board and less than seven members as required

for a public limited company under <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_173">section 12</a> (b) of the Act. As the

Foundation has not produced the altered Memorandum and Articles of

Association of the Company, and the same are not available in the office

of the Registrar of Companies at Mumbai a letter was addressed to it for

supply of the duly certified copy of the same. The said letter was returned

with postal remark ‗not known'. At paragraph 12 of the affidavit it is

stated that opposite party No.13 considered the change of status of the

Foundation from ‗private' to ‗public' company both on fact and in law is

not legal and valid.      Since the Foundation did not furnish the

Memorandum and Articles of Association to opposite party No.14, the

change of status of the Foundation from ‗private limited' company to
                                   37


‗public limited' company with reference to <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_174">Section 3</a> (1)(iii) and <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_175">Section 3</a>

(1)(iv) cannot be deemed to be a Public Company and it is not a

Government Company as defined under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_176">section 617</a> of the Act,1956 read

with the provisions of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_177">Sections 618</a> to <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_178">620</a> of the said Act till the

provisions of <a href="/doc/889229/" id="a_179">sections 44</a> of the Act are complied with and also the

requisite minimum number of members as required under <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_180">section 12</a> (b)

of the Act are complied with by it. The Foundation, a company

incorporated under <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_181">section 25</a> of the Act, 1956 by collusion is not a Public

Company in terms of the aforesaid provisions of the Act. In view of the

aforesaid statement of fact sworn to by competent officer of the Ministry

of Company Affairs and having regard to the undisputed fact, it is a

private company limited by guarantee. For the reasons stated supra, the

submission made on behalf of the petitioners that Anil Agarwal Foundation

is not a ‗public limited' company for the purpose of acquisition of lands in

its favour under Part VII of the Land Acquisition Act and the acquisition of

land in favour of the company for educational purposes as it falls within

the definition of Society in <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_182">section 3(f)</a> sub-Clause (vi) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_183">L.A. Act</a> and

to establish Educational Institutions is neither sponsored by the State

Government or Local Authorities as required under the above provisions

shall be accepted by this Court as the same is well founded. In support of

the above said views in giving answer to point No.1, it would be

necessary for us to refer to the decision of the apex Court hereunder.

18.         In the case of Needle Industries (India) Ltd. &amp; Ors. Vs.

Needle Industries Newey (India) Holding Ltd. &amp; Ors., reported in

(1981) 3 SCC 333, a three Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
                                  38


examined and explained the definitions of ‗private company' and a ‗public

company' and held as under :

          ―147. In the first place, a <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_184">Section 43-A</a> company may
       include in its articles, as part of its structure, provisions
       relating to restrictions on transfer of shares, limiting the
       number of its members to 50, and prohibiting an invitation
       to the public to subscribe for shares, which are typical
       characteristics of a private company. A public company
       cannot possibly do so because, by the very definition, it is
       that which is not a private company, that is to say, which
       is not a company which by its articles contains the
       restrictions mentioned in <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_185">Section 3(l)(iii)</a>. Therefore, the
       expression ‗public company' in <a href="/doc/21390555/" id="a_186">Section 3(1)(iv)</a> cannot be
       equated with a ‗private company which has become a
       public company by virtue of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_187">Section 43-A</a>'.
          148. Secondly, the number of members of a public
       company cannot fall below 7 without attracting the serious
       consequences provided for by <a href="/doc/541746/" id="a_188">Section 45</a> (personal liability
       of members for the company's debts) and <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_189">Section 433</a>
       (d)(winding up in case the number of its members falls
       below 7). A <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_190">Section 43-A</a> company can still maintain its
       separate corporate identity qua debts even if the number
       of its members is reduced below seven and is not liable to
       be wound up for that reason.
          149. Thirdly, a <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_191">Section 43-A</a> company can never be
       incorporated and registered as such under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_192">Companies
       Act</a>. It is registered as a private company and becomes, by
       operation of law, a public company.
          150. Fourthly, the three contingencies in which a
       private company becomes a public company by virtue of
       <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_193">Section 43-A</a> [mentioned in sub-sections (1), (1-A) and (1-
       B) read with the provisions of sub-section (4) of that
       section] show that it becomes and continues to be a public
       company so long as the conditions in sub-sections (1), (1-
       A) or (1-B) are applicable. The provisos to each of these
       sub-sections clarify the legislative intent that such
       companies may retain their registered corporate shell of a
       private company but will be subjected to the discipline of
       public companies. When the necessary conditions do not
       obtain, the legislative device in <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_194">Section 43-A</a> is to permit
       them to go back into their corporate shell and function
       once again as private companies, with all the privileges
       and exemptions applicable to private companies. The
       proviso to each of the sub-sections of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_195">Section 43-A</a> clearly
       indicates that although the private company has become a
       public company by virtue of that section, it is permitted to
       retain the structural characteristics of its origin, its
       birthmarks, so to say. Any provision of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_196">Companies Act</a>
       which would endanger the corporate shell of a ―proviso
                           39

company‖ cannot be applied to it because, that would
constitute an infraction of one or more of the
characteristics of the ―proviso company‖ which are
statutorily allowed to be preserved and retained under
each of the three provisos to the three sub-sections of
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_197">Section 43-A</a>. A right of renunciation in favour of any other
person, as a statutory term of an offer of rights shares,
would be repugnant to the integrity of the Company and
the continued retention by it of the basic characteristics
under <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_198">Section 3(l)(iii)</a>.
    151. Fifthly, <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_199">Section 43-A</a>, when introduced by Act 65 of
1960, did not adopt the language either of <a href="/doc/261576/" id="a_200">Section 43</a> or of
<a href="/doc/889229/" id="a_201">Section 44</a>. Under <a href="/doc/261576/" id="a_202">Section 43</a> where default is made in
complying with the provisions of <a href="/doc/21390555/" id="a_203">Section 3(1)(iii)</a>, a private
company ―shall cease to be entitled to the privileges and
exemptions conferred on private companies by or under
this Act, and this Act shall apply to the company as if it
were not a private company‖. Under <a href="/doc/889229/" id="a_204">Section 44</a> of the Act,
where a private company alters its articles in such a
manner that they no longer include the provisions, which
under <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_205">Section 3(l)(iii)</a>, are required to be included in the
articles in order to constitute it a private company, the
company ―shall as on the date of the alteration cease to be
a private company‖. Neither of the expressions, namely,
―this Act shall apply to the company as if it were not a
private company‖ (<a href="/doc/261576/" id="a_206">Section 43</a>) or that the company ―shall .
. . cease to be a private company (<a href="/doc/889229/" id="a_207">Section 44</a>) is used in
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_208">Section 43-A</a>. If a <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_209">Section 43-A</a> company were to be
equated in all respects with a public company, that is a
company which does not have the characteristics of a
private company, Parliament would have used language
similar to the one in <a href="/doc/261576/" id="a_210">Section 43</a> or <a href="/doc/889229/" id="a_211">Section 44</a>, between
which two sections, <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_212">Section 43-A</a> was inserted. If the
intention was that the rest of the Act was to apply to a
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_213">Section 43-A</a> company ―as if it were not a private
company‖, nothing would have been easier than to adopt
that language in <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_214">Section 43-A</a>; and if the intention was
that a <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_215">Section 43-A</a> company would for all purposes ―cease
to be a private company‖, nothing would have been easier
than to adopt that language in <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_216">Section 43-A</a>.
   152. Sixthly, the fact that a private company which
becomes a public company by virtue of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_217">Section 43-A</a> does
not cease to be for all purposes a ―private company‖
becomes clear when one compares and contrasts the
provisions of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_218">Section 43-A</a> with <a href="/doc/889229/" id="a_219">Section 44</a>: when the
articles of a private company no longer include matters
under <a href="/doc/21390555/" id="a_220">Section 3(1)(iii)</a>, such a company shall as on the
date of the alteration cease to be a private company
[<a href="/doc/889229/" id="a_221">Section 44(1)(a)</a>]. It has then to file with the Registrar a
prospectus or a statement in lieu of prospectus under
<a href="/doc/889229/" id="a_222">Section 44(2)</a>. A private company which becomes a public
                            40

company by virtue of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_223">Section 43-A</a> is not required to file a
prospectus or a statement in lieu of a prospectus.
   153. These considerations show that, after the
<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_224">Amending Act</a> 65 of 1960, three distinct types of
companies occupy a distinct place in the scheme of our
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_225">Companies Act</a>: (1) private companies (2) public
companies and (3) private companies which have become
public companies by virtue of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_226">Section 43-A</a>, but which
continue to include or retain the three characteristics of a
private company. <a href="/doc/1282843/" id="a_227">Sections 174</a> and <a href="/doc/1934600/" id="a_228">252</a> of the Companies
Act which deal respectively with quorum for meetings and
minimum number of directors, recognize expressly, by
their parenthetical clauses, the separate existence of public
companies which have become such by virtue of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_229">Section
43-A</a>. We may also mention that while making an
amendment in sub-clause (ix) of Rule 2(a) of the
Companies (Acceptance of Deposits) Rules, 1975, the
Amendment Rules, 1978 added the expression: ―any
amount received ... by a private company which has
become a public company under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_230">Section 43-A</a> of the Act
and continues to include in its Articles of Association
provisions relating to the matters specified in clause (iii) of
sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_231">Section 3</a> of the Act‖, in order to bring
deposits received by such companies within the Rules.
   154. The various points discussed above will facilitate a
clearer perception of the position that under the
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_232">Companies Act</a>, there are three kinds of companies whose
rights and obligations fall for consideration, namely,
private companies, public companies and private
companies which have become public companies under
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_233">Section 43-A(1)</a> but which retain, under the first proviso to
that section, the three characteristics of private companies
mentioned in <a href="/doc/21390555/" id="a_234">Section 3(1)(iii)</a> of the Act. Private
companies enjoy certain exemptions and privileges which
are peculiar to their constitution and nature. Public
companies are subjected severely to the discipline of the
Act. Companies of the third kind like NIIL, which become
public companies but which continue to include in their
articles the three matters mentioned in sub-clauses (a) to
(c) of <a href="/doc/21390555/" id="a_235">Section 3(1)(iii)</a> are also, broadly and generally,
subjected to the rigorous discipline of the Act. They cannot
claim the privileges and exemptions to which private
companies which are outside <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_236">Section 43-A</a> are entitled.
And yet, there are certain provisions of the Act which
would apply to public companies but not to <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_237">Section 43-A</a>
companies. Is <a href="/doc/1553605/" id="a_238">Section 81</a> of the Companies Act one such
provision? And if so, does the whole of it not apply to a
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_239">Section 43-A</a> company or only some particular part of it?
These are the questions which we have now to consider.‖
                                           (emphasis added)
                                      41


19.         Therefore, in view of the reasons assigned above, the reliance

placed by the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Anil Diwan on behalf of the

Company upon the above referred various provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_240">Companies

Act</a> and documents in support of his submission that Anil Agarwal

Foundation is a ‗Public Limited Company' is wholly untenable in law as the

same is contrary to facts and various provisions of the Act,1956 which are

adverted to above, and law laid down by the Apex Court on this aspect.

Therefore, we have to hold the first point against the beneficiary

company/ Foundation.

20.         The second point is also required to be answered in favour of

the petitioners for the following reasons. The case of the beneficiary

company/Foundation is that it is a public limited company and therefore

acquisition of lands by the State Government in exercise of its eminent

domain power for establishment of the University is permissible in view of

<a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_241">Section 40</a> of the L.A. Act. The provisions of <a href="/doc/742301/" id="a_242">Section 40(1)</a> of the L.A. Act

provides that consent for acquisition of land shall be given by the

appropriate Government if it is satisfied either on the report of the

Collector under <a href="/doc/1183388/" id="a_243">section 5-A(2)</a> or by an enquiry held that the purpose of

the acquisition of lands is for the erection of dwelling-house for workmen

employed by the company or for the provision of amenities directly

connected   therewith,   or   that    such   acquisition   is   needed   for   the

construction of some building or work for a company which is engaged or

is taking steps for engaging itself in any industry or work which is for a

public purpose or that such acquisition is needed for the construction of

some work and that such work is likely to prove useful to the public.
                                   42


<a href="/doc/1554208/" id="a_244">Section 44-B</a> of the Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained

in the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_245">L.A. Act</a>, no land shall be acquired under Part VII except for the

purpose mentioned in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_246">Section 40</a> for a

private company which is not a Government company. Since we have

answered the point no.1 in favour of the petitioners and against the

Foundation holding that it is Private Limited Guarantee Company,

acquisition of lands in favour of the beneficiary company is permissible

only for the purposes mentioned in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of

<a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_247">Section 40</a> of the L.A. Act, as the Foundation is neither a Government

Company nor a Public Company. The acquisition of lands in favour of the

beneficiary company is not permissible for any purpose other than the

purposes as provided under <a href="/doc/139114158/" id="a_248">Sections 40(1)(a)</a> of the L.A. Act. In this view

of the matter, the proposed acquisition of lands in favour of the

Foundation pursuant to the impugned notifications for the purpose of

establishment of a non-existent University, as rightly pointed out by the

learned Senior Counsel Mr. Jayant Das for the petitioners that such

University has not come into existence either <a href="/doc/535576/" id="a_249">Under the University Grants

Commission Act</a>,1956 in terms of <a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_250">section 2</a> (f) or under the Orissa

Universities Act, and, therefore, the acquisition of lands in favour of the

Foundation is illegal in the eye of law. The undisputed fact is that there is

an Ordinance promulgated by the Government of Orissa at the time of

initiation of the proceedings to establish a University by the Foundation.

Such Ordinance is wholly untenable in law for the reason that the

proposed University only can be established under the Orissa Universities

Act and such University will have a status of a deemed University under
                                  43


the provisions of the <a href="/doc/535576/" id="a_251">University Grants Commission Act</a> if it is granted

under the said Act by issuing notification under <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_252">Section 3</a> of the Act.

Therefore, the Ordinance promulgated by the State Government in favour

of the Foundation cannot give the legal status to the University proposed

to be established in the acquired lands by the Foundation. Under the

provisions of Section 44-B of the L.A. Act of Chapter VII, acquisition of

lands in favour of a private company can only be made for the purposes

mentioned in Clause (a) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_253">Section 40</a> of the Act, which

is for erection of dwelling-houses for workmen employed by the company

or for the provisions of amenities directly connected therewith. The

acquisition of lands for establishment of the proposed non existent

University does not fall within the purposes mentioned in the clause (a) or

the aforesaid provisions of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_254">section 40</a> and further it does not fall within

the public purpose in terms of Section 3(f) Clause (vi) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_255">L.A. Act</a> for

the reason that establishment of a non-existent University by a private

company cannot be held as public purpose in terms of the above

provisions and law laid down by the apex Court in this regard. Therefore,

acquisition of lands by the State Government on the request of the

Vedanta Foundation is totally impermissible in law. Hence, the impugned

notifications are void ab initio in law and are liable to be quashed.

Accordingly, the second point is answered against the Foundation and in

favour of the petitioners.

Answer to Points 3, 4(a)(b) and 5 (a) &amp; (b), 6,7,8,9,10 &amp; 11

21.            All these points being inter related, are taken up together

and answered as hereunder.
                                   44


            The case of the petitioners who are land owners and public

spirited persons in these cases is that the notification issued under

<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_256">Section 4</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_257">L.A. Act</a>, proposing to acquire the lands in the locality

in favour of the beneficiary company for establishment of the proposed

Vedanta University is not legally permissible for the reason that it is not a

‗public company' in terms of the definition of <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_258">Section 3</a> (iv) of the

<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_259">Companies Act</a> as the beneficiary company is a guarantee Private Limited

Company. Therefore, the proposed acquisition of lands for the purpose of

establishing a University does not fall within the purpose for which the

lands are proposed to be acquired as per Clause (a) or (b) of sub-section

(1) of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_260">Section 40</a> of the L.A. Act. Therefore, it is not permissible in law for

the State Government to acquire the lands in favour of the beneficiary

Company and further this important legal aspect of the matter has not

been properly considered by the State Government, while exercising its

power under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_261">Section 4(1)</a> of the L.A. Act to initiate the acquisition

proceedings in view of <a href="/doc/1554208/" id="a_262">Section 44-B</a> of the L.A. Act. Further the Collector

of the District where the acquired lands are situated has not conducted

any enquiry, by serving individual notices upon the owners/interested

persons, as required under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_263">Section 5-A</a> (2) of the L.A.Act and/or previous

enquiry under <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_264">Section 40</a> of the Act or under Rule 4 of the Rules. <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_265">Section

39</a> of the L.A. Act expressly states that provisions of <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_266">sections 6</a> to <a href="/doc/562722/" id="a_267">16</a>

(both inclusive) and <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_268">Sections 18</a> to <a href="/doc/411174/" id="a_269">37</a> (both inclusive) shall not be put in

force in order to acquire land for any company under Chapter VII unless

with the previous consent of the appropriate Government and unless the

company shall have executed the agreement mentioned therein in its
                                    45


favour. Placing strong reliance upon decision in the case of <a href="/doc/830852/" id="a_270">State of

Gujarat and another vs. Patel Chaturbhai Narsinbhai &amp; Ors</a>.,

reported in AIR 1975 SC 629 and also another judgment of the

Supreme Court in the case of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd.

Vs. Darius Shapur Chenai and Ors., reported in AIR 2005 SC 3520,

learned Senior Counsel contended that land owners are         entitled to be

given   opportunity   of   being   heard   by   conducting   an   enquiry   as

contemplated under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_271">Section 5-A</a> or previous enquiry under <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_272">Section 40</a> of

the L.A. Act.

22.         Learned Senior Counsel Mr. Jayant Das, Mr. R.K.Rath and

learned counsel Mr. Subir Palit who appeared on behalf of the

petitioners both for the owners of land and the public spirited persons

in the Public Interest Litigation petitions placed strong reliance upon

Rule 3(2) of the Rules framed by the Union of India in exercise of its

power under <a href="/doc/1061397/" id="a_273">Section 55</a> of the L.A.Act. It is contended by them that in

the proposed acquisition of lands in favour of the beneficiary Company

in terms of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_274">Section 40</a> (1) of the L.A.Act under Part

VII read with Rules 3 &amp; 4 of the Rules are applicable to the acquisition

proceedings, the State Government is required to acquire the lands by

following the due procedure as contemplated therein. Rule 3 of the

said Rules provides for constitution of a Committee called ‗Land

Acquisition Committee' and the State Government shall publish the

same in the Official Gazette. In the case at hand, undisputedly no

such Committee was constituted by the State Government from

among the persons notified under sub-rule (2) of Rule 3 and clauses
                                 46


(i) and (ii) of the Rules. Further they have submitted that whenever

any Company makes an application to the State Government for

acquisition of any land, it shall direct the Collector to submit a report

on the matters provided under sub-rule (2) and clauses (i), (ii), (iii)

and (iv) of the Rule 4 which are elaborately extracted in the reasoning

portion and further sub-rule (2) of Rule 4 provides that the Collector

should   give   reasonable   opportunity   to   the   Company   to   make

representation and hold an enquiry into the matters referred to in sub -

rule (1) and while conducting such an enquiry he is required to

indicate in his report the aspects, which are referred to in clauses (i),

(ii) and (iii) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 4. Sub-rule (4) of Rule 4 mandates

that no declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_275">section 6</a> in respect of the lands notified

under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_276">Section 4</a> (1) of the L.A.Act shall be made unless the State

Government has consulted the Committee and has considered the

reports submitted by the Collector under the Rule and the report, if

any submitted under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_277">Section 5A</a> of the Act and the agreement under

<a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_278">Section 41</a> of the Act has been executed by the Company and

published in the Official Gazette. The above said mandatory procedure

has not been complied with by the State Government and the

Collector before publishing the <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_279">Section 6</a> notifications. Therefore, the

acquisition proceedings in respect of the lands covered in the

notifications in favour of the beneficiary Company/Foundation are bad

in law, hence the same are liable to be quashed.

23.       Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners

in support of the above said legal contentions placed reliance upon the
                                 47


following decisions of the Supreme Court, namely, Shanti Sports Club &amp;

anr. Vs. Union of India and ors., reported in (2009) 15 SCC 705

and <a href="/doc/1990262/" id="a_280">City Montessory School vs. State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors</a>.,

reported in (2009) 14 SCC 253. It is contended by the learned Senior

Counsel Mr. R.K. Rath that the memorandum of agreement was executed

by the Vedanta Foundation and not by Anil Agarwal Foundation in favour

of the   State   Government before    the   initiation of   the   acquisition

proceedings. Therefore, it is not a valid agreement as required under

<a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_281">Section 41</a> of the Act.   Further, certain clauses in the said agreement

would clearly go to show that the State Government has pre determined

the issue regarding acquisition of lands without getting the report from

the Collector as required under sub-rule (4) of Rule 4 of the Rules and

declaration of the acquisition of lands under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_282">Section 6</a> of the L.A. Act is

bad in law. Therefore, he would further submit that the impugned

notifications of acquiring the lands are in violation of the statutory

provisions of the L.A.Act and the Rules. Learned Senior Counsel further

submitted that the observance of the aforesaid statutory rules by the

State Government in order to exercise its power is required to be strictly

adhered to and followed as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

cases of Shanti Sports Club (supra) and City Montessori School (supra).

24.          Mr. Ashok Mohanty, learned Advocate General appearing

on behalf of the State Government and the Collector on the basis of the

record made available for our perusal submitted that the State

Government has applied its mind and after being satisfied that the

proposed lands were required for public purpose, published the
                                 48


notifications under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_283">Section 4</a> (1) of the Act proposing to acquire the

lands as mentioned in the preliminary notifications and notified the

same after receipt of the requisition made by the beneficiary Company

and notices were issued to the owners/interested persons calling upon

them to submit their objection statement to the proposed acquisition.

None of the owners filed their       objection statement except the

petitioners in W.P.(C) No. 3361 of 2007. Therefore, he submits that the

contention of the petitioners that notices were not served upon them as

required under the aforesaid provisions of the Act and conduct of the

enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_284">Section 5-A</a> of the L.A. Act was necessary, as urged by

the learned Sr. Counsel and other counsel on behalf of the petitioners,

is not tenable in law. He further sought to justify the consent given by

the State Government for complying with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_285">Sections 6</a>

to <a href="/doc/562722/" id="a_286">16</a> and <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_287">18</a> to <a href="/doc/411174/" id="a_288">37</a> of the L.A. Act both inclusive for the purpose of

acquiring the lands in favour of the beneficiary Company under <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_289">Section

39</a> of the Land Acquisition Act. Before giving such consent by the State

Government issuing and publishing the notifications under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_290">Section 4(1)</a>

of the L.A. Act after the enquiry held by the Committee constituted by

the State Government as provided under sub-rule (2) of Rule 3 and

unless it opines that the lands which are proposed to be acquired as

notified under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_291">Section 4(1)</a> of the L.A. Act are        needed for the

beneficiary Company to establish a multi discipline faculty University,

which would serve the public purpose is not required in law and further

he had submitted that the beneficiary Company has executed the

agreement on 31.7.2007 in favour of the State Government as required
                                  49


under <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_292">Section 41</a> of the L.A.Act and administrative approval was

obtained on 29.11.2006. Revised administrative approval was granted

on 13.12.2006 and notifications under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_293">Section 4</a> (1) were published on

22.12.2006 and on subsequent dates. Therefore, he would urge that

the legal contentions of the petitioners that there was no previous

consent of the State Government in notifying the proposed lands in the

notifications is both on facts and in law are not at all correct. It is also

further contended by him that on the basis of the Collector's report and

the counter statement, the petitioners have not submitted their

statement of objection to the notices served upon them along with

<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_294">Section 4(1)</a> of notification opposing the proposed acquisition of lands

by the State Government in favour of the beneficiary Company to

establish a University. Hence the State Government after satisfying

with the reports of the Collector and the Core Committee appointed as

provided under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_295">Section 40</a> of the L.A.Act has issued

the declaration notifications under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_296">Section 6</a> of the L.A. Act. He has

placed strong reliance upon Clause (a) or (b) of sub-section (1) of

<a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_297">Section 40</a> of the L.A. Act, in justification of the acquisition. He further

contended that the acquisition of the lands covered under the

impugned notifications are for the public purpose as the beneficiary

Company is going to establish a University in the State which will be of

international reputation and therefore the acquisition of lands are legal

and valid. Further he has placed strong reliance upon the decision of

the Apex Court in the case of Fomento Resorts and Hotels Limited

&amp; Anr. Vrs. Minguel Martins &amp; Ors., reported in (2009) 3 SCC
                                 50


571 in support of his contention that public purpose as referred to in

Clauses (a) or (b) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_298">Section 40</a> of the Act is

different from the definition of ‗public purpose' as given under <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_299">Section

3</a> (f)(vi) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_300">L.A. Act</a>. Further he has contended that in <a href="/doc/557996/" id="a_301">Devinder

Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, (2008) 1 SCC 728 upon which reliance is

placed by the Sr. Counsel for the petitioners in which the Apex Court

has placed reliance upon the case of <a href="/doc/830852/" id="a_302">State of Gujarat and another

vs. Patel Chaturbhai Narsinbhai &amp; Ors</a>., reported in AIR 1975 SC

629 is not applicable to the facts of this case for the reason that

Gujarat State Legislature has amended the provisions of <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_303">section 39</a> by

inserting <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_304">Section 4</a> of the L.A.Act. This legal aspect is not considered

by the Apex Court in Devinder Singh's case and the decision in the

case of M/s. Fomento Resorts and Hotels Limited &amp; anr. Vrs.

Gustavo Ranato Da Cruz Pinto &amp; Ors., (supra), clearly laid down the

legal principles with reference to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_305">L.A. Act</a>

regarding for acquisition of lands in favour of the beneficiary Company

as per Clause (a) or (b) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_306">Section 40</a> of the L.A.Act.

Learned Advocate General has further placed strong reliance on the

Three Judge Bench decision of the Apex Court in the case of Swasthya

Raksha Samiti Rati Chowk Vrs. Chaudhary Ram Harakh Chand &amp;

Ors., reported in AIR 2005 SC 1835, but the said matter has been

referred to larger Bench in view of the doubt entertained by the

Division Bench about the view taken by the Bench in Gujarat case

referred to supra holding that notice to land owners is mandatory

having not noticed    contrary observation of the Five Judge Bench in
                                 51


<a href="/doc/463201/" id="a_307">Babu Barkya Thakur v.the State of Bombay and others</a>,1961(1) SCR

126. In Devinder Singh's case, the Constitution Bench decision referred

to (supra) has not been noticed by the apex Court and therefore the

said decision is not helpful to the petitioners. He further placed strong

reliance upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of M/s.

Fomento Resorts and Hotels Limited's cases referred to supra in

support of his contention, wherein it has been held by the Apex Court

in those cases that no enquiry is required under Rule 4 (1) preceding

the initiation of acquisition proceedings and publishing notification

under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_308">Section 4</a> of the L.A.Act as contended by the petitioners. Further

he has placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the

case of Abdul Hussain Tayabali &amp; Ors. Vrs. The State of Gujarat &amp;

Ors, reported in AIR 1968 SC 432 in support of his legal submission

that <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_309">Section 5A</a> of the L.A. Act enquiry is administrative enquiry and

report of the Collector to the State Government is recommendatory in

nature and it is not binding upon the State Government, therefore non

submission of enquiry report by the Collector to the State Government

does not vitiate the acquisition proceedings.

25.        Learned Advocate General and learned Senior Counsel Mr.

Anil Divan appearing on behalf of the State Government and the

beneficiary Company respectively very vehemently submitted that the

petitioners and other owners of the land on whose behalf public

litigation petitions are filed, have waived and acquiesced their statutory

rights regarding the enquiry to be conducted by the Collector as they
                                 52


have not availed the opportunity given by the District Collector to them

by not filing the statement of objections within thirty days from the

date of service of notice upon them. Therefore, they submit that there

is no need for the District Collector to conduct an enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_310">Section

5A</a> of the Land Acquisition Act and further the acquisition is of the year

2007 and hence the same cannot be interfered with by this Court at

this stage. Learned Advocate General further contends that some of the

land owners have received compensation to the tune of Rs.50 crores

and some of them have sought for reference to the Jurisdictional

Reference Court for enhancement of the compensation. Therefore, it is

submitted that the acquisition of lands by the State Government issuing

preliminary and final notifications is legal and valid. Learned Advocate

General further submits that compensation amount has been received

by more than 80% of the land oustees after preferring claim in the

proceedings under <a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_311">section 11</a> and the Land Acquisition Officer has

passed awards, compensation has been paid to the owners of the land

and possession of the same has been taken over and delivered to the

beneficiary company.    Therefore, he submits that these are not fit

cases for granting reliefs by this Court in favour of the petitioner-

owners either in the petitions filed by them or in the public interest

litigation petitions as there is no public interest involved, as the

litigation in these cases is between the land owners and the State

Government and therefore it is a private interest litigation and the

substantial number of owners have not approached the Court seeking

the relief of quashing the notifications. Therefore, this Court need not
                                  53


exercise its Judicial review power to quash the acquisition proceedings

in the public interest litigation petitions and, prayed for dismissal of the

petitions. In support of the aforesaid submissions, they have placed

reliance upon the following decisions of the Apex Court. (1) Municipal

Corporation of Greater Bombay Vrs. Industrial Development

Investment Co. Pvt. &amp; Ors, AIR 1997 SC 482, (2) Narmada

Bachao Andolan etc. vs. Union of India             &amp; Ors, AIR 2000 SC

3751; and (3) Chairman &amp; Managing Director BPL Ltd. Vs. S.P.

Gururaja &amp; Ors., reported in 2003 AIRSCW 5298.

26.         Mr. Anil Diwan, learned Senior Counsel for the Company

submitted that initiation of the acquisition proceedings by the State

Government at the instance of the Anil Agarwal Foundation for

establishment of the University is a balancing act due to the economic

policy of the Union of India and also globalization. Since all the owners

of the lands have not come up before this Court questioning the legality

and validity of the impugned notifications, therefore, this Court need

not exercise its extra ordinary and discretionary power to quash the

impugned notifications in respect of the lands of the other owners who

have not approached this Court. In the PIL writ petitions, the

acquisition of the lands of the owners who have not approached this

court cannot be quashed. If the petitioner owners writ petitions are

allowed, it would amount to quashing the notifications partially in

respect of some of the acquired lands, which will not be permissible in

law. In support of this submission, he has placed reliance upon the

decisions of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/501542/" id="a_312">Delhi Administration v. Gurdip</a>
                                  54


Singh Uban and others, 2000 SC 3737.             Further, placing reliance

upon another decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Vijay

Cotton &amp; Oil Mills Ltd. Vs. State of Gujarat, 1969 (2) SCR 60,

learned Senior counsel further submits that the procedure to be

followed by the District Collector under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_313">section 5-A</a> of the L.A. Act after

publishing the preliminary notifications is not mandatory in law. It is

further contended that all the land owners have waived and acquiesced

their rights regarding an enquiry under the above provisions of the Act

as they did not file objections to the proposed acquisition of their lands

though notice being served upon them, therefore he submits that the

acquisition proceedings need not be quashed by this Court in exercise

of its Judicial Review power. In support of the above contention, he has

placed reliance upon the decisions of the Supreme Court in the cases of

<a href="/doc/351816/" id="a_314">State of Rajasthan v. D.R. Laxmi and others</a>, (1996) 6 SCC 445;

and <a href="/doc/527480/" id="a_315">Swaika Properties (P) Ltd. and another v. State of Rajasthan

and others</a>, (2008) 4 SCC 695.

27.         He has further contended that if the statement of objections

regarding non-compliance of rule 4 of the Land Acquisition (Companies)

Rules of 1963 were not filed by the land owners, to what extent this Court

can interfere with the impugned notifications, has to be considered by this

Court even assuming for the sake of argument that non-compliance of the

procedure contemplated under rules 3(2) and 4 of the Companies Rules

by the State Government vitiates the acquisition proceedings. Learned

Senior counsel further placing reliance upon the decision in M/s. Fomento

Resorts and Hotels Ltd. (supra) and <a href="/doc/705558/" id="a_316">Om Prakash and another v. State</a> of
                                   55


Uttar Pradesh and others, AIR 1998 SC 2504 submitted that compliance

of Rule 4 by the State Government is not mandatory.             It is further

submitted by learned Senior counsel Mr. Anil Diwan that <a href="/doc/1554208/" id="a_317">Section 44B</a> is

not applicable to the facts of the case in view of the fact that it is not a

private company. It is a public company got converted under <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_318">section 25</a>

of the Act. Acquisition of lands by the State Government for the purpose

of establishment of University is a public purpose and, therefore,

acquisition proceedings were initiated at the instance of the Foundation by

the State Government and after applying its mind and satisfying the

requirement of the lands for the beneficiary company on the basis of the

requisition made by it they have issued the <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_319">section 4(1)</a> notifications.

28.         The aforesaid submissions of learned Advocate General Mr.

Ashok Mohanty,      and learned Sr. Counsel Mr. Anil Divan have been

strongly rebutted by the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Jayant Das appearing

for the petitioners in the Public Interest Litigation petition contending that

the beneficiary Company has played fraud upon the State Government for

the reason that on the basis of representation submitted by the Vedanta

Company and the Memorandum of Understanding executed by Vedanta

Company and Sterlite Company claiming that it is Public Limited Company

and on that basis acquisition proceedings were initiated        by the State

Government and lands were         acquired in its favour.    The beneficiary

company is not at all a public limited company and misrepresenting this

fact, it has got acquired lands for establishment of a university though it

is not entitled for the same. Therefore, he strongly submits that the

Foundation has played fraud on the State Government and fraud vitiates
                                  56


everything is the well settled principles of law.   In this regard, he has

placed strong reliance upon the decisions of the Apex Court in the cases

of Smt. Shrisht Dhawan Vs. Shaw Brothers, AIR 1992 SC 1555; S.P.

Chengalvarya Naidu (dead) by L.Rs. Vs. Jagannath (dead) by L.Rs.

&amp; Ors, reported in AIR 1994 SC 853; United India Insurance Co. Ltd.

Vs. Rajendra Singh &amp; Ors, (2000) 3 SCC 581; Ram Chandra Singh

Vs. Savitri Devi &amp; Ors., (2003) 8 SCC 319, and submits that there

cannot be any waiver or acquiescence by the land owners, in view of the

fact that there is violation of the fundamental rights and statutory rights

of the owners of the lands.. Therefore, he submits that the action of the

State Government is void ab-initio in law for the reason that acquisition of

lands in favour of non-existing University is a continuing wrong, which

can be challenged by the petitioners before this Court and this Court has

to examine the rights of the parties in exercise of its Judicial review

power, as the action of the State Government is a continuing wrong.

29.         Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner Mr. Jayant Das

further contends that Land Acquisition (Companies) Rules, 1963 is framed

pursuant to the amendment of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_320">Section 4</a> (1) of the Act by Act 38 of 1923

as acquisition of lands in favour of company is as provided under Chapter

VII of the L.A. Act read with the above Rules. Therefore, the procedure

contemplated under rule 4 should be complied with by the Collector and

the State Government before publication of          the notifications under

<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_321">section 4(1)</a> of the L.A. Act after giving consent by the State Government

to acquire the lands as required under <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_322">section 39</a> of the Act and thereafter

execution of agreement by the Company in favour of the State
                                   57


Government containing the terms and conditions as provided under

<a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_323">Section 41</a> of the L.A. Act and publishing the same in the official Gazette

as required under <a href="/doc/1409056/" id="a_324">section 42</a> of the L.A. Act which is the mandatory

procedure required to be followed, that is not complied with by the State

Government.    In the instant case, the requisition dated 23.6.2006 was

submitted to the State Government by Vedanta Foundation for acquisition

of vast tract of lands in the locality in question for     establishment of

Vedanta University in the acquired lands. There is no requisition by the

Anil Agarwal Foundation which is claimed to have converted as a public

company under <a href="/doc/501652/" id="a_325">section 25</a> of the Companies Act. The document

Annexure-14 obtained by the petitioners in W.P.(C) No. 10325 of 2009

under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_326">Information Act</a> from the Special Land Acquisition

Officer would clearly show that no enquiry was conducted as required

under Rule 4 of the Rules by the Collector of the Puri District in respect of

Anil Agarwal Foundation for the proposed establishment of Vedanta

University in the acquired lands. Therefore, it is contended by him that

enquiry by the Committee constituted under sub-rule (2) of Rule 3 of the

Companies Rules before or after issuance of the preliminary notifications

is not conducted by the Collector though it is mandatory in law as held by

the apex Court in the cases of Shanti Sports Club (supra) and City

Montessori School (supra).

30.         Another Senior Counsel Mr.Sanjit Mohanty appearing on

behalf of the Company in addition to the submissions made by Mr. Anil

Diwan, submits that <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_327">Section 39</a> of the L.A. Act consent has been given by

the State Government for acquisition of lands in its favour             after
                                   58


examining the purpose for which the lands were sought to be acquired, as

requested in its requisitions   and the Memorandum of the agreement as

required under <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_328">Section 41</a> of the L.A.Act was executed by it in favour of

the State Government and it has        also complied with the procedure

required to be followed as provided under rule 4 of the Rules.

31.         Mr. Mohanty, alternatively submits that there is no need for

the State Government to conduct an enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_329">section 5A</a> of the L.A.

Act, in the cases on hand as there was no objection statement filed by the

land owners except one petitioner and therefore there was no need for

the Collector and the State Government to follow the procedure as

provided under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_330">Section 5A</a>. He further contends that there is substantial

compliance of the rules 3 (2) and 4 of the Company Rules by the State

Government, as the Core Committee was appointed by it as provided in

sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_331">Section 40</a> of the L.A. Act for the purpose of conducting

enquiry as required under Part VII to submit its report to the State

Government regarding acquisition of lands in favour of the company. In

support of this contention, he has placed reliance upon the decisions of

the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1234253/" id="a_332">Talson Real Estate (P) Ltd. v. State

of Maharashtra</a>, (2007) 13 SCC 186. Therefore, he has prayed for

dismissal of the writ petitions of the owners contending that there is no

merit in their cases. So far as the writ petitions filed by the persons

claiming to be public spirited persons espousing the public cause seeking

to quash the acquisition proceedings are concerned, learned Senior

Counsel submits that the same are not maintainable in law for the reason

that similar writ petition No. 6981 of 2008 filed earlier by nine persons,
                                   59


viz. Prasanna Kumar Mishra, Dwarika Mohan Mishra, Kalandi Charan

Pradhan, Uma Charan Pradhan, Gagan Behari Pradhan, Aruna Chandra

Pradhan, Parsuram Pradhan, Rama Pradhan &amp; Sudarsan Gochhayat has

been dismissed by this Court vide its order dated 9.5.2008 and therefore

these PIL petitions are not maintainable at all.        Further it is contended

that neither public interest is affected nor public injury is caused to the

public at large nor Rule of Law is violated as alleged in the PIL writ

petitions and therefore prayed for dismissal of the same.

32.        After   careful   consideration   of   the    aforesaid   rival   legal

contentions, we are answering the points against the State Government

and the beneficiary company by assigning the following reasons.

33.        In Shanti Sports Club &amp; Anr. Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors.,

(2009) 15 SCC 705, the apex Court held as under with regard to the

procedure to be followed by the State Government to exercise its eminent

domain power to acquire the lands in favour of the beneficiary company :

              ―38. The decision to acquire the land for a public
          purpose is preceded by consideration of the matter at
          various levels of the Government. The Revenue
          Authorities conduct survey for determining the location
          and status of the land and feasibility of its acquisition
          for a public purpose. The final decision taken by the
          competent authority is then published in the Official
          Gazette in the form of a notification issued under
          <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_333">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act. Likewise, declaration made
          under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_334">Section 6</a> of the Act is published in the Official
          Gazette. The publication of notifications under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_335">Section
          4(1)</a> has twofold objectives. In the first place, it enables
          the landowner(s) to lodge objections against the
          proposed acquisition. Secondly, it forewarns the owners
          and other interested persons not to change the
          character of the land and, at the same time, make them
          aware that if they enter into any transaction with
          respect to the land proposed to be acquired, they will
          do so at their own peril. When the land is acquired on
          behalf of a company, consent of the appropriate
                                 60

         Government is a must. The company is also required to
         execute an agreement in terms of <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_336">Section 41</a> of the Act
         which is then published in the Official Gazette in terms
         of <a href="/doc/1409056/" id="a_337">Section 42</a> thereof. As a necessary concomitant, it
         must be held that the exercise of power by the
         Government under <a href="/doc/983800/" id="a_338">Section 48(1)</a> of the Act must be
         made known to the public at large so that those
         interested in accomplishment of the public purpose for
         which the land is acquired or the company concerned
         may      question    such    withdrawal     by   making
         representation to the higher authorities or by seeking
         court's intervention. If the decision of the Government
         to withdraw from the acquisition of land is kept secret
         and is not published in the Official Gazette, there is
         every likelihood that unscrupulous landowners, their
         agents and wheeler-dealers may pull strings in the
         power corridors and clandestinely get the land released
         from acquisition and thereby defeat the public purpose
         for which the land is acquired. Similarly, the company
         on whose behalf the land is acquired may suffer
         incalculable harm by unpublished decision of the
         Government to withdraw from the acquisition.‖


34.        <a href="/doc/1990262/" id="a_339">In City Montessori School v. State of U.P</a>.,(2009) 14 SCC
253 the apex Court held as under:


         ―13. The appellant is a private person. The notification
      under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_340">Section 4</a> and declaration in terms of <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_341">Section 6</a> of
      the Act were issued in terms of the provisions contained
      in Part VII of the Act.
         14. <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_342">Section 40</a> of the Act provides for an enquiry in
      the manner prescribed in the Rules framed under the Act
      known as the Land Acquisition (Companies) Rules, 1963.
      <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_343">The Act</a> makes a distinction between an acquisition made
      for a public purpose and an acquisition made for the
      benefit of a company. Acquisition made at the instance of
      a company must be done in strict compliance with the
      provisions contained in the Act and the Rules framed
      thereunder. <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_344">The Act</a> being an exproprietory legislation
      and particularly when resorted to for the benefit of a
      private person requires scrupulous satisfaction of the
      statutory requirements.
         15. <a href="/doc/165105/" id="a_345">In Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. v. Darius
      Shapur Chenai</a> it was held: (SCC p. 640, para 29)
          ―29. <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_346">The Act</a> is an expropriatory legislation. This Court
      in <a href="/doc/303515/" id="a_347">State of M.P. v. Vishnu Prasad Sharma</a> observed that
      in such a case the provisions of the statute should be
      strictly construed as it deprives a person of his land
      without consent. [See also <a href="/doc/212063/" id="a_348">Khub Chand v. State of
      Rajasthan</a> and <a href="/doc/1890409/" id="a_349">CCE v. Orient Fabrics (P) Ltd] There</a>
      cannot, therefore, be any doubt that in a case of this
                                   61

       nature due application of mind on the part of the
       statutory authority was imperative.‖
          16. <a href="/doc/557996/" id="a_350">In Devinder Singh v. State of Punjab</a> it was held:
       (SCC p. 743, para 43)
           ―43. Expropriatory legislation, as is well known, must
       be strictly construed. When the properties of a citizen are
       being compulsorily acquired by a State in exercise of its
       power of eminent domain, the essential ingredients
       thereof, namely, existence of a public purpose and
       payment of compensation are principal requisites
       therefore. In the case of acquisition of land for a private
       company, existence of a public purpose being not a
       requisite criterion, other statutory requirements call for
       strict compliance, being imperative in character.‖‖

35.         In view of the law laid down by the Apex Court in the above

referred cases, there is no substantial compliance of the provisions of the

L.A.Act and Rules, as contended by the learned Advocate General and

learned senior counsel Mr. Sanjit Mohanty. In the absence of the report

of the District Collector as required under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_351">section 5-A</a> of the L.A. Act or in

the absence of an enquiry under the above Companies Rules, report

submitted by the District Collector to the State Government without

following the procedure by forwarding the report to the Committee as

constituted under sub-rule (2) of Rule 3 by the State Government          as

mandated under rule 4 (4) of the Land Acquisition (Companies) Rules,

1963, no declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_352">section 6</a> that the proposed lands are required

for a public purpose should have been made by the State Government, as

it has not consulted the Statutory committee and not submitted           the

report under Rule 4 to the State Government.            The agreement as

provided under <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_353">section 41</a> of the L.A.Act is not executed by the Company

with the State Government agreeing to pay the compensation payable to

the owners/interested persons in respect of their lands sought to be
                                  62


acquired. For non-compliance with the said mandatory statutory legal

requirement on the part of the District Collector, Puri and the State

Government, the impugned notifications published under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_354">section 6</a> of the

L.A. Act declaring that the lands proposed in the preliminary notifications

are acquired in favour of the Foundation is void ab initio in law, for the

reason that the State Government was required to satisfy itself that the

proposed lands are in fact needed for a company. The State Government

should not have made such declaration unless the compensation to be

awarded to the owners of such proposed lands is to be paid by the

Company and deposited with the State Government. The opinion formed

by the State Government for declaration that the lands notified in the

preliminary notifications are needed for the company for establishment of

a University which was not in existence either under the Orissa

Universities Act or the <a href="/doc/535576/" id="a_355">University Grant Commission Act</a> at the time of

initiation of the proceedings or at the time of publishing the declaration

notifications under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_356">section 6</a>. Therefore, the satisfaction of the State

Government for acquisition of lands by issuing <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_357">section 6</a> notifications

declaring that the lands are needed for a non-existing University, has

violated the human rights of thousands of land owners. Therefore the

notifications are invalid and unconstitutional. Hence they are liable to be

quashed.

36.            Further the submission of Mr.Anil Diwan and Mr. Sanjit

Mohanty, learned counsel for the company that there was no need on the

part of the State Government to conduct an enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_358">section 5A</a> of

the L.A. Act, in the cases on hand as there was no objection statement
                                  63


filed by the land owners and therefore the owners have waived and

acquiesced their right regarding enquiry as contemplated therein is not at

all acceptable for the reason that the enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_359">Section 5-A</a> of the

L.A. Act is mandatory in nature, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

the case of <a href="/doc/1876512/" id="a_360">Farid Ahmed Abdul Samad v. Municipal Corpn. of the

City of Ahmedabad</a>, (1976) 3 SCC 719, which reads as under:

          "24. We are clearly of opinion that <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_361">Section 5-A</a> of the
          Land Acquisition Act is applicable in the matter of
          acquisition of land in this case and since no personal
          hearing had been given to the appellants by the
          Commissioner with regard to their written objections
          the order of acquisition and the resultant confirmation
          order of the State Government with respect to the land
          of the appellants are invalid under the law and the
          same are quashed. It should be pointed out, it is not a
          case of failure of the Rules of natural justice as such as
          appeared to be the only concern of the High Court and
          also of the city civil court. It is a case of absolute non-
          compliance with a mandatory provision under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_362">Section
          5-A</a> of the Land Acquisition Act which is clearly
          applicable in the matter of acquisition under the
          Bombay Act.‖      (Emphasis supplied)


37.        In the case of <a href="/doc/500723/" id="a_363">Shri Mandir Sita Ramji v. Lt. Governor of

Delhi</a>, (1975) 4 SCC 298, the Supreme Court has held that :

          "5. The learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition
          on the basis that the appellant had no opportunity of
          being heard by the Collector under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_364">Section 5-A</a>. The
          duty to afford such an opportunity is mandatory. A
          decision by the Government on the objection, when the
          Collector afforded no opportunity of being heard to the
          objector, would not be proper. The power to hear the
          objection under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_365">Section 5-A</a> is that of the Collector and
          not of the appropriate Government. It is no doubt true
          that the recommendation of the Land Acquisition
          Collector is not binding on the Government. The
          Government may choose either to accept the
          recommendation or to reject it; but the requirement of
          the section is that when a person's property is proposed
          to be acquired, he must be given an opportunity to
          show cause against it. Merely because the Government
          may not choose to accept the recommendation of the
          Land Acquisition Collector, even when he makes one, it
                                 64

          cannot be said that he need not make the
          recommendation at all but leave it to the Government
          to decide the matter. In other words, the fact that the
          Collector is not the authority to decide the objection
          does not exonerate him from his duty to hear the
          objector    on    the   objection   and    make     the
          recommendation.‖      (emphasis supplied)

38.         In the case of <a href="/doc/1943463/" id="a_366">Tej Kaur v. State of Punjab</a>, (2003) 4 SCC

485, the Supreme Court placing reliance upon its earlier decision held as

under

           "5. Similarly, in the decision in <a href="/doc/1003330/" id="a_367">Shyam Nandan Prasad
           v. State of Bihar</a> this Court observed that affording of
           opportunity of being heard to the objector during
           inquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_368">Section 5-A</a> is a must and that this
           provision embodies a just and wholesome principle
           that a person whose property is being, or is intended
           to be, acquired, should have occasion to persuade the
           authorities concerned that his property be not touched
           for acquisition.‖

39.         The apex Court had also occasion to consider similar question

in the case of <a href="/doc/768110/" id="a_369">Babu Ram and another v. State of Haryana and Anr</a>.,

(2009) 10 SCC 115. It is profitable to quote what the apex Court

observed in the aforesaid case which reads under :

             ―30. As indicated hereinabove in the various cases
           cited by Mr. Pradip Ghosh and, in particular, the
           decision in Krishnan Lal Arneja case, in which reference
           has been made to the observations made by this Court
           in Om Prakash case, it has been emphasized that a
           right under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_370">Section 5-A</a> is not merely statutory but also
           has the flavour of fundamental rights under Articles 14
           and 19 of the Constitution. Such observations had been
           made in reference to an observation made in the earlier
           decision in Gurdial Singh case and keeping in mind the
           fact that right to property was no longer a fundamental
           right, an observation was made that even if the right to
           property was no longer a fundamental right, the
           observations relating to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_371">Article 14</a> would continue to
           apply in full force with regard to <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_372">Section 5-A</a> of the L.A.
           Act.‖
                                     (Emphasis supplied)
                                  65



40.         By non-filing of the statement of objections, the land owners

have waived their right as urged by the learned Advocate General and

Senior Counsel Mr. Sanjit Mohanty on behalf of the State Government and

the beneficiary company respectively and their submissions are wholly

untenable in law for the reason that the alleged waiver of their statutory

rights would amount to violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under

Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution, as the right under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_373">section 5A</a>

of the L.A.Act is not merely statutory but also has the flavour of

fundamental rights and such right is elevated to the status of human

rights in view of the interpretation made by the apex Curt in the aforesaid

judgment and to this effect law has been laid down in the case of <a href="/doc/501542/" id="a_374">Delhi

Administration v. Gurdip Singh Uban</a>, (2000) 7 SCC 296, the relevant

paragraph from the above decision is extracted as hereunder:

                   ―53. Now objection under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_375">Section 5-A</a>, if filed, can
           relate to the contention that (i) the purpose for which
           land is being acquired is not a public purpose, (ii) that
           even if the purpose is a public purpose, the land of the
           objector is not necessary, in the sense that the public
           purpose could be served by other land already proposed
           or some other land to which the objector may refer, or
           (iii) that in any event, even if this land is necessary for
           the public purpose, the special fact-situation in which
           the objector is placed, it is a fit case for omitting his
           land from the acquisition. Objection (ii) is personal to
           the land and Objection (iii) is personal to the objector.
                  54. Now in the (ii) and (iii) types of objections,
           thee is a personal element which has to be pleaded in
           <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_376">Section 5-A</a> inquiry and if objections have not been
           filed, the notification must be conclusive proof that the
           said person had ‗waived' all objections which were
           personal and which he could have raised. However, so
           far as Objection (i) is concerned, even in case
           objections are not filed, the affected party can challenge
           in Court that the purpose was not a public purpose.‖
                                             (Emphasis supplied)
                                 66



           Further, for non-compliance of the statutory provisions of

Sections 39, 40, 41, 42 and 44B of Part VII of the L.A. Act and Rule 4 of

the Land Acquisition (Companies) Rules, 1963 by the State Government

this Court has to exercise its judicial review power to quash the

notifications. The MOU has been signed on behalf of Anil Agarwal

Foundation by Mr.A.K.Samal, Vice President. He is not the competent

person as the company must be represented by either is Principal Officer

or officer specially authorized by the Board of Directors. The said

memorandum of understanding is also not in compliance with sub-

sections (1) to (4) and (4A) of <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_377">Section 41</a> agreeing for the terms as

provided in the aforesaid provisions. Therefore, it is not an agreement in

terms of <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_378">section 41</a> and the same is not published as required under

<a href="/doc/1409056/" id="a_379">section 42</a> of the L.A.Act. The Collector has also not been duly authorized

by way of notification as required in law to represent the Governor on

behalf of the State. No such notification is available on record in this

regard and the agreement does not validate the preliminary notifications

issued in between 13.12.2006 to 22.12.2006 and consequently the

declaration notifications are also bad in law. Therefore, the learned Sr.

Counsel on behalf of the petitioners have rightly requested this Court to

quash the notifications, as the same are published by the State

Government in flagrant violation of the Statutory provisions of Chapter

VII of the L.A.Act &amp; Rules 3 &amp; 4 of the Rules. From the perusal of the

records produced by the State Government, it appears that except in

respect of four land owners, the political executive passed order
                                 67


overruling the objections in respect of three and in respect of one person

accepting the same. The files do not disclose that the political executive

has applied its mind and granted approval as required under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_380">section 6</a>

declaration notification declaring the proposed lands in favour of the

beneficiary company for establishment of University.

41.        In this regard it would further be appropriate for us to advert

to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/281133/" id="a_381">Srinivasa Coop.

House Building Society Ltd. v. Madam Gurumurthy Sastry</a>, (1994)

4 SCC 675, wherein the Court has held as under :

           ―4. <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_382">The Act</a> recognises dichotomy, namely, acquisition
           for a public purpose in Chapter II and acquisition for a
           private purpose of a type restricted in Chapter VII.
           There is no provision in the Act to say that when a land
           is required for a company, it may also be for a public
           purpose. Therefore, if a company, namely a Cooperative
           Society registered under the Central or <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_383">State
           Cooperative Societies Act</a>, preceding 1984 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_384">Amendment
           Act</a>, had to acquire the land it had to do so in strict
           compliance with Chapter VII. If the company,
           (Cooperative Society) requires land for any purpose
           other than those mentioned in <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_385">Section 40</a>, then no
           compulsory acquisition under the Act is possible. Part
           VII nowhere authorises the Government to apply the
           provision of that part to private acquisition. A.P. State
           Amendment Act expressly included acquisition for
           providing house sites for the poor; for the execution of
           any housing scheme under A.P. Housing Boards Act;
           godowns for a cooperative society as for public and
           urgent purposes. By necessary implication the
           acquisition for a Private Cooperative House Building
           Society to construct houses for its members must be a
           private purpose.
           8. Explanation.-- ‗Private company' and ‗Government
           company' shall have the meanings respectively assigned
           to them in the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_386">Companies Act</a>, 1956 (1 of 1956). A plain
           reading of the fascicule of these provisions clearly
           indicates the distinction, statute has envisaged, namely,
           acquisition for a public purpose and acquisition for a
           private purpose. Even the acquisition for a company,
           unless utilization of the land so acquired is integrally
           connected with public use, resort to the compulsory
                                 68


           acquisition under Chapter VII cannot be had. Even when
           Chapter VII was invoked, the requirements of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_387">Section
           40</a> and <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_388">Section 41</a> are mandatory and shall be strictly
           complied with. It is clearly discernible from scheme of
           the acquisition in Chapter VII that the land can be
           acquired for the erection of dwelling-houses for
           workmen employed by the company or for the
           provisions of amenities directly connected therewith or
           needed for the construction of some building or work for
           a company which is engaged or is taking steps for
           engaging itself in any industry or work which is for a
           public purpose or is needed for the construction of some
           work which is likely to prove useful to the public.
           Notwithstanding anything contained in the Act, i.e.,
           despite the compliance with Chapter VII, no land should
           be acquired under Chapter VII except for the purpose
           mentioned in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_389">Section
           40</a>, for a private company which is not a Government
           company and that such company shall not be entitled
           after the acquisition under Chapter VII to transfer the
           said land or any part thereof by sale, mortgage, gift,
           lease or otherwise except with the previous sanction of
           the appropriate Government. The object, therefore,
           appears to be that the land acquired under Chapter VII
           shall always remain to serve the public purpose,
           beneficial to the public. It is not open to the
           Government to waive any of the provisions in Part VII.
           The provisions contained therein have mandatory
           operation. The object of <a href="/doc/169272333/" id="a_390">Sections 44-A</a> and <a href="/doc/1554208/" id="a_391">44-B</a>
           appears to be that they intend to safeguard public
           interest. The company acquiring the land for a public
           purpose in Chapter VII may, after the acquisition has
           become final, divert the land for private profit motive,
           defeating the purported public purpose for which the
           acquisition was made. The Government company
           obviously does not alienate such property for private
           gain since the profits merge into public fund. While the
           private company could get acquisition but thereafter
           become free to dispose of the property. Therefore, the
           acquisition for a private company get limited only for
           purposes envisaged under <a href="/doc/139114158/" id="a_392">Section 40(1)(a)</a> and thereby
           the public purposes envisaged therein get safeguarded
           and protected. The dominant purpose of public utility
           pervades the provisions in Chapter VII of the Act.‖
                         (emphasis added).

42.        It is seen that issuance of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_393">section 4</a> (1) notifications in favour

of the beneficiary company was made on the basis of the requisition made

by Vedanta Foundation but not Anil Agarwal Foundation which is the
                                   69


beneficiary Company. It is an undisputed fact that Vedanta Company was

converted into Sterlite Foundation and thereafter in the year 2006 before

the acquisition proceedings were sought to be initiated, it claimed that it

has converted into Anil Agarwal Foundation as a public company under

<a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_394">section 25</a> of the Act, is the case sought to be made out on behalf of the

beneficiary company to justify the impugned notifications. Therefore, the

initiation of the proceedings by issuance of notifications under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_395">section 4</a>

(1) of the L.A.Act was made stating that the proposed lands are needed

by the company for establishment of Vedanta University which is not in

existence either under the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_396">State Universities Act</a> or the U.G.C.Act and

therefore the purpose for which the proposed acquisition of lands was

made by issuing preliminary notifications is bad in law. The fact of non-

existence of the University is evident from the Ordinance promulgated by

the State Government as on the date of initiation of the acquisition

proceedings. Hence, the publication of the <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_397">section 4</a> (1) preliminary

notifications proposing to acquire the lands in question is void ab initio in

law. The publication of the said notifications is also void ab initio for one

more strong reason, namely, that the Company in favour of which the

lands were sought for acquisition according to the State Government and

the beneficiary company is a public company converted under <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_398">section 25</a>

of the Act, 1956. The acquisition of lands for establishment of University,

which is for educational purpose is permissible under <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_399">section 3</a> (f)(vi) of

the Act only in respect of educational scheme sponsored by the

Government, or by any authority established by Government for carrying

out any such scheme, or with the prior approval of the appropriate
                                    70


Government, by a local authority, or a society registered under the

<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_400">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860, or under any corresponding law for the

time being in force in a State or a co-operative society within the meaning

of any law relating to co-operative societies for the time being in force in

any State. Therefore the provision of        <a href="/doc/1554208/" id="a_401">section 44-B</a> of the L.A.Act is

attracted to the facts of this case for the reason that we have already

answered the point no.1 against the company by recording reasons in the

judgment holding that it is not a public company and it has continued as a

private limited guarantee company. The said finding is on the basis of

undisputed fact that the beneficiary company does not have share capital

and it was registered as a private limited guarantee company and the

same cannot be converted as a public company under <a href="/doc/158228882/" id="a_402">section 25</a> of the

Act. Therefore, the acquisition of lands for a private company by the State

Government under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_403">L.A. Act</a> is not permissible except

for the purpose as mentioned in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_404">Section

40</a> of the Act as stated under <a href="/doc/1554208/" id="a_405">section 44-B</a> of the L.A.Act. <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_406">Section 40</a> (1)

clause (a) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_407">L.A. Act</a> provides for acquisition of lands in favour of the

company for the erection of dwelling houses for workmen employed by

the company or for the provision of amenities directly connected

therewith. The acquisition of lands in favour of the beneficiary company

undisputedly is not for the aforesaid purpose. Therefore, the initiation of

the proceedings from the beginning by the State Government under

<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_408">section 4(1)</a> of the L.A. Act, by itself is void ab initio in law as the same is

in flagrant violation of <a href="/doc/1554208/" id="a_409">Section 44B</a> of the L.A.Act. Further previous

consent given by the State Government without complying with the
                                   71


mandatory requirement of Rule 4 of the Rules in not conducting an

inquiry by the District Collector for the reason that according to the State

Government it is not required is the legal contention urged, the same is

reiterated by the beneficiary company, which contention of them is wholly

untenable in law    for the reason that <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_410">Section 39</a> of the L.A.Act clearly

contemplates that previous consent of the State Government is required

to put the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_411">Land Acquisition Act</a> in force in order to acquire lands for any

company, i.e., including a private company before publishing Section 4(1)

Notifications. Learned Senior Counsel Mr.Jayant Das on behalf of the

petitioners has rightly rebutted the said legal contention by aptly placing

strong reliance upon <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_412">Section 4</a> (1) amendment of the L.A.Act by including

the phrase ―or for a company‖ which was inserted by Act 38 of 1923

under <a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_413">Section 2</a> (o) of the amendment Act. The above said contention of

the learned Senior Counsel has to be accepted for the reason that the

interpretation made by him by placing reliance upon the phrase ―or for a

company‖ inserted by <a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_414">Section 2</a> (o) of the Act 38 of 1923 is tenable in

law. If the interpretation sought to be made by the learned Advocate

General and the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the beneficiary

company that <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_415">Section 4</a> is not mentioned in <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_416">Section 39</a> of the Act iand

that the previous consent of the State Government prior to publishing the

<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_417">Section 4(1)</a> notification is not required is accepted, then it would render

<a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_418">section 39</a> and Part VII of the L.A.Act read with rules 3 and 4 of the Rules

otiose or redundant. That is not the object of the legislature in introducing

Part VII relating to procedure to be followed for acquisition of land in

favour of a company. In view of the said amendment, <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_419">Section 39</a> must
                                  72


be read harmoniously with <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_420">Section 4</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_421">L.A. Act</a> read with the

Company Rules to give purposeful interpretation to achieve the object of

the L.A.Act. In the absence of non mention of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_422">section 4</a> of the Act in the

said provision of <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_423">Section 39</a> of the L.A. Act, the provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_424">Land

Acquisition Act</a> including <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_425">sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/562722/" id="a_426">16</a> should be read into the said

provision to put the provisions of the L.A.Act in force in order to acquire

lands for any company by following the mandatory provisions of Part VII

of the L.A.Act read with the Land Acquisition (Companies) Rules. The said

interpretation of the provision of <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_427">Section 39</a> of the L.A.Act would be

harmonious to achieve the object and intendment of the provisions of Part

VII of the L.A.Act. Further, the object of framing such rules by the Central

Government in exercise of its power under <a href="/doc/1061397/" id="a_428">section 55</a> of the Act is for the

purpose of carrying out the purposes of the provisions of Part VII of the

L.A. Act and such rules are made for the guidance of the State

Government and the officers of the Central Government and of the State

Government to give effect to the provisions of the L.A.Act. As could be

seen from the Rules, the sole object of framing such rules is to comply

with the provisions of Part VII of the Land Acquisition Act by following

strictly the procedure contemplated therein as the same is held to be

mandatory by the apex Court in number of decisions viz. Narinderjit

Singh Vs. State of U.P., (1973) 1 SCC 157; State of Mysore Vs.

Abdul Razad Sahib, (1973) 3 SCC 196; General Govt. Servants

Cooperative Housing Society Ltd. Vs. Sh. Wahab Uddin &amp; Ors.,

(1981) 2 SCC 352; The Collector (District Magistrate) &amp; Anr. Vs.

Raja Ram Jaiswal, AIR 1985 SC 1622; Mohan Singh &amp; Ors.
                                   73


International Airport Authority of India &amp; Ors., (1997) 9 SCC 132.,

To acquire land in favour of company, under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_429">Land Acquisition Act</a> at

its instance the State Government is required to find out (i) whether the

company has made its best endeavour to find out lands in the locality for

the purpose of acquisition, (ii) that the company has made all reasonable

efforts to get such lands by negotiation with the persons interested

therein on payment of reasonable price and such negotiations have failed,

(iii) that the land proposed to be acquired is suitable for the purpose and

(iv) that the area of land proposed to be acquired is not excessive. Sub-

rule (2) of rule 4 provides that the Collector after giving reasonable

opportunity to the company to make any representation hold an enquiry

into the matters referred to in sub-rule (1) clauses (i) to (iv) of the Rule 4

referred to above. Further it is the duty of the Collector, if the lands

proposed to be acquired are agricultural lands, to consult the Senior

Agricultural Officer of the district whether or not such lands are good

agricultural lands and also determine having regard to the provisions of

<a href="/doc/31609/" id="a_430">Sections 23</a> and <a href="/doc/1485112/" id="a_431">24</a> of the L.A. Act the approximate amount of

compensation likely to be payable in respect of the land which in the

opinion of the Collector should be acquired for the company. Sub-rule (3)

of Rule 4 contemplates that the Collector after holding the enquiry under

sub-rule (2) of the Rule 4 shall submit the report to the State

Government and a copy of the same shall be forwarded by the

Government to the Committee constituted under rule 3 (2) of the Rules.

Under sub-rule (4) of Rule 4 it is the bounden duty of the State

Government before declaring that the proposed lands in the preliminary
                                  74


notifications are required for the beneficiary Company by publishing the

notifications under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_432">section 6</a> of the L.A.Act to consult the Committee and

also consider the report submitted by the District Collector under sub-rule

(3) of rule 4 and the report, if any, submitted under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_433">section 5-A</a> of the Act

and that the agreement under <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_434">section 41</a> of the Act has been executed by

the Company. In the instant case undisputedly, the agreement is

executed by the beneficiary company in favour of the State Government

not incorporating all the terms and conditions as provided under sub-

sections (1) to (5) of <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_435">Section 41</a> of the L.A.Act     and the same is not

published as required under <a href="/doc/1409056/" id="a_436">section 42</a> of the Act. The State Government

is required to be satisfied with the report, if any, of the Collector under

<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_437">Section 5-A</a>, sub-section (2), or on the report of the officer making an

enquiry under <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_438">section 40</a> before publishing the final notifications under

<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_439">Section 6</a> of the L.A.Act that the proposed acquisition of lands is for the

purposes referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_440">Section 40</a> and

require the company to enter into an agreement with the State

Government as required under <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_441">section 41</a> for the matters, i.e.(1) the

payment to the State Government of the cost of the acquisition, (2) the

transfer, on such payment, of the land to the company and (3) the terms

on which the lands shall be held by the company. In the absence of such

agreement published by the State Government under <a href="/doc/1409056/" id="a_442">section 42</a>, as soon

as may be after its execution by the beneficiary company, the publication

of <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_443">section 6</a> notifications declaring that the proposed lands are required

for the beneficiary Company is void ab initio in law. In this regard it is

necessary for us to extract the relevant paragraphs 31 and 32 from the
                                   75


decision of the Apex Court in the case of Babu Verghese &amp; Ors Vs. Bar

Council of Kerala &amp; Ors, reported in AIR 1999 SC 1281 in support of

the legal contention that ―where a power is given to do a certain thing in

a certain way, the thing must be done in that way or not at all‖. The

above said paragraphs are extracted in support of the conclusions and

reasons assigned by us.

                ―31. It is the basic principle of law long settled that
            if the manner of doing a particular act is prescribed
            under any statute, the act must be done in that
            manner or not at all. The origin of this rule is traceable
            to the decision in Taylor v. Taylor,(1875) 1 Ch D 426
            which was followed by Lord Roche in <a href="/doc/1107594/" id="a_444">Nazir Ahmad v.
            King Empero</a>,63 Ind App 372:AIR 1936 PC 253 who
            stated as under:
               ―Where a power is given to do a certain thing in a
            certain way, the thing must be done in that way or not
            at all.‖
               32. This rule has since been approved by this Court
            in <a href="/doc/1786180/" id="a_445">Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh v. State of Vindhya
            Pradesh</a>, 1954 SCR 1098: AIR 1954 SC 322 and again
            in <a href="/doc/794815/" id="a_446">Deep Chand v. State of Rajasthan</a>, (1962) 1 SCR
            662:AIR 1961 SC 1527. These cases were considered
            by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/407511/" id="a_447">State of U.P.
            v. Singhara Singh</a>, AIR 1964 SC 3581964) 1 SCWR 57
            and the rule laid down in Nazir Ahmad case was again
            upheld. This rule has since been applied to the
            exercise of jurisdiction by courts and has also been
            recognised as a salutary principle of administrative
            law.‖


43.         It is also profitable to notice what the apex Court held on the

proposition of law in the case of <a href="/doc/791131/" id="a_448">Chairman, Indore Vikas Pradhikaran

v. Pure Industrial Coke &amp; Chemicals Ltd. And others</a>, (2007) 8 SCC

705 by referring to its earlier large number of decisions:


         ―58. Expropriatory legislation, as is well-known, must be
         given a strict construction.
                        76

59. <a href="/doc/165105/" id="a_449">In Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. v. Darius Shapur
Chenai</a>,(2005) 7 SCC 627 construing <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_450">Section 5-A</a> of the
Land Acquisition Act, this Court observed:
    ―6. It is not in dispute that <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_451">Section 5-A</a> of the Act
    confers a valuable right in favour of a person whose
    lands are sought to be acquired. Having regard to
    the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_452">Article 300-A</a> of the
    Constitution, the State in exercise of its power of
    ‗eminent domain' may interfere with the right of
    property of a person by acquiring the same but the
    same must be for a public purpose and reasonable
    compensation therefor must be paid.
It was further stated: (SCC p. 640, para 29)
    ―29. <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_453">The Act</a> is an expropriatory legislation. This
    Court in <a href="/doc/303515/" id="a_454">State of M.P. v. Vishnu Prasad Sharma10</a>
    observed that in such a case the provisions of the
    statute should be strictly construed as it deprives a
    person of his land without consent. [See also <a href="/doc/212063/" id="a_455">Khub
    Chand v. State of Rajasthan</a>,AIRF 1967 SC 1074
    and <a href="/doc/1890409/" id="a_456">CCE v. Orient Fabrics (P) Ltd</a>. (2004) 1 SCC
    597
    There cannot, therefore, be any doubt that in a
    case of this nature due application of mind on the
    part of the statutory authority was imperative.‖
<a href="/doc/1422834/" id="a_457">In State of Rajasthan v. Basant Nahata</a>,(2005) 12 SCC 77
it was opined: (SCC p.102, para     59)
    ―In absence of any substantive provisions contained
    in a parliamentary or legislative act, he cannot be
    refrained from dealing with his property in any
    manner he likes. Such statutory interdict would be
    opposed to one's right of property as envisaged
    under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_458">Article 300-A</a> of the Constitution.‖
<a href="/doc/940100/" id="a_459">In State of U.P. v. Manohar</a>, (2005) 2 SCC 126 a
Constitution Bench of this Court held: (SCC p.129, paras 7-

    ―7. Ours is a constitutional democracy and the
    rights available to the citizens are declared by the
    Constitution. Although <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_460">Article 19(1)(f)</a> was deleted
    by the Forty-fourth Amendment to the Constitution,
    <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_461">Article 300-A</a> has been placed in the Constitution,
    which reads as follows:
    ‗300-A. Persons not to be deprived of property save
    by authority of law.--No person shall be deprived of
    his property save by authority of law.'
    8. This is a case where we find utter lack of legal
    authority for deprivation of the respondent's</pre>

    authorities.‖

<a href="/doc/1515136/" id="a_462">In Jilubhai Nanbhai Khachar v. State of Gujarat</a>,1995 Supp
(1) SCC 596 the law is stated in the following terms: (SCC
p. 622, para 34)
    ―34. The right of eminent domain is the right of the
    sovereign State, through its regular agencies, to
    reassert, either temporarily or permanently, its
    dominion over any portion of the soil of the State
    including private property without its owner's
    consent on account of public exigency and for the
    public good. Eminent domain is the highest and
    most exact idea of property remaining in the
    Government, or in the aggregate body of the
    people in their sovereign capacity. It gives the right
    to resume possession of the property in the manner
    directed by the Constitution and the laws of the
    State, whenever the public interest requires it. The
    term ‗expropriation' is practically synonymous with
    the term ‗eminent domain.‖
It was further observed: (SCC p. 627, para 48)
    ―48. The word ‗property' used in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_463">Article 300-A</a> must
    be understood in the context in which the sovereign
    power of eminent domain is exercised by the State
    and property expropriated. No abstract principles
    could be laid. Each case must be considered in the
    light of its own facts and setting. The phrase
    ‗deprivation of the property of a person' must
    equally be considered in the fact situation of a
    case. Deprivation connotes different concepts.
    <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_464">Article 300-A</a> gets attracted to an acquisition or
    taking possession of private property, by necessary
    implication for public purpose, in accordance with
    the law made by Parliament or a State Legislature,
    a rule or a statutory order having force of law. It is
    inherent in every sovereign State by exercising its
    power of eminent domain to expropriate private
    property without owner's consent. Prima facie,
    State would be the judge to decide whether a
    purpose is a public purpose. But it is not the sole
    judge. This will be subject to judicial review and it
    is the duty of the court to determine whether a
    particular purpose is a public purpose or not. Public
    interest has always been considered to be an
    essential ingredient of public purpose. But every
    public purpose does not fall under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_465">Article 300-A</a> nor
    every exercise of eminent domain an acquisition or
    taking possession under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_466">Article 300-A.</a> Generally
    speaking preservation of public health or
    prevention of damage to life and property are
    considered to be public purposes. Yet deprivation of
    property for any such purpose would not amount to
    acquisition or possession taken under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_467">Article 300-A.</a>
    It would be by exercise of the police power of the

             powers of the State that no person shall be
             deprived of his property save by authority of law.
             There has to be no deprivation without any
             sanction of law. Deprivation by any other mode is
             not acquisition or taking possession under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_469">Article
             300-A.</a> In other words, if there is no law, there is
             no deprivation. Acquisition of mines, minerals and

</p><p id="p_2">44.         In view of the above legal position laid down by the Apex

Court of which relevant paragraphs have been extracted by us, the legal

contention urged by the learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the

petitioners that after the preliminary notifications are published enquiry is

necessary either under Rule 4 by the District Collector or under <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_471">Section

40</a> sub-section (3) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_472">L.A. Act</a> by the enquiry officer appointed by the

State Government as provided under sub- section (2) of <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_473">Section 40</a>, and

it is mandatory in law, must be accepted by this court by rejecting the

submissions made by the learned Advocate General and Senior Counsel

on behalf of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_3">45.        The aforesaid decisions of the Apex Court which have been

dealt with by us and relevant paragraphs of which are extracted upon

which reliance has been rightly placed by the learned Senior Counsel on

behalf of the petitioners and, therefore, the same must be accepted as

the legal principles laid down in those cases aptly apply to the fact

situation. For the reasons stated supra, the reliance placed by the learned

Advocate General and Senior Counsel for the Company               upon the

decisions of the Apex Court in the case of Vijay Cotton &amp; Oil Mills Ltd.

Vs. State of Gujarat, reported in (1969) 2 SCR 60, in the case of State

of Rajasthan &amp; Ors. Vrs. D.R. Laxmi &amp; Ors., reported in (1996) 6 SCC
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  79</span>


445 and in the case of Swaika Properties (P) Ltd. &amp; Anr. Vs. State of

Rajasthan &amp; Ors., reported in (2008) 4 SCC 695 stating that the

procedure as contemplated under Rules 3(2)         and 4 of the Company

Rules to be followed by the Collector and the State Government is not

mandatory    is   misplaced   and   further   reliance   placed   upon   the

observations made by the three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in the

case of Swasthya Raksha Samiti Rati Chowk Vs. Chaudhary Ram

Harakh Chand &amp; Ors., (supra) is also misplaced as the Apex Court has

referred the matter to the larger Bench. By careful reading of paragraphs

5 and 6 of the aforesaid judgment, it is noticed that the reason for

reference to larger Bench is for non-consideration of the Constitution

Bench decision in Babu Barkya (supra) wherein the Constitution Bench

indicated that all the requirements of Part VII of the Act especially

<a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_474">Section 40</a> could be considered in <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_475">Section 5A</a> enquiry itself which would

include all and any objection of the land owners including the objection in

regard to acquisition in favour of a company. Having made that

observation further at paragraph 6, the apex Court was of the opinion

that the objections that could possibly be raised in Rule (4) enquiry can

also be raised in a <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_476">Section 5A</a> enquiry and in the absence of any specific

requirement in Rule (4) as to the issuance of notice to the land owners of

being heard in such an enquiry hearing the land owners at the stage of

Rule (4) enquiry would lead only to duplication and cause delay. Having

made such observation, the said Bench referred the matter to the larger

Bench. While referring to the larger Bench it has not noticed the

Constitution Bench decision in the case of <a href="/doc/141161929/" id="a_477">State of U.P. &amp; ors. vs.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   80</span>


Manohar</a>, reported in (2005) 2 SCC 126 which was decided on

15.12.2004 and was very much available for consideration. In the said

decision, the Constitution Bench clearly enunciated the law that after

deletion of <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_478">Article 19(1)(f)</a> by 44th amendment to the Constitution and

insertion of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_479">Article 300A</a>, no person shall be deprived of his property save

by authority of law which means that Rule (4) enquiry must be strictly

adhered to and further what objections could be taken in Rule (4) enquiry

can also be raised under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_480">section 5A</a> enquiry is the observation of the

Constitution Bench in Babu Barkya (supra). In the instant case no such 5-

A enquiry is also held. Therefore, reliance placed upon the three Judge

Bench decision in Swasthya Raksha Samiti (supra) by the learned

Advocate General and senior counsel for the State Government and the

beneficiary Company is misplaced. Apart from the said legal position, the

apex Court in the <a href="/doc/1802196/" id="a_481">Case of Babu Verghese &amp; others v. Bar Council</a> of kerala

(supra) after referring to its earlier decision and Privy Council decisions at

paragraphs 31 and 32 extracted earlier has clearly laid down the law that

the procedure laid down in the Statute must be strictly adhered to

otherwise the action is void ab initio in law. Therefore, we have to accept

the legal contention urged on behalf of the petitioners as the same is well

founded in view of the mandatory provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_482">L.A. Act</a>, Rules,

Principles of natural justice and the Constitution Bench decisions of the

Apex Court and other decisions referred to above by us upon which

reliance has rightly been placed by the learned Senior Counsel on behalf

of the petitioners.

</p><p id="p_5">46.         Since the action of the State Government entailed serious

civil consequences to the land owners, the principles of natural justice

should have been complied with even though the owners did not file their

objections within 30 days from the date of service of notice along with the

preliminary notification upon them. This view of ours is supported by the

decisions of the seven Judge Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in the

case of Maneka Gandhi Vs. Union of India, AIR 1978 SC 597 vide

paragraphs 57, 58 and 61, which read as under:

            mandates that no one shall be condemned unheard, is
            part of the rules of natural justice. In fact, there are two

</p><p id="p_8">48.          Even accepting for the sake of argument the contention urged

on behalf of the State and the beneficiary company that by non-filing of

statement of objections the land owners whose lands have been acquired

have waived and acquiesced their rights and have lost their statutory

right of hearing and, therefore, there was no statutory obligation on the

part of the Collector to conduct an enquiry, then the State Government

was required to give its previous consent as required under <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_491">section 39</a> in

favour of the Company and got the agreement executed by the company

in favour of the State Government and thereafter the mandatory

procedure as provided under rule 3(2) and rules 4 (1) to (3) was required

to be complied with by the District Collector in conducting the enquiry and

thereafter   his   report   should   have   been   submitted   to   the   State

Government who in its turn should have sent the same to the Committee

seeking their views in the matter before the exercise of the statutory

power by the State Government under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_492">section 6</a> of the L.A.Act to declare

that the proposed lands are      acquired for the benefit of the beneficiary

company by publishing the notifications. Undisputedly, this requirement

of law has not been fulfilled by the State Government as could be seen

from the information furnished to one of the petitioners under the Right

to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_493">Information Act</a>. <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_494">Section 6</a> provides for declaration by the State

Government which is subject to the provisions of Part VII of the Act after

the State Government is satisfied considering the report, if any, made

under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_495">section 5-A</a> sub-section (2) that the land is needed for a company

is held not mandatory then that would be in contravention of the

provisions of Part VII of the L.A. Act. The Central Government in exercise
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   83</span>


of the statutory power under <a href="/doc/1061397/" id="a_496">section 55</a> has framed the rules called the

Land Acquisition (Companies) Rules referred to supra for carrying out the

purposes of Part VII of the L.A. Act giving guidance to the State

Government and officers after following the procedure as provided in the

second proviso to the said provision the publication of <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_497">Section 6</a> of the

L.A.Act should have been made by the State Government. The rules

framed by the Central Government for the purpose of carrying out the

purpose of Part VII shall be held as mandatory for the reason that the

statutory rights, fundamental and constitutional rights of the land owners

will be taken away by the State Government in exercise of its eminent

domain power in acquiring their lands. Therefore, the seven Judge Bench

in Maneka Gandhi's case has rightly held that if any action of the State

Government or authority entails civil consequences even in the absence

of the statutory provision of hearing, principles of natural justice shall be

read into the statute. In this view of the matter and also for the reason

stated in <a href="/doc/1183388/" id="a_498">Section 5-A(2)</a> and rule 4 of the Rules and the decisions of the

Supreme Court with regard to conduct of enquiry and submission of

report,   reasonable opportunity should have been given to the land

owners and the same should have been         strictly followed by the State

Government or its officers. Therefore, the action of the State Government

in not following the mandatory procedure as provided in the statutory

provisions under <a href="/doc/1183388/" id="a_499">section 5-A(2)</a> or the Rules 3 and 4 has rendered the

action of the State Government void ab initio in law. For the aforesaid

reasons, the reliance placed both by learned Senior Counsel Shri Anil

Diwan and Shri Sanjit Mohanty on the observation made by the apex
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  84</span>


Court in the case of Swasthya Raksha Samiti Rati Chowk Vs.

Chaudhary Ram Harakh Chand,            (supra) in paras 5 &amp; 6 is not

applicable to the fact situation. Therefore, the contention urged on this

behalf by them is liable to be rejected. Accordingly, the same is

rejectedby accepting the legal submission of the learned Sr.Counsel on

behalf of the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_9">49.         The contention urged by learned Advocate General for the

State and Mr.Anil Diwan, learned counsel on behalf of the beneficiary

company that by not filing the objections to the preliminary notifications

proposing to acquire the lands in question, land owners have waived and

acquiesced their rights to question the non-conducting of enquiry by the

District Collector either under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_500">section 5-A</a> or under rule 4 of the rules is

both on facts and in law is untenable for the reasons stated hereunder.

Pursuant to our direction, the learned Government Advocate made

available to us the record of the acquisition proceedings in relation to the

acquired lands from the stage of publication of the preliminary notification

till the date of alleged taking over of possession of the acquired lands. As

could be seen from the records, in fact no notice along with the preliminary

notification was issued and served upon either the owners or interested

persons of the acquired lands as required in laws. The order-sheet of the

records maintained by the Collector would disclose that the notice by way

of beat of drum was given in the villages where the lands are situated

which is not in compliance with the provision of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_501">section 4</a> (1) which says

that the Collector shall cause public notice of the substance of such

notification to be given at convenient places in the locality. <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_502">Section 5-A</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                      <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_503">85</a></span>


requires that any person interested in any land which has been notified

under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_504">section 4</a> (1) within thirty days from the date of publication of the

notification to object to the acquisition of the land. For this purpose notice

should be served upon such person but that has not been done in the cases

on hand and also       in respect of the other land owners.          Therefore, the

question of filing of objection by the land owners/person interested did not

arise. The second proviso to <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_505">Section 6</a> provides that no declaration of the

proposed lands under the said section shall be made unless the

compensation to be awarded for such property is to be paid by a company.

It is noticed from the proceedings recorded in the original files that the

compensation to be awarded has been determined by the Collector on the

basis of sale statistics secured from the District Sub-Registrar and the

value of the land shown in the sale statistics has been treated as the

market value and awarded the same as compensation without following the

procedure contemplated under <a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_506">sections 9</a> and <a href="/doc/742973/" id="a_507">10</a> by issuing notice to the

owners of the land/persons interested calling upon them to file claim

petition for determination of the compensation amount for determining the

market value of the property as provided in <a href="/doc/31609/" id="a_508">sections 23</a> and <a href="/doc/1485112/" id="a_509">24</a> of the

L.A.Act. Since the Collector has not complied with the mandatory

requirement     of   issuing   and   serving   individual   notice   to   the   land

owners/interested persons, the question of waiver or acquiescence of the

right of the land owners as contended by the learned Senior Counsel on

behalf of the   company do not arise at all and the further enquiry is not

required to be conducted as provided under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_510">section 5-A</a> (2) or rule 4 is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                  86</span>


wholly untenable in law and therefore the said contention of the opposite

parties cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_10">50.              It is   noticed from the     original files   of the   State

Government that without following the mandatory procedure of issuing

notice under <a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_511">sections 9</a> and <a href="/doc/742973/" id="a_512">10</a> to the owners/interested persons for filing

claim statement to award compensation by determining the market value

of the land under <a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_513">section 11</a>, the awards are said to have been passed and

proviso to <a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_514">Section 11</a> which clearly states     that such award should be

approved by the State Government for the purpose to constitute it a valid

award. From the records it is not noticed nor shown from any other records

that the draft awards passed by the Collector was approved by the State

Government. Therefore, we have to say that no award in terms of <a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_515">section

11</a> is passed in respect of the acquired lands and the same has not been

communicated to the land owners/interested persons as required under

<a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_516">section 12</a> (2) of the L.A.Act to work out their statutory rights as provided

under <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_517">section 18</a> of the Act. In the absence of valid awards, the question of

taking over possession and issuing certificate of possession to the

beneficiary company by transferring the lands in its favour by the State

Government also factually and legally incorrect for the reason that in the

absence of valid awards the question of taking over possession of the land

and handing over the same to the beneficiary company also did not arise.

Except the alleged taking over possession of the land from the owners

without serving the award as required under <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_518">section 12</a> (2) and further

calling upon them to deliver possession to the State Government and

vesting of such land with the State Government and thereafter delivering
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                   87</span>


the same in favour of the beneficiary company is also factually and legally

invalid in law for the reason that to evidence the fact of taking over

possession from the land owners, no Gazette Notification under <a href="/doc/562722/" id="a_519">Section 16</a>

of the L.A.Act is available in the records. In the absence of such Gazette

Notification, the claim made by the State Government that awards were

passed, possession of the lands have been taken by the State Government

and certificate of possession has been given in favour of the company after

transferring possession of the lands is only a paper delivery but no physical

or actual possession was either taken from the land owners or acquired

lands vested with the State Government and thereafter transferred in

favour of the beneficiary company.
</p>
<p id="p_11">51.         There can be no dispute with regard to the settled legal

proposition of law that if an order is bad in its inception, it cannot be

made good subsequently.       If the basis of an order falls being illegal,

invalid or void the consequential order cannot be given effect to as it

automatically becomes inoperative or in other words if the basic order

stands vitiated, the consequential order automatically falls. It is necessary

to peruse what the apex Court said in this regard in the case of

Badrinath Vs. Government of Tamil Nadu &amp; Ors., (2000) 8 SCC

395, which reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">               ―This flows from the general principle applicable to
          ―consequential orders‖. Once the basis of a proceeding
          is gone, may be at a later point of time by order of a
          superior authority, any intermediate action taken in the
          meantime- like the recommendation of the State and by
          the UPSC and the action taken thereon- would fall to
          the ground. This principle of consequential orders which
          is applicable to judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings is
          equally applicable to administrative orders.‖

preliminary notifications and proceeding with the further proceedings in

granting previous consent as provided under <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_520">Section 39</a> of the L.A.Act

what the apex Court said in <a href="/doc/894494/" id="a_524">Commissioner of Customs v. Essar Oil

misrepresentation is called deceit and consists in leading a
man into damage by wilfully or recklessly causing him to
believe and act on falsehood. It is a fraud in law if a party
makes representations, which he knows to be false, and
injury enures therefrom although the motive from which the
representations proceeded may not have been bad. An act
of fraud on court is always viewed seriously. A collusion or
conspiracy with a view to deprive the rights of the others in
relation to a property would render the transaction void ab

given case a deception may not amount to fraud, fraud is
anathema to all equitable principles and any affair tainted
with fraud cannot be perpetuated or saved by the application
of any equitable doctrine including res judicata. (<a href="/doc/371933/" id="a_526">See Ram

in his ability to ―wing me into the easy-hearted man and
trap him into snares‖. It has been defined as an act of
trickery or deceit. In Webster's Third New International
Dictionary ―fraud‖ in equity has been defined as an act or
omission to act or concealment by which one person obtains
an advantage against conscience over another or which
equity or public policy forbids as being prejudicial to
another. In Black's Legal Dictionary, ―fraud‖ is defined as an
intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of inducing
another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing
belonging to him or surrender a legal right; a false
representation of a matter of fact whether by words or by
conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by
concealment of that which should have been disclosed,
which deceives and is intended to deceive another so that he
shall act upon it to his legal injury. In Concise Oxford
Dictionary, it has been defined as criminal deception, use of
false representation to gain unjust advantage; dishonest
artifice or trick. According to Halsbury's Laws of England, a
representation is deemed to have been false, and therefore
a misrepresentation, if it was at the material date false in
substance and in fact. <a href="/doc/299780/" id="a_527">Section 17</a> of the Indian Contract Act,
1872 defines ―fraud‖ as act committed by a party to a
contract with intent to deceive another. From dictionary
meaning or even otherwise, fraud arises out of deliberate
active role of the representator about a fact, which he knows
to be untrue yet he succeeds in misleading the representee
by making him believe it to be true. The representation to
become fraudulent must be of a fact with knowledge that it
was false. In a leading English case i.e. Derry v. Peek, what
constitutes ―fraud‖ was described thus (All ER p. 22 B-C):
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                           90</span>

</p><p id="p_17">        ―[Fraud is proved when it is shown that a false
representation has been made (i) knowingly, or (ii) without
belief in its truth, or (iii) recklessly, careless whether it be
true or false.‖
         But ―fraud‖ in public law is not the same as ―fraud‖ in
private law. Nor can the ingredients, which establish ―fraud‖
in commercial transaction, be of assistance in determining
fraud in administrative law. It has been aptly observed by
Lord Bridge in Khawaja v. Secy. of State for Home Deptt.,
that it is dangerous to introduce maxims of common law as
to effect of fraud while determining fraud in relation to
statutory law. ―Fraud‖ in relation to statute must be a
colourable transaction to evade the provisions of a statute.
</p><p id="p_18">        ― ‗If a statute has been passed for some one
particular purpose, a court of law will not countenance any
attempt which may be made to extend the operation of the
Act to something else which is quite foreign to its object and
beyond its scope.' Present-day concept of fraud on statute
has veered round abuse of power or mala fide exercise of
power. It may arise due to overstepping the limits of power
or defeating the provision of statute by adopting subterfuge
or the power may be exercised for extraneous or irrelevant
considerations. The colour of fraud in public law or
administration law, as it is developing, is assuming different
shades. It arises from a deception committed by disclosure
of incorrect facts knowingly and deliberately to invoke
exercise of power and procure an order from an authority or
tribunal. It must result in exercise of jurisdiction which
otherwise would not have been exercised. That is
misrepresentation must be in relation to the conditions
provided in a section on existence or non-existence of which
power can be exercised. But non-disclosure of a fact not
required by a statute to be disclosed may not amount to
fraud. Even in commercial transactions non-disclosure of
every fact does not vitiate the agreement. ‗In a contract
every person must look for himself and ensures that he
acquires the information necessary to avoid bad bargain.' In
public law the duty is not to deceive.‖ (<a href="/doc/1697217/" id="a_528">See Shrisht Dhawan
v. Shaw Bros</a>., SCC p. 554, para 20.)

the apex Court held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">            ―9. The question, then, is what is mala fides in the
           jurisprudence of power? Legal malice is gibberish unless
           juristic clarity keeps it separate from the popular concept
           of personal vice. Pithily put, bad faith which invalidates
           the exercise of power -- sometimes called colourable
           exercise or fraud on power and oftentimes overlaps
           motives, passions and satisfactions -- is the attainment
           of ends beyond the sanctioned purposes of power by
           simulation or pretension of gaining a legitimate goal. If
           the use of the power is for the fulfilment of a legitimate
           object the actuation or catalysation by malice is not
           legicidal. The action is bad where the true object is to
           reach an end different from the one for which the power
           is entrusted, goaded by extraneous considerations, good
           or bad, but irrelevant to the entrustment. When the
           custodian of power is influenced in its exercise by
           considerations outside those for promotion of which the
           power is vested the court calls it a colourable exercise
           and is undeceived by illusion. In a broad, blurred sense,
           Benjamin Disraeli was not off the mark even in law when
           he stated: ―I repeat . . . that all power is a trust -- that
           we are accountable for its exercise -- that, from the
           people, and for the people, all springs, and all must
           exist‖. Fraud on power voids the order if it is not
           exercised bona fide for the end designed. Fraud in this
           context is not equal to moral turpitude and embraces all
           cases in which the action impugned is to effect some
           object which is beyond the purpose and intent of the
           power, whether this be malice-laden or even benign. If
           the purpose is corrupt the resultant act is bad. If
           considerations, foreign to the scope of the power or
           extraneous to the statute, enter the verdict or impel the
           action, mala fides or fraud on power vitiates the
           acquisition or other official act.‖
                                                    ( Emphasis added)

Therefore, the action of the State Government in issuing the impugned

notifications is void ab initio in law on account of fraud played upon the

State Government by the beneficiary company by misrepresenting the facts
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                   93</span>


and made it to believe and act upon the same to exercise its powers to

acquire the vast tract of lands in its favour for which they are not legally

entitled to and therefore the action of the State Government in exercising its

power for the purpose other than vested in it, amounts to legal mala fides

as held by the Apex Court in the cases referred to supra.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">53.         Further as could be seen from the original records of the

State Government that issuance of the preliminary notifications and

obtaining agreements from the Vedanta Foundation and the beneficiary

company are also bad in law for the reason that we have answered point

no.1 holding that the beneficiary company is not a public company; it is a

private company limited by guarantee. Further acquisition of lands in its

favour is permissible only in respect of the purpose of erection of dwelling

houses for workmen employed by the company or for the provision of

amenities directly connected therewith.
</p>
<p id="p_26">          The MOU dated 19.7.2006 executed by Vedanta Company in

favour of the State Government was before publishing the preliminary

notifications in respect of the acquired lands. On the basis of the said

MOU preliminary notifications dated 13.12.2006 to 22.12.2006 were

published. Therefore, the said agreement was not executed by the

beneficiary company in favour of the State Government for publishing

<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_535">section 4(1)</a> notifications by giving previous consent by it as provided

under <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_536">section 39</a> of the L.A.Act to put the provisions of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_537">sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/562722/" id="a_538">16</a>

(both inclusive) and <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_539">sections 18</a> to <a href="/doc/411174/" id="a_540">37</a> in force. Therefore, there is no

valid agreement before the State Government to exercise the statutory

power and grant previous consent for publishing the preliminary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                   94</span>


notifications. For this reason, publication of the preliminary notifications

on the basis of the said MOU executed by Vedanta Company does not

enure to the benefit of the beneficiary company. Therefore, the said

agreement is not valid as required under <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_541">section 39</a> read with <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_542">section 41</a>

of the L.A.Act and, therefore, acquisition of lands by publishing <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_543">Section 4</a>

(1) notifications in favour of the beneficiary company is vitiated in law for

the reason that before putting the provisions of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_544">sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/562722/" id="a_545">16</a> and <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_546">18</a> to

<a href="/doc/411174/" id="a_547">37</a> in order to acquire land in favour of the beneficiary company, no

previous consent of the State Government was there and such consent

also shall not be given unless the company has executed the agreement

in terms of <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_548">section 41</a> of the L.A.Act. Therefore, the agreement is not only

not in conformity with sub-sections (1) to (4) and (4A) of <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_549">section 41</a>, but

the same is not legal and valid for the reason that much prior to the said

agreement, preliminary notifications were published and thereafter final

notifications were published which are not permissible in law. Therefore,

the same is in contravention of <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_550">section 39</a> of the Act.

</p><p id="p_27">54.         For the above reason also the final notifications are bad in

law. In view of the reasons stated supra, the submissions of Shri Ashok

Mohanty, learned Advocate General and Mr. Anil Diwan, learned Senior

Counsel and Mr.Sanjit Mohanty, learned Senior Counsel for the Company

with reference to the original records of the State Government produced

by the learned Government Advocate to justify the action of the State

Government in support of the impugned notifications regarding the

previous consent accorded by the State Government            and thereafter

Memorandum of Understanding executed by the company in favour of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                  95</span>


State Government agreeing to certain terms and conditions as provided in

<a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_551">section 41</a> of the L.A.Act and thereafter on the basis of the report of the

Collector, the State Government satisfied with      the requisition made by

the company that the proposed lands in the preliminary notification are

required for it for educational purpose to establish a multiple discpline

university in the acquired lands, which will benefit the students of Orissa

State and also the other States in the country, which will be more

advantageous for the State Government, therefore, there is a public

purpose as defined under <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_552">section 3(f)</a> (vi) of the Act, is wholly untenable

in law and the reliance placed on the various decisions by them which are

adverted to in the judgment portion, are not of much help to them. For

the reasons stated supra, all the points from 3 to 11 are answered

against the Beneficiary Company and the State Government.

Answer to Point Nos. 12(a) &amp; (b) &amp; 13 :
</p>
<p id="p_28">55.         Learned Senior Counsel Mr. Jayant Das and Mr. Rajat Rath,

on behalf of the petitioners submit that the acquisition of the lands in

question in favour of the beneficiary company, is bad in law in view of the

fact that by Gazette Notification dated 23.4.1984 published by the State

Government, the nearby area of the acquired lands has been declared as

Wildlife Sanctuary and that two rivers, namely, ‗Nuanai' &amp; ‗Nala' are

flowing in the acquired lands according to the satellite map issued by the

Forest Department. With reference to the said map it is submitted by the

learned Senior   Counsel for    the   petitioners   that if   the   impugned

notifications for acquisition of lands in favour of the beneficiary company

are not quashed, it would definitely affect the ecology and environment in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                 96</span>


the locality and public in general would be affected. The action of the

State Government in acquiring lands is not only in contravention of the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1781078/" id="a_553">Wild Life (Protection) Act</a> but also Air (Prevention &amp;

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_554">Control of Pollution) Act</a> as well as Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_555">Control of

Pollution) Act</a> and Environmental Protection Act of 1986.          The wild

animals in the Sanctuary will adversely suffer and so also Water and Air

pollution will be caused in that locality. On account of establishment of

educational institutions, township and other buildings as proposed by the

beneficiary company in the acquired lands would come up which would

affect the two rivers that are flowing on the lands in question. The same

is against the doctrine of ‗public trust' as held by the Apex Court in the

case of Common Cause, A Registered Society Vs. Union of India &amp;

Ors., (1999) 6 SCC 667.
</p>
<p id="p_29">56.         Mr. Jayant Das, learned Senior Counsel, rightly placed

reliance upon the decision of the Apex Court in Bandhua Mukti Morcha

vrs. Union of India, reported in AIR 1984 SC 802, which decision states

that affecting the statutory and fundamental rights of the citizens would

be a continuing wrong. In the name of sustainable development,

acquiring vast tract of lands of the locality by the State Government

would certainly affect the inter-generational equity for the people of the

locality.   The conversion of nature of the lands in question from

agricultural to non-agricultural purpose would affect the environment and

ecology at large and it would be certainly in the contravention of the

aforesaid Statutory laws and violations of the fundamental duties as

enumerated in <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_556">Article 51A(1)(g)</a> of Part IV of the Constitution.    Further
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                    97</span>


the condition imposed by the State Government that within 5 kilometers

of the acquired lands no person shall be allowed to develop his properties

by putting up the buildings without permission of the Development

Authority also is in violation of their rights. Therefore, the public interest

petitions must succeed as the impugned action of the State Government

certainly not only amounts to violation of Rule of law but also affect public

interest and thereby it would adversely affect the             constitutional,

fundamental and statutory rights of the residents of the locality.

Therefore, the Public Interest Litigation writ petitions are maintainable in

law for the reason that the public interest also involved in these petitions

and hence the same are required to be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_30">57.         In support of their contentions, the learned Senior Counsel on

behalf of the petitioners have placed strong reliance upon the decision of

the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of S.P. Gupta

Vs. Union of India &amp; Anr., AIR 1982 SC 149; and decisions of the

Supreme Court in Janata Dal Vs. H.S. Chowdhary, AIR 1993 SC 892;

Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors.,

(1996) 5 SCC 281; and         State of Uttaranchal Vs. Balwant Singh

Choufal, (2010) 3 SCC 402 and requested this Court to allow the Public

Interest Litigation petitions granting the reliefs.

</p><p id="p_31">58.         The submissions was strongly refuted            by the learned

Advocate General and also the learned senior counsel for the beneficiary

Company contending that there is neither ecology &amp; environmental issues

involved in these petitions nor is there any contravention of the laws in

relation to Air, Water or Wildlife Protection or Environmental Protection
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                     98</span>


Act. It is contended by learned Senior Counsel Mr.Sanjit Mohanty that the

petitioners by filing the public interest litigation petitions, have abused

the process of this Court, which are not at all maintainable in law in view

of the fact that earlier one writ petition being W.P.(C) No. 6981 of 2008,

which was filed by nine persons was disposed of by this Court vide its

order dated 9.5 2008 holding that it is not maintainable in law.             This

aspect of the case is elaborately referred to at para-9 in the counter

statement filed by the beneficiary Company at page 270.                It is also

submitted by the learned Advocate General           that the legal contentions

urged on behalf of the petitioners that ecology and environment of the

area in question will be adversely affected is contrary to the report of the

Additional Secretary to the State Government, Tourism Department

produced in the W.P.(C) No. 7163 of 2008. Further the learned Advocate

General and the learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the beneficiary

Company have urged that there is neither any wildlife sanctuary nor any

forest is existing near the lands in question as contended by the learned

Senior Counsel and another counsel on behalf of the petitioners, which

are acquired in favour of the company and the said statement of the

petitioners is a false statement of fact and in fact the lands which are

existing   for   sanctuary   is   excluded   from   acquisition   in   the   final

notifications.    Therefore, it is contended by them that there is neither

public interest involved in these matters nor Rule of law is violated by the

State Government for which they have requested for dismissal of the

public interest writ petitions.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                      99</span><p id="p_32">


</p><p id="p_33">59.         With reference to the aforesaid rival legal contentions, we

have very carefully examined the above P.I.L. writ petitions with

reference to the pleadings, rival legal contentions urged by the learned

Senior Counsel and another counsel for the parties and records/files of

the Government and after careful examination of all the documents

produced by the parties, we are answering the above points in favour of

the petitioners by assigning the following reasons.

</p><p id="p_34">60.         The   lands   of   the   locality   are   acquired   by   the   State

Government in favour of the beneficiary company. The State Government

by Notification dated 23.4.1984 published in the Gazette declared certain

lands situated near the vicinity of the acquired lands as the Wildlife

Sanctuary is an undisputed fact and the said notification is still in force.

Further the satellite maps issued by the Department of Forest produced

by the petitioners in the public interest litigation petitions, would clearly

go to show that two rivers, namely, ‗Nuanai' and ‗Nala'          are flowing in

certain lands acquired in favour of the beneficiary-company. Hence, the

control of the said rivers will be under the said private company if the

acquisition proceedings are held to be valid in law thereby the doctrine of

public trust as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

Common Cause, A Registered Society (supra) upon which strong

reliance has been placed by the petitioners Senior Counsel, will be

violated. In this decision the Supreme Court held that natural resources

such as air, water, forest, lakes, rivers and wildlife are public properties

entrusted to the Government for their safe and proper use and proper

protection and the doctrine enjoins upon the Government to protect the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                  100</span>


resources for the enjoyment of the general public rather than to permit

their use for private ownership or commercial purposes. Let us know what

the apex Court said on the point:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                   ―160. The Court also appears to have invoked
            the ―Doctrine of Public Trust‖ which is a doctrine of
            environmental law under which the natural resources
            such as air, water, forest, lakes, rivers and wildlife are
            public properties ―entrusted‖ to the Government for
            their safe and proper use and proper protection. Public
            Trust Law recognizes that some types of natural
            resources are held in trust by the Government for the
            benefit of the public. The ―Doctrine of Public Trust‖ has
            been evolved so as to prevent unfair dealing with or
            dissipation of all natural resources. This doctrine is an
            ancient and somewhat obscure creation of Roman and
            British law which has been discovered recently by
            environmental lawyers in search of theory broadly
            applicable to environmental litigation.</blockquote><p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">                   161. This doctrine was considered by this Court
            in its judgment in <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_557">M.C.Mehta v.Kamal Nath</a>, (1997) 1
            SCC 388 to which one of us (S.Saghir Ahmad,J.) was
            a party. Justice Kuldip Singh, who authored the

            their use for private ownership or commercial
            purposes......‖

            Further, by acquiring the vast tract of lands in which the above

two rivers are flowing and handing over the same to the beneficiary

company, as alleged by the opposite parties without producing any

document is definitely contrary to the doctrine of public trust. Requiring the

beneficiary-company to maintain the flow of the above two rivers would

also affect the residents of the locality at large. The aforesaid action of the

          rights. <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_560">In M.C. Mehta v. Union of India</a> this Court held
          that life, public health and ecology has priority over

          than 3 decades back still holds good. The phrase covers

          development that meets the needs of the present without
          compromising with the ability of future generations to
          meet their own needs. Despite various elaborations,
          definition of sustainable development, though very old,
          still is widely accepted the world over and has been
          reiterated by this Court in a catena of cases.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">              61. The background under which the fund came to be
          created has already been noted. Noticing fast depletion of
          forests, the fund was ordered to be utilised for protection
          of forests and environments. The environments are not
          the State property and are a national asset. It is the
          obligation of all to conserve the environments, and for its
          utilisation, it is necessary to have regard to the principles

           Further in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad (104) v. Union

of India,(2008) 2 SCC 222, the Supreme Court observed that :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">             3. As a matter of preface, we may state that
          adherence to the principle of sustainable development is
          now a constitutional requirement. How much damage to
          the environment and ecology has got to be decided on
          the facts of each case. While applying the principle of
          sustainable development one must bear in mind that
          development which meets the needs of the present
          without compromising the ability of the future
          generations to meet their own needs is sustainable
          development. Therefore, courts are required to balance
          development needs with the protection of the
          environment and ecology. It is the duty of the State
          under our Constitution to devise and implement a
          coherent and coordinated programme to meet its
          obligation of sustainable development based on inter-
          generational equity (see <a href="/doc/764031/" id="a_563">A.P. Pollution Control Board v.
          Prof. M.V. Nayudu</a>). Mining is an important revenue-
          generating industry. However, we cannot allow our
          national assets to be placed into the hands of companies
          without a proper mechanism in place and without
          ascertaining the credibility of the user agency.

the above statutory enactments. Further as could be seen from the original

tract of lands belonging to the State Government including Gochar lands on

the basis requisition of Vedanta Company have been de-reserved and

divested from the purpose for which it was reserved and made available for

case, as could be seen from the proceedings maintained by the Collector,

hundreds of acres of lands of the Government has been granted in favour

of the company which grant is under Rule 5 as mentioned in the records is

not permissible in law for the reason that rule 5 of the Orissa Government

Land Settlement Rules, 1983 provides that all applications for settlement of

Government land in favour of the applicants irrespective of the purpose of

lease or extent of area involved either in rural or in urban area shall be

filed before the Tahasildar having jurisdiction over the area in which the

land is situated and the application for settlement of land shall be filed by

the applicant in Form I. On receipt of such application, the same shall be

forthwith entered chronologically in a register maintained in Form II and

after receipt of the applications the Tahasildar shall cause a verification to

be made in respect of each application with reference to the existing record

of rights and map to ascertain whether the land applied for is free from

encroachment of encumbrance or not, whether lease can be granted has to

be examined and whether the applicant is eligible to get the land for the

purpose for which he has applied. Before grant of such land, proclamation

in Form No.III shall be published inviting objections, fixing a date for

hearing. Further notice in this regard must be affixed in the notice Board of

such procedure appears to have been followed and the grant of lease of

hundreds of acres of government land in favour of the beneficiary company

has been made without following the procedure contemplated in the

Business Transaction Rules framed by his Excellency the Governor in

exercise of power under <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_564">Article 166 (3)</a> of the Constitution. The valuation

of the property and the rent fixed has also been done without following the

proper procedure and grant of such vast extent of land in favour of the

company is not provided for under Rule 5 of the Rules. Therefore, grant of

such land in its favour for establishment of a non-existing university is

once again conferring largess upon a private company thereby public

interest is affected is also one more strong reason for allowing the public

interest litigation petitions.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                     ―2..........We wish to point out with all the
             emphasis at our command that public interest litigation
             which is a strategic arm of the legal aid movement and
             which is intended to bring justice within the reach of the
             poor masses, who constitute the low visibility area of
             humanity, is a totally different kind of litigation from the
             ordinary traditional litigation which is essentially of an
             adversary character where there is a dispute between
             two litigating parties, one making claim or seeking relief
             against the other and that other opposing such claim or
             resisting such relief. Public interest litigation is brought
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                      105</span>


before the court not for the purpose of enforcing the
right of one individual against another as happens in the
case of ordinary litigation, but it is intended to promote
and vindicate public interest which demands that
violations of constitutional or legal rights of large
numbers of people who are poor, ignorant or in a
socially or economically disadvantaged position should
not go unnoticed and un-redressed. That would be
destructive of the rule of law which forms one of the
essential elements of public interest in any democratic
form of Government. The rule of law does not mean
that the protection of the law must be available only to
a fortunate few or that the law should be allowed to be
prostituted by the vested interests for protecting and
upholding the status quo under the guise of
enforcement of their civil and political rights. The poor
too have civil and political rights and the rule of law is
meant for them also, though today it exists only on
paper and not in reality. If the sugar barons and the
alcohol kings have the fundamental right to carry on
their business and to fatten their purses by exploiting
the consuming public, have the chamars belonging to
the lowest strata of society no fundamental right to earn
an honest living through their sweat and toil? The
former can approach the courts with a formidable army
of distinguished lawyers paid in four or five figures per
day and if their right to exploit is upheld against the
Government under the label of fundamental right, the
courts are praised for their boldness and courage and
their independence and fearlessness are applauded and
acclaimed. But, if the fundamental right of the poor and
helpless victims of injustice is sought to be enforced by
public interest litigation, the so-called champions of
human rights frown upon it as waste of time of the
highest court in the land, which, according to them,
should not engage itself in such small and trifling
matters. Moreover, these self-styled human rights
activists forget that civil and political rights, priceless
and invaluable as they are for freedom and democracy,
simply do not exist for the vast masses of our people.
</blockquote><p id="p_45">Large numbers of men, women and children who
constitute the bulk of our population are today living a
sub-human existence in conditions of abject poverty;
utter grinding poverty has broken their back and sapped
their moral fibre. They have no faith in the existing
social and economic system. What civil and political
rights are these poor and deprived sections of humanity
going to enforce? This was brought out forcibly by W.
Paul Gormseley at the silver jubilee celebrations of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                       106</span>


Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the Banaras
Hindu University:
</p><p id="p_46">    "Since India is one of those countries which has
   given a pride of place to the basic human rights
   and freedoms in its Constitution in its Chapter on
   Fundamental Rights and on the Directive
   Principles of State Policy and has already
   completed twenty-five years of independence, the
   question may be raised whether or not the
   fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution
   have any meaning to the millions of our people to
   whom food, drinking water, timely medical
   facilities and relief from disease and disaster,
   education and job opportunities still remain
   unavoidable. We, in India, should on this occasion
   study the human rights declared and defined by
   the United Nations and compare them with the
   rights available in practice and secured by the law
   of our country."
</p><p id="p_47">       The only solution for making civil and political
rights meaningful to these large sections of society
would be to remake the material conditions and
restructure the social and economic order so that they
may be able to realise the economic, social and cultural
rights. There is indeed close relationship between civil
and political rights on the one hand and economic,
social and cultural rights on the other and this
relationship is so obvious that the International Human
Rights Conference in Teheran called by the General
Assembly in 1968 declared in a final proclamation:
   ―Since human rights and fundamental freedoms
are indivisible, the full realisation of civil and political
rights without the enjoyment of economic, social and
cultural rights is impossible.‖
        Of course, the task of restructuring the social and
economic order so that the social and economic rights
become a meaningful reality for the poor and lowly
sections of the community is one which legitimately
belongs to the legislature and the executive, but mere
initiation of social and economic rescue programmes by
the executive and the legislature would not be enough
and it is only through multi-dimensional strategies
including public interest litigation that these social and
economic rescue programmes can be made effective.
Public interest litigation, as we conceive it, is essentially
a cooperative or collaborative effort on the part of the
petitioner, the State or public authority and the court to
secure observance of the constitutional or legal rights,
benefits and privileges conferred upon the vulnerable
sections of the community and to reach social justice to
them. The State or public authority against whom public
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                  107</span>

            interest litigation is brought should be as much
            interested in ensuring basic human rights, constitutional
            as well as legal, to those who are in a socially and
            economically disadvantaged position, as the petitioner
            who brings the public interest litigation before the court.
            The State or public authority which is arrayed as a
            respondent in public interest litigation should, in fact,
            welcome it, as it would give it an opportunity to right a
            wrong or to redress an injustice done to the poor and
            weaker sections of the community whose welfare is and
            must be the prime concern of the State or the public
            authority.‖

            or omission also causes a specific legal injury to an
            individual or to a specific class or group of individuals. In
            such cases, a member of the public having sufficient
            interest can certainly maintain an action challenging the

SCC 402, the Supreme Court referring to large number of its earlier

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">              ―33. The High Courts followed this Court and exercised
          similar jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_567">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.

          The rule of locus standi was diluted and the traditional
          meaning of ―aggrieved person‖ was broadened to provide
          access to justice to a very large section of the society
          which was otherwise not getting any benefit from the
          judicial system. We would like to term this as the first
          phase or the golden era of the public interest litigation.
          We would briefly deal with important cases decided by
          this Court in the first phase after broadening the
          definition of ―aggrieved person‖.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">             36. Public interest litigation is not in the nature of

          basic human rights meaningful to the deprived and
          vulnerable sections of the community and to assure them
          social and economic justice which is the signature tune of
          our Constitution. The Government and its officers must
          welcome public interest litigation because it would
          provide them an occasion to examine whether the poor

          remain victims of deception and exploitation at the hands

          whether social and economic justice has become a
          meaningful reality for them or it has remained merely a
          teasing illusion and a promise of unreality, so that in case
          the complaint in the public interest litigation is found to
          be true, they can in discharge of their constitutional
          obligation root out exploitation and injustice and ensure
          to the weaker sections their rights and entitlements.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">             39. The origin and evolution of public interest litigation
          in India emanated from realisation of constitutional
          obligation by the Judiciary towards the vast sections of
          the society--the poor and the marginalised sections of
          the society. This jurisdiction has been created and carved
          out by the judicial creativity and craftsmanship.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">             40. <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_569">In M.C. Mehta v. Union of India</a>, this Court
          observed that <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_570">Article 32</a> does not merely confer power on
          this Court to issue direction, order or writ for the
          enforcement of fundamental rights. Instead, it also lays a
          constitutional obligation on this Court to protect the
          fundamental rights of the people. The Court asserted
          that, in realisation of this constitutional obligation, ―it has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                  110</span>

           all incidental and ancillary powers including the power to
           forge new remedies and fashion new strategies designed
           to enforce the fundamental rights‖. The Court realised
           that because of extreme poverty, a large number of
           sections of society cannot approach the court. The
           fundamental rights have no meaning for them and in
           order to preserve and protect the fundamental rights of
           the marginalised sections of the society by judicial
           innovation; the Courts by judicial innovation and
           creativity started giving necessary directions and passing
           orders in the public interest.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">               41. The development of public interest litigation has
           been an extremely significant development in the history
           of the Indian jurisprudence. The decisions of the Supreme
           Court in the 1970s loosened the strict locus standi
           requirements to permit filing of petitions on behalf of
           marginalised and deprived sections of the society by
           public spirited individuals, institutions and/or bodies. The
           higher courts exercised wide powers given to them under
           Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution. The sort of
           remedies sought from the Courts in the public interest
           litigation goes beyond award of remedies to the affected
           individuals and groups. In suitable cases, the Courts have
           also given guidelines and directions. The Courts have
           monitored implementation of legislation and even
           formulated guidelines in the absence of legislation. If the
           cases of the decades of 70s and 80s are analysed, most
           of the public interest litigation cases which were
           entertained by the courts are pertaining to enforcement
           of fundamental rights of marginalised and deprived
           sections of the society.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_52">64.         In view of the clear pronouncement of law in the aforesaid

cases by the Apex Court this Court has to interfere with the acquisition

proceedings and grant of Government lands in favour of the Beneficiary

Company to protect the public interest.     Hence we have to answer the

aforesaid points in favour of the petitioners and against the opposite

parties.
</p>
<p id="p_53">65.         For the reasons stated supra, the factual contentions urged

by the learned Advocate General, placing reliance upon the report of the

Additional Secretary of Tourism Department, is wholly contrary to the

Gazette Notification of 1984 referred to supra and the Satellite Map
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                  111</span>


issued by the Forest Department to the petitioners, which is produced for

our perusal.    Further the legal contentions urged on behalf of the

Company by Mr. Sanjit Mohanty, learned Senior Counsel that the

petitioners have abused the process of this Court claiming that they are

public spirited persons, is also untenable in law for the reason that they

have established the case that interest of the public of the locality will be

affected and also there will be violation of the Rule of law          if the

acquisition of lands     and grant of leasehold rights in respect of

Government lands in favour of the beneficiary Company is held to be not

legal and valid and therefore we have to hold that there is no abuse of

the process of this Court by the petitioners     in approaching this Court

espousing the public cause and public interest as the act of the State

Government is in contravention of      the Notification issued by the State

Government way back in the year 1984 declaring certain lands nearby the

lands acquired, as Wild life Sanctuary and the documents produced by

the petitioners to prove the fact that two rivers are flowing on the

acquired lands. For the reasons stated supra we are of the view that the

petitioners in the PIL writ petitions have established that they are bona

fide public spirited persons who are very much interested in protecting

the public interest and see that the State Government discharged its

responsibilities and fundamental duties towards the public of the locality

keeping in view ―the doctrine of public trust‖ upon the public properties.

The disposal of the earlier writ petition filed by nine persons referred to

supra upon which reliance is placed by the learned Senior Counsel on

behalf of the Company in support of his contention that the writ
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                  112</span>


petitioners in the PIL have abused the process of this Court is not tenable

in law, as this Court has not decided the case on merits by answering the

substantial issues that arose for its consideration.    In the present writ

petitions by urging tenable grounds they have made out a strong case for

granting the reliefs. If the PIL petitions are not allowed there will be a

continuing wrong of the State Government and the beneficiary Company,

which would violate the human rights of the residents of the locality

where the lands are acquired and land owners/interested persons. They

are small holders of the lands who belong to the Marginalized sections of

the society and therefore they have no access to the justice for which

they have got constitutional right under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_571">Article 39A</a> of the Constitution

and hundreds acres of     Government lands are granted in favour of the

company in utter violation of law.
</p>
<p id="p_54">66.       For the foregoing reasons, absolutely there is no substance in

the contentions urged by the learned Senior counsel on behalf of the

Company that there is no public interest involved in these cases of PIL

writ petitions filed by the petitioners and they have abused the process of

the Court is misconceived and wholly untenable in law and the said

contention is required to be rejected and the public interest litigation writ

petitions also have to be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_55">Answer to Point Nos. 14 and 15 :
</p>
<p id="p_56">67.         We have answered all the points framed in these petitions

against the State Government and the beneficiary Company by recording

our reasons and we have held that the acquisition proceedings from the

stage of initiation till the date of purported awards which in fact and law
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                   113</span>


not awarded and the alleged taking over of possession of the lands is in

flagrant violation of the statutory provisions of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_572">Sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_573">5A</a>, <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_574">6</a>, <a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_575">9</a>, <a href="/doc/742973/" id="a_576">10</a>,

<a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_577">11</a>, <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_578">12</a> (2), 23, 24, read with the provisions under Part-VII of the Land

Acquisition Act, 1894.    We have also answered the points that arose for

our consideration in the Public Interest Litigation holding that the

initiation of the acquisition proceedings in favour of the beneficiary

company, on the requisition made by the Vedanta Foundation by

misrepresenting facts and playing fraud on the State Government, has

vitiated the entire acquisition proceedings. We have further answered

that the public interest at large is affected and there is violation of rule of

law.   Therefore, we have also held that writ petitions filed by the

petitioners as public interest litigation are also required to be allowed and

made observation that the petitioners in those petitions, apart from public

interest, they have pleaded on behalf of small land holders who have no

sustenance to approach this Court to fight litigation.         Therefore, the

acquisition proceedings in its entirety in respect of persons who have

approached this Court and even who have not approached this Court are

liable to be quashed for the reason that there is flagrant violation of the

aforesaid provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_579">Land Acquisition Act</a> as observed by the

Supreme Court in the case of H.M.T. House Building Co-operative

Society Vs. Syed Khader &amp; Ors, reported in AIR 1995 SC 2244. The

Supreme Court, while answering the legal questions that arose for

consideration, held that prior approval of the Government is required

under <a href="/doc/169272333/" id="a_580">Section 44-A</a>, but as the same has not been followed, the entire

acquisition proceedings was quashed.          Further, the Supreme Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                  114</span>


directed in the above referred case the State Government and the Society

which was in the possession, that lands shall be restored to the

respective land owners irrespective of the fact whether they had

challenged the acquisition of their lands or not and at paragraph 26 of its

judgment has directed as hereunder :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">                ― 26. We direct that as a result of quashing of the
            land     acquisition    proceedings     including    the
            notifications as aforesaid, the possession of the lands
            shall be restored to the respective landowners
            irrespective of the fact whether they had challenged
            the acquisition of their lands or not. On restoration of
            the possession to the landowners they shall refund
            the amounts received by them as compensation or
            otherwise in respect of their lands. The appellant,
            the respondents and the State Government including
            all authorities/persons concerned shall implement
            the aforesaid directions at an early date.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_57">68.         Applying the said decision to the facts of the case and the

acquisition of lands in question, we deem it appropriate to grant reliefs in

favour of the land owners irrespective of whether they have approached

this Court or not.
</p>
<p id="p_58">69.         In the result, we allow the writ petitions, quash the impugned

land acquisition proceedings including the notifications under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_581">Sections

4(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_582">6</a> and the awards passed in the Land Acquisition Proceedings for

acquisition of land in favour of the beneficiary company and direct that

the possession of the acquired lands shall be restored to the respective

land owners irrespective of the fact whether they have challenged the

acquisition of their lands or not. On restoration of the possession to the

land owners, they shall refund the amount received by them as

compensation or otherwise in respect of their lands. We also quash the

grant of Government Lands in favour of the Beneficiary Company under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                     115</span>


    Rule 5 of the Government Land Settlement Rules with a direction to the

    State Government to resume the lands which were granted to the

    beneficiary company by way of lease. All concerned including the State

    Government, the land owners and the beneficiary company shall

    implement the aforesaid direction at an early date.
