<p id="p_1">(Per
: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. S.J. MUKHOPADHAYA)
 

 


 

	This
Public Interest Litigation has been preferred by the villagers of
Samagoga and Baraya of Taluka Mundra, alleging pollution caused by
7th to 12th respondents by emitting hazardous
gas and discharging untreated effluents.  Pollution Control Board was
initially directed to visit the industrial premises and to submit a
report before this Court.  However, the report being incomplete with
regard to some of the industries, namely   Ashapura Mine Chem
Limited, Mahashakti Coke and Jindal Saw Limited, the Pollution
Control Board was asked to make further enquiry under the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and under Air (Prevention
and Control of Pollution)-1981, and to submit a fresh report.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_2">	Pursuant
to the Court's order, a report has been submitted before this Court,
from which it would be evident that none of the respondent industries
are discharging any hazardous waste, nor emitting any hazardous gas,
which are within the permissible limits.  In absence of any infirmity
in the report, we accept the same.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">	Mr.
</p><p id="p_4">Mihir Thakore, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners contended
that though Panchayats assessed the property of the respondents in
this case, no steps have been taken for recovery of the same.  Per
contra,  learned Counsel appearing for the Panchayats submitted that
steps have already been taken to recover the property tax and other
dues.  Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent
industries submitted that the industries are ready to pay the tax,
subject to their rights to challenge illegal assessment, if any,
made.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_5">	The
next submission made on behalf of the petitioner is that the
industries are not being established with proper permission and
therefore, they may not be allowed to run.  Such submission has been
disputed by the respondents, who wanted to rely upon the documents to
show that the industries have been established after obtaining due
permission from the Authorities.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_6">	We
have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_7">	In
the present case, as it has been reported by the Pollution Control
Board after the recent inspection that the respondent industries are
not emitting any hazardous gas, which is well within the permissible
limit, and are also not discharging any untreated effluent, we are
not inclined to issue any direction  to the Pollution Control Board. 
It will always be open for the Pollution Control Board to make
periodical inspection of the industries to ensure that no industrial
pollution is caused.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_8">	So
far as collection of tax is concerned, the Panchayats are directed to
take steps for collection of the assessed tax in accordance with law.
 If one or other respondent industry is not satisfied with such
assessment, they may move an appeal under sub-section (6 ) of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Section
200</a> of the Act, after depositing the requisite amount under
sub-section (7) of Section 200 of the Gujarat Panchayats Act, 1993.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_9">	The
petition stands disposed of with aforesaid observations and
directions.  There shall be no order as to costs.
</p>
