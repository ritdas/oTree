petitions2 as common question of law and facts are involved. However, the

facts are referred from C.W.P. No. 11839 of 2007 unless the same are

specifically mentioned from other petitions. The petitioners have filed the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> C.W.P. No. 11839 of 2007                                                   2</span>


instant petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution for quashing order

dated 11.7.2007 (P-10) whereby 63 application forms and 67 demand drafts

for allotment of plots in the 'Dyeing Zone' Sector 29 Part-II, Panipat, have

been sent back by the Chief Administrator, Haryana Urban Development

Authority (for brevity, 'HUDA') to the Regional Officer, Haryana State

Pollution Control Board, Panipat (for brevity, 'the Board') for returning the

same to the applicants.     The petitioners have also sought quashing of

advertisement/public notice (P-9) to the extent that they have been asked to

apply afresh for allotment of plots alongwith the difference of earnest

money at a higher rate i.e. Rs. 1,155/- per square meter as compared to the

earlier rate of Rs. 500/- per square meter. Still further a prayer has been

made for directing the respondents to consider the earlier applications

submitted by the petitioners for allotment of plots in the 'Dyeing Zone'

Sector 29 Part-II, Panipat and to allot plots as per the old rates prevalent at

the time of submission of application forms.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.           Brief facts of the case are that the matter regarding

contamination of ground water being caused by in-discriminate discharge of

polluted effluent by small and tiny units engaged in dyeing and printing

activities in Panipat Town was considered in various meetings of the

Environment Protection Council, Haryana. It was noticed that out of 500

units of Panipat, about 300 tiny units, which were employing 5-6 persons,

were operating from residential and non-conforming areas of the Town.

Thus, in principle it was decided to formulate a time bound action plan for

relocation of small scale industrial units working in the congested areas of

the Town in a separate industrial estate so that their effluent could be treated

in a common effluent treatment plant.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> C.W.P. No. 11839 of 2007                                                   3</span><p id="p_3">


</p><p id="p_4">3.           In the meeting of the Environment Protection Council, held on

19.9.2001 it was decided that Sector 29 Part-II and Sector 30, Panipat, being

developed by the HUDA, would be suitable site for relocating the

aforementioned units. The issue with regard to cost of sites for relocating

the units was also considered and it was decided that cost of the plot may be

realised as per the following formula:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">             "i)    5% of the price along with the application form.

             ii)    10% within 30 days of issue of allotment letter.

</pre><p id="p_5">             iii)   Balance 85% in half yearly instalments payable over a

                    period of 10 years."
</p>
<p id="p_6">             It was further decided that the HUDA will carry out an exercise

to work out a scheme in which the larger units would be charged more, so

that the price payable by the tiny units could be reduced further i.e. less than

Rs. 1,428/- per square yards.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.           In the meeting held on 26.2.2002 as per Item No. A-84(2)

Suppl. A-84 the matter regarding shifting of dyeing units in Panipat Town

was considered. It was decided that the units involved in the dyeing and

printing activities in the Town which were functioning from residential and

non-conforming zone, should be shifted to the new industrial area and land

be given to them on 'no profit no loss basis' by the HUDA in Sector 29

Part-II, Panipat (P-2). Thereafter, a survey was conducted by the Survey

Team of the Regional Office of the Board at Panipat to identify the units

which were involved in the dyeing and printing activities and operating

from the residential and non-conforming zones in the Town for their

relocation to the new sites in Sector 29 Part-II, Panipat. A survey list of 494

units was prepared, which were found existing in the non-conforming zone
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> C.W.P. No. 11839 of 2007                                                  4</span>


in Panipat Town. In the list complete information was incorporated viz.

name of the unit, address, name of the owner, type of industries, total area

of plant in square meters, total area of dyeing section in square maters, total

investment, quantity of effluent discharged, point of discharge, status of

Common Effluent Treatment Plan (CETP) whether installed or not, proof of

ownership, status of air pollution and land recommended by team in square

meters.
</p>
<p id="p_8">5.           On 14.8.2003, a meeting was held to review the progress of

rehabilitation of Dyeing Units at Panipat, wherein it came to notice that out

of 409 units, 213 were of smaller category and 196 were of bigger size.

Only 182 units had applied for allotment of plots under smaller category and

120 units submitted applications for allotment of plots under bigger

category.    In the aforementioned meeting it also surfaced that 310

applications were received upto 13.8.2003.        71 units had applied for

variation in plot size and it was decided that they would be adjusted as per

the number of plots available. It was further decided that applications from

such units, which were closed down after identification and did not apply

earlier, may be received but allotment in such cases would be made later on

keeping in view the number of plots available. The progress regarding

installation of Effluent Treatment Plant, construction of building and roads

etc was also discussed (P-5).
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.           The petitioners in these petitions are carrying on the dyeing and

printing activities in the residential/non-conforming zone of the Town and

names of their units, except some of them which will be disclosed in the

succeeding para, figures in the survey list (R-2/1).          The petitioners

submitted their application forms for allotment of plots in the 'Dyeing Zone'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> C.W.P. No. 11839 of 2007                                                 5</span>


alongwith 5% earnest money. Even those persons whose units were not

included in the survey list approached the Board for allotment of plots

enabling them to shift their units in the 'Dyeing Zone'. The petitioners have

claimed that the Regional Officer of the Board after considering their cases

recommended to the Estate Officer, HUDA, Panipat, for allotment of plots

in such like cases. Some of the recommendations of the Regional Officer of

the Board, made on 22.6.2006, 21.7.2006 and 25.7.2006 have been placed

on record as Annexure P-4 (Collectively).
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.          The grievance of the petitioners is that the respondents are

adopting the policy of pick and choose in allotting plots in the 'Dyeing

Zone'. It has been alleged that in some of the cases plots have been allotted

way back in the year 1993 and also in 2007 (P-6 &amp; P-7) whereas the

applications submitted by the petitioners were kept pending.

</p><p id="p_11">8.          On 11.7.2007, the HUDA issued an advertisement/Public

Notice in the newspapers for allotment of industrial plots in Dyeing Zone,

Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat. It was mentioned in the advertisement that in the

84th meeting of the Authority, held on 26.2.2002, the policy for shifting of

Dyeing units, functioning from Panipat Town/non-conforming zone, as

identified by the survey conducted by the Board in the year 2001, was

approved but despite lapse of 5 years, some of the entrepreneurs who had

been identified for the allotment of plots in the zone have not come forward

till that date seeking allotment of plot. Since the plots could not be left as

such for an indefinite period, therefore, a last chance was again given to

such entrepreneurs and applications were invited upto 10.8.2007. It was

further mentioned that the applicants who had already made an application
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> C.W.P. No. 11839 of 2007                                                6</span>


should apply afresh alongwith the difference of earnest money and other

required documents (P-9).
</p>
<p id="p_12">9.          The further case of the petitioners is that the Chief

Administrator, HUDA has returned their applications alongwith demand

drafts to the Regional Officer of the Board on the erroneous premise that

since the advertisement/public notice dated 11.7.2007 has been issued,

therefore, the identified beneficiaries needs to apply afresh as per the

current rates applicable in the financial year 2007-08. The Regional Officer

of the Board has been asked to return the applications to the applicants (P-

</p><p id="p_13">10).   It has been further pointed out by the petitioners that in the

advertisement/public notice the rates of the plots have been considerably

enhanced to Rs. 1,155/- per square mater for plots upto 525 square meters

and Rs. 1,925/- per square meter for plots above 525 square meters.

</p><p id="p_14">10.         In the written statement filed on behalf of respondent Nos. 2

and 4 the stand taken is that at the time of survey 494 units were identified

and out of them 29 units did not opt for the rehabilitation scheme and 'no

demand' was raised by them and accordingly against their names the survey

team recorded as 'No Demand' in the column of the survey list under the

heading of 'Land recommended by team in Sq. Mtrs.'. According to the

respondents only 465 units have been identified beneficiaries and eligible

for allotment of plots by the Survey Team. It has been submitted that only

332 applicants applied for allotment of plots which have already been

allotted plots in the year 2003-2004 itself. The fresh advertisement/public

notice has been issued with a view to rehabilitate the left out identified

beneficiaries out of 465 units. In the reply on merits, it has been submitted

that the names of petitioner Nos. 2 and 5 to 12 do not figure in the survey
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> C.W.P. No. 11839 of 2007                                                  7</span>


list and, thus, they are not entitled for allotment of plots in the 'Dyeing

Zone'. With regard to petitioner Nos. 4 and 8 it has been mentioned that

though their names figure in the survey list but they did not show any

interest in the plots, therefore, the Survey Team has given the comment as

'no demand' in the survey list against their names. In respect of petitioner

No. 3 it has been mentioned that after considering the application, Plot No.

598, measuring 1000 square meters, has already been allotted as a result of

draw held on 30.11.2007. The application of petitioner No. 1 was kept in

abeyance due to some objections raised. However, during the course of

arguments, learned counsel for the respondents have informed the Court that

a plot in favour of petitioner No. 1 has been allotted.
</p>
<p id="p_15">11.          Respondent Nos. 2 and 4 have specifically denied the

allegation of the petitioners that at the time of survey certain units were

ignored. It has been asserted that the survey team has ignored only such

units which were either closed down or functioning from rented premises.

With regard to enhancement of price of the plots it has been asserted that

rates have been revised keeping in view various factors and long time span.

As a matter of facts rates have been uniformally increased in all the Urban

Estates in Haryana. The respondents have placed on record letter dated

1.6.2007, fixing the rates of industrial plots in various Urban Estates for the

year 2007-08 (R-2/2).
</p>
<p id="p_16">12.          A separate written statement has also been filed on behalf of

the Board-respondent No. 3, however, no additional pleadings have been

raised therein.
</p>
<p id="p_17">13.          In the pleadings as well as during the course of arguments it

has come to the notice of the Court that in some cases plots have already

been allotted in favour of some of the petitioners. In some cases the names

of the petitioners even does not figure in the survey list prepared by the

Board, whereas in some of the cases plots have not been allotted on the

premise that 'no demand' has been raised by the petitioners. Accordingly,

we propose to draw the factual position in respect of each of the petitioner

in these petitions in the following chart:-

</pre><p id="p_18">8.          Learned counsel for the petitioners have argued that the

question of not requesting for allotment of a plot would not arise once the

petitioners have been found to be working in a residential/non-conforming

area polluting the ground water. According to the learned counsel, the

petitioners have only expressed their willingness to rehabilitate them in a

plot of requisite size, which the officers of the Survey Team had not agreed

probably for the reason that the plots of that size were not available. They

have also suggested that once the object of rehabilitation scheme is to order

closure of the dyeing and printing units in the residential/non-conforming
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> C.W.P. No. 11839 of 2007                                                   10</span>


areas then the petitioners have to be rehabilitated. In C.W.P. No. 8375 of

2008, Mr. Shyam Kumar Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioner has

submitted that the land purchased by the petitioner to shift his unit has been

acquired to establish 'Dyeing Zone'. Another argument raised by them is

that a total of 494 units were identified and accordingly plots have been

carved out in the 'Dyeing Zone', therefore, it is incumbent upon the

respondents to at least allot plots to such identified units. With regard to the

persons whose names were not included in the survey list, it has been

submitted that the names of some of the units could not be incorporated in

the survey list because of their closure at the relevant point of time but they

have been able to revive and functioning.          Moreover, ample plots are

available with the respondents in the 'Dyeing Zone' which can be allotted to

such units. Learned counsel have further submitted that the petitioners were

even willing and ready to apply in response to the advertisement/public

notice dated 11.7.2007 but the respondent authorities refused to accept their

applications and returned the same. They have also pointed out that in some

of the cases even the Board has started the process of issuing closure notices

under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_2">Section 33-A</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974, to the petitioners because they failed to shift their units to the 'Dyeing

Zone' Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat. They have emphasized that without

providing alternative site to the petitioners the Board cannot direct them to

stop their activities and pass an order directing closure of the unit.

</p><p id="p_19">9.           Mr. Arun Walia and Mr. Raghujeet Singh Madan, learned

counsel for the respondents have, however, submitted that the original

record shows that the petitioners against whom the remark of 'no demand'

has been recorded in the survey list, did not express any desire to allotment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11"> C.W.P. No. 11839 of 2007                                                   11</span>


of plots in the 'Dyeing Zone' at the time of survey. They have emphasised

that the proforma prepared by the Survey Team who inspected the dyeing

and printing units in the residential/non-conforming areas has been duly

signed by each one of the petitioners and at this stage they cannot turn

around and refuse the factum of raising 'no demand' for allotment of plot.

Thus, such units cannot stake their claim for allotment of plots now as a

matter of right.
</p>
<p id="p_20">10.          We have heard learned counsel for the parties at a considerable

length and perused the paper books as well as original record with their able

assistance. It is an undisputed fact that the Authority in its 84th meeting held

on 26.2.2002 has taken a conscious decision for shifting of dyeing and

printing units to the Dyeing Zone Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat because the

effluent is being discharged by such units, which are operating from the

residential and non-conforming zones of Panipat Town and result in

contamination of the ground water. Thus, it was decided to formulate a time

bound action plan for relocation of small scale industrial units working in

the congested areas of Panipat Town in a separate industrial estate so that

their effluent could be treated in a common effluent treatment plant.

Accordingly, a survey was conducted by the Board and 494 units were

identified. Some of identified units have already been allotted plots. The

advertisement/public notice dated 11.7.2007 also notices that inspite of

lapse of more than five years some of the entrepreneurs who were identified

for allotment of plots in the Dyeing Zone did not come forward for

allotment of plot and one last chance was given to such units.

</p><p id="p_21">11.          In view of the factual position which has emerged from the

above chart, it would be convenient if the cases of the petitioners are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> C.W.P. No. 11839 of 2007                                                  12</span>


bifurcated into three categories viz. (i) cases in which the plots have not

been allotted in the 'Dyeing Zone' on the ground that 'no demand' was

raised at the time of survey; (ii) cases wherein the names of the petitioners

do not figure in the survey list; and (iii) cases wherein plots have already

been allotted.
</p>
<p id="p_22">12.              The ultimate object of establishing the 'Dyeing Zone' is to

shift the polluting dyeing and printing units from the residential and non-

conforming zone of Panipat Town to the newly carved out Dyeing Zone in

Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat so as to bring clean environment and to obviate

the possibility of contamination of ground water. If that be so, then to

accept that the petitioners would not require to be rehabilitated on the

earmarked land purposely developed for them would not be acceptable. We

are of the view that the petitioners whose names figure in the survey list

would be fully entitled to apply for plot of requisite size in pursuance to the

advertisement/public notice dated 11.7.2007, which has invited applications

for allotment of such plots in the 'Dyeing Zone'. The benefit of survey list

made by the Survey Team, who have identified 494 dyeing and printing

units and has made recommendation in respect of others regarding size of

plots, has to be given to such persons. Therefore, we deem it just and

appropriate to issue directions to the Chief Administrator, HUDA to

reconsider the matter by accepting the eligibility of the petitioners, whose

names are there in the survey list, for allotment of a plot and take a policy

decision in that regard.     The Chief Administrator shall also decide in

principle the size of the plots which should be allotted to such persons and

as to whether they would be considered in pursuance to the

advertisement/public notice dated 11.7.2007 or their applications could be

considered independent of that. The needful shall be done within a period

of three months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order.

</p><p id="p_23">13.          It is not possible to accept the claims of the petitioners who

never surfaced in the survey list of 494 units, which was prepared in 2001,

because they were not in existence on or before the survey. There is no

clinching evidence on record in any of these cases proving their existence

beyond doubt on or before the date of survey. In any case, we do not wish

to enter upon any such inquiry as it may lead to including the names of

those whose authenticity is doubtful. Therefore, we reject their claim and

dismiss their petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_24">14.          The petitions in respect of the petitioners who have already

been allotted plots in the 'Dyeing Zone' are, however, dismissed as having

been rendered infructuous.
