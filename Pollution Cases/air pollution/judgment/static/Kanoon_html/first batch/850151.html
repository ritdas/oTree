<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
 

Virender Singh, J.  
</p>
 

<p id="p_2">1. On the last date of hearing i.e. February 05,
2003 it was ordered by me that the counsel for the
petitioner (Mr. Sanjiv Bansal, Advocate) and counsel for
the respondent (Mr. B.S. Thind, Advocate) be informed of
the actual date of hearing i.e. 12.2.2003 as none had
appeared from either side on the last date of hearing.
However, on 12.2.2003 the present petition could not be
taken up by me. Office report shows that counsel for the
parties were duly informed.  
</p>
 

<p id="p_3">2. The present revision petition has been filed
for setting aside the impugned order dated 25.4.1997
Annexure P/2 passed by Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate,
Kharar whereby the complaint of the petitioner under
Section 25/26 read with <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_1">Section 47</a> of the Water
(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter
referred to as the Act) has been dismissed for want of
prosecution.  
</p>
 

<p id="p_4">3. The case of the petitioner is that M/s
Platewell Electroplaters, D-II, Phase I, Mohali Distt.
Ropar was found discharging its trade effluent, when
inspected by the Board officials, without installing any
effluent treatment plant or constructing any sewer. It is
then the case of the petitioner that both the respondents
were given an opportunity to explain their position but it
was not availed of by the respondents and ultimately the
petitioner filed the complaint (Annexure P/1) against the
respondents after getting due approval/sanction. It has
further been averred that the present complaint has to be
tried as a warrant case as the contravention of the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_3">Section 25</a> or 26 of the Act are punishable
with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than
2 years but which may extend to 6 years and with fine. it
is further asserted on behalf of the petitioner that after
the recording of the evidence, charge was framed against
the respondents vide order dated 2.3.95. Thereafter the
case was posted for after charge evidence and one PW was
also examined on 2.8.1996 and then the matter was
adjourned for remaining PWs. One of the dates fixed for
after charge evidence was 25.4.97 and on that day the
complaint was dismissed for want of prosecution by the
learned Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Kharar vide
order Annexure P/2.  
</p>
 

<p id="p_5">4. I have heard Mr. Sanjiv Bansal, learned
counsel for the petitioner. However, none has put in
appearance on behalf of the respondents to assist this
Court.  
</p>
 

<p id="p_6">5. The grouse shown by the learned counsel for the
petitioner is that the impugned order is totally contrary
to the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4"> of Criminal Procedure Code</a>. As the
present complaint relates to a warrant case, the learned
trial court should have adopted the provisions of <a href="/doc/1683498/" id="a_5">section
249</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure and as such the
Court has no jurisdiction to dismiss the complaint in this
eventuality. In support of this, Mr. Bansal has read
<a href="/doc/1683498/" id="a_6">Section 249</a> of the Cr.P.C. before me. He has also relied
upon a judgment of this Court rendered in  Baljinder Singh
v. Jagsir Singh and Ors. 1991(2) RCR 251.  
</p>
 

<p id="p_7">6. I have perused the impugned order. <a href="/doc/1683498/" id="a_7">Section 249</a>
of the Code of Criminal Procedure is reproduced as under:--  
</p>
<p id="p_8">  "249- When the proceedings have been
instituted upon complaint, and on any day fixed
for the hearing of the case, the complainant is
absent, and the offence may be lawfully
compounded or is not a cognizable offence, the
Magistrate may, in his discretion,
notwithstanding anything hereinbefore
contained, at any time before the charge has
been framed, discharge the accused."  
</p>
 

<p id="p_9">7. The plain reading of aforesaid section makes it
clear that the Magistrate has no jurisdiction to dismiss
the complaint where the offence is either non-compoundable
or is cognizable and in a case where the charge has been
framed.  
</p>
 

<p id="p_10">8. In the present case, it has been averred that
the charge was framed against the respondents on 2.3.95
and thereafter one PW was also examined on 2.8.96 as after
charge evidence and as such, the judgment in Baljinder
Singh's case (supra) relied upon by the learned counsel
for the petitioner is fully applicable to the facts of the
present case.  
</p>
 

<p id="p_11">9. For the foregoing reasons, the order in
question (Annexure P/2) deserves to be set-aside.
Accordingly, revision petition is allowed and the order
dated 25.4.97 dismissing the complaint for want of
prosecution is hereby set-aside. The complaint is
restored to its original position. The parties are
directed to appear before the trial court on 24.3.2003 for
further proceedings. The copy of the judgment be sent to
the trial court without any delay.  
</p>
 

<p id="p_12">10. Since it is an old matter relating to the year
1992, the trial court is directed to speed up the trial
and would make all its endeavour to finish the case at the
earliest preferably within six months. Since the
respondents go un-represented in the present petition
before me, the trial court would secure the presence of
the respondents according to law.  
</p>
