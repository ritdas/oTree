Y.K. Sabharwal, J.

<p id="p_2">	Natural resources are the assets of entire nation.  It is the obligation 
of all concerned including Union Government and State Governments to 
conserve and not waste these resources.  <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_1">Article 48A</a> of the Constitution of 
India requires the State shall endeavour to protect and improve the 
environment and to safeguard the forest and wild life of the country.  Under 
<a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_2">Article 51A</a>, it is the duty of every citizen to protect and improve the natural 
environment including forest, lakes, rivers and wild-life and to have 
compassion for living creatures.  
</p>
<p id="p_3">In the present case, the question is about conservation, preservation 
and protection of forests and the ecology.  When forest land is used for 
non-forest purposes, what measures are required to be taken to 
compensate for loss of forest land and to compensate effect on the 
ecology, is the main question under consideration.
	Forests are a vital component to sustain the life support system on 
the earth.  Forests in India have been dwindling over the years for a 
number of reasons, one of it being the need to use forest area for 
development activities including economic development.  Undoubtedly, in 
any nation development is also necessary but it has to be consistent with 
protection of environments and not at the cost of degradation of 
environments.  Any programme, policy or vision for overall development 
has to evolve a systemic approach so as to balance economic 
development and environmental protection.  Both have to go hand in hand.  
In ultimate analysis, economic development at the cost of degradation of 
environments and depletion of forest cover would not be long lasting.  
Such development would be counter productive.  Therefore, there is an 
absolute need to take all precautionary measures when forest lands are 
sought to be directed for non forest use.
</p><p id="p_4">	The point in issue is whether before diversion of forest land for non-
forest purposes and consequential loss of benefits accruing from the 
forests should not the user agency of such land be required to compensate 
for the diversion.  If so, should not the user Agency be required to make 
payment of Net Present Value (NPV) of such diverted land so as to utilize 
the amounts so received for getting back in long run the benefits which are 
lost by such diversion?  What guidelines should be issued for 
determination of NPV?  Should guidelines apply uniformly to all?  How to 
calculate NPV? Should some projects be exempted from payment of NPV?  
These are the main aspects which require examination and determination 
in the backdrop of various legislations which we would presently notice.
	The legislature to provide for conservation of forest and for matters 
connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto enacted the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_3">Forest 
(Conservation) Act</a>, 1980 (for short, the 'FC Act').  It postulates that no 
State Government or other authority shall make, except with the prior 
approval of the Central Government, any order directing that any forest 
land or any portion thereof may be used for any non-forest purpose.  The 
Central Government under the FC Act has been empowered to constitute 
a Committee to advice it with regard to grant of approval.  Under <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_4">Section 2</a> 
of the Act the question of use of any forest land for non-forest purposes 
and any other matter connected with the conservation of forest may be 
referred to such a committee by the Central Government under the FC Act.  
The contravention of any of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_5">Section 2</a> has been made an 
offence.  
</p><p id="p_5">Noticing the decline in environment quality due to increasing 
pollution, loss of vegetal cover and biological diversity, excessive 
concentrations of harmful chemicals in the ambient atmosphere and in 
food chains, growing risks of environmental accidents and threats to life 
support system, the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_6">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 (for short, the 'EP 
Act') has been enacted.  It has been noted in the Statement of Objects and 
Reasons that although there are existing laws dealing directly or indirectly 
with several environmental matters, it is necessary to have a general 
legislation for environmental protection.  Existing laws generally focus on 
specific types of pollution or on specific categories of hazardous 
substances.  Some major areas of environmental hazards are not covered.  
There also exist uncovered gaps in areas of major environmental hazards.  
There are inadequate linkages in handling matters of industrial and 
environmental safety.  Control mechanisms to guard against slow, 
insidious build up of hazardous substances, especially new chemicals, in 
the environment are weak.  Because of a multiplicity of regulatory 
agencies, there is need for an authority which can assume the lead role for 
studying, planning and implementing long-term requirements of 
environmental safety and to give direction to, and co-ordinate a system of 
speedy and adequate response to emergency situations threatening the 
environment.  The EP Act was, therefore, enacted to provide for protection 
and improvement of environment and for matters connected therewith.   
The Central Government has been given wide powers to take measures to 
protect and improve the environment as provided under <a href="/doc/1870616/" id="a_7">Section 3</a> 
including the power to constitute an authority or authorities for the purpose 
of exercising and performing such of the powers and functions, including 
the power to issue directions under <a href="/doc/1728291/" id="a_8">Section 5</a>, of the Central Government 
under the Act and for taking measures with respect to such of the matters 
referred to in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1870616/" id="a_9">Section 3</a> as may be mentioned in the 
order and subject to the prejudice and control of the Central Government.  
Section 5 of the EP Act empowers the Central Government, in exercise of 
its powers and performance of its function under the Act, to issue 
directions in writing to any person, officer or any authority and such 
person, officer or authority shall be bound to comply with such directions.  
The Central Government has the power to direct the closure, prohibition or 
regulation of any industry, operation or process or stoppage of regulation 
of the supply of electricity or water or any other service.  
Parliament has also enacted enactments to prevent and control 
water pollution and air pollution [The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of 
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 
1981]. 
</p><p id="p_6">A statement was placed before this Court by the Central 
Government showing the position as on 20th March, 2000 of the cases 
approved for diverting forest lands, stipulation for compensatory 
afforestation under the FC Act and the compensatory afforestation done, 
funds to be utilized and actually utilized. The Court noted the dismal 
situation as there was a shortfall to the extent of 36% of total afforestation 
compensatory or otherwise afforestation.  It further noted that though funds 
had been realized by all the States in connection with such afforestation, a 
very large number of States had spent 50% or less amount on 
afforestation. In this background, taking suo moto action, notices were 
directed to be issued to the States mentioned in the Order dated 17th April, 
2000 to explain as to why moneys realized have not been spent on 
carrying out afforestation.
</p><p id="p_7">	On 23rd November, 2001, after considering the affidavits that had 
been filed, it was noted that large sums of money had been realized by 
various States from the user-agency to whom permits were granted to use 
forest land for non-forest purposes. The moneys were paid by user 
agencies to the State Governments for compensatory afforestation but the 
utilization was only about 83% of the funds actually realized by the State 
Governments, the shortfall being of nearly Rs.200 crores.  
The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) was directed to 
formulate a scheme providing that whenever any permission is granted for 
change of use of forest land for non-forest purposes and one of the 
conditions of the permission is that there should be compensatory 
afforestation, then the responsibility of the same should be that of user-
agency and it should be required to set apart a sum of money for doing the 
needful.  In such a case the State Government will have to provide or 
make available land on which reforestation can take place and this land 
may have to be made available either at the expense of the user-agency or 
of the State Government, as the State Government may decide.  It was 
decided that the scheme shall ensure that afforestation takes place as per 
the permissions which are granted and there should be no shortfall.  
The scheme was submitted by MOEF alongwith an affidavit dated 
22nd March, 2002.
</p><p id="p_8">	The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) on consideration of 
relevant material including the scheme submitted by MOEF made its report 
(IA 826) containing recommendations dated 9th August, 2002.  The report, 
taking note of the present system of compensatory afforestation as per 
guidelines issued by MOEF from time to time under the FC Act, the 
procedure for receipt and utilization of funds for compensatory 
afforestation, activities permissible under compensatory afforestation, 
adequate compensation for loss of forest land  recovery of Net Present 
Value, funds for catchment area, treatment plant and involvement of user-
agency for compensatory afforestation, made the following 
recommendations :
</p><p id="p_9">(a)	in addition to the funds realized for 
compensatory afforestation, net present 
value of the forest land diverted for non-
</p><p id="p_10">forestry purposes shall also be recovered 
from the user agencies, while according 
approval under the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_12">Forest (Conservation) 
Act</a>, 1980; 
</p><p id="p_11">(b)	a 'Compensatory Afforestation Fund' shall 
be created in which all the monies received 
from the user-agencies towards 
compensatory afforestation, additional 
compensatory afforestation, penal 
compensatory afforestation, net present 
value of forest land, Catchment Area 
Treatment Plan funds, etc., shall be 
deposited.  The rules, procedure and 
composition of the body for management of 
the Compensatory Afforestation Fund shall 
be finalized by the Ministry of Environment 
&amp; Forests with the concurrence of Central 
Empowered Committee within one month;
</p><p id="p_12">(c)	the funds received from the user-agencies 
in cases where forest land diverted falls 
within Protected Areas i.e. area notified 
under <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_13">Section 18</a>, <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_14">26A</a> or 35 of the <a href="/doc/1781078/" id="a_15">Wild Life 
(Protection) Act</a>, 1972, for undertaking 
activities related to protection of bio-
</p><p id="p_13">diversity, wildlife, etc., shall also be 
deposited in this Fund.  Such monies shall 
be used exclusively for undertaking 
protection and conservation activities in 
protected areas of the respective State/UT;
</p><p id="p_14">(d)	the amount received on account of 
compensatory afforestation but not spent or 
any balance amount lying with the State/UT 
or any amount that is yet to be recovered 
from the user agency shall also be 
deposited in this Fund;
</p><p id="p_15">(e)	besides artificial regeneration (plantations), 
the funds shall also be utilized for 
undertaking assisted natural regeneration, 
protection of forests and other related 
activities.  For this purpose, site specific 
plans should be prepared and implemented 
in a time bound manner;
</p><p id="p_16">(f)	the user agencies especially the large 
public sector undertakings such as Power 
Grid Corporation, NTPC, etc., which 
frequently require forest land for their 
projects should also be involved in 
undertaking compensatory afforestation by 
establishing Special Purpose Vehicle.  
</p><p id="p_17">Whereas the private sector user-agencies 
may be involved in monitoring and most 
importantly, in protection of compensatory 
afforestation.  Necessary procedure for this 
purpose would be laid down by the MOEF 
with the concurrence of the Central 
Empowered Committee.
</p><p id="p_18">(g)	Plantations must use local and indigenous 
species since exotics have long term 
negative impacts on the environment; and
</p><p id="p_19">(h)	an independent system of concurrent 
monitoring and evaluation shall be evolved 
and implemented through the 
Compensatory Afforestation Fund to 
ensure effective and proper utilization of 
funds.
</p>
<p id="p_20">	The aforesaid report, inter alia, notes that there was general 
consensus amongst the States/Union Territories that the present practice 
of concentrating only on artificial regeneration through plantations should 
be dispensed with as it does not adequately compensates the loss of 
natural forest and that a part of the fund should also be used for assisted 
natural regeneration wherein the natural forests are allowed to regenerate 
and grow by undertaking silvicultural and cultural operations such as fire 
tracing, singalling of seedlings, protection, etc.  These activities help in 
regenerating the rootstock which may exists in the degraded forests.  
Besides, this helps in restoring the natural forests, which is not possible 
through plantations.  It also noted that to compensate for the loss of 
tangible as well as intangible benefits flowing from the forest lands which 
has been diverted for non-forest use, the NPV of such land is being 
recovered from the user agency in the States of Madhya Pradesh, 
Chhattisgarh and Bihar.  In the states of Madhya Pradesh and 
Chhattisgarh, the NPV is being recovered at the rate of Rs.5.80 lac per 
hectare to Rs.9.20 lac per hectare of the forest land depending upon the 
quality and density of the forest land diverted for non-forestry use.  The 
underlying principle for recovery of NPV was that the plantations raised 
under the compensatory afforestation scheme could never adequately 
compensate for the loss of natural forests as the plantations require more 
time to mature and even then they are a poor substitute to natural forest.  It 
noted that States/Union Territories as well as MOEF are of the view that in 
addition to the funds realized for compensatory afforestation, the NPV of 
the forest land being directed for non-forestry purposes should also be 
recovered from the user-agencies.
</p><p id="p_21">	The MOEF, in principle, accepted the aforesaid recommendations of 
CEC.  The order dated 29th October, 2002 notices this fact.  Further 
noticing that no other State had filed any response to the report of CEC, 
the Court presumed that the State Governments were also not opposed to 
the said report and have accepted the same in the same manner as Union 
of India.  On detailed examination of the report, the recommendations of 
CEC were accepted and Union of India was directed to frame 
comprehensive rules with regard to the constitution of a body and 
management of the compensatory afforestation funds in concurrence with 
the CEC.  It was directed that the compensatory afforestation funds which 
had not yet been realized by the States shall be transferred to the 
aforesaid body by respective States and the user agencies within six 
months of its constitution.  In addition, while according approval under the 
FC Act for change in user, the user-agency shall also pay into the said 
fund, the NPV of forest land diverted for non-forest purposes at the rate of 
Rs.5.80 lac per hectare to Rs.9.20 lac per hectare of forest land depending 
upon the quality and density of the land in question converted for non-
forest use.  The amount was subject to upward revision by the MOEF in 
consultation with CEC as and when necessary.  The aforesaid 
recommendations of CEC were accepted.
</p><p id="p_22">	An application (I.A.No.1046) was filed by the MOEF, inter alia, 
seeking directions that the NPV calculation shall be part of the detailed 
project report submitted to it for a forestry clearance under the FC Act.  
During the course of hearing, learned Solicitor General informed this Court 
that the Government was agreeable to the suggestions of CEC that money 
received from user-agencies for compensatory afforestation fund should 
be kept in an interest bearing account, though initially it had some 
reservations about it.  Reference has also been made in the application 
about exemption being granted to some projects from payment of NPV, an 
aspect which we would consider later at an appropriate stage so also the 
basis of the calculation of the NPV. We may, however, note that although 
in the application it was stated that the format issued by the World Bank for 
calculation for NPV for the projects shall be the basis of its calculation, the 
learned Solicitor General stated that he was not relying upon the said 
format. Regarding the mining projects, the application mentions that there 
has to be difference in approach for mineral of high volume and low 
volume and low value and minerals of high value and low volume.  It is 
stated that levying of flat rates of NPV per hectare basis will, therefore, not 
be rational.  The application states that in case of mining, NPV should be 
calculated at the rate of 10% for the major minerals and 5% for the minor 
minerals to be levied on the annual royalty.    An application (IA 1047) has 
also been filed by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India taking similar 
pleas as are taken in IA 1046 seeking directions that in mining NPV may 
be calculated at the rate of 10% and 5% as above noted.
	Now, we may refer to Notification dated 23rd April, 2004 issued by 
MOEF in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (3) of Section 3

</p>

<p id="p_49">	Clause 6.6 provides for other functions and reads thus:
"(i)	The CAMPA may establish Special

new mechanism to generate additional 
sources of fund for forest conservation 
works and to create capacity and data base

</p>

<p id="p_51">	Having regard to the nature of the functions of the Executive Body of 
the CAMPA, we find substance in the suggestion of learned Amicus Curiae 
that there should be more involvement of NGOs by including in the 
Executive Body, the conservationists, environmentalists, economists and 
experts in forestry.  We are of the view that the Executive Body deserves 
to be expanded as, presently, only one professional ecologist is its 
member, remaining all being officers of the Government.  We may note 
here that a forthright and fair stand was taken by the learned Solicitor 
General not only in regard to the constitution of CAMPA but on other 
aspects also, keeping in view the non-adversarial nature of the litigation.  
Learned Solicitor General submitted that the Government is committed to 
conserve the forest and protect the environments, and would implement, in 
letter and spirit, the directions issued by this Court.  
In view of above, we direct that clause 2.2 shall be suitably amended 
so as to include two more environmentalists, one of whom may be expert 
in the field of forest and the other in the field of forest economy 
development.  These members shall be included in the Executive Body in 
consultation with the Chairperson of the CEC.
	Regarding clause 6.3(iv), it was suggested that there should be 
corporate accounting based on double entry system and auditing should 
be conducted by the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG).  We see 
substance in this suggestion as well.
</p><p id="p_52">	Clause (v) in 6.4 provides that the monies received in CAMPA shall 
be used only in that particular State or Union Territory.  The clause seems 
to be too rigid.  Many a times, the effect of degradation of environment or 
depletion of forest can be felt more in the adjoining area which may be in a 
different State or Union Territory.  The effect of environmental degradation 
cannot be restricted to a particular area.  The impact cannot be limited to 
the place of origin.  Therefore, we direct that a suitable modification of the 
clause shall be made so as to provide that ordinarily expenditure shall be 
incurred in the particular State or Union Territory but leaving it to the 
discretion of the CAMPA to also incur expenditure in the State or Union 
Territory other than the one mentioned in clause 6.2 if it considers it 
necessary.
</p><p id="p_53">Clause 6.6 which by use of the word 'may' leaves it to the discretion 
of the CAMPA to establish Special Performance Vehicle (SPV) for 
undertaking compensatory afforestation deserves to be amended so as to 
substitute the word 'may' by the word 'shall' so that the regeneration is 
done by some SPV in specified areas.
</p><p id="p_54">	Now, we come to the question of the guiding principle to be laid for 
determining the NPV.  Reference was made to opinions of various experts 
laying down as to what is the concept of NPV and how it is to be 
calculated.  The question is also about the legal and jurisdictional basis to 
levy NPV.  Most of the States did not object to the recovery of the NPV 
from the user-agency but strenuously urged that since the land under the 
forest belongs to the State, the amount deposited by the user-agency as 
NPV shall be paid to them.  It was also contended on behalf of the States 
that there should be no NPV on degraded forest.  The further submission 
was that all public utility projects shall be exempted from payment of NPV.  
On the other hand, relying upon the principles of inter-generational equity 
and sustainable development, Mr. Harish Salve, learned senior counsel 
and Amicus Curiae contended that forest is a part of eco-system and, 
therefore, the value to be put and calculated is not only on trees and 
leaves but the basis has to be the preservation of bio-diversity.  It is 
submitted that NPV is to be levied and collected not because property 
rights of the States are affected but on account of effect on ecology by 
conversion of forest land for non-forest purpose.  Further, Mr. Salve 
submits that the basis for calculation of NPV should be the economic 
value, spread over a period of 50 years, which would be regenerational 
value for forest regeneration to be taken into account as opposed to 
restoration value, i.e., financial value.  Regarding legal and jurisdictional 
basis to levy NPV, Mr. Salve contended that there are various legal 
principles which act as source of power to levy NPV.  In this regard, 
reference has been made to provision of the FC Act, EP Act and Forest 
Policy of 1988.  It is contended that these enactments and the policy are 
the measures taken by the legislature and the Government to discharge 
the constitutional obligation to protect the environments.  Reliance is also 
placed upon the doctrine of public trust, which learned counsel submits is a 
constitutional doctrine.
</p><p id="p_55">First, we may consider the meaning of NPV and determine what is 
NPV.
</p><p id="p_56">	The NPV is the present value (PV) of net cash flow from a project, 
discounted by the cost of capital.
</p><p id="p_57">	Forestry is a public project.  It is important to bear in mind that a 
benefit received today is worth more than that received later.  The benefit 
received today is in fact 'cost incurred' today.  Time value of the cash 
inflow/outflow is important in investment appraisal.  NPV is a method by 
which future expenditures (costs) and benefit are levelised in order to 
account for the time value of money.  The object behind NPV is to levelise 
costs.  What is the value of Rupee today would not be the value of Rupee 
say 50 years later.  For example, let us have the starting point of value of 
Rupee in India in the year 2005 and analyse it with the value of Rupee that 
may be in the year 2050.  Cost incurred or to be incurred in 2050 have to 
be discounted by using appropriate parameters like rate of discount, 
gestation period, ratio of deflators to GDP.  Therefore, expenses incurred 
in each year between say 2005 and 2050 have to be brought down to their 
present values by using appropriate discount rate in the NPV.
	The project like forestry has long gestation period of 40-50 years.  It 
goes through cost cycles each year depending upon inflation, rate of 
interest, internal rate of return etc.  Therefore, costs for the year 2005 will 
differ from the cost of 2006 and cost of 2006 will differ from that of the year 
2007 and so on and so forth.  However, this constitutes what is called as 
conventional method of accounting cost which does not take into account 
social and economic cost of diversion of forest.
	Cost is a function of the discount rate (a measure of the value of 
capital) used.  Under NPV, all costs are discounted to some reference date 
which we have taken as 2005 for illustration.  The total cost reckoned at 
this reference date is the sum of present value or future value of costs 
discounted to the year 2005.  Similarly, one can calculate the present 
value of the revenues from the expected benefits of forest regeneration.  
	The question then is why charge NPV.  In the case of a conventional 
project like Hydro-electric Project, the accounting procedure is normally 
based on Return On Investment (ROI) in which the unit cost of energy 
includes return on capital, investment, depreciation of capital, annual fuel 
cost and operational and maintenance costs.  However, ROI excludes the 
time value of money.  It also excludes the gestation period of the project.  
Therefore, we have the NPV method which discounts future costs and 
future benefits by use of appropriate discount rate and brings down such 
costs and benefits to the reference date which in the present case has 
been assumed to be the year 2005.
</p><p id="p_58">	The question, which we have to answer, is concerning the relevance 
of fixing appropriate discount rate in valuation of the costs and benefits 
arising from forestry as a project.
</p><p id="p_59">	The value of any asset is discounted by present value of the 
economic benefits it will generate in future years.  For example, timber 
asset value is the discounted future stumpage price for mature timber after 
deducting costs of bringing the timber to maturity.  NPV is one of the 
methods for valuation of standing timber.  The general expression V for the 
value of an asset, in the base year O, is simply the sum of the net 
economic benefits it yields in each year over the life time, T, of the Asset, 
discounted to the present value by the discounted rate.
	The current method of valuing public sector projects, like forestry, 
has become contentious as public sector undertakings agrees for lower 
discount rate on account of long gestation period.  However, the flaw with 
this argument is that the low rate of return is computed without including 
the intangible or environmental impacts/benefits emanating from forest. 
	How does one value the intangibles?  There are several methods, 
viz, opportunity cost, replacement cost, travel cost, contingent value 
method (CVM) and social benefit cost analysis (SBCA).
	SBCA can be applied to the evaluation of environmental impacts of 
forestry projects.  Here, one must appreciate that the environmental 
outputs from forests appear as public goods for which there is no market.  
Various environmental outputs can be classified into this category, namely, 
	Flood Control Benefits
Water Production
Soil Conservation
Outdoor Recreation
Biodiversity &amp; Conservation
Habitat
Air Purification

	The problem in valuation of the above outputs is: allocation of fixed 
costs according to the contribution of each product in total revenue.  This is 
because except contribution of timber product, contribution of the other 
above-noted outputs is not known, especially intangible outputs.  However, 
under SBCA, benefits from each of the above environmental outputs are 
identifiable.  For example, flood control benefits arise because of the role 
of forests as stream regulator.  Similarly, valuation method for each of the 
above outputs differs.  In valuing biodiversity, CVM is useful.  SBCA is 
helpful in placing monetary value on carbon storage on air purification.
	The point is that for each of the above functions of the forests, 
different methods of valuation have to be applied.  Various methods have 
been used to estimate the value of environment like CVM, Opportunity 
Cost Method, Travel Cost Method, SBCA etc.  It would be appropriate if 
body of experts examine the aspect and report to this Court suggesting the 
best method depending on factors like gestation period, rate of discount 
(interest), density of the forest, social benefits of the project undertaken by 
PSU etc.  They will take into account economic values associated with 
forests, viz., direct use values, indirect use values such as value of 
environmental benefits from the forest, option values and existence value.
	The above discussion shows that NPV helps levelising the costs of 
public projects like forestry.  It is an important tool of SBCA.  Under SBCA, 
benefits from each of the above environmental outputs are identifiable.  
Hence, applying NPV, one can allocate levelised costs according to the 
contribution of each product in the total revenue. It is important to bear in 
mind that a benefit or cost received or incurred now is worth more than that 
received or incurred later.  Therefore, using the appropriate discount rate 
helps to aggregate marginal benefits and costs.  The choice of interest rate 
depends upon time preference.  For public project, such as forestry, a 
social discount rate, which indicates time preference of the society, should 
be used.
</p><p id="p_60">	Forest sustainability is an integral part of forest management and 
policy that also has a unique dominating feature and calls for forest owners 
and society to make a long-term (50 years or longer) commitment to 
manage the forest for future generation.  One of the viewpoints for 
sustaining forest is a naturally functioning forest ecosystem.  This view 
point takes a man and nature relationship to the point of endorsing to, the 
extent possible, the notion of letting forest develop and process without 
significant human intervention.  A strong adoption of the naturalistic value 
system that whatever nature does is better than what humans do, this is 
almost the "nature dominates man" perspective.  Parks and natural reserve 
creations; non-intervention in insect, disease and fire process; and 
reduction of human activities are typical policy situation.  This viewpoint 
has been endorsed by 1988 Forest Policy of Government of India.  
Yet another viewpoint recognizes the pragmatic reality faced by the 
governments and the administrative, namely, trees don't vote while people 
do.  Some of the criteria reflecting key elements of ecological, economic 
and social sustainability are:
</p><p id="p_61">1.	Conservation of biological diversity.
</p><p id="p_62">2.	Maintenance of productive capacity of forest 
ecosystems.
</p><p id="p_63">3.	Maintenance of forest ecosystem health and vitality.
</p><p id="p_64">4.	Conservation and maintenance of soil and water 
resources.
</p><p id="p_65">5.	Maintenance of forest contribution to global carbon 
cycles.
</p><p id="p_66">6.	Maintenance and enhancement of long-term multiple 
socioeconomic benefits to meet the needs of societies.
</p><p id="p_67">7.	Legal, institutional and economic framework for forest 
conservation and sustainable management.
</p>

<p id="p_68">	An expert dealing with principles and applications of forest valuation, 
on the aspect of value of inputs and outcomes and conditions, says :
"Decision making in forest management requires 
that we understand the relative values of inputs, 
outcomes, and conditions.  Cost values for inputs 
such as labour, capital, interest, supplies, legal 
advice, trades, and other management activities 
as well as the market value of existing timber 
stands are relatively easy to obtain.  Outcomes or 
resulting condition values are more difficult, but 
we need measures of the values of timberland, 
recreation, water, wildlife, visual amenities, 
biodiversity, environmental services, and 
ecological process to help guide management 
decisions.  By understanding market, social and 
other values of forests, we can better allocate our 
scarce and valuable resources to attain the 
desired mix of outcomes and conditions."
</p>

<p id="p_69">	The emphasis is on ecosystem, management philosophy that has 
greater emphasis on integration, biological diversity and ecological 
processes.
</p><p id="p_70">	In respect of working economic values of the outcome, it is said:
"In real world forest management situations, 
decision makers are faced with several 
alternatives and potentially large sets of criteria 
related to the ecological, economic and social 
impacts of these alternatives.  It would be very 
easy to generate a nearly incomprehensible table 
that documented every physical, biological, 
economic, and social outcome and condition 
resulting from each management alternative.  
Such information could include outcome levels for 
water yield, sediment production, and timber 
growth; population trends for important wildlife 
species; and recreation use for backcountry and 
developed recreation sites.  Similarly, information 
on the economic value of these outcomes can be 
estimated by means of the methods discussed in 
chapter 8 and added to our impact table.  To this 
avalanche of information, we could add the 
impacts on the social well-being of local and 
regional communities.  The forest management 
analyst can easily overwhelm the decision 
makers and stakeholders with information."
</p>

<p id="p_71">	Dealing with fundamental of decision analyses to achieve ecological, 
economic and social goals, it is said that what is to be broadly kept in view 
is:
</p><p id="p_72">"Ecological and environmental goals are 
important to forest managers, landowners, and 
their stakeholders, we need information about 
how decision alternatives affect such goals.  
These goals can be broadly stated as 
</p><p id="p_73">1.	Maintaining and enhancing forest productivity
</p><p id="p_74">2.	Conservation of biological diversity
</p><p id="p_75">3.	Protecting and enhancing environmental 
conditions."
</p>

<p id="p_76">The aforesaid also shows that NPV as a tool of SBCA is required to 
be based on Total Economic Value (TEV).  It indicates the components of 
TEV.  It further shows what are the type of agency or experts which are 
required to examine these issues.
</p><p id="p_77">	Dealing with co-relation between economics and environmental 
management, in 'Environmental Economics in practice' edited by Mr. 
Gopal K. Kadekodi in his write up through case studies, answers the 
question as to what has economics got to do with environmental 
management.  The author says that economics is the science of explaining 
the behaviour of different agents who take part in production, consumption 
and distribution activities in the economy and make decisions regarding 
the use of resources.  That, environmental economics focuses on market 
and non-market behaviour of different agents in the society regarding 
natural and environmental resources, viewed from intergenerational, inter-
temporal and different institutional frameworks.  (Emphasis supplied by us)
	It is further stated that one of the major branches of economic theory 
is the 'theory of value'.  Economic theory always makes a distinction 
between value and price.  Answering the question as to why value natural 
resources specifically, it is stated that one reason is that there is no market 
for ecosystem services such as nutritional cycle, carbon sequestration, 
watershed functions, temperature control, soil conservation etc.  It is also 
stated that assuming there are markets, they do not do their job well.  This 
market may be regulated one.  There may be restrictions on entry as a 
result of licensing or rationing introduced by the Government.  For the 
above reasons, it is concluded that valuation beyond the present is 
necessary and for natural resource Accounting NPV method is a must.
	Mr. Salve advocates for Total Economic Value (TEV) on the ground 
that TEV expresses the full range of value or benefits  both tangible and 
intangible.  Basically, it is understood that natural and environmental 
resources provide several 'use values' and 'non-use values' to enhance 
human welfare and provide sustainability to all lives (often termed as 
anthropogenic values).  Conceptually, it is the sum of use values (UV) and 
non-use value (NUV) which constitutes the TEV.  Further elaborations UV, 
option value (OV) non-use value (NUV) etc. have been given.  The UV, it is 
stated, can be further broadly classified into three groups  direct, indirect 
and option values.  Direct Use Values (DUV) refer to the current use 
(consumption) of the resources and services provided directly by natural 
and environmental resources.  Examples are the use of timber and non-
timber forest products.  Recreation (tourism to wildlife sanctuaries or 
Himalayan Glaciers, mountains), education, research etc., are examples of 
direct non-consumptive use values.  Indirect Use Values (IUV) generally 
are referred to the ecological functions that natural resource environments 
provide.  It can be broadly classified into three groups  watershed values, 
ecosystem services and evolutionary processes.  The Optional Value (OV) 
is associated with the benefits received by retaining the option of using a 
resource (say a river basin) in the future by protecting or preserving it 
today, when its future demand and supply is uncertain.  Take the example 
of the Narmada river basin.  
</p><p id="p_78">It is not necessary to delve further in this matter since ultimately it 
would be for the experts to examine and assist this Court as to the Model 
to be adopted for valuation, namely, TEV, CVM, SBCA etc.  It is for the 
experts to tell us as to what NPV should be applied in case of mines and 
different types of forests.  We may only note that basis of these valuations 
is the theory of sustainable development, i.e., development that meets the 
needs of the present without compromising with the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs.  Despite various elaborations, 
definition of sustainable development, though very old, still is widely 
accepted world over and has been reiterated by this Court in catena of 
cases.
</p><p id="p_79">	Regarding the parameters for valuation of loss of forest, we may 
only note as to what is stated by Ministry of Environment and Forests, 
Government in its handbook laying down guidelines and clarifications upto 
June 2004 while considering the grant of approval under Section 2 of the 
FC Act.  Dealing with environmental losses (soil erosion, effect on 
hydrological cycle, wildlife habitat, microclimate upsetting of ecological 
balance), the guidelines provide that though technical judgment would be 
primarily applied in determining the losses, as a thumb rule, the 
environmental value of one hectare of fully stocked forest (density 1.0) 
would be taken as Rs.126.74 lakhs to accrue over a period of 50 years.  
The value will reduce with density, for example, if density is 0.4, the value 
will work out at Rs.50.696 lakhs.  So, if a project which requires 
deforestation of 1 hectare of forest of density 0.4 gives monetary returns 
worth over Rs.50.696 lakhs over a period of 50 years, may be considered 
to give a positive cost benefit ratio.  The figure of assumed environmental 
value will change if there is an increase in bank rate; the change will be 
proportional to percentage increase in the bank rate.  Ms. Kanchan 
Chopra, while conducting the case study of Keoladeo National Park in 
respect of economic valuation of biodiversity at the institute of economic 
growth, Delhi as a part of the Capacity 21 project sponsored by the UNDP 
and MOEF, Government of India examined the question as to what kind of 
values are to be taken into consideration.  As per the study, different 
components of biodiversity system possess different kinds of value (1) a 
commodity value (as for instance the value of grass in a park), (2) an 
amenity value (the recreation value of the park) and/or (3) a moral value 
(the right of the flora and fauna of the park to exist).  It is recognized that it 
is difficult to value ecosystem, since it possesses a large number of 
characteristic, more than just market oriented ones.  It also leads to the 
need to carry out bio-diversity valuation both in terms of its market linkage 
and the existence value outside the market as considered relevant by a set 
of pre-identified stakeholders.  It is, however, evident that while working 
out bio-diversity valuation, it is not trees and the leaves but is much more.  
Various techniques for valuing biodiversity that have been developed to 
assess the value of living resources and habitats rich in such resources 
have been considered by the author for her case study while considering 
the aspect of value, their nature and stakeholders interest.  In so far as the 
value of ecology function in which the stakeholders or scientists, tourists, 
village residents, non-users, the nature of value is  regulation of water, 
nutrient cycle, flood control.  These instances have been noted to highlight 
the importance of the biodiversity valuation to protect the environments.  
The conclusions and the policy recommendations of the author are:
"Biodiversity valuation has important implications 
for decision making with respect to alternative 
uses of land, water and biological resources.  
Since all value does not get reflected in markets, 
its valuation also raises methodological problems 
regarding the kinds of value that are being 
captured by the particular technique being used.  
Simultaneously, in the context of a developing 
country, it is important to evolve methods of 
management that enable self-financing 
mechanisms of conservation.  This implies that 
biodiversity value for which a market exists must 
be taken note of, while simultaneously making 
sure that the natural capital inherent in 
biodiversity rich areas is preserved and values 
which are crucial for some stakeholders but 
cannot be expressed in the market are reflected 
in societal decision making.
</p><p id="p_80">	A focus on both the above aspects is 
necessary.  It is important to take note of the 
nature of market demand for aspects of 
biodiversity that stakeholders, such as tourists, 
express a revealed preference for by way of 
paying a price for it.  Simultaneously, it is 
important to examine the extent to which a 
convergence or divergence exists between value 
perceptions of this and other categories of 
stakeholders.  It is in this spirit that two alternative 
methodologies are used here to arrive at an 
economic valuation of biodiversity in Keoladeo 
National Park.  The travel-cost methodology 
captures the market-linked values of tourism and 
recreation.  It throws up the following policy 
implications :
</p><p id="p_81">1.	Keeping in mind the location of the park 
and the consequent joint product nature of 
its services, cost incurred locally is a better 
index of the price paid by tourists.  It is 
found that demand for tourism services is 
fairly insensitive to price.  A redistribution of 
the benefits and costs of the park through 
an increase in entry fee would not affect the 
demand for its services.
</p><p id="p_82">2.	Cross-substitution between different 
categories of stakeholders can improve the 
financial management of the wetland.  A 
part of the proceeds can go to the local 
management. Also, high-income tourists, 
scientists and even non-users with a stake 
in preservation can pay for or compensate 
low-income stakeholders for possible loss 
in welfare due to limits on extraction and 
use.
</p><p id="p_83">3.	However, the limit to such a policy is 
determined by the number of visitors and 
their possible impact on the health of the 
wetland.  Such a constraint did not appear 
to be operational in the context of the 
present park.
</p><p id="p_84">Identification and ranking of values of different 
aspects of biodiversity resources as perceived 
and expressed by different categories of 
stakeholders namely scientists, tourists, local 
villagers and non-users is an important object in 
the process of valuation.  In the KNP study, a fair 
degree of congruence with respect of ecological 
function value and livelihood value is discovered 
to exist in the perceptions of diverse groups.  
Stakeholders as diverse as scientists, tourists, 
local villagers and non-users give high rankings to 
these uses."

<p id="p_85">Next question is to which expert reference shall be made.  Counsel 
for parties agree that Institute of Medical Economic Growth is an institute 
of eminence having been set up about half a century earlier.  It has also 
been pointed out that this Institute is getting regular maintenance and 
development grant from Indian Council of Social Sciences research 
(ICSSR).   Further, it appears that the Institute is also receiving research 
and training grants from Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health and Family 
Welfare and Ministry of Agriculture, besides National Bank for Agriculture 
and Rural Development.  We have been informed that eminent faculty 
members in the institute are engaged in the field of research and  
Ms.Kanchan Chopra, (Ph.D. Economics, University of Delhi) is one such 
faculty member and her field of specialization is resources and 
environmental economics, agriculture and rural development and project 
evaluation.  The matter deserves to be referred to a committee of experts 
in respect whereof we will in latter part of the judgment issue appropriate 
directions.
</p><p id="p_86">	Next, we will deal with the contention of Mr. Venugopal who, 
appearing for State of Kerala, submitted that the State has no objection to 
the levy of NPV but the amount so received should come to the State.  
Referring to Notification dated 23rd April, 2004 constituting CAMPA, 
learned counsel contended that clause 6.4 of the said Notification, which 
deals with disbursement of the funds, does not envisage the amount being 
disbursed to the State Government.  Learned senior counsel also 
challenged the constitutional validity of the Notification.  The contention put 
forth is that the Notification does not have any Parliamentary or Legislative 
control.  Referring to various clauses of the notification, it was contended 
that fund sought to be created under CAMPA lacks accountability and puts 
aside financial control.  There is a total lack of financial discipline which, 
learned counsel contends, is against the constitutional framework.  It was 
further contended that the forests vest in the Government; the same are 
State properties and, therefore, all amounts received shall go to 
Consolidated Fund of India or Consolidated Fund of the State or to Public 
Funds, as the case may be.  Reference has also been made to the 
provisions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General (Duties, Powers and 
Conditions of Service) Act, 1971 (for short, the 'CAG Act') and the 
submission is that no provision under the Notification shows that the 
account can be subjected to audit under the CAG Act.  The contention, in 
short, is that constitutionally it is not permissible to any person or authority 
to hold funds collect on behalf of the Government.  This is basis for urging 
that the Notification dated 23rd April, 2004 is unconstitutional.  
	For examining the nature of the fund sought to be regulated by 
CAMPA, brief reference is necessary to be made to some of constitutional 
provisions.

</p><p id="p_97">Chapter III of CAG Act deals with duties and powers of the 
Comptroller and Auditor-General.  <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_27">Section 10</a> thereof deals with 
compilation of accounts of Union and the States by CAG.  Under <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_28">Section 
11</a>, the CAG is required to prepare and submit accounts to the President, 
Governors of State and Administrators of Union Territories having 
Legislative Assemblies.  Under <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_29">Section 12</a>, CAG is required to give 
information and render assistance to the Union Government and the State 
Governments.  <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_30">Section 13</a> sets out general provisions relating to audit.  
Under this provision, it shall be the duty of the CAG to audit all expenditure 
from the Consolidated Fund of India and of each State and of each Union 
Territory having a Legislative Assembly and to ascertain whether the 
moneys shown in the accounts as having been disbursed were legally 
available for and applicable to the service or purpose to which they have 
been applied or charged and whether the expenditure conforms to the

manufacturing, profit and loss accounts and balance sheet and other 
subsidiary accounts kept in any department of the union or of a State; and 
in each case to report on the expenditure, transactions or accounts so

<a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_36">Section 20</a> is in the nature of a residuary provision providing that CAG, if 
requested by the President of India or the Governor of the State or the 
Administrator of Union of Territory having a Legislative Assembly to 
undertake the audit of the accounts of such other body or authority of 
which audit has been entrusted to CAG, the CAG shall undertake such 
audit.  Chapter III shows the responsibility of CAG to conduct audit in the 
manner provided in the law or on request made for the audit in the manner 
provided under <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_37">Section 20</a>.
</p><p id="p_98">Relying on aforesaid constitutional provisions and also of CAG Act, it 
was contended that the notification constituting CAMPA is unconstitutional 
as it does not stipulate that the amounts collected on behalf of Government 
shall go to the relevant consolidation fund or to public fund.  Further, no 
provision has been made for audit under the CAT Act.  To examine this 
contention, it is necessary to determine the nature of Fund dealt with by 
CAMPA.  
</p><p id="p_99">The background under which the fund came to be created has 
already been noted.  Noticing fast depletion of forests, the fund was 
ordered to be utilized for protection of forests and environments.  The 
environments are not the State property and are national asset.  It is the 
obligation of all to conserve the environments and for its utilization, it is 
necessary to have regard to the principles of sustainable development and 
inter-generational equity.  
</p><p id="p_100">Reverting now specifically to forests, if it becomes necessary for 
economic development to use the same for non-forest purpose, then 
before grant of permission for diversion of forest land, there should be 
some scheme whereunder loss occurring due to such diversion can be 
made up by adopting both short term measures as well as long term 
measures one of it being a regeneration programme. Natural regeneration 
is a long process. It requires huge amounts. It requires a policy and 
direction. It requires proper use of funds for regeneration of depleted forest 
and ecology. The natural resources like forests are in trust with the present 
generation. In this light, various statutes noted above have been enacted 
by the Parliament. Keeping in view the letter and spirit of those statutes 
and constitutional provisions, the legality of CAMPA and the power to issue 
directions for natural regeneration and utilization of funds is required to be 
appreciated. The body set up or fund generated to protect ecology and 
provide for regeneration cannot in constitutional scheme of things be 
considered and treated as a fund under <a href="/doc/1532561/" id="a_38">Article 266</a> or <a href="/doc/1665558/" id="a_39">Article 283</a> or <a href="/doc/335021/" id="a_40">Article 
284</a> of the Constitution of India. When seen in this light, neither <a href="/doc/72095/" id="a_41">Article 110</a> 
nor <a href="/doc/1862193/" id="a_42">Article 199</a> and/or <a href="/doc/1254651/" id="a_43">Article 294</a> or 195 would have any application.  
There is an additional reason for the view that NPV will not fall under 
<a href="/doc/72095/" id="a_44">Article 110</a> or 199 or 195 of the Constitution.  Our constitution draws a 
distinct line between a "TAX" and a "FEE".  In case of <a href="/doc/1307370/" id="a_45">Ratilal Panachand 
Gandhi v. State of Bombay &amp; Ors</a>. [1954 SCR 1055], one of the 
questions which arose for determination was regarding constitutional 
validity of Section 58 of Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950.  That section 
makes it obligatory on every Public Trust to pay to the Administration Fund 
a contribution at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed.  
Under the rules, the contribution was fixed at the rate of 2% per annum 
upon the gross annual income of every Public Trust.  Failure to pay such 
contribution was made liable to penalty under <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_46">Section 66</a> of the Act.  It was 
contended on behalf of the Trustees that the levy of contribution under 
<a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_47">Section 58</a> was in substance the levy of a tax, it was beyond the 
competence of the State legislature to enact such a provision.  This 
argument was rejected by this Court by holding that the Administration 
Fund constituted under Section 57 of Bombay Public Trust Act was a 
Special Fund which was to be applied exclusively for payment of charges 
for expenses incidental to the regulation of Public Trusts and in carrying 
into effect the provisions of the Act.  Under Section 57 Special Fund vested 
in the Charity Commissioner.  That Fund was set up from the charges 
levied on various Trusts in the State.  The Fund was to be managed by the 
Charity Commissioner.  All investments were to be made by the Charity 
Commissioner.  All disbursements were to be made by him in the manner 
prescribed by the rules.   The collections of these charges, deployed in the  
Special  Fund,  were  not  merged  in the general revenue, but these 
collections were earmarked and set apart for the purposes of the Act.  This 
Court further noticed that the Charity Commissioner and the servants 
appointed under the Act drew their salary from the Consolidated Fund of 
the State.  However, this Court observed that <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_48">Section 57</a> was enacted to 
facilitate the Administration and not with a view to mix up the Fund with the 
general revenue collected for government purposes.  Therefore, this Court 
held that Public Trusts Administration Fund was set up to meet all 
expenses of the administration of Trust property within the scheme of the 
Act and it is to meet such expenses that they levy was made and 
collections were effected.  Therefore, this Court held that such payments 
were levied for rendering service which the State considers beneficial in 
public interest.  In the circumstances, it was held that <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_49">Section 57</a> and 
<a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_50">Section 58</a> of the 1950 Act were not ultra vires the State legislature 
because they did not levy a tax but they levied a fee which came within 
Entry 47 of List III of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, which reads as 
under:
</p><p id="p_101">"47.  Fees in respect of any of the matters in this 
List, but not including fees taken in any court."
</p>
<p id="p_102">	Thus reading Entry 47 with Entry 20 of the same List, the imposition 
of NPV is a charge or a fee which falls within Entry 47 read with Entry 20 of 
List III of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.  The Fund set up is a part 
"of economic and social planning" which comes within Entry 20 of List III 
and the charge which is levied for that purpose would come under Entry 47 
of List III and, therefore, <a href="/doc/72095/" id="a_51">Article 110</a> is not attracted.
To sustain ecological, economic and social values, in so far as 
forests are concerned, primarily, it is a question of Forest Management. In 
the introduction chapter of Forest Management, Fourth Edition, co-
authored by Lawrence S. Davis, Professor Emeritus, University of 
California-Brakeley, K. Norman Johnson, Orgeon State University, Peter S. 
Bettinger, Orgeon State University and Theodore E. Howard, University of 
New Hampshire, authors have said that "forest management remains the 
attempt to guide forests toward a society's goals.  A forest manager is the 
catalyst of this effort. As such, the manager needs an earthy 
understanding of biological process; a knowledge of animals and their 
habitats; an appreciation  of streams and their environments; the long-
range viewpoint of a planner; the patience of a labour negotiator, the skills 
of an administrator; and the alertness, flexibility and all-round 
resourcefulness of a successful business executive.  Above all, the forest 
manager requires a genuine sense and feeling for the forest as an entity."  
This objective is to be borne in mind while considering the question of 
ecology as opposed to mere compensatory afforestation.  Compensatory 
afforestation is only a small portion in the long range efforts in the field of 
regeneration.  It has been said that recognizing the aforesaid uniqueness 
while applying the principles of management is the heart of forest 
management.
</p><p id="p_103">Forest Management planning involves a blend of ecological, 
economic and social systems with the economic and social sides of 
planning often just as complex as the ecological sides.  Table 1.1 gives 
examples of decisions needed in the management of forest as under :

<p id="p_105">When permission is granted by the Government of India to use the 
forest land for non-forest purposes, it is not unconditional.  Conditions are 
attached mainly with a view to protect the environments and to make good 
the loss likely to occur by grant of such permission.  The payment into 
such a fund or imposition of conditions are for the protection of natural 
resources.  The Notification dated 23rd April, 2004 sets up a body to which 
payment is made so that the said body can carry out the statutory and 
constitutional obligations.  Since the amount does not go to the accounts 
postulated by <a href="/doc/1665558/" id="a_52">Article 283</a>, the said provision shall have no application.  
Similarly, the provisions of the CAG Act would also have no application.  At 
the same time, it may be noted that clause 6.3 stipulates the audit through 
Chartered Accountants on the panel of CAG. In order to provide for 
financial discipline, transparency and accountability, it would be 
appropriate to provide for corporate accounting on the principles of double 
entry system.  We are further of the view that the accounts of the Fund 
shall be subjected to internal Statutory Audit, the Statutory Auditors to be 
taken from the panel of CAG.  The internal audit shall be conducted every 
six months.
</p><p id="p_106">The duty to preserve natural resources in pristine purity has been 
highlighted in <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_53">M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath &amp; Ors</a>. [(1997) 1 SCC 388].  
After considering the opinion of various renowned authors and decisions 
rendered by other countries as well on environment and ecology, this 
Court held that the notion that the public has a right to expect certain lands 
and natural areas to retain their natural characteristics is finding its way 
into the law of the land.  The Court accepted the applicability of public trust 
doctrine and held that it was founded on the ideas that certain common 
properties such as rivers, sea-shore, forests and the air were held by the 
Government in trusteeship for the free and unimpeded use of the general 
public.  These natural resources have a great importance to the people as 
a whole that it would wholly unjustified to make them subject to private 
ownership.  These resources being a gift of nature, should be made freely 
available to everyone irrespective of the status in life.  The doctrine enjoins 
upon the Government to protect the resources for the enjoyment of the 
general public rather than to permit their use for private ownership or 
commercial purposes.  It was held that our legal system  based on 
English common law  includes the public trust doctrine as part of its 
jurisprudence.  The State is the trustee of all natural resources which are 
by nature meant for public use and enjoyment.  Public at large is the 
beneficiary of these resources.  The State as a trustee is under a legal 
duty to protect these natural resources.  Summing up the Court said :
"We are fully aware that the issues presented in 
this case illustrate the classic struggle between 
those members of the public who would preserve 
our rivers, forests, parks and open lands in their 
pristine purity and those charged with 
administrative responsibilities who, under the 
pressures of the changing needs of an 
increasingly complex society, find it necessary to 
encroach to some extent upon open lands 
heretofore considered inviolate to change.  The 
resolution of this conflict in any given case is for 
the legislature and not the courts.  If there is a law 
made by Parliament or the State Legislatures the 
courts can serve as an instrument of determining 
legislative intent in the exercise of its powers of 
judicial review under the Constitution.  But in the 
absence of any legislation, the executive acting 
under the doctrine of public trust cannot abdicate 
the natural resources and convert them into 
private ownership, or for commercial use.  The 
aesthetic use and the pristine glory of the natural 
resources, the environment and the ecosystems 
of our country cannot be permitted to be eroded 
for private, commercial or any other use unless 
the courts find it necessary, in good faith, for the 
public good and in public interest to encroach 
upon the said resources."
</p>
<p id="p_107">In view of above, we hold that the natural resources are not 
ownership of any one State or individual, public at large is its beneficiary 
and, therefore, the contention of Mr. Venugopal that the amount of NPV 
shall be made over to the State Government cannot be accepted.
<a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_54">The Indian Forest Act</a> was enacted to consolidate the law relating to 
forests, the transit of forest-produce and the duty leviable on timber and 
other forest-produce.  The focus of this Act is on the proprietary rights.  
<a href="/doc/1870616/" id="a_55">Section 3</a> empowers the State Government to constitute any forest land or 
waste land which is the property of the Government or over which the 
Government has proprietary rights, or to the whole or any part of the forest 
produce of which the Government is entitled in a reserved forest in the 
manner provided in the Act.  As provided in <a href="/doc/1728291/" id="a_56">Section 5</a>, no right can be 
acquired over the land in respect whereof notification has been issued 
under <a href="/doc/143180/" id="a_57">Section 4</a>.  In the manner provided in <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_58">Section 11</a>, the Forest 
Settlement Officer is empowered to acquire the land.  <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_59">Section 20</a> provides 
for declaration of reserved forest.  No right in or over a reserved forest can 
be acquired, as provided in <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_60">Section 23</a>.  Acts prohibited in respect of 
forests have been incorporated in <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_61">Section 25</a>.  <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_62">Section 29</a> deals with 
declaration of protect forest and <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_63">Section 30</a> empowers the State 
Government to issue notification reserving trees etc. in a protected forest.  
The power of the State Government for protection of forest has been 
provided in <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_64">Section 35</a>.  The power to impose duty on timber and other 
forest produce is contained in <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_65">Section 39</a> of the Act.
From the above, it can be seen that scheme of 1927 Act is a State 
management and regulation of the forest.  On the assumption that local 
communities were incapable of scientific management of forest, the British 
Government introduced Forest Policy and Management by setting up a 
forest department and enacting the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_66">Indian Forest Act</a>, 1878 which was 
amended from time to time.  By passage of time, it was found that the 
provisions of the said Act were not adequate and, thus, in order to 
consolidate the law relating to forest, the transit of forest produce and the 
duty leviable for timber and other forest produce, the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_67">Indian Forest Act</a>, 
1927 was enacted.  To further tighten the management and regulation, the 
FC Act of 1980 was enacted.  It became necessary for conservation of 
forest on realizing that there has been large scale of deforestation which is 
causing ecological imbalance leading to environmental deterioration.  This 
led to enactment of the FC Act providing for prohibition for use of forest 
land for non-forest purpose by anyone including the State Government or 
other authorities except with the prior approval of the Central Government.  
This legislature was enacted, as already noted, after Forest and Wildlife 
were taken out from the State list and placed in the Concurrent list.  At the 
same time, <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_68">Article 48A</a> was inserted in the Constitution of India for 
protection and improvement of environments and safeguarding forest and 
wildlife in the year 1977.
</p><p id="p_108">The basis objectives leading to the laying down of the National 
Forest Policy, 1988 may also be noted and also the need and requirement 
for its enforcement.  This policy was framed on realizing that 1952 Forest 
Policy for the management of State forest in the country had not halted the 
depletion of forests.  It was, therefore, considered necessary to evolve a 
fresh policy for future to lay down new strategies of forest conservation 
which had become imperative.  Conservation includes preservation, 
maintenance, sustainable utilization, restoration and enhancement of the 
natural environment.  The principal aim of the forest policy is to ensure 
environmental stability and maintenance of ecological balance including 
atmospheric equilibrium which are vital for sustenance of all life forms, 
human, animal and plant.  The derivation of direct economic benefit must 
be subordinated to this principal aim.
</p><p id="p_109">The forest policy has a statutory flavour.  The non-fulfillment of 
aforesaid principle aim would be violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the 
Constitution.  The basic objectives of the Forest Policy, 1988 are:
"2.1	The basic objectives that should govern the 
National Forest Policy are the following:
</p><p id="p_110">--	Maintenance of environmental stability 
through preservation and, where 
necessary, restoration of the ecological 
balance that has been adversely disturbed 
by serious depletion of the forests of the 
country.
</p><p id="p_111">--	Conserving the natural heritage of the 
country by preserving the remaining natural 
forests with the vast variety of flora and 
fauna, which represent the remarkable 
biological diversity and genetic resources of 
the country.
</p><p id="p_112">--	Checking soil erosion and denudation in 
the catchment areas of rivers, lakes 
reservoirs in the interest of soil and water 
conservation, for mitigating floods and 
droughts and for the retardation of silation 
of reservoirs.
</p><p id="p_113">--	Checking the extension of sand-dunes in 
the desert areas of Rajasthan and along 
the coastal tracts.
</p><p id="p_114">--	Increasing substantially the forest/tree 
cover in the country through massive 
afforestation and social forestry 
programmes, especially on all denuded, 
degraded and unproductive lands.
</p><p id="p_115">--	Meeting the requirements of fuelwood, 
fodder, minor forest produce and small 
timber of the rural and tribal populations.
</p><p id="p_116">--	Increasing the productivity of forests to 
meet essential national needs.
</p><p id="p_117">--	Encouraging efficient utilization of forest 
produce and maximum substitution of 
wood.
</p><p id="p_118">--	Creating a massive people's movement 
with the involvement of women, for 
achieving these objectives and to minimize 
pressure on existing forests.
</p><p id="p_119">2.2	The principal aim of Forest Policy must be 
to ensure environmental stability and 
maintenance of ecological balance 
including atmospheric equilibrium which are 
vital for sustenance of all life forms, human, 
animal and plant.  The derivation of direct 
economic benefit must be subordinated to 
this principal aim."
</p>		
<p id="p_120">It has been recognized that one of the essentials for forest 
management is the conservation of total biological diversity, the network of 
national parks, sanctuaries, biosphere reserves and other protected areas 
to be strengthened and extended adequately.  
</p><p id="p_121">The strategy under the Forest Policy is to have a minimum of one-
third of the total land area of the country under forest or tree-cover.  In the 
hills and in mountainous regions, the aim should be to maintain two-third of 
the area under such cover in order to prevent erosion and land 
degradation and to ensure the stability of the fragile ecosystem.  Clause 
4.3 lays down the aspects of management of State forests.  It would be 
instructive to reproduce hereunder certain parts of the Policy with a view to 
have clarity of the aim to be achieved.  
</p><p id="p_122">"4.3.1. Schemes and projects which interfere with 
forest that clothe steep slopes, catchments of 
rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, geologically unstable 
terrain an d such other ecologically sensitive 
areas should be severely restricted.  Tropical 
rain/moist forest, particularly in areas like 
Arunachal Pradesh, Kerala, Andaman and 
Nicobar Islands should be totally safeguarded.
4.3.2. No forest should be permitted to be worked 
without the Government having approved the 
management plan, which should be in a 
prescribed format and in keeping with the 
National Forest Policy.  The Central Government 
should issue necessary guidelines to the State 
Government in this regard and monitor 
compliance.
</p><p id="p_123">	XXX			XXX			XXX
4.4.1.	forest land or land with tree cover should 
not be treated merely as a resource readily 
available to be utilized for various projects and 
programmes, but as a national asset which 
requires to be properly safeguarded for providing 
sustained benefits to the entire community.  
</p><p id="p_124">Diversion of forest land for any non-forest 
purpose should be subject to the most careful 
examinations by specialists from the standpoint of 
social and environmental costs and benefits.  
Construction of dams and reservoirs, mining and 
industrial development and expansion of 
agriculture should be consistent with the needs 
for conservation of trees and forests.  Projects 
which involve such diversion should be least 
provide in their investment budget, funds for 
regeneration/ compensatory afforestation.
4.4.2.	Beneficiaries who are allowed mining and 
quarrying in forest land and in land covered by 
trees should be required to repair and re-vegetate 
the area in accordance with established forestry 
practice.  No mining lease should be granted to 
any party, private or public, without a proper mine 
management plan appraised from the 
environmental angle and enforced by adequate 
machinery.
</p><p id="p_125">	XXX			XXX			XXX
4.6	Having regard to the symbiotic relationship 
between the tribal people and forests, a primary 
task of all agencies responsible for forest 
management, including the forest development 
corporations should be to associate the tribal 
people closely in the protection, regeneration and 
development of forests as well as to provide 
gainful employment to people living in and around 
the forest.  While safeguarding the customary 
rights and interests of such people, forestry 
programmes should pay special attention to the 
following
</p><p id="p_126">--	One of the major cause for degradation of 
forest is illegal cutting and removal by 
contractors and their labour.  In order to put 
an end to this practice, contractors should 
be replaced by institutions such as tribal 
cooperatives, labour cooperatives, 
government corporations, etc. as early as 
possible;

programmes to meet the needs of the tribal

4.8.1.	Encroachment on forest lands has been on 
the increase.  This trend has to be arrested and 
effective action taken to prevent its continuance.  
There should be no regularization of existing 
encroachments.
</p><p id="p_132">	XXX			XXX			XXX
4.9.	The main considerations governing the 
establishment of forest-based industries and 
supply of raw material to them should be as 
follows :
</p><p id="p_133">--	As far as possible, a forest-based industry 
should raise the raw material needed for 
meeting its own requirements, preferably 
by establishment of direct relationship 
between the factory and the individuals 
who can grow the raw material by support 
the individuals with inputs including credit, 
constant technical advice and finally 
harvesting and transport services.
</p><p id="p_134">--	No forest-based enterprise, except that at 
the village or cottage level, should be 
permitted in the future unless it has been 
first cleared after a careful scrutiny with 
regard to assured availability of raw 
material.  In any case, the fuel, fodder and 
timber requirements of local population 
should not be sacrificed for this purpose.
</p><p id="p_135">--	Forest-based industries must not only 
provide employment to local people on 
priority but also involve them fully in raising 
trees and raw-material.
</p><p id="p_136">--	Natural forests serve as a gene pool 
resources and help to maintain ecological 
balance.  Such forests will not, therefore, 
be made available to industries for 
undertaking plantation and for any other 
activities.
</p><p id="p_137">--	Framers, particularly small and marginal 
farmers would be encouraged to grow, on 
marginal/degraded lands available with 
them, wood species required for industries.

and fodder species on community lands not 
required for pasture purposes, and by 
forest department/corporations on 
degraded forests, not earmarked for natural 
regeneration.
</p><p id="p_139">--	The practice of supply of forest produce to 
industry at concessional prices should 
cease.  Industry should be encouraged to 
use alternative law materials.  Import of 
wood and wood products should be 
liberalized.
</p><p id="p_140">--	The above considerations will, however, be 
subject to the current policy relating to land

4.16.	The objective of this revised Policy cannot 
be achieved without the investment of 
financial and other resources on a 
substantial scale.  Such investment is 
indeed fully justified considering the 
contribution of forests in maintaining 
essential ecological processes and life-
</p><p id="p_142">support systems and in preserving genetic 
diversity.  Forest should not be looked upon 
as a source of revenue.  Forests are a 
renewable natural resource.  They are a 
national asset to be protected and 
enhanced for the well being of the people 
and the Nation."
</p>

<p id="p_143">It is clearly a constitutional imperative to preserve and enhance 
forest cover as a natural gene pool reserve.
</p><p id="p_144">As opposed to the above, the ground reality has been depletion of 
forest. 
</p><p id="p_145">The shift in the approach of the legislation is evident from the FC Act 
of 1980 when compared with the scheme underlying the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_69">Indian Forest Act</a>, 
1927 which was State oriented for conserving the Forest Policy of 1952.  
Further, in 1977, Forest and Wildlife were taken out from the State list and 
incorporated in Concurrent list.  Considering compulsions of States and 
large depletion of forest, these legislative measures have shifted the 
responsibility from States to Centre.  Moreover, any threat to the ecology 
can lead to violation of right of enjoyment of healthy life guaranteed under 
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_70">Article 21</a> which is required to be protected.  The Constitution of India 
enjoins upon this Court a duty to protect environments.  
The aforesaid background has been given to demonstrate that the 
object of amount of NPV is to utilize the fund to conserve the ecology 
without in any manner affecting proprietary rights of the State Government 
over the land, timber or the minerals.  The Notification dated 23rd April, 
2004 does not deprive any State of any land timber or mineral and, 
therefore, there is no question of disbursement of any amount to the State.  
The damage to environment is a damage to the country's assets as a 
whole.  Ecology knows no boundaries.  It can have impact on the climate.  
The principles and parameters for valuation of the damage have to be 
evolved also keeping in view the likely impact of activities on future 
generation.
</p><p id="p_146">	We have already noted that this matter came to be examined on 
Central Government filing statement showing the dismal state of affairs of 
the forest in the country.  It is evident that despite the FC Act and the forest 
policy the forests have been rapidly depleting.  The forest policy 
recognizes this fact and, in fact, was involved to check the menace of fast 
eroding of forest in the country.  Despite constitutional amendments made 
effective from the beginning of 1977 and despite various environmental 
laws enacted between 1974-1986 depletion of forest has not halted. 
	The State of Forest Report 1995 published by Forest Survey of India 
when compared with the State of Forest Report 1997 also shows that there 
has been considerable depletion of forest cover.  It also shows the limited 
regeneration.  A comparison of the two reveals that total forest cover of the 
country decreased from 638,879 sq.km. to 633,397 sq.km., thus showing a 
net loss of 5,482 sq.km.  Further it reveals that there has been a net 
decrease of 17,777 sq.km. of dense forest cover of the country while open 
forests and mangroves have increased by 12,001 sq.km. and 294 sq.km 
respectively.  The redeeming feature, however, is an improvement which 
can be seen from the State of Forest Report 2001.  Learned Amicus 
Curiae submits that improvement is a result of strict vigil on account of 
various orders passed by this Court from time to time.  It cannot be 
doubted that it is necessary to continue the efforts for regeneration of 
forest.
</p><p id="p_147">	It would also be useful to make a mention of the order dated 22nd 
September, 2000 passed by this Court which led to grant of sanction of 
rupees 1,000 crores for maintenance of forest under the 12th Finance 
Commission (2005-2010).  The said order took note of the fact that felling 
of the trees is far in excess of what would be justified with reference to 
regeneration, and the main cause is non-availability of sufficient funds.  It 
also notices that even with regard to the felling of trees as per working 
plans in the last three years, the corresponding prescription for 
regeneration has not been implemented.  It further notices that there 
cannot be any felling without regeneration because that will, over a period 
of time, only result in forest vanishing.  Further, the order says that the 
shortfall of regeneration which has resulted in depletion of forest cover has 
to be made up.  The court took note of the suggestion that for regeneration 
there should be a joint venture between State of Madhya Pradesh  a 
State having a large forest area, and the Central Government whereby the 
working capital, in whole or substantially the whole, can be provided by the 
Central Government and the regeneration of degraded forests carried out.  
Taking an overall view, it is important for the nation that in certain areas 
where natural forest exists, the same should be preserved and at the same 
time the Central Government should consider whether the deficient States 
should not be asked to contribute towards the preservation of the existing 
forest cover and the compensation/incentive given to the forest rich States 
to preserve and regenerate forests.  In a sense, there should be a 
partnership of all the States to ensure the maintenance and improvement 
of forest cover.  It was observed that this suggestion should be considered 
by a Committee of Secretary (MOF) and the Secretary (MOEF) in 
consultation with the Chief Secretaries of all the States.
	Para 14.25 of the 12th Finance Commission Report deals with 
maintenance of forest.  Noticing that several States have represented that 
subsequent to the restrictions placed by this Court on exploitation of forest 
wealth, the forests have become a net liability for the States rather than a 
source of revenue and maintenance of forest has become a problem due 
to financial constraints, these States pleaded that separate grant should be 
provided for maintenance of forest.  Recognising that forest are a national 
wealth and the country as a whole has the responsibility in preserving the 
said national wealth, the Commission decided to recommend a grant of 
rupees 1000 crores spread over the award period 2005-2010 for 
maintenance of forest.  This would be over and above what the States 
have been spending through their forest departments.  The amount was 
distributed among the States based on their forest area, to be spent for 
preservation of forest wealth.  In this light, it is not open to the State 
Government to contend that the amount of NPV paid by the user agency 
shall be handed over to them.  
</p><p id="p_148">Reference may also be made to report of the Planning Commission 
(Chapter IX) relating to forest environments in Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-
2007) which has taken note of the fact that sustainability is not an option 
but imperative since without it environmental deterioration and economic 
decline will be feeding each other leading to poverty, pollution, poor health, 
political upheaval and unrest.  Environment cuts across all sectors of 
development.  The rapid increase in green house gases in the 
atmosphere, land degradation, deteriorating conditions of fragile eco 
systems, deforestation, loss of biodiversity and environmental pollution 
have become subjects of serious global concern.  The overall impact of 
these phenomena is likely to result in depletion of ozone layer, change of 
climate, rise in sea-level loss of natural resources, reduction in their 
productivity ultimately leading to an ecological crisis affecting livelihood 
options for development and over all deterioration in quality of life.
	From the above report, it follows that the deterioration and 
consequently preservation of eco-systems cannot be area or state specific 
and that utmost attention is required to be accorded to conservation of 
natural resources and for improvement of the status of our environments.  
The report notices the need to tackle the environmental degradation in a 
holistic manner in order to ensure both economic and environmental 
sustainability.  Forests play an important role in environmental and 
economic sustainability.  It takes note of the forests being consistently and 
seriously undervalued in economic and social terms.  It recognizes that the 
economic value of the eco-system services of the forests is vast though it 
is extremely difficult to quantify.   It takes note of the fact that generally 
much of the land-use decision that presently drives forest change takes 
relatively little account of these values.  The country's forest resource is 
under tremendous pressure.  Note has been taken of the fact that India's 
biological diversity is reflected in the heterogeneity of its forest cover.  It is 
one of the 12 'mega-diversity' countries of the world.  India is also at the 
meeting zone of three major zone of three major bio-geographic realms, 
namely, the Indo-Malayan (the richest in the world), the Eurasian and Afro-
tropical.  India also has the two richest bio-diversity areas, one in the 
northeast and the other in the Western Ghats.  The biological diversity is 
being conserved through a network of biosphere reserves, national parks 
and sanctuaries, however, the challenges for conservation emanate from 
population pressures, adverse impacts of industrialization and intensifying 
threat from illegal trade.
</p><p id="p_149">	The importance of conserving and managing existing natural forest 
and forest soils, which are very large stores of carbon, has been 
emphasized as it will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  To 
develop and protect forest, a scientific management is necessary so as to 
enhance productivity, density and health.  Forestry projects have to lay 
emphasis on management and rejuvenation of natural forests.  The fragile 
eco-systems should be properly managed in order to safeguard the 
livelihood of millions of people.
</p><p id="p_150">	The national development agenda must recognize the necessity of 
protecting the long-term ecological security.  The problem area is the 
growing population, high degree of mechanism and steep rise in energy 
use which has led to activities that directly or indirectly affect the 
sustainability of the environment.  
</p><p id="p_151">	It is recognized that the sustainable use of bio-diversity is 
fundamental to ecological sustainable.   The loss of bio-diversity stems 
from destruction of the habitat, extension of agriculture, filling up of wet 
lands, conversion of rich bio-diversity sites for human settlement and 
industrial development, destruction of coastal areas and uncontrolled 
commercial exploitation.  It is thus evident that the preservation of eco-
systems, bio-diversity and environment whether examined on common law 
principle or statutory principle or constitutional principle eying from any 
angle it is clearly a national issue to be tackled at the national level.  All 
initiatives are required to seriously pursue.  
	Dealing with inter-generational justice, it has been rightly observed 
that posterity shall not be treated like dirt.  In an article published in 2003 
Columbia Journal of Environmental Law (28 Colum.J.Envtl.L.185), the 
author says that the way in which a society cares or does not care for its 
dirt  its land  reflects the degree to which it cares or does not care for its 
own long-term future.  
</p><p id="p_152">	We may also briefly refer to Public Trust doctrine and its applicability 
to the matters under consideration.  The Public Trust Doctrine looks 
beyond the need of the present generation and also suggests that certain 
resources are invested with a special nature.  It would be instructive to 
make a note of a story given in by Timothy Patrick Brady in Boston College 
Environmental Affairs Law Review, Spring 1990 under the title 'But most of 
it belongs to those yet to be born'.  The story relates to digging of well at 
the time of drought.  When a Frenchman told villagers of a prudent African 
solution of digging well, many villagers agreed but others argued that it will 
bring people from other villages and they would bring their cattle and that 
would increase the pressure on the already precious water.  The 
Frenchman told the villagers that why not explain to them that the well is 
only for your own village and they can dig their own.  It was then said that 
'water is not only ours, but is gift of nature from God and must be shared.'  
Ultimately, they concluded that it was wiser not to dig the well at all.  The 
moral of the story is that we are trustees of natural resources which belong 
to all including future generation as well.  The public trust doctrine has to 
be used to protect the right of this as also future generation.  
Having regard to the above, amounts under CAMPA have to be 
used for regeneration of eco-system and the same cannot be handed over 
to any State Government on the premise that ecology is not property of 
any State but belongs to all being a gift of nature for entire nation.  The 
object of the FC Act and EP Act is protection of environments.  <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_71">These Act</a>s 
do not deal with any propriety rights of anyone.  
As already stated the question as to what amount of NPV is required 
to be paid to achieve these object is a matter to be gone into by the 
experts.  However, the amounts shall have to be updated from time to time 
after every three years.  For grant of approval under Section 2 of the FC 
Act besides payment of NPV as being presently calculated by MOEF, the 
user agencies shall have to give undertakings to pay the remaining 
amount, if any, pending finalization of determination by the experts.
	Turning now to the grant of exemption to certain projects, learned 
Solicitor General submitted that Government hospitals, dispensaries, non-
commercial government ventures like schools, rain water harvesting tanks, 
sever lines, village roads etc. are the projects meant for public welfare and 
have no adverse impact on environment as such and, therefore, these 
cases deserve to be granted exemption.  Learned Amicus Curiae has no 
objection to non-commercial and non-revenue earning Government public 
welfare projects being treated differently and granted exemption from the 
purview of the payment of NPV.  Submission was also made by learned 
counsel appearing for some of the parties that other projects like irrigation, 
hydro electricity or other similar projects engaged in public welfare and 
public utility activities too deserve to be similarly treated and granted 
exemption.  On behalf of the National Hydro Project Corporation Ltd. 
(NHPC), it was submitted that dams/hydro electric projects and other 
similar projects are undertaken in public interest and these will also not 
create environmental pollution and mere fact of these are revenue earning 
projects should not be taken as a ground to treat them differently.  
Reliance has been placed on observations made in Hindustan Motors 
Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. N.Siva Kumar &amp; Anr. [(2000) 10 SCC 664] to contend that 
such a project is not a pollution industry.  This decision is not relevant for 
determining the question about levy and payment of NPV.  The question is 
not only about these and projects referred by the Solicitor General not 
creating pollution but is about diversion of forest land for non-forest 
purpose, thereby depleting forest so as to utilize land area in setting up 
these projects.  A distinction has to be maintained between a project set up 
for providing public utility but which is revenue earning, the category to 
which the project of NHPC falls and the government projects of the nature 
above referred like hospitals, schools etc., non-revenue earning projects.  
A balance is required to be maintained in the development and protection 
of environments.  As already noted, the development has to be based on 
sustainability.  If NHPC uses the forest land for non forest purposes, the 
payment of NPV is to protect the ecological and bio-diversity having regard 
to the doctrines above referred.  Generally speaking, projects like NHPC 
are commercial ventures.
</p><p id="p_153">	What we have stated above is also applicable to submissions made 
on behalf of Grid Corporation of Orissa (GRIDCO), State of Uttranchal and 
State of Madhya Pradesh.  We are unable to accept the submission that 
wherever the government is the user agency in notified forest area, 
protected forest/reserved forest etc., NPV should not be charged.  Such a 
submission cannot be accepted in the teeth of Section 2 of the FC Act and 
other environmental laws noticed hereinbefore.  
	The submission made on behalf of the Federation of Indian Mineral 
Industries about calculation of NPV at the rate of 10 per cent for major 
mineral and 5 per cent for minor mineral as already noted cannot be 
accepted.  The question is not of the value of the mineral or it being high 
value and low volume and mineral of high volume and low value, the 
question is about use of the forest areas and need to protect the 
environments in the manner above stated.  A larger public interest has to 
be the guiding principle and not the present interest of user agency only.  
	We are of the view that the question as to which class of projects 
deserve to be exempted can first be examined by experts having regard to 
principles laid in this judgment and in receipt of the report from them, this 
Court would further examine the matter and issue appropriate directions.  
However, prima facie we feel that revenue earning projects do not deserve 
similar treatment as non-revenue earning public welfare projects. 
We are clear that if let loose, the benefits achieved as indicated in 
the State Forest Report of 2001 would be lost and we may be again where 
we were in 1990's or 1980's and earlier period during which there was 
immense depletion of forest and insignificant regeneration.
The work of regeneration and also of compulsory afforestation 
requires special, specific and expert attention and we see no illegality in 
establishment of Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in terms of clause 6.6 
above quoted except that for present till further orders it would be 
necessary to monitor the establishment of SPV.  Thus, in respect of clause 
6.6 in relation to establishment of SPV, we hold that before establishing 
SPV, its format shall be filed in Court and SPV shall not be established 
without permission of the Court.  Further in our view the constitution of 
authority (CAMPA) is necessary to fully and effectively implement 
recommendation dated 9th August, 2002 made by CEC for protection of 
environment
	In view of the aforesaid discussion, our conclusions are:
</p><p id="p_154">1.	Except for government projects like hospitals, 
dispensaries and schools referred to in the body of the 
judgment, all other projects shall be required to pay 
NPV though final decision on this matter will be taken 
after receipt of Expert Committee Report.
</p><p id="p_155">2.	The payment to CAMPA under notification dated 23rd 
April, 2004 is constitutional and valid.
</p>
<p id="p_156">3.	The amounts are required to be used for achieving 
ecological plans and for protecting the environment and 
for the regeneration of forest and maintenance of 
ecological balance and eco-systems.  The payment of 
NPV is for protection of environment and not in relation 
to any propriety rights.
</p><p id="p_157">4.	Fund has been created having regard to the principles 
of intergenerational justice and to undertake short term 
and long-term measures.
</p><p id="p_158">5.  	The NPV has to be worked out on economic principles.
In view of the above, we issue following directions:
A.	An expert committee comprising of three experts 
including Ms.Kanchan to be appointed within a period of 
one month by the Institution of Economic Growth (North 
Campus).
</p><p id="p_159">B.	The committee of experts would examine the following 
issues:
</p><p id="p_160">(i)	To identify and define parameters 
(scientific, bio-metric and social) on the 
basis of which each of the categories of 
values of forest land should be estimated.
</p><p id="p_161">(ii)	To formulate a practical methodology 
applicable to different bio-geographical 
zones of India for estimation of the values 
in monetary terms in respect of each of the
