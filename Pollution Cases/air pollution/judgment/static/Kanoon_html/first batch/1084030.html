           Dated this the 18th day of December, 2009

                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Thottathil B.Radhakrishnan, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">             The petitioner samithi exposes a cause of concern in

relation to large       scale excavation of clay for brick

manufacturing and also the fact that the pits formed by such

excavation are left unfilled.       The private parties who have

entered appearance are yet to place any counter affidavit on

record.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             2. In the report dated 31st July, 2008, submitted by

the Environmental Engineer, Kerala State Pollution Control

Board,     it is stated that based on complaints, the area was

inspected by his office and the brick kilns were found to be

sufficiently away from nearby residences, in accordance with

the set back norms fixed by the Pollution Control Board. The

W.P.(C) No.21884 of 2008
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2</span>

official of the Pollution Control Board states that fire wood is

the fuel used for burning and the duration of burning is

generally for a period of 24 hours in each kiln. In terms of the

provisions contained in <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_1">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, it is pointed out that consent

to operate is issued only with the condition that the kiln has to

be covered on its sides with mud plaster or tarpaulin to prevent

smoke emission from sides during burning process and that

fabricated hood type roof system with drought-fan and exhaust

pipe of 15 metres height has to be provided on the top of each

kiln to drive out smoke during the burning process and also the

other conditions in terms of the Pollution Control Board

guidelines. Annexure R2(a) is placed on record as a model

consent order.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            3.   In so far as the pits are concerned, the 5th

respondent Geologist has filed a counter affidavit stating

amongst other things that earnest efforts are being taken to abide

W.P.(C) No.21884 of 2008
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>

by all the directions already issued by this Court in the judgment

reported in <a href="/doc/14406/" id="a_3">Soman v. Geologist</a> (2004 (3) KLT 577) and that on

inspection it appears that a good number of pits from which clay

was drawn have been left unfilled. An evaluation statement is

placed along with the counter affidavit of the Geologist which

shows that action has been taken even by revenue recovery

proceedings for refilling the pits. But the fact of the matter

remains that the District Collector and the Geologist will have to

ensure that the pits are filled and no pit is left unfilled even if the

operator does not fill it soon. If there is inaction on the part of

any operator to fill up the pits, Governmental machinery shall

be immediately brought into action to enforce proceedings and

to ensure that the pits are filled and amounts due for that is

recovered in terms of the law from the erring operators. Action

taken reports in this regard are called for having regard to the

grave situation disclosed by the photographs which are placed

on record.

</p><p id="p_6">            4. Hence it is ordered that the District Collector,

Kottayam will ensure that the 5th respondent Geologist files an

action taken report in this regard in regular intervals of six

months each before the Registrar General of this Court with the

concurrence of the District Collector without fail.

</p><p id="p_7">            Writ petition is ordered accordingly.
