                                       CWP No. 12266 of 2009

                                       Date of Decision: 13.08.2009



M/s Essen Forge Private Limited.                          ..Petitioner


                         Versus


Punjab Pollution Control Board and others.               ..Respondents


CORAM:      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE T.S.THAKUR,CHIEF JUSTICE
            HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA


Present :    Mr. A.K.Jain, Advocate for the petitioner

                               *****
</pre>
<p id="p_1">T.S.Thakur, C.J. (Oral)

            Pursuant to an order passed by this Court in Civil Writ

Petition No. 2796 of 2007 dated 04.10.2008, the Punjab Pollution

Control Board appears to have initiated action against among others the

forging Units established by the petitioner-company on Gill Road

opposite P.S.E.B. Office, Ludhiana.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            The petitioner's grievance now is that without passing any

formal order in the said proceedings, the Board Authorities are bent

upon closing the petitioner's unit thereby depriving the petitioner-

company of the opportunity to challenge the validity of the order in

appropriate proceedings and also carry on its normal business activities.

</p><p id="p_3">            Mr. Patwalia, learned counsel appearing for the Punjab

Pollution Control Board submits that according to his instructions, a
             CWP No. 12266 of 2009                            [2]

formal order on the subject has already been passed by the Chairman of

the Board about which a statement was made even in the contempt

proceedings initiated by Shri Sher Singh (petitioner) in Civil Writ

Petition No. 2796 of 2007. He urged that the order in question may

have been already served upon the petitioner-company but in case the

same has not been served, an additional copy of the order would be

served upon the petitioner-company within next two days.

</p><p id="p_4">            Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

petitioner-company may be given reasonable time to challenge the

validity of the order in appropriate proceedings before the appropriate

Forum and the petitioner-company may be protected against the

implementation of the directions issued by the Board in the meantime to

prevent any miscarriage of justice.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            In the circumstances, therefore, and keeping in view the

limited prayer that has been urged before us, we dispose of this writ

petition with the following directions:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            i) The respondent-Board shall serve the formal order

               passed under the provisions of the Air (Prevention &amp;

               <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 upon the petitioner-

               company within one week from today. In case the order

               has already been served according to the record of the

               respondent-Board, an additional copy of the same shall

               be served upon the company within next two days.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            ii) In case, the order passed by the respondent-Board has

               not already been implemented and the Hammer, which is

               said to be a source of the noise pollution, not already
                  CWP No. 12266 of 2009                            [3]



                 sealed as pointed out by Mr. Patwalia, the sealing of the

                 said Hammer and other noise polluting activities in the

                 unit shall remain stayed but only for a limited period of

                 three weeks' from today.</blockquote><p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">             Petition is disposed off with the above observations. No

costs.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             A    copy    of   the   order   shall   be   given   dasti   to

Mr. D.S.Patwalia, for compliance under the signature of the Bench

Secretary.
