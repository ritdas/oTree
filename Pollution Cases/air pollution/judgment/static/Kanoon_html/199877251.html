Coram:
               Hon'ble Mr. Justice Janak Raj Kotwal, Judge
Appearance:

For the appellant/petitioner(s) :    Mr. Pankaj Jamwal, Adv.
For the respondent(s):               Mr. Ahtsham Bhat, GA</pre>

</pre><p id="p_1">1.     Petitioner has set up a poultry farm under the name and
       style as M/S Kotwal Poultry Farm in his land at village,
       Gurah Brahmana, Bantalab, Jammu. He claims that he is
       running this poultry farm since 1996. The Chairman, State
       Pollution Control Board, Jammu, herein respondent No. 2
       (for short the Board) vide his order No. 234 dated
       24.12.2014 issued in exercise of the power vested in the
       Board under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">section 31-A</a> of the Air (Prevention and
       <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (for short the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air Act</a>) has
       ordered immediate closure of the poultry farm of the
       petitioner. The reasons for which the closure of the poultry

       farm has been ordered are that the same has been set up
      without prior consent of the Pollution Control Board
      warranted under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_4">Sections 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_5">26</a> of the Water (Prevention
      and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water
      Act</a>) and <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_8">Section 21</a> the Air Act and the unit holder has
      failed to show any response to the notices issued by the
      Board, besides failing to take measures to meet the
      requirements of laws governing environmental protection.
      The order passed by respondent No. 2 also shows that local
      residents of the area have complained against operation of
      the said poultry farm for causing air pollution in the area.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.    The order No. 234 (supra) is challenged by the petitioner in
      this writ petition. He seeks quashing of the said order and a
      direction to the respondents not to interfere of the poultry
      farm.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.    Heard        learned counsel on both sides and perused the
      record.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    The case set up by the petitioner is that notice No. 1116-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      18/SPCB/rd-j/Compt./N-11/14 dated 01.04.2014 issued to
      him by the Board was replied by him on 20.05.2014 against
      the proper acknowledgement receipt bearing No. 3375 and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">OWP No. 535/2015                                       Page 2 of 8</span>
       all the queries made to him were addressed in detail.
      Petitioner has produced a copy of reply filed by him as
      annexure-A-2 bearing the endorsement in regard to its
      receipt under No. 3353 dated 20.05.2014. It is alleged by
      the petitioner that no proceedings in the matter were held
      after submission of the reply by him till 25.02.2015 when a
      Revenue Officer visited the spot and orally directed him not
      to proceed with the business of the said poultry farm. After
      a brief spell of time when he was suffering from bad health,
      he approached the office of the Board at Jammu on
      28.03.2015 with an application, which was accepted by
      respondent No. 3 on 04.04.2015 against a proper receipt.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">5.    Petitioner challenges the impugned order on the ground that
      the same has been issued without considering the reply of
      the petitioner in contravention of the principles of natural
      justice. It is contended also that the poultry farm of the
      petitioner does not come within the purview of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a>
      and there is no discharge of sewage or trade effluent into
      any stream or well or sewer or land in the near vicinity so
      the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_10">Water Act</a> too is not attracted. The impugned order is
      challenged also on the ground that no sample was ever
      taken from the petitioner's poultry farm and the order is
      devoid of any investigation or finding recorded after

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">OWP No. 535/2015                                     Page 3 of 8</span>
       investigation. The order is challenged also on the ground
      that the same does not disclose that the poultry farm is
      located in an air pollution control area or that a poultry farm
      comes within the ambit of "industry" under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_11">section 21</a> of
      the Air Act. It is alleged by the petitioner that the impugned
      order dated 24.12.2014 was served on him on 06.04.2015
      when respondent No. 3 provided him a photocopy of the
      said order. It is contended by the petitioner also that his
      poultry farm has been made non functional in spite of being
      fully equipped in accordance with norms prescribed for
      running a poultry farm. In order to justify filing the writ
      petition in this Court, it is contended by the petitioner that
      the appellate authority under the Act is non functional as
      there is no presiding officer of the said authority. Petitioner
      has, therefore, sought setting aside the impugned order
      dated 24.12.2014 as also quashing of the consequential
      directions issued to the Deputy Commissioner/District
      Magistrate, Chief Engineer, Electric and Maintenance and
      Director Industries and Commerce for closing the poultry
      farm, snapping its electric connection and deregistration of
      the same. In alternative, petitioner has sought direction to
      the respondents (authorities) to grant fresh consent for
      running for said poultry farm.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">OWP No. 535/2015                                       Page 4 of 8</span>
<p id="p_6"> 6.    The submissions of learned counsel for the petitioner were
      three fold. Firstly and primarily, that the impugned order
      has been passed by the Board in complete disregard to his
      reply to the show cause notice dated 01.04.2014, which was
      submitted in the office of the Board by the petitioner on
      20.05.2014 and therefore, violates principles of natural
      justice. Secondly, that a poultry farm does not fall within
      the ambit of the 'industrial plant' as envisaged under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_12">section
      21</a> of the Air Act and thirdly, that the poultry farm in
      question is not located in "air pollution control area".
</p>

<p id="p_7">7.    Objections on behalf of the official respondents have not
      been filed. Learned Government Advocate, Mr. Ahtsham
      Bhat appearing on behalf of the official respondents,
      however, opposed the writ petition. Mr. Bhat submitted that
      a poultry farm emits air pollutant into the atmosphere so it
      is covered within the definition of "industrial plant'' as
      defined under <a href="/doc/840666/" id="a_13">section 2(k)</a> of the Air Act and that it is not
      denied by the petitioner that his poultry farm is located in
      residential area, which is "air pollution control area."
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.    The impugned order records that the unit holder (that is, the
      petitioner) was served with repeated notices, in particular

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">OWP No. 535/2015                                        Page 5 of 8</span>
       notice dated 01.04.2014, calling upon him to show reason as
      to why legal action including closure of his unit be not
      taken but the unit holder failed to show any response to
      these notices. As against this, petitioner has produced copy
      of his reply to the notice dated 01.04.2014, which supports
      an acknowledgement stamp showing that the reply was
      received in the office of the Board against receipt No. 3353
      dated 20.05.2014. In his reply, the petitioner has given
      various reasons against closure of the poultry farm set up by
      him.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.     The impugned order has been issued on 24.12.2014, that is,
      more than eight months after issuance of the notice dated
      01.04.2014 and seven months after receipt of reply in the
      office of the Board on 20.05.2014. In absence of any
      response on behalf of the official respondents, the plea of
      the petitioner that reply to the show cause notice was
      delivered by him in the office of the Board on 20.05.2014
      deserves to be accepted and it is to be held that the
      impugned order has been issued without according
      consideration to the reply to the show cause notice
      furnished by the petitioner. The impugned order, therefore,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">OWP No. 535/2015                                     Page 6 of 8</span>
       infracts the principle of audi alteram partem and this
      petition deserves to be granted on that score only.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.   For the aforementioned, this petition is allowed by
      providing that the impugned order dated 24.12.2014 and all
      the consequential orders shall remain in abeyance. In
      addition, following directions are issued:
