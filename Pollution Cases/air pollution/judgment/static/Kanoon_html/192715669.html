<p id="p_34">              2. In compliance with the Order of this Hon'ble Court dated 14-11-
       2019, this respondent had issued notice, vide letter dated 20.11.2019, to
       the Units for arranging facility to conduct air quality monitoring from 25-
       11-2019 to 27-11-2019. Monitoring was conducted on the above
       mentioned dates as per schedule. However, accurate results could not be
       obtained due to the malfunctioning of the equipments used. When the
       Writ Petition came up for further consideration, the above facts were
       placed before this Hon'ble Court and this Hon'ble Court pleased to grant
       further time to complete the air monitoring, as directed earlier. The
       inconvenience caused to this Hon'ble Court in this regard is deeply
       regretted.

            conducted by the Board in the units from 5.12.2019, continuously for
            three days. The loading and unloading of the cement was found carried
            out on all days during the said monitoring. The loading and unloading of
            cement was found carried out during day time and the same was carried
            out only inside the enclosed area earmarked for the said activity of the
            Units. The copy of the monitoring report is produced herewith and marked
            as Annexure R5(a). As per the norms PM10 measured at 1m outside of
            the boundary of the unit shall not exceed 100ug/M3 and PM2.5 shall not

</p><p id="p_38">     4.     The 8th respondent had provided the loading/unloading shed with
     corrugated sheet roofing. The shed is adjoining the godown. Other sides
     are enclosed using garden net upto the roof level. Curtain, using garden
     net is provided to the fourth side used for entry/exit of vehicles. It is
     observed that the comparatively higher values obtained from the station
     near M/s.Anna Agencies, could be due to the proximity of the road and
     a cashew factory functioning nearby.
</p><p id="p_39">     5.     The 9th respondent had provided the loading/unloading shed with
     corrugated sheet roofing. Two sides share common wall with the
     godown buildings. The third side has wall for about 1.5m height and
     garden net enclosures for the remaining height up to roof level. Curtain,
     using garden net is provided to the fourth side used for entry/exit of
     vehicles.
</p><p id="p_40">     6.     The 10th respondent had provided the loading/unloading shed
     with corrugated sheet roofing. Two sides are enclosed using tarpaulin
     sheets up to roof level and third side shares a common wall with the
     godown. Curtain, using garden net is provided to the fourth side used
     for entry/exit of vehicles.
</p><p id="p_41">     7.     It was observed that the garden net, used as curtain at the
     entry/exit point of the units are drawn to the sides to enable entry of
     vehicles to the loading/unloading area and thereafter the curtains are
     closed, completely closing the loading/unloading area. Dust suppression
     is achieved in all units by water sprinkling. Considering the particle size
     distribution of cement PM10 is more indicative of the same. The values
     of PM10 on the third day in all the units are considerably lower than
     those of the first two days. On the third day the units had increased the
     frequency of wetting of their premises and roads. In this regard it is
     most respectfully submitted that the air quality standards are attainable
     with the existing control measures such as enclosure to the
     loading/unloading area and wetting of the premises and roads, provided
     they are maintained properly at all times during the operation of the
     units. As such, it is observed that the consent conditions are found
     complied with by the Units. Further, when the frequency of wetting the
     unit premises and the roads was increased the dust was found to have
     reduced and air quality had improved considerably.
</p><p id="p_42">     8.     When the matter is considered in detail it is noticed that though
     the enclosure using tarpaulin/garden net is found to be adequate to
     meet the air quality standards at present, the enclosure using such
     materials are of temporary nature and the chance of these getting easily
     damaged cannot be ruled out. Hence, it is desirable to provide enclosure
     of a permanent nature to the loading/unloading area. Further, being an
     enclosed area, the cement dust will be contained within the shed where
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> WP(C).No.32958 OF 2018                      11</span>

     the loading/unloading is carried out. This dust so accumulated inside the
     shed, if not removed at regular intervals may possess health hazard to
     the labourers who are working frequently inside the closed shed. Hence,
     providing dust extraction system for the loading/unloading shed is found
     to be necessary. Direction was issued to the units to provide dust
     extraction system. The copy of the direction dated 12.12.2019 is
     produced herewith and marked as Annexure R5(b).
