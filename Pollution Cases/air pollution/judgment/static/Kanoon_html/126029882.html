 WP(C).No.28532 OF 2019(N)              2




                                JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">          The petitioner has, in the instant writ petition,

    sought for many reliefs but, during the course of

    argument,        confined   her    prayer    for   issuance   of   an

    appropriate       direction   to       the   Appellate   Authority,

    established under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of

    Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, to take a decision on the appeal

    preferred against the order of the Kerala Pollution Control

    Board withdrawing the permission/consent granted on the

    premise that the petitioner was permitted to keep 250

    chicken but exceeded the same.                 As a consequence

    thereon, the Secretary of Chathamangalam Panchayath

    issued     the     impugned       Ext.P13    stop    memo     dated

    26.09.2019.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          2.    Having heard the learned counsel for the

    petitioner, I am of the view that this writ petition can be

    disposed of with a direction to the 3 rd respondent

    Appellate Authority to decide the appeal preferred against

    the order of the competent authority, withdrawing the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> WP(C).No.28532 OF 2019(N)                 3</span>


    permission/consent,           as   the     decision    would      have    a

    consequential        effect    upon       the    sustainability   of     the

    impugned order herein.
</p>
<p id="p_3">          Let the Appellate Authority decide the appeal within

    a period of two months from the date of receipt of a

    certified copy of the judgment.                  In case the petitioner

    succeeds        in   the      appeal       the     Secretary      of     the

    Chathamangalam Grama Panchayath will re-consider the

    issue, after affording an opportunity of hearing to the

    petitioner.
