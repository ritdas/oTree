                      Coir mats. They are in business from 2009. The products are exported to

                      various countries in Europe and to the USA. There are about 200 employees.

                      The petitioner has been providing direct employment to the aforesaid

                      employees and to several others indirectly. It is stated that the coir mats are

                      produced for Stencil painting of various designs which are made from water

                      based bio-degradable paints at the factory.

                      degradable and water based, the question of pollution will never arise.

                      However, it is stated that there were issues relating to the production and a

                      permission had to be obtained. In that regard, this writ petition came to be
