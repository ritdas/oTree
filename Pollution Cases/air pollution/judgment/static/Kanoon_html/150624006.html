<p id="p_12">                    On the basis of record, emanating from CWP No. 312 of





             2017, titled as Rajesh Kumar Sood Vs. State of H.P., this Court vide

             order, dated 19th September, 2017 directed the Registry to register a

             separate petition, which being the instant petition, was registered as

             CWPIL No. 144 of 2017. What prompted the Court to register a

             separate CWPIL, was the importance and significance of the issues,

             involving larger public interest, canvassed by the writ petitioner,

             who subsequently, for reasons best known to him, sought to

             withdraw the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_13">             2.     In the original petition, the issue primarily pertained to

             alleged encroachments, carried out by different persons over public




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 30/11/2017 23:29:13 :::HCHP</span>
     land belonging to the railway authorities and more specifically along




                                                               .
</p><p id="p_14">    the railway tracks within the State of Himachal Pradesh.
</p>




<p id="p_15">    3.     Taking note of the fact that in Himachal Pradesh, there are





    three railway tracks, one of which is declared as a World Heritage

    site by UNESCO, this Court, with the registration of the present

    petition, on 19th September, 2017, issued certain directions for



</p><p id="p_16">    4.                         to
    removing encroachments over the railway property.
</p>
<p id="p_17">           We were concerned with three railway tracks, namely: (i)


    Kalka-Shimla Heritage Track ; a UNESCO World Heritage site ; (ii)

    Pathankot-Jogindernagar railway track, again a Century old railway

    track and (iii) Nangal-Talwara track.
</p>


<p id="p_18">    5.     Happily, large number of encroachments already stand




    removed and unauthorized structures demolished. Some work in this

    regard is still pending.
</p>




<p id="p_19">    6.     Further, during the course of hearing of the instant petition,





    we were informed that inspection for renewal of Heritage status of

    Kalka-Shimla railway line as World Heritage UNESCO Site is likely

    to take place in the near future, as renewal has to take place within

    one year from now. We were also informed that there were certain

    places on this track where sewage/waste water was being openly

    thrown. In this background, on 14th November, 2017, we passed the

    following order :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "Mr. Rahul Mahajan, learned counsel for Indian Railways
          states that on Kalka-Shimla Track there are certain places
          where sewage/waste water from private houses is being openly

          near future and within one year from today. In the affidavit, let
          respondent No. 10-Divisional Manager explain the steps taken
          for meeting out the requirements of renewal."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_20">    7.     On the next date of hearing, we were informed by the railway





    authorities that despite written communication(s), no action was

    taken by the authorities, constituted under the Water (Prevention and


    <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the Act)

    and other environmental laws of the land. Consequently, we

    impleaded the H.P. State Pollution Control Board as a party and



    issued notice.
</p>



<p id="p_21">    8.     Mr. Rahul Mahajan, Advocate, also stated that at Parwanoo,

    an industrial township, effluents were being released by certain





    industries/polluters in open streams. Discharge of such effluents is





    causing severe damage to the railway property, more so bridges

    which are century old.
</p>
<p id="p_22">    9.     In response thereto, Mr. Tara Sigh Chauhan, Advocate,

    learned counsel for the Board, has today handed over to us an

    affidavit, revealing shocking state of affairs, vis-à-vis the

    functioning of the authorities under the Act and implementation of

    environmental laws. There is neither any Sewerage Treatment Plant

    nor any Solid Waste Processing Unit at Parwanoo. Also, there is no

    mechanism to process the effluents. At this point of time, we need

    not say more, save and except, that only on the prodding of the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                            ::: Downloaded on - 30/11/2017 23:29:13 :::HCHP</span>
     Court, the Board rose from slumber and issued notice for




                                                               .
</p><p id="p_23">    disconnection of electricity of one of the stake holders. We are





    informed that the duty cast under the environmental laws is actually





    that of Municipal Council, Parwanoo, to whom notice of

    disconnection of electricity already stands issued.
</p>
<p id="p_24">    10.    At this stage, Mr. Rahul Mahajan, Advocate, informs that





    insofar as the specific site of the bridge, which is likely to be

    effected as a result of effluent being openly discharged by the


    industrial units, there are four more polluters, namely (i) Daljeet

    Electroplanting; (ii) Aadhunik Agro Pvt. Ltd ; (iii) Shivalik

    Industrial Limited and (iv) Universal Power Product. This is as per



    instructions imparted by Mr. D.K. Bajan, ADEN, Shimla, Northern




    Railways.
</p>
<p id="p_25">    11.    Under these circumstances, we direct the Secretary, H.P.
</p>




<p id="p_26">    Pollution Control Board to forthwith have the site inspected and if





    necessary, issue orders for disconnection of electricity and water

    connection of these polluting units.
</p>
<p id="p_27">    12.    We implead H.P. State Electricity Board, through its

    Secretary, Kumar House, Shimla as party respondent. Mr. Vivek

    Sharma, Advocate, waives notice.
</p>
<p id="p_28">    13.    Mr. Satyen Vaidya, learned Senior Advocate, states that with

    the orders being issued by the Pollution Control Board, electricity of

    the units shall be disconnected forthwith. Mr. Anup Rattan, learned

    Additional Advocate General, states that water connection shall also

    be disconnected.
</p>

<p id="p_29">     14.      Mr. Shrawan Dogra, learned Advocate General, states that all




                                                                   .
</p><p id="p_30">    assistance shall be rendered by the district administration, including





    deployment of police force, if so required.
</p>




<p id="p_31">    15.      It is not in dispute before us that within the territorial limits of

    Municipal Council, Parwanoo, there is neither a sewage treatment

    plant nor any mechanism for processing and dealing with municipal

    solid waste.
</p>
<p id="p_32">    16.                            to
             Mr. T.S. Chauhan, Advocate, invites our attention to the fact


    that since the year 2015, Pollution Control Board has been taking up

    the issue with the authorities, but the fact of the matter being that at

    the ground level, nothing has been done and things have remained as



    it is.
</p>



<p id="p_33">    17.      At this stage, Ms. Seema Guleria, Advocate, who is otherwise

    assisting the Court as an Amicus Curiae in other matters, states that





    new technology (Black Hole) is available to deal with solid waste,





    and that too, at low cost and in an efficient manner. And all this,

    without segregating the waste material. She states that the

    entrepreneur possessing such technology has approached the

    authorities, highlighting that certain States have already used the

    same. Well, at this stage, we do not want to comment about the

    feasibility thereof, but definitely it requires consideration of the

    authorities and as such, we leave it open for them to do so at the

    earliest.
</p>
<p id="p_34">    18.      We direct the Secretary (Urban Development) to file a

    separate affidavit dealing with the issue, more specifically the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                ::: Downloaded on - 30/11/2017 23:29:13 :::HCHP</span>
     mechanism which can be provided on urgent basis in dealing with




                                                               .
</p><p id="p_35">    municipal solid waste at Parwanoo.
</p>




<p id="p_36">    19.      Since Parwanoo is the first industrial township of the State





    and Gateway to the State of Himachal Pradesh, we are certain that

    sold waste and sewage cannot be allowed to be thrown in the open

    and kept unprocessed. As such, we deem it appropriate to segregate





    this issue and direct registration of a separate CWPIL to exclusively

    deal with the same. Registry to take necessary action.
