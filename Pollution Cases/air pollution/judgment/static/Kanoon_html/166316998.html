                          --------
For the petitioner:       Mr. Sumeet Gadodia, Advocate
For State of Jharkhand: J.C. to A.G.
For the Board:            Mr. A.K.Pandey, Advocate
                          --------
                       st
Order No. 02: Dated 1 August, 2011
Per D.N.Patel, J.

</pre><p id="p_3">1.   Learned counsel for the petitioner is challenging the order, passed
     by the respondent-Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board dated
     21st November, 2009, which is at Annexure 4 to the memo of
     petition, whereby, it has been directed that the petitioner-unit may
     be closed down. It is further submitted by the learned counsel for the
     petitioner that the respondents have no power, jurisdiction and
     authority to pass such a direction. Moreover, a copy of the letter
     upon which reliance has been placed dated 20th August, 2009,
     written by the Secretary, Forest &amp; Environment Government of
     Jharkhand, while passing the impugned order, has never been
     supplied to the petitioner. The document, which has been relied
     upon by the respondents, though is not a secret document under the
     Officials Secret Act, even then a copy of the said document has not
     been supplied to the petitioner and reliance has been placed while
     passing the impugned order and, thus, there is a gross violation of
     the principles of natural justice. Moreover, the procedure laid down
     under <a href="/doc/64492593/" id="a_1">Section 21(4)</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution)
     Act</a>, 1981 has not been complied with. Neither any notice nor
     opportunity of being heard has been given to the petitioner, while
     passing the impugned order and hence also, the impugned order
     deserves to be quashed and set aside.
</p><p id="p_4">2.   The petitioner is working as a crushing unit since 2005 and has
     never violated of any of the law, much less violation of the Act,
     1981. Never any notice has been given by the Jharkhand State
     Pollution Control Board for violation of any of the Air (Prevention and
     <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. Directly and abruptly the impugned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2.</span>
     order has been passed for closure of the petitioner unit and hence,
     during pendency and final hearing of this writ petition, let the
     impugned order be stayed and the petitioner-unit may not be closed
     down by the respondents and the unit may be allowed to continue
     with its activities, like several other crushing units, as has been
     allowed by this Court in several other writ petitions. It is submitted by
     the learned counsel for the petitioner that in not less than three
     dozen matters, similar order has been passed by this Court, one of
     them is W.P.(C) No. 3277 of 2011. Those writ petitions have been
     admitted for final hearing and the stay has been granted by this
     Court and, therefore, let this matter be also tagged with the
     aforesaid writ petitions.
</p><p id="p_5">3.   In that view of the matter, Rule.
</p><p id="p_6">4.   Notice of Rule to the respondents. Learned counsel for the State
     waives notice on behalf of respondent no.1 whereas Mr. A.K.
     Pandey, learned counsel, waives notice on behalf of respondent
     nos. 2 and 3 and they are seeking time to file reply.
</p><p id="p_7">5.   Time, as prayed for, is granted.
</p><p id="p_8">6.   Petitioner is also directed to implead the Union of India through
     Ministry of Environment and Forest as respondent no.4 to the
     present petition. Leave to amend is granted. The amendment shall
     be carried out in red ink during course of the day. Let a copy of this
     writ petition along with its Annexure be given to the learned
     Assistant Solicitor General of India, appointed for this Court.
</p><p id="p_9">7.   So far as interim relief is concerned, it appears that there is a prima
     facie case in favour of the petitioner and balance of convenience is
     also in favour of the petitioner, for the reasons that (i) no notice has
     ever been issued to the petitioner, as required under <a href="/doc/64492593/" id="a_4">Section 21(4)</a>
     of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981; (ii) Never a
     document, which has been relied upon by the respondents, while
     passing the impugned order at Annexure 4 to the memo of petition,
     has been supplied to the petitioner; and (iii) in similarly situated
     matters, in not less than 3 dozen matters, this Court has allowed the
     crushing units to continue with their activities and those matters
     have already been admitted by issue Rule. One of such writ
     petitions is W.P.(C) No. 3277 of 2011.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                  3.</span>
<p id="p_10">             8.   In that view of the matter, I hereby stay the operation,
                  implementation and execution of the order passed by the Member
                  Secretary, Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board, Ranchi, dated
                  21st November, 2009, which is at Annexure 4 to the memo of
                  petition, till the next date of hearing. Meanwhile, I hereby direct the
                  respondents to allow the petitioner-unit to continue with its crushing
                  activities.
</p><p id="p_11">             9.   Rule is made returnable on 25th August, 2011.
