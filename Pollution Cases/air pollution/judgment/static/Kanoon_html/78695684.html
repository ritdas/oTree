As per Dipak Misra, C.J.

<p id="p_2">                      In this batch of appeals, the assail is to the common order

           dated 24.11.2009 passed by the learned Single Judge disposing of

           three writ petitions, namely, CWJC No.7646 of 2009, CWJC

           No.7567 of 2009 and CWJC No.8075 of 2009, whereby he has

           directed the Chief Councillor to fix and notify a special meeting with

           regard to no confidence motion against him and the Deputy Chief

           Councillor in accordance with the requisition as received and seek

           confidence of the House within the period as provided under the

           Bihar Municipal Act, 2007 (for brevity, „the Act‟).

</p><p id="p_3">           2.           Be it noted, though there were three writ petitions and

           three appeals have been preferred against the common order passed

           by the learned Single Judge, yet the factual exposition in all the cases
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  -7-</span>




has an inseparable thread of commonality and, therefore, it is

apposite to adumbrate the facts in singular compartment.

</p><p id="p_4">3.          Eighteen Councillors of Madhubani Nagar Parishad

filed requisition for convening special meeting of the Nagar Parishad

for considering of the vote of no confidence against the Chief

Councillor as well as the Deputy Chief Councillor. On the basis of

the requisition, the Chief Councillor fixed the meeting to 16.07.2009

and noticed the Councillors. On the 09th of July, 2009, the in-charge

Additional Collector informed the Chief Executive Officer of the

Nagar Parishad that in view of the order dated 08.07.2009 of the

District Magistrate, Madhubani, the special meeting relating to the

vote of no confidence against the Chief Councillor and the Deputy

Chief Councillor should be adjourned to 10.30 a.m. on 17.07.2009

and the said meeting should be held at the Vikash Bhawan. It is the

admitted position that the Collector-cum-District Magistrate had

received the earlier communication from the Nagar Parishad in

which the meeting was fixed to 16.07.2009. As the Collector-cum-

District Magistrate had no role in the scheme of the Act, the said

order passed by the Collector came to be challenged in CWJC

no.8075 of 2009. The writ petition came to be filed by the petitioners

who are the Chief Councilor and the Deputy Chief Councillor.

</p><p id="p_5">4.           In CWJC No.7646 of 2009, a Ward Member assailed

the notice containing memo no. 442 dated 01.07.2009 issued by the

Executive Officer, Nagar Parishad, Madhubani by which he had

directed the Chief Councillor to call a meeting on 16.07.2009 at

</p><p id="p_6">11.a.m. for consideration of the no confidence motion. The notice

issued by the Executive Officer contained the circular issued by the

State Government, as contained in memo no.2360 dated 22.06.2009,

wherein it has been stipulated that the meeting would be held as per

the procedure laid down in the said circular. Be it noted, the said

circular has been issued by the Principal Secretary, Department of

Urban Development and Housing. The writ petitioner challenged the

circular on the ground that in the said circular, it has been stipulated

that once a notice has been given for holding a meeting of no

confidence motion, the same shall not be postponed and for

discussion on the motion, there would be no necessity for a quorum.

To put it otherwise, it has been conveyed by the circular that the

meeting of no confidence would be allowed to continue even if the

minimum quorum is not fulfilled. It was contended that the authority

had no power to issue such a circular as that would run counter to the

mandate of the statute.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.    In CWJC No.7567 of 2009 filed by the petitioner-Chief

Councillor of the Municipal Council,it was stated that after getting

the information from the Chief Executive Officer, he had instructed on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   -9-</span>




22.06.2009 for convening the meeting of the council on 16.07.2009,

but the same was adjourned by the Collector placing reliance on the

circular dated 22.06.2009 which had no legs to stand upon. It was

also urged that the District Magistrate had no right to change the date

or to preside over the meeting. It was also contended that in the

absence of any framing of rules as mandated under Section 25(4) of

the Act, vote of no confidence motion could not be mooted.

</p><p id="p_8">6.           A counter affidavit was filed by the answering

respondents contending, inter alia, that in the absence of the statutory

rule, the State was competent to issue circular which would have

force of the rule. The said circular provides that where there is no

confidence motion against the Chief Councillor and the Deputy

Chief Councillor simultaneously, the meeting would be called for by

the Collector of the District and would be presided over by him and

convened under his supervision or under his delegated authority. It

further provides that for such a special meeting, there would be no

requirement of quorum. It was put forth that as no procedure is

envisaged in the Act how a vote of no confidence motion is to be

moved and mooted when there is a requisition against both the Chief

Councillor and the Deputy Chief Councillor, the said circular was

issued to fill up the lacuna. Reliance was placed under various

provisions of the Act especially Section 487 of the Act which deals

with removal of difficulties.

</p><p id="p_11">7.              Before we proceed to state about the conclusions

arrived at by the learned Single Judge, it is apt to mention that on

16.07.2009 in CWJC No.8075 of 2009 wherein the postponement of

the meeting by the District Magistrate vide communication dated

09th July, 2009 was assailed, the said order was stayed and further it

was directed status quo prior to the holding of the meeting of no

confidence motion fixed for the date, i.e., 16.07.2009, shall be

maintained.
</p>
<p id="p_12">8.              The learned Single Judge, after hearing the learned

counsel for the parties, came to hold that the notification issued by

the State Government vide memo no.2360 dated 22.06.2009 making

provision for holding of special meeting is totally contrary to the

provisions contained in Sections 25(4) and 51 of the Act and,

therefore, cannot be accepted to remain in force and the State

Government in the guise of issuing executive instructions cannot

usurp the statutory provision. He has further opined that the Act

itself takes care about the person who would preside over the

meeting under Section 51 of the Act and, hence, the District

Magistrate could not have been conferred the power by executive

instruction more so in the absence of a rule. The language employed

in Section 25(4) of the Act to the effect that "the manner prescribed"

would mean the manner prescribed as in the statute, meaning thereby

making rules and not by issuing executive instructions. The learned

</p>
<p id="p_14">


Single Judge has further held that the State Government had no

authority whatsoever to stipulate that no quorum would be necessary

as the same is in clear transgression of the postulates laid down in

the Act. Being of this view, the learned Single Judge came to hold

that the meeting could not have been adjourned by the District

Magistrate. After so holding, it has been noted by him that by order

dated 16.07.2009, the writ court had stayed the communication of

the Collector and a meeting was held by the Chief Councillor on that

day and the same was attended by 12 members. The learned Single

Judge further took note of the fact that once the meeting was

adjourned by the District Magistrate and due to the interim order

passed on 16.07.2009 in which parties were not represented the

meeting was held, it cannot be regarded as a notice to all. He further

took note of the fact that the Chief Councillor and the Deputy Chief

Councillor after obtaining the interim order immediately held the

meeting on the same day and, therefore, the resolution passed therein

cannot be treated to be proper resolution passed in a valid meeting

and, accordingly, it directed the Chief Councillor to fix and notify a

special meeting, with the agenda with regard to no confidence

motion against him and the Deputy Chief Councillor in accordance

with the requisition, as received and seek confidence of the House

within the period as has been provided in the Act.

be called for this purpose in the manner prescribed upon a requisition

made in writing by not less than one-third of the total number of

been stated that `prescribed‟ means `prescribed by rules made under

the Act‟. It is not in dispute that the State Government has not

framed the rules. In the absence of the rules, a circular has been

issued by the Under Secretary, Department of Urban Development,

Govt. of Bihar, Patna. The said circular in various clauses has laid

down certain conditions which have been discussed by the learned

single Judge at length. In Clause 4 of the said circular, there is a

stipulation that no quorum would be necessary. The said stipulation

is in flagrant violation of the statutory provisions and cannot be held

to be valid. That apart, the said circular confers power on the District

Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_33">13.           Chapter VII of the Act in Part-A deals with Transaction

of Business by Municipality. Section 51 which occurs in the said

provision reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          "51.Presiding officer of a meeting of Municipality.-
          (1) The Chief Councillor shall preside at every
          meeting of the Municipality and in his absence the
          Deputy Chief Councillor shall preside the meeting:

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">          Provided that when a meeting is held to consider a

          a meeting of the Municipality, shall also have, and
          may exercise, a casting vote in all cases of equality of
          votes".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">14.           On a reading of the said provision, it is clear as day that

the Chief Councillor shall preside over the meeting and in his

<p id="p_36">


absence, the Deputy Chief Councillor shall do so. In the proviso, an

exception has been carved out that the Chief Councillor shall not

preside at such a meeting if the meeting has been convened to

consider a motion for his removal. Sub-section (2) empowers the

Chief Councillor or the person presiding over a meeting of the

Municipality to exercise a casting vote in all cases of equality of

votes. It can be stated by applying the deductive method that a

person who has power to cast his vote can only preside over the

meeting. If the scheme of the Act is read in proper perspective, there

can be no scintilla of doubt that a Chief Councillor who has power to

participate in the transaction has power to vote. Thus, a Chief

Councillor can, under certain circumstances, be asked to preside over

the meeting. Such a contingency can be met with if there is a

requisition to moot a motion of no confidence against the Chief

Councillor and the Deputy Chief Councillor.          No role can be

ascribed to any person from the executive to preside over such a

meeting. True it is, there are provisions in certain statutes where a

meeting is held in the presence of the Executive Officer of the

Municipality or by a Sub Divisional Officer or even by the District

Magistrate, but in the said provisions, no power is conferred on them

for casting vote in case of equality of votes but Section 51 of the Act

has been differently couched and, therefore, the only conclusion that

can be arrived at is that a meeting has to be presided over by the

Chief Councillor or the Deputy Councillor or the Councillor which

would be in apposite and in fitness of thing in a democratic set up

regard being had to the power conferred on the Municipalities under

the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_39">15.           In view of the aforesaid, the plea of the State Government

that to meet a contingency of this nature, the executive instruction

was issued does not deserve acceptance and, accordingly, we concur

with the finding of the learned single Judge on that score.

</p><p id="p_40">16.                It is next contended by the learned counsel for the

appellants that in the absence of a rule as provided under Section

25(4) read with Section 2(76) of the Act, no meeting can be held for

mooting a motion of no confidence.
</p>
<p id="p_41">17.               The learned counsel for the appellants, in this context,

has commended us to certain authorities. <a href="/doc/1443197/" id="a_1">In P. Kasilingam &amp; Ors.

v. P.S.G. College of Technology &amp; Ors</a>., (AIR 1995 SC 1395), it

has been held as follows:

           power conferred by Section 53 of the Act. Under
           Section 54(2) of the Act every rule made under the Act
           is required to be placed on the table of both Houses of
           the Legislature as soon as possible after it is made. It is
           accepted principle of statutory construction that "rules
           made under a statute are a legitimate aid to construction
           of the statute as Contemporanea Expositio" (See :

       2(b) and Rule 2(d) defining the expression "College"
       and    "Director"        can,     therefore,   be   taken   into
       consideration       as    contemporanea        exposition    for
       construing the expression "private college" in Section
       2(8) of the Act. Moreover, the Act and the Rules form
       part of a composite scheme. Many of the provisions of
       the Act can be put into operation only after the relevant
       provision or form is prescribed in the Rules. In the
       absence of the Rules the Act cannot be enforced. If it is
       held that Rules do not apply to technical educational
       institutions the provisions of the Act cannot be enforced
       in respect of such institutions. There is, therefore, no
       escape from the conclusion that professional and
       technical education institutions are excluded from the
       ambit of the Act and the High Court has rightly taken
       the said view. Since we agree with the view of the High
       Court that professional and technical educational
       institutions are not covered by the Act and the Rules,
       we do not consider it necessary to go into the question
       whether the provisions of the Act fall within the ambit

to <a href="/doc/1445510/" id="a_4">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and expressed that

the substantive law as laid down in <a href="/doc/1445510/" id="a_5">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act must

context altogether and emphasis was laid on backing of procedural

law. It was a decision rendered in the backdrop of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_10">Article 21</a> of the

        fair" accrual is the presentation of accounts in a manner
        which would reflect the true income/profit. One has,
        therefore, to look at the entire scheme of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_19">Companies

        Government constitute a complete scheme. Without the

        legitimate aid to construction of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_23">Companies Act</a> as

        <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_24">Companies Act</a>, like computation of book profit, net

<p id="p_48">22.               The principle laid down therein, we are disposed to

think, deals with a different facet altogether. Their Lordships have

expressed the view that without the rule, the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_25">Companies Act</a> cannot be implemented because of the object behind

the various provisions of the Act and, hence, the framing of the rule

was imperative.      As has been indicated hereinabove, the factual

matrix of the present case is in a different spectrum. It pertains to

calling of a meeting for vote of no confidence and, therefore, the said

decision is of no assistance to the learned counsel for the appellant.

</p><p id="p_49">23.            The learned counsel for the appellants commended us

the terms `as may be prescribed‟ could only be done by Rules and no

Rules have been made under Section 3(A) of the Uttar Pradesh Sales

Tax Act, 1948 (U.P. 15 of 1948) which makes every dealer liable to

sales tax if he was an importer from outside Uttar Pradesh and the

same cannot be substituted by a notification. It is well settled in law

that imposition of tax has to have a statutory sanction. <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_27">The Act</a> has

made a provision that it has to be provided by a rule and their

Lordships have held that it could not have been done by a

notification. Thus, the ratio laid down in the said decision is not

applicable to the case at hand.

<p id="p_52">24.           At this juncture, we may fruitfully refer to the decision

in <a href="/doc/1161634/" id="a_28">Orissa State Prevention and Control of Pollution Board v. M/s

Orient Paper Mills and another</a>, AIR 2003 S.C. 1966 wherein their

<p id="p_53">In that context, their Lordships have held in paragraphs 22 and 23 as

follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_23">           "22. Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_35">Article 166</a> empowers the

           the said business insofar as it is not business with
           respect to which the Governor is by or under the
           Constitution required to act in his discretion. The
           memorandum was issued in the name of the
           Governor. It is not in dispute that it was
           authenticated in terms of clause (2) of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_36">Article 166</a>
           of the Constitution. The power was exercised by
           the State under the provisions of the Act. The said
           order was to remain in force till rules are framed in
           the prescribed manner.

<blockquote id="blockquote_24">           23. The provisions of the Act mandate that the
           unladen weight and laden weight must be
           determined. Indisputably, weighing devices had to
           be provided for the said purpose. It is true that for
           the said purpose rules may have to be framed. It is,
           however, a well-settled principle of law that even
           in a case where the statute provides for certain
           things to be done, subject to rules, any action taken
           without framing the rules would not render any (sic
           that) action invalid. If a statute is workable even
           without framing of the rules, the same has to be
           given effect to. The law itself except in certain
           situations does not envisage vacuum. Non-
           compliance with the provisions relating to "laden

          nature must be held to be imperative in character."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_54">26.       From the aforesaid enunciation of law, it is clear as crystal

that if the provisions of the Act can be given effect to, non-framing

of the rules would not vitiate the act. The acid test is the workability

of the provisions. The submission of the learned counsel for the

appellants is that without framing of the rules, a vote of no

confidence cannot be carried out. They have invited our attention to

<a href="/doc/48504/" id="a_37">Sections 48</a> and <a href="/doc/795555/" id="a_38">51</a> of the Act. We have already reproduced <a href="/doc/795555/" id="a_39">Section

51</a> of the Act hereinabove. <a href="/doc/48504/" id="a_40">Section 48</a> of the Act reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">            48. Meetings.- (1) The Municipality shall meet
          not less than once in every month for the
          transaction of its business.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_28">          (2) The Chief Councillor may, whenever he thinks
          fit, and shall, upon a requisition in writing by not
          less than one-fifth of the Councillors, convene a
          meeting of the Municipality.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_29">         (3) If the Chief Councillor fails to call the
         requisition meeting provided in sub-section (2), the
         meeting may be called by the persons who signed
         the requisition.
</blockquote><p id="p_55">27.            On a scrutiny of the scheme of the Act, we are of the

considered opinion that it cannot be said that without laying down of

the procedure for conduct of business in a special meeting under the

rules, the provision as engrafted under <a href="/doc/501652/" id="a_41">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/795555/" id="a_42">51</a> of the Act

cannot really be effectively carried out. The procedure to be adopted

</p>
<p id="p_57">


has to be fair. Appreciating the scheme of the Act in entirety, we

notice that the Chief Councillor has been empowered to convene a

meeting of the Municipality. In fact, <a href="/doc/48504/" id="a_43">Section 48</a> of the Act adequate

guidance and safeguard. It is a well settled proposition of law that a

statute has to be read as a whole to understand its object and purpose.

On a reading of the provisions in entirety, we are of the considered

view that a vote of no confidence can be mooted and carried out

without framing of the rules and, hence, the provisions of the statute

are workable.
</p>
<p id="p_58">28.          The next contention that is canvassed is that the learned

single Judge has fallen into grave error by directing to convene

another meeting though a meeting had already been held on

16.07.2009. It is worth noting that initially the meeting was fixed on

16.07.2009 by the Chief Councillor himself. There was an

interdiction by the Additional Collector to postpone the meeting to

17.07.2009. The said communication was dated 9th July, 2009. This

Court on 16.07.2009, while directing stay of the notice dated

19.07.2009, had further directed status quo with regard to the

holding of the meeting of no confidence on 16.07.2009. On that day,

as is evident from the material on record, 12 Councillors attended the

meeting and it is not in dispute that the Madhubani Nagar Parishad

consists of 30 elected members. The learned single Judge opined

and rightly so that when all the Councillors were not represented and
</p><p id="p_59">                                 - 27 -
</p>
<p id="p_60">


the Court had interdicted and the meeting was held on 16.07.2009,

there was really no notice to all concerned. If we permit ourselves to

say so, the writ court has applied the doctrine that `nobody should

suffer for the fault of the Court‟. Eighteen Councillors had filed a

requisition for convening a special meeting of the Nagar Parishad for

considering the vote of no confidence. Sub-<a href="/doc/1410915/" id="a_44">section 25(4)</a> postulates

that a Chief Councillor or a Deputy Chief Councillor can be removed

from the office by resolution carried by a majority of the whole

number of Councillors holding the office. When the requisition was

sent by 18 elected Councillors and a meeting is scheduled there has

to be notice to all so that they can participate in the no confidence

motion. The meeting was conducted on 16.07.2009 because of an

interim order of this Court. The learned single Judge has held that

the said meeting was really no meeting in the eye of law. We think

the opinion expressed is correct inasmuch as in a democratic set up

there has to be a proper notice but in the instant case, there was a

state of confusion because of the interdiction by the Court at the

eleventh hour. The writ court thought it appropriate to rectify the

error and issue the direction. The same is in the fitness of things

because it would be travesty of justice if the Councillors who had

requested for convening the meeting were not noticed when to

appear in the meeting because nothing has been brought on record

that the Councillors were noticed again to attend the meeting on

16.7.2009.     Thus, we do not find any error in the said direction of

the learned single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_63">29.           Consequently, we perceive no merit in any of the appeals

and, accordingly, all the appeals are dismissed without any order as

to costs.
