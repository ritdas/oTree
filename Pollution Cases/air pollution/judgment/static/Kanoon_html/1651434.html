Background</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.    The Applicant filed an RTI application dt.29.12.08 with the CPIO, ICMR. He
      requested for information against 12 points with regard to DPC meeting held
      on 25.5.1988 and 5.8.1988 for promotion to the post of Administrative officer
      and in OA No.285 of 2006 in the matter of supersession in the grade of AO
      and SAO by Shri Prem singh.         The CPIO replied on 16.1.09 directing the
      Applicant to deposit a sum of Rs.10/- by DD in favour of DG, ICMR or deposit
      in cash. The applicant paid the amount but received no information. He then
      filed an appeal dt.30.1.09 with the Appellate Authority. On not receiving any
      reply, he filed a second appeal dt.2.3.09 before CIC.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.    The Bench of Mrs. Annapurna Dixit, Information Commissioner, scheduled the
      hearing for April 21, 2009.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.    Mr. C.S. Gupta, AO &amp; PIO and Mr. H.L. Arora, S.A&gt;O &amp; Appellate Authority

<p id="p_4">4.    The Applicant was present during the hearing.
</p>

<p id="p_5">Decision

</p><p id="p_6">5.    The Appellant submitted that in para 4.10 of his original appeal No.285 of
      2006 filed before the CAT on 30.1.06, the Respondent rejected the plea made
      by him in his representation dated 8.12.95 without even touching the main
      issue of supersession by his junior Shri Prem Singh and that despite not doing
      so, in para 4.10 of the Respondent,s reply, filed on 24.4.06 it is stated that
      the allegation of supersession by Shri Prem Singh was also considered and
      duly intimated to the Applicant.        According to the Appellant that no such
      information regarding supersession by Shri Prem Singh has been intimated to
       him.   Accordingly in his second appeal   he requested for the copy of the
      decision in the matter of supersession.
</p>

<p id="p_7">      The Respondent submitted that since this case is related to a legal issue and
      since a number of issues are co-related in the case of the Appellant and also
      since this case is on-going since 1997, the Public Authority will review all
      available information in this connection and provide the same to the
      Appellant. The CPIO is accordingly directed to provide the information which
      has been admitted before the CAT by the Respondent,       within 20 days of
      issue of this Order.
</p>

<p id="p_8">6.    The appeal is disposed off.

Name of the Applicant                  :   Mr.Rajesh Debroy

Name of the Public Authority           :   Central Pollution Control Board


Background

</p><p id="p_16">1.    The Applicant filed an RTI application dt.10.10.08 with the CPIO, CPCB. He
      stated that CPCB has been constituted under an Act of the Parliament. The
      general public does not know what type or category of organization it actually
      is? CPCB publications, MoEF's Annual reports and other documents identify
      CPCB differently.   Some say it is a grant in aid organization while others
      report it to be an autonomous institute, S&amp;T body etc.     He wanted to know
      the type of organization CPCB officially falls under with concrete documentary
      evidence to this effect.   He also wanted to know whether the main roles,
      duties and current activities of CPCB are in line with that of the type of
      organization CPCB belong to.
</p>

<p id="p_17">      The CPIO replied on 3.11.08 enclosing the extract of provision of Section 3, of
      the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_1">Water Act</a>, 1974 which deals with constitution of the Central Board, the
      <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_2">section 16</a> of the Water Act, 1974 and <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_3">Section 16</a> of the Air Act, 1981 which
      deals with the powers and functions of Central Board. Not satisfied with the
      reply, the Applicant filed an appeal dt.2.12.08 with the Appellate Authority
      stating that from the reply furnished by CPIO, it can be seen that CPCB
      passing the criteria and tests of different types of organization thereby
      indicating that it can possibly exist as any of the following forms of
      organization - Body Corporate, State Authority, Statutory Body, Government
      Agency, Grant in Aid organization, Autonomous Body and others.                He
      particularly wants to know what type of organization CPCB is. The Appellate
      Authority replied on 2.1.09 stating that once the full information is supplied
      by the CPIO, it is upto the Applicant to understand the meaning. Aggrieved
      with this reply, the Applicant filed a second appeal dt.24.2.09 before CIC.
</p><p id="p_18"> 2.      The Bench of Mrs. Annapurna Dixit, Information Commissioner, scheduled the
        hearing for April 21, 2009.
</p>

<p id="p_19">3.      Mr. S.N. Gundli, Law Officer &amp; CPIO, Mr. J.S. Kamyotra, Member Secretary &amp;
        Appellate Authority and Mr. Shriance Jain, Asstt. Secretary represented the
        Public Authority.
</p>

<p id="p_20">4.      The Applicant was not present during the hearing.
</p>

<p id="p_21">Decision

</p><p id="p_22">     5. The Respondent submitted that all the information has been provided to the
        Appellant. He stated that the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>
        1974 clearly gives the constitution of the Central Pollution Control Board.
        This has been intimated to the Appellant who also happens to be working for
        CPCB. The Respondent further stated that the sub section 3 of Chapter II of
        the Act provides the exact statutory status of the Body.     The CPCB     is a
        Research Organisation and an autonomous body receiving 100 % grant-in-aid
        from the Government. The main functions of the Board are categorized under
        <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_5">Section 16</a> of both the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a>s.    According to the Respondent no
        other roles and duties exist as far as the CPCB is concerned, outside those
        given in the Act. They further added that CPCB publishes Annual plans which
        spell out activities to be undertaken by the Board on an year to year basis.
        The CPCB implements activities broadly in the areas of (i) development of
        standards and their compliance, (ii)monitoring of ambient environment of
        water, air and noise, (iii) technological development for abetment/control of
        pollution, (iv) issues related to biomedical/plastic/hazardous/municipal waste
</p><p id="p_23">        (v) material and research and development activities etc. It is the
        Respondent's    contention that the Appellant is aware of all these activities
        since he is an Environmental Engineer working for CPCB.
</p>

<p id="p_24">     6. The Commission noted that in his appeal the Appellant has not asked for any
        information but has requested for initiating action against the CPIO for
        providing misleading and confusing replies    and holds that the Appellant's
        appeal   for imposition of penalty on the CPIO does not have any merit     as
        information was provided by the CPIO well within the mandatory period.
</p><p id="p_25">       7. After hearing the submission of the Respondent and on perusal of the
         information provided, it was found that all available information has been
         provided to the Appellant and since no further information has been sought in
         the 2nd appeal, the appeal is rejected.
