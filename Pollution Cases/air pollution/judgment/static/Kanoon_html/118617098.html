                                   ...
     For the Appellant   : Mr.S.L.Agrawal, Advocate
     For the Respondents: M/s Ajit Kumar, AAG &amp; Vikash Kumar,JC
                           to AAG.

                                      Dated 7th July, 2014
By Court-       This appeal is directed against the order dated

4.12.2013</pre><p id="p_1"> passed in W.P.(C) No. 7668 of 2012 , whereby the

Interlocutory Application filed by the appellant being I.A. No. 5231

of 2013, seeking stay of letter no.30 dated 5.11.2012 issued by the

Forester, Bhadudih, Jamshedpur has been rejected.

</p><p id="p_2">2.              The appellant is carrying on the business of

manufacturing of brick at Plot nos. 287(P), 284, 288, 295, 530,

342, 347 ,348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 356, 529, 531, 532,

533, 534, 358,340,344,343,345(P) and 294 having an area of 9.49

acres at Mauza Rapcha in the district of East Singhbhum since

2005-06. The appellant has been granted permit under Rule 31 of

the Jharkhand Minor Mineral Concession Rules by the Assistant

Mining Officer, East Singhbhum for the year 2005-06. For running

the brick kiln, the appellant       was granted consent by the

Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_1">Section 21</a> of the

Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.

</p><p id="p_3">3.        For the protection and existence of ecology and habitat of

wild life of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary, the Government of India has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                         2.</span>

taken steps for prohibiting the running of industries of brick kiln

in the Eco-sensitive Zone of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary vide Ministry

of Environment and Forests Notification No. S.O. 680(E)               dated

29.3.2012 and pleased to notify the area up to five kilometers as

Eco Sensitive Zone. Stating that the appellant- brick kiln is a

polluting industry and is remitting hazardous solid waste in

terrestrial   area of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary as well as using

firewood in the process of baking bricks as well as damaging forest

environment which is ultimately consumed by the wild animals

and to ensure that the provisions of above Notification is complied

with, the Forester, Bhadudih, Jamshedpur issued a closure notice

to the appellant vide letter dated 5.11.2012, whereby the appellant

has been directed to close the brick kiln forthwith, otherwise action

would be taken against him under the provisions of Wild Life

Protection act.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    Challenging the said notice, the appellant filed the writ

petition. In the writ petition, the appellant filed an Interlocutory

Application being I.A. No. 5231 of 2013, claiming for stay of the

impugned letter dated 5.11.2012 and the same was disposed of on

4.12.2013     holding     that    any   interim     order   passed   would

tantamount to declaring the said order as bad and illegal at the

initial stage without hearing the writ petition on merit.

</p><p id="p_5">5.   Being    aggrieved      by   the   dismissal   of   the   Interlocutory

Application, the appellant has filed this Letters Patent Appeal.

</p><p id="p_6">6.   When the Letters Patent Appeal came for hearing, the

appellant was represented by the learned counsel- Mr.S.L.Agrawal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3.</span>

        and the respondent- State is represented by Mr.Ajit Kumar,

        learned   Additional   Advocate     General,   appearing   along   with

        Mr.Vikash Kumar, learned JC to AAG.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7.   The present Letters Patent Appeal is preferred against the

        dismissal of the Interlocutory Application. Admittedly, the main

        writ petition is pending before the learned Single Judge.

</p><p id="p_8">        8.   Since the main writ petition is pending, we are not inclined to

        go into the merits of the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        9.   The Letters Patent Appeal is disposed of giving liberty to the

        appellant to raise all the contentions before the learned Single

        Judge in the pending writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_10">        10. We request the learned Single Judge to take up the writ

        petition at an early date.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">                                                (R. Banumathi, C.J.)
