                  CRL.APPEAL No.1847 OF 2009
                 ==========================
                 Dated this the 4th day of June, 2015


                            JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       This appeal is directed against judgment dated 10.2.2009 in

C.C.398 of 2006 passed by the Court of Judicial First Class

Magistrate, Koyilandy. The appellant herein was the complainant

therein. He filed the complaint alleging commission of offences under

<a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_1">sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_2">22</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1981 (for short the 'Act') read with <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_4">section 37</a> of the Act, by the

first respondent. Cognizance was taken thereon and it was taken on

file and numbered as C.C.398 of 2006.         On appreciation of the

evidence adduced by the parties, the learned Magistrate arrived at the

finding that the appellant/complainant had failed to establish

commission of aforesaid offences by the accused/first respondent and

consequently, acquitted him under <a href="/doc/1454285/" id="a_5">section 255(1)</a> of the Code of

Criminal Procedure. It is aggrieved by the same that the captioned

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl.A.1847/09                        2</span>



appeal has been filed by the complainant/appellant.




</p><p id="p_2">      2.The case of the complainant/appellant was that he and his

family are residing at Vanmukam amsom, Chingapuram Desom in

Koyilandy.     He is a sexagenarian and was leading a peaceful

retirement life. While so, the first accused constructed a flour mill by

name 'Kalleri Flour Mill' near to his house without prior sanction and

operated it from 13.2.2004 without obtaining license and consent to

operate. Rice, wheat, coriander, chilly, turmeric etc. are being ground

in the mill. Owing to such activities of the first respondent, the

surrounding area got polluted in such a manner that it affected the

health of the public at large. It is specifically stated in the complaint

that the appellant had conducted the flour mill in such an

objectionable manner from 13.2.2004 to 14.9.2004. It is with such

allegations that the complaint was filed by the appellant herein.




</p><p id="p_3">      3.To bring home the charge against the first respondent, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl.A.1847/09                       3</span>



appellant got himself examined as PW1 besides getting examined

PWs 2 and 3. Exts.P1 to P23 were also marked on his side. After the

closure of the evidence of the complainant/appellant, the first

respondent-accused was examined under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">section 313</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>.          He

denied all the incriminating circumstances put to him. On the side of

the first accused, Exts. D1 and D2 were got marked. However, he had

not adduced any oral evidence. Evidently, the appellant herein who

was examined as PW1 deposed in tune with his averments in the

complaint. He would depose that without obtaining prior sanction

from the authorities, the first respondent established the flour mill in

question and operated it from 13.2.2004 till 14.9.2004 without getting

license from the panchayat. He also deposed that the first respondent

had not obtained registration with SSA, sanction from the District

Medical Officer and consent to establish and consent to operate from

the Pollution Control Board. He further deposed to the effect that the

flour mill was being operated using 10 HP motor and owing to the

sound and dust pollutants emanating from the flour mill, himself and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl.A.1847/09                        4</span>



the members of his family were finding it difficult to live peacefully

and virtually, their health is adversely affected by its functioning. He

would also depose that to abate the nuisance, he had instituted

O.S.No.79 of 2004 before the Munsiff Court, Payyoli and Ext.P6 is

the decree passed thereon. He would also depose that despite the

decree passed by the Civil Court, the accused-first respondent

continued to operate the flour mill without complying with the

directions in the decree and that constrained him to file E.P.224/2005.

A Commission was taken out and the Commission after inspection,

filed Ext.P5 report dated 24.8.2005. The appellant has also produced

Ext.P3 which is a copy of the report submitted by the Assistant

Environmental Engineer attached to the PCB and also Ext.P4 which is

a copy of the letter from the Assistant Environmental Engineer dated

11.8.2005.    Ext.P7 is another report submitted by the Advocate

Commissioner on 2.1.2006. He has also produced certain documents

to show that the functioning of the flour mill creates health problems

to his family and evidently, those documents pertain to a period after

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl.A.1847/09                          5</span>



the period in question. PW2, the Medical Officer would admit the

issuance of Ext.P13 certificate. It is undated. He would depose that

PW1 is allergic to dust and smell of grains would cause Asthma. PW3

was the Secretary of the Thikkodi Grama Panchayat during the period.

Ext.P15 was got marked through him. During cross examination, he

deposed that the mill in question started functioning after obtaining

license. Later, he was recalled and re-examined and through him

Exts.D1 and D2 were marked. Exts.P18, P19, P20, P21 and P22 were

also marked through him. Ext.D1 is the certificate dated 31.10.2008

issued by PW3 to show that license was issued to the first respondent

to operate the flour mill using 10 HP motor. Evidently, it is after

analysing the oral and documentary evidence adduced by the parties

that the trial court arrived at the finding that the complainant/appellant

failed to establish commission of alleged offence by the first

respondent-accused.

<p id="p_4">


</p><p id="p_5">      4.Before appreciating the evidence on record, I think it apropos

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl.A.1847/09                       6</span>



to refer to the relevant provisions as also the position of law.

Evidently, the accusation against the first respondent herein is that by

establishing and operating the flour mill without obtaining prior

sanction as required under law, he violated the provisions under

<a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_8">sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_9">22</a> of the Act and thereby made himself liable to be

punished under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_10">section 37</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/195059463/" id="a_11">Section 21(1)</a> of the Act in so

far as relevant reads thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "21.Restrictions on use of certain industrial
            plants--(1) Subject to the provisions of this
            section, no person shall, without the previous
            consent of the State Board, establish or operate
            any industrial plant in an air pollution control
            area.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6"><a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_12">Section 22</a> of the Act reads as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            "22.Persons carrying on industry, etc., not to
            allow emission of air pollutants in excess of
            the standards laid down by State Board--No
            person operating any industrial plant, in any air
            pollution control area shall discharge or cause
            or permit to be discharged the emission of any
            air pollutant in excess of the standards laid
            down by the State Board under clause (g) of
            sub-section (1) of section 17.
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Crl.A.1847/09                         7</span>



<p id="p_7"><a href="/doc/91536186/" id="a_13">Section 37(1)</a> of the Act reads thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             "37.Filure to comply with the provisions of
             section 21 or section 22 or with the
             directions issued under section 31A--(1)

             section 21 or section 22 or directions issued
             under section 31A, shall, in respect of each
             such failure, be punishable with imprisonment
             for a term which shall not be less than one year
             and six months but which may extend to six
             years and with fine, and in case the failure
             continues, with an additional fine which may
             extend to five thousand rupees for every day
             during which such failure continues after the
             conviction for the first such failure."</blockquote><p id="p_8">




</p><p id="p_9">      5.<a href="/doc/195059463/" id="a_14">Section 21(1)</a> provides that no person shall, without the

previous consent of the State Board, establish or operate any industrial

plant in an air pollution control area. The trial court took note of the

fact that the entire Kerala State is declared as air pollution control area

as per SRO No.1831/1993 dated 26.11.1993 in Kerala Gazette (extra

ord.)No.8 dated 26.11.1993. Thus, in the light of such notification

issued invoking the power under <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_15">section 19</a> of the Act which

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Crl.A.1847/09                        8</span>



empowers the State to declare an area as air pollution control area

there cannot be any doubt with respect to the fact that the area in

question is also an air pollution control area. When once the said fact

is found indisputable, to establish that the first respondent has violated

the provisions under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_16">section 21</a> of the Act, the appellant was bound to

adduce evidence to the effect that the first respondent had either

established the flour mill in question without previous consent of the

PCB or operated in an air pollution control area. True that in view of

the fact that the entire Kerala State was declared as air pollution

control area, for a successful prosecution, the appellant ought to have

proved that the first respondent had established and operated the flour

mill during the period 13.2.2004 to 14.9.2004 without previous

consent of the PCB. Therefore, the question is whether the appellant

had succeeded in proving that the first respondent herein established

and operated the flour mill in question during the period between

13.2.2004 and 14.9.2004 lest there would not be any question of his

committing the offence under <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_17">section 22</a> of the Act. Now, I will

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">Crl.A.1847/09                       9</span>



examine the evidence on record. It is to be noted that the precise case

of the appellant herein was that without obtaining prior sanction, the

first respondent herein established and operated the flour mill during

the period 13.2.2004 to 14.9.2004. The learned counsel for the

appellant would submit that the court below erred in not taking into

account Exts.P3 and P4. Ext.P3 is the photocopy of the report filed

by the Assistant Environmental Engineer. Ext.P4 is the photocopy of

the letter from the Assistant Environmental Engineer dated 11.8.2005.

Ext.P3 was produced before the Munsiff Court, Payyoli in O.S.No.79

of 2004. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the said

report carried certification to the effect that the mill in question was

found functioning without obtaining consent to operate from the

Board. In the contextual situation, it is apposite to note that Ext.P3

report did not carry the date on which the inspection was made. When

the precise contention of the appellant was that the mill in question

was functioning during the period from 13.2.2004 to 14.9.2004

without obtaining prior sanction, date of inspection is a decisive,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">Crl.A.1847/09                         10</span>



relevant factor and obviously, the aspect is not discernible from

Ext.P3 report in view of the evidence tendered by PW3 to the effect

that the mill in question started its functioning after obtaining the

requisite licence.    It is to be noted in this context that the authority

who prepared and submitted the said report was not examined as

witness before the trial court.       No evidence whatsoever was also

adduced to show that it was without obtaining a consent to operate

that the mill in question was established and operated. It is a fact

borne out from the records that no such evidence was adduced before

the trial court to the effect that it was established and operated during

the period that too, without obtaining consent from PCB.         There is

absolute absence of any evidence to support the oral testimony of

PW1 to the effect that the mill in question started its functioning on

13.2.2004. In fact, in a bid to establish the said fact, the appellant

produced Ext.P6 judgment before the trial court. A scanning of the

impugned judgment would reveal the reason for not relying on Ext.P6

by the trial court to arrive at the conclusion that the first respondent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">Crl.A.1847/09                       11</span>



has committed the aforesaid alleged offence. A perusal of the same

would reveal that the trial court considered the question of

admissibility of the said document in the light of the decision of this

Court in <a href="/doc/1777512/" id="a_18">Rukhiya Beevi v. State of Kerala</a> [2004 (2) KLT 938] and

also in the light of the provisions under <a href="/doc/1038208/" id="a_19">sections 41</a> to <a href="/doc/43650/" id="a_20">43</a> of the Indian

Evidence Act. It is evident from the impugned judgment itself that the

learned counsel for the complainant canvassed the said position

relying on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/5732927/" id="a_21">Bachittar Singh

and another v. State of Punjab</a> [2003 SCC (Crl.) 233]. However,

on perusing the said decision, it is evident that it did not deal with the

subject involved in the case on hand. There cannot be any doubt with

respect to the position that a judgment of a civil court is not always

binding on the criminal court and of course it could be relied on

subject to the satisfaction of the conditions under <a href="/doc/1038208/" id="a_22">sections 41</a> to <a href="/doc/43650/" id="a_23">43</a> of

the Indian Evidence Act. At any rate, by mere production of such

document, it could not be said that the same would form a conclusive

evidence. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_24">Section 293</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_25">Cr.P.C</a> deals with reports of scientific experts

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">Crl.A.1847/09                        12</span>



which could be used in evidence in any enquiry, trial or in other

proceedings under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_26"> the Code</a>. Sub <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_27">section 4</a> thereunder would provide

categories of experts falling under sub section (1) thereunder. After

considering the said aspects, the trial court arrived at the conclusion

that the commission report filed by the appellant herein would not fall

under the said category. After considering Exts.P3 and P4, evidently,

the trial court arrived at the conclusion that they could not be relied on

to arrive at the conclusion that there was dust pollution or sound

pollution. The trial court also took into consideration the decision of

this Court in Rukhiya Beevi's case (supra) to hold that there could

not be any presumption that any particular industry is an industrial

plant coming within the definition under 2(k). In short, after careful

scanning of the evidence, both oral and documentary, the trial court

arrived at the conclusion that there was absolute absence of any

material to hold conclusively that the first respondent established and

operated the mill in question during the relevant period viz.,

13.2.2004 to 14.9.2004. The learned counsel for the appellant argued

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">Crl.A.1847/09                          13</span>



at length to drive home the contention that the said conclusion arrived

at by the trial court is not based on proper appreciation of the evidence

on record, but they are outcome of utter, perverse appreciation of

evidence. I have no hesitation to hold that the counsel had failed in

the said attempt as no evidence whatsoever was brought on record

legally by the appellant to establish the accusation against the first

respondent.     There is no document legally brought on record which

would reveal that the mill in question was established and operated

without obtaining the requisite license or permits from the concerned

authorities. When that be the circumstances, I cannot find any

illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgment inviting an appellate

interference. The long and short of the discussions is that this appeal

is liable to fail and accordingly, it is dismissed.
