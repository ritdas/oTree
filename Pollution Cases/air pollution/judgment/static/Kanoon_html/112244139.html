                        CRIMINAL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION


                 1 WRIT PETITION (CRIMINAL) NO. 135 OF 2008

<p id="p_1">P.Sathasivam,J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">1)    The only question raised in this writ petition,  filed  under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1">Article
32</a> of the Constitution of India, is as to whether FIR No. R.C.  0062003A0019
dated 05.10.2003 lodged under Section 13(2) read with Section 13 (1) (e)  of
the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_2">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as  “the  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_3">PC
Act</a>”) against the petitioner  herein  to  investigate  into  the  matter  of
alleged disproportionate assets  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the  directions
passed by this Court in the order dated 18.09.2003 in I.A. No. 376  of  2003
in W.P. (C) No. 13381 of 1984 titled <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_4">M.C.  Mehta  vs.  Union  of  India  and
Others</a>, (2003) 8 SCC 696?
</p><p id="p_3">2)    The case of  the  petitioner  as  stated  in  the  writ  petition,  is
summarized hereunder:
</p><p id="p_4">(a)   On the date of filing of this writ petition  before  this  Court,  the
petitioner was the Chief Minister of U.P.  Earlier also, the petitioner  had
been the Chief Minister of U.P. for three times.  The  petitioner  had  also
served as a Member of Parliament many a time both as a Member of  Lok  Sabha
and Rajya Sabha and had also served as a Member of Legislative Assembly  and
Legislative Council of the State of U.P.  The petitioner is a  law  graduate
and had been a teacher from 1977 to 1984.  At  present,  the  petitioner  is
the President of a National Political Party called as “Bahujan  Samaj  Party
(BSP)”, which is one of the six National Parties recognized by the  Election
Commission of India.
</p><p id="p_5">(b)   This Court, by order dated 16.07.2003 in I.A. No. 387 of 2003 in  Writ
Petition (C) No. 13381 of 1984 titled <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_5">M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India  &amp;  Ors</a>.
directed the CBI to conduct an inquiry on the basis of an I.A. filed in  the
aforesaid writ petition alleging various  irregularities  committed  by  the
officers/persons in the Taj  Heritage  Corridor  Project  and  to  submit  a
Preliminary Report.
</p><p id="p_6">(c)   By means of an order  dated  21.08.2003,  this  Court  issued  certain
directions to the CBI to interrogate and verify the assets  of  the  persons
concerned with regard to outflow of Rs. 17 crores which was alleged to  have
been released without proper sanction for the said Project.  When  the  case
was taken up for hearing on 11.09.2003, a report was submitted  by  the  CBI
and it was directed to be kept in a sealed cover in the Registry.
</p><p id="p_7">(d)   This Court, in its further order dated 18.09.2003,  on  the  basis  of
the  report  dated  11.09.2003,  granted  further  time  to  the   CBI   for
verification of the assets  of  the  officers/persons  involved.   The  CBI-
Respondent No. 2 herein submitted a report on 18.09.2003 before  this  Court
which formed the basis  of  order  dated  18.09.2003  wherein  the  CBI  was
directed to conduct an inquiry with respect to  the  execution  of  the  Taj
Heritage Corridor Project under Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) Area at Agra.
</p><p id="p_8">(e)   Pursuant to the orders of this Court, an FIR was lodged on  05.10.2003
being RC No. 0062003A0018/2003 under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_6">Section 120-B</a> read with  <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_7">Sections  420</a>,
<a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_8">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_9">468</a> and <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_10">471</a> IPC and under <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_11">Section 13(2)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1101716/" id="a_12">Section  13(1)(d)</a>  of
the PC Act against several persons including the petitioner herein.  In  the
said FIR, certain details and several developments  which  took  place  with
regard to the aforesaid Project have been given.   As  per  the  allegations
contained in  the  report  dated  11.09.2003,  several  irregularities  were
allegedly being found in the  aforesaid  Project.   Pursuant  to  the  same,
investigation has been completed and the report was forwarded to obtain  the
sanction from the competent authority, namely, the Governor for  prosecuting
the Chief Minster of the State.  The Governor, by  order  dated  03.06.2007,
declined to accord sanction to prosecute the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_9">(f)   According to the petitioner, in the aforesaid FIR, it was stated  that
this Court also directed the CBI to conduct an  inquiry  pertaining  to  the
assets of the officers/individuals concerned in  the  aforesaid  Project  as
mentioned in the judgment passed by this Court  in  the  aforesaid  case  in
order to ascertain whether any mis-appropriation of  funds  have  been  done
with regard to outflow of Rs. 17 crores released  for  the  construction  of
said Project.  A perusal of the order dated  18.09.2003  would  reveal  that
whatever directions were issued by this Court were only in  respect  of  Rs.
17 crores alleged to have been released without proper  sanction  and  there
is not even a whisper about making an investigation into  any  other  assets
of the persons involved in general.  In other words, the scope of the  order
of this Court was limited to the  extent  of  money  released  in  the  said
Project and not otherwise.  This is clear  from  the  order  of  this  Court
dated 18.09.2003 wherein it had specifically observed about lodging  of  FIR
only with regard to Taj Heritage Corridor Project case.  That order  nowhere
mentioned about lodging of second FIR  in  regard  to  the  disproportionate
assets of the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_10">(g)   It is the further case of the petitioner that contrary to  the  orders
of this Court, with mala fide intentions, the  CBI  registered  another  FIR
being R.C. No. 19 of 2003 on the same date i.e. 05.10.2003 only against  the
petitioner  alleging  therein  that  in  pursuance  of  the   orders   dated
21.08.2003, 11.09.2003 and 18.09.2003 passed by this Court,  they  conducted
an inquiry with regard to the  acquiring  of  disproportionate  movable  and
immovable assets by the petitioner and her close relatives and on the  basis
of this inquiry lodged the said FIR,  whereas  there  was  no  direction  or
observation by this Court to inquire into the assets of the  petitioner  not
related to the said Project case.
</p><p id="p_11">(h)   The said FIR has been lodged by Shri K.N.  Tewari,  Superintendent  of
Police, CBI/ACP, Lucknow, however, in the column of complaint at page No.  2
of the FIR, the name of the  complainant/informant  has  been  mentioned  as
Shri Inder Pal, Assistant Registrar, PIL Branch,  Supreme  Court  of  India,
New Delhi even  though  no  such  order  or  direction  issued  by  him  for
registration of the case.  It is further pointed out  that  Shri  Inder  Pal
has not signed any such  FIR  as  complainant/informant.   Pursuant  to  the
impugned FIR - R.C. No. 19 of 2003  the  CBI  conducted  raids,  search  and
seizure operations at all the premises of the petitioner and  her  relatives
and seized all the bank accounts.
</p><p id="p_12">(i)   The petitioner has made several representations to the CBI  officials,
the State Minister of Personnel and the Hon’ble  Prime  Minister  who  heads
the Personnel Department drawing their attention that the Supreme Court  had
not given any such direction or authority to the CBI  to  lodge  an  FIR  in
respect to the alleged disproportionate assets and  investigate  the  entire
assets of the petitioner from the year 1995 which have no relation with  the
case of Taj Heritage Corridor Project which came into being only in  August,
2003.  In spite of several reminders and further representations, till  date
no communication has been received from the CBI.  The absence of  any  reply
by any of the  authorities  including  the  CBI  shows  that  there  was  no
direction or authority to the CBI in the order dated 18.09.2003 to lodge  an
FIR or to investigate into the  assets  of  the  petitioner  which  are  not
related to the said Project.  Hence,  it  was  incumbent  upon  the  CBI  to
comply with the  provisions  of  <a href="/doc/1868602/" id="a_13">Section  6</a>  of  the  Delhi  Special  Police
Establishment Act, 1946 (in short ‘<a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_14">DSPE Act</a>’) which makes it  obligatory  to
obtain the consent of the  Government  of  the  concerned  State  to  confer
jurisdiction on the CBI to  investigate  in  any  case  arising  within  the
jurisdiction  of  a  State.   In  the  present  case,  FIR  was  lodged  and
investigation  was  conducted  without  obtaining  consent  of   the   State
Government which is in flagrant violation of <a href="/doc/1868602/" id="a_15">Section 6</a> of the DSPE Act.   In
the absence of the consent of the State Government, the  whole  exercise  of
the CBI about lodging of FIR  and  investigating  into  the  assets  of  the
petitioner  not  related  to  Taj  Heritage  Corridor  Project  is   without
jurisdiction and, therefore, the same is non est and void ab initio.
</p><p id="p_13">(j)   It is  further  pointed  out  that  this  Court  in  its  order  dated
25.10.2004, after perusing the investigation reports filed by the CBI,  held
that no link was found between  the  irregularities  alleged  to  have  been
found in respect to the assets matter and the Taj Heritage Corridor  Project
which was the subject-matter of the reference before the Special Bench.
</p><p id="p_14">(k)   The fact that this Court had stopped monitoring the  assets  case  was
again reiterated in the order dated 07.08.2006 passed by this Court.
</p><p id="p_15">(l)   On 27.11.2006, this Court finally decided the issue in respect to  the
FIR being R.C. No. 18 relating to the Taj Heritage Corridor matter  reported
in M.C. Mehta (Taj Corridor Scam) vs. Union of India &amp; Ors.,  (2007)  1  SCC
</p><p id="p_16">110.  In the said judgment, this Court observed that it  should  not  embark
upon an enquiry in regard to  the  allegations  of  criminal  misconduct  in
order to form an opinion  one  way  or  the  other  so  as  to  prima  facie
determine guilt of a person or otherwise.  When the matter  came  up  before
the Governor of U.P. to grant or refuse sanction for prosecution, he  sought
legal opinion from the Additional Solicitor General of India  and  based  on
his opinion and on  appreciation  of  entire  materials,  the  Governor  has
concluded that the petitioner was  not  even  remotely  connected  with  the
sanction of the said Project or the payment released for  the  same.   After
the above order of the Governor, the directions given by this Court  in  the
order dated 18.09.2003 were fully complied  with  including  in  respect  to
consider violations of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_16">PC Act</a>.  After this, there  was
no  justification  or  authority  with  the  CBI  to   continue   with   the
investigation in other personal assets of the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_17">(m)   On 05.06.2007, the CBI moved an application before the Special  Judge,
Anti Corruption Bureau, (CBI),  Lucknow  informing  that  the  Governor  had
refused to grant sanction.  On perusal of all the  materials  including  the
order of the Governor declining to grant sanction, the  Special  Judge  held
that in the absence of sanction to prosecute the petitioner, the  Court  has
no jurisdiction to take cognizance.
</p><p id="p_18">(n)   The order of the Governor was also challenged  before  this  Court  in
Writ Petition (Civil) No. 434 of 2007.  However, this Court, by order  dated
06.08.2007,  dismissed  the  same  as  withdrawn.   Even   thereafter,   the
petitioner has made several representations to the  Director,  CBI  to  drop
the investigation on the basis of the aforesaid FIR.  However,  the  CBI  is
bent upon harassing the petitioner.  Hence, she  approached  this  Court  by
filing the present writ petition.
</p><p id="p_19">Stand of the CBI-Respondent No.2:
</p><p id="p_20">3)    Pursuant to the notice issued on 15.05.2008, the  CBI-Respondent  No.2
herein has filed its counter affidavit wherein it was  stated  that  in  the
order dated 18.09.2003 of  this  Court,  there  was  a  clear  direction  to
register an FIR  for  investigating  into  disproportionate  assets  of  the
petitioner on the ground that in  the  said  order  it  was  mentioned  that
“apart from what has been stated in the reports with regard to  the  assets,
the   learned   ASG   Mr.   Altaf   Ahmad   has   submitted   that   further
inquiry/investigation is necessary by the CBI”.  It is further  stated  that
the validity of the aforesaid FIRs was not disturbed by the  Allahabad  High
Court by its order dated 22.10.2003 on the ground that the FIR  in  question
was filed as per the directions of this Court.  It is further stated by  the
CBI that the FIR No. RC 19 dated 05.10.2003 under <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_17">Section  13(2)</a>  read  with
<a href="/doc/669669/" id="a_18">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the  PC  Act  reveal  the  details  of  huge  amount  of
disproportionate assets possessed by the petitioner and her  family  members
beyond their known sources of income.
</p><p id="p_21">Further case of the petitioner:
</p><p id="p_22">4)    A  rejoinder  affidavit,  supplementary  affidavit  and  supplementary
counter affidavits have also  been  filed  wherein  subsequent  developments
which took place during the  pendency  of  the  writ  petition,  especially,
passing of  various  orders  by  the  Income  Tax  Authorities,  Income  Tax
Appellate Tribunal and the Delhi High Court in favour of the petitioner  for
different assessment years have  been  mentioned  holding  that  all  income
shown in her accounts in the form of  gift  or  otherwise  are  genuine  and
legal, covering from 1995 to 2004  of  which  period  the  assessments  were
reopened, investigated and reassessed.
</p><p id="p_23">Case of the intervenor:
</p><p id="p_24">5)    During the pendency of this writ petition, which was  filed  in  2008,
one Mr. Kamlesh Verma has filed I.A. No. 8 of 2010 claiming  that  he  is  a
social worker and petitioner  in  Writ  Petition  No.  2019  of  2009  (M/B)
concerning FIR being RC No. 18 dated  05.10.2003  for  intervention  in  the
above matter and to assist the Court.  By pointing out that it  was  he  who
challenged the order of the Governor declining to grant sanction in  respect
of FIR No. 18 and filed Writ Petition No. 2019 of 2009 which is  pending  in
the Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench, sought to  intervene  to  put-forth
certain factual details.  In the said application, the intervener  has  also
highlighted various earlier  orders  of  this  Court.   The  said  I.A.  was
resisted by the  petitioner  by  pointing  out  that  in  the  present  writ
petition the petitioner seeks quashing of the second FIR i.e.  R.C.  No.  19
only on the ground that there was no  such  direction  in  the  order  dated
18.09.2003  passed  by  this  Court.   The   intervention   application   is
therefore, misconceived.  It is also pointed out  that  the  intervener  has
filed his writ petition in Lucknow in 2009 and his intervention  application
was filed on 08.09.2010 whereas the petitioner had filed  writ  petition  in
May, 2008 and this Court had  issued  notice  on  15.05.2008.   It  is  also
pointed out that the intervener was not associated with the  Project  matter
before this Court at any stage when orders  were  passed  on  several  dates
commencing from 2003 ending with 2009.
</p><p id="p_25">6)    In the light of the above pleadings  of  the  parties,  we  heard  Mr.
Harish  Salve,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the  petitioner,  Mr.   Mohan
Parasaran, learned Additional Solicitor General for the Union of  India  and
CBI and Ms. Kamini Jaiswal, learned counsel for the intervener.

</p><p id="p_28">8)    It is clear from the narration of  facts  as  well  as  the  relief(s)
sought for in the writ petition that the petitioner is aggrieved  of  second
FIR being No. R.C. 0062003A0019 dated 05.10.2003.  It  is  also  clear  that
the petitioner has assailed the said FIR on the ground  that  there  was  no
direction by this Court in its  order  dated  18.09.2003  which  could  have
empowered the CBI to lodge two FIRs, namely, (i) FIR No.  R.C.  0062003A0018
dated 05.10.2003 under <a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_25">Section 120-B</a> read with <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_26">Sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_27">467</a>,  <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_28">468</a>,  and

against the petitioner as well as 10 other accused  persons  in  respect  of
Taj Corridor matter and (ii) FIR  No.  R.C.  0062003A0019  dated  05.10.2003
under <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_32">Section 13(2)</a> read with <a href="/doc/669669/" id="a_33">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the P.C. Act  against  the
petitioner only.      It is the specific stand of the CBI that in the  order
dated 18.09.2003 passed by this Court in  I.A.  No.  376  of  2003  in  Writ
Petition No. 13381 of 1984 - <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_34">M.C. Mehta  vs.  Union  of  India  and  Others</a>,
(2003) 8 SCC 696, there was  a  clear  direction  to  register  an  FIR  for
investigating into disproportionate assets of the petitioner on  the  ground
that in the said order, it is mentioned  that  “apart  from  what  has  been
stated in the reports with regard to the assets, the learned ASG  Mr.  Altaf
Ahmed has submitted that further inquiry/investigation is necessary  by  the
CBI”.  It is also their stand that the validity of the  aforesaid  FIRs  was
not disturbed by the Allahabad High Court by its order dated  22.10.2003  on
the ground that the FIR in question was filed as per the directions of  this
Court.   It  is  further  stated  that  the  second  FIR  being   No.   R.C.
0062003A0019 dated  05.10.2003  revealed  the  details  of  huge  amount  of
disproportionate assets possessed by the petitioner and her  family  members
beyond their known sources of income.
</p><p id="p_29">9)    As against the abovesaid stand of the  CBI,  the  petitioner,  in  the
form of rejoinder and supplementary affidavits, has  pointed  out  that  all
income shown in her accounts in the form of gift or  otherwise  are  genuine
and legal covering from 1995 to 2004.  It is further pointed  out  that  all
orders passed by the Income Tax Authorities have been brought on record  and
all of them attained finality and no further appeal is pending against  them
and all the assessments were reopened investigated and re-assessed.
</p><p id="p_30">10)   The petitioner has also filed a  consolidated  compilation  of  orders
passed by this Court commencing  from  16.07.2003  ending  with  27.04.2009.
Mr. Harish Salve, learned senior counsel for the petitioner  and  Mr.  Mohan
Parasaran, learned ASG took  us  through  all  those  orders.   Among  those
orders, we are very much concerned about the order dated 18.09.2003.  Before
going into the various directions issued in  the  said  order,  it  is  also
relevant to refer  the  earlier  orders  dated  16.07.2003,  21.08.2003  and
11.09.2003.  It is clear from those orders that this Court  by  order  dated
30.12.1996 in <a href="/doc/253098/" id="a_35">M.C. Mehta (Taj Trapezium  Matter)  vs.  Union  of  India  and
Others</a>, (1997) 2 SCC 353 issued  a  number  of  directions  to  protect  the
national and world  heritage  monument,  namely,  the  Taj.   Thereafter,  a
number of interim applications were filed by the persons concerned who  were
required to shift their business or manufacturing  activities.   This  Court
has  also  appointed  a  Monitoring  Committee  to  report   whether   those
directions issued by this Court are complied with or not.
</p><p id="p_31">11)   In the order dated 16.07.2003 – <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_36">M.C. Mehta  vs.  Union  of  India  and
Others</a>, (2003) 8 SCC 706, this Court, in order to find out who  cleared  the
project, i.e., construction of the ‘Heritage Corridor’ at Agra and for  what
purpose it  was  cleared  without  obtaining  necessary  sanction  from  the
Department concerned and whether there was any  illegality  or  irregularity
committed by the officers/persons, came to the conclusion  that  inquiry  by
CBI is necessary.  Accordingly, in para 16 of the  said  order,  this  Court
directed the Director of  CBI  to  see  that  inquiry  with  regard  to  any
illegality/irregularity committed by the officers/persons  be  conducted  at
the earliest and directed to submit a report  to  this  Court.   This  Court
also directed the CBI to submit Preliminary report  within  four  weeks  and
final report within two months from 16.07.2003.
</p><p id="p_32">12)   In the next order dated 21.08.2003, <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_37">M.C  Mehta  vs.  Union  of  India</a>,
(2003)  8  SCC  711,  this  Court,  after  going  through  the   Preliminary
Confidential Report submitted by the CBI, directed  the  higher  officer  of
CBI to interrogate four, five or six more persons who are  involved  in  the
decision-making of granting contract for construction of  the  Taj  Heritage
Corridor.  In the same order, this Court observed that it would be  open  to
the CBI officer to interrogate  and  verify  their  assets  because  it  was
alleged that Rs. 17 crores were released without proper sanction.
</p><p id="p_33">13)   The next order is dated 18.09.2003 - <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_38">M.C. Mehta  vs.  Union  of  India
and Others</a>, 2003 (8) SCC 696.  In this order, this  Court  referred  to  the
earlier directions and orders, more particularly, the direction  to  CBI  to
interrogate the persons involved and verify their  assets  in  view  of  the
fact that it was alleged that an  amount  of  Rs.  17  crores  was  released
without proper  sanction.   After  going  through  the  report  of  the  CBI
submitted on 11.09.2003, further time was given to the CBI for  verification
of the assets of the persons/officers involved.  In the course  of  hearing,
the CBI  has  pointed  out  that  income  tax  returns  of  various  persons
including  the  petitioner  were  collected  from   different   income   tax
authorities.  In the course of the  said  proceedings,  apart  from  various
reports with regard to the  assets,  the  learned  ASG  -  Mr.  Altaf  Ahmed
submitted that  further  inquiry/investigation  is  necessary  by  the  CBI.
Based on his request, this Court issued the following directions:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      “13.   Considering   the   aforesaid   report    and    the    serious

      Government of Uttar Pradesh as well as to the Cabinet Secretary, Union
      Government and to the Ministry concerned dealing with NPCC.”


</p><p id="p_35">14)   A perusal of the orders  prior  to  the  order  dated  18.09.2003  and
several directions in the order dated  18.09.2003  clearly  show  that  this
Court  was  concerned  with   illegality/irregularity   committed   by   the
officers/persons in carrying out the Taj  Heritage  Corridor  Project.   The
main allegation relates to an amount of Rs. 17 crores which was released  by
the State Government without proper sanction.  It  is  also  clear  that  in
order to find out who cleared the  project  and  for  what  purpose  it  was
cleared without obtaining necessary sanction from the  Department  concerned
and  whether  there  was  any  illegality/irregularity  committed   by   the
officers/persons, this Court  thought  an  inquiry  by  CBI  was  considered
necessary.  In such a situation, the CBI was  directed  to  interrogate  and
verify their assets.  As rightly pointed out by Mr. Harish Salve, there  was
no occasion for this Court to consider the alleged  disproportionate  assets
of the petitioner separately that too from 1995 to 2003 when admittedly  Rs.
17 crores were released in September, 2002.
</p><p id="p_36">15)    A  thorough  scrutiny  of  all  the  orders  including  the  specific
directions dated 18.09.2003 clearly show that the same was confined only  in
respect to the case relating to Taj Corridor Project which was the  subject-
matter of reference before the Special Bench.  It is relevant to  point  out
para 13(f) of the order dated 18.09.2003 which makes it clear that  the  CBI
could have lodged only one FIR No. R.C. 0062003A0018 dated  05.10.2003.   In
other  words,  inasmuch  as  there  being  no   consideration   of   alleged
disproportionate assets at any stage of the proceedings while  dealing  with
the Taj Corridor matter, there could not have been and in fact there was  no
such direction to lodge  another  FIR  being  No.  R.C.  0062003A0019  dated
05.10.2003 exclusively against the petitioner under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_42">P.C. Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_37">16)   In this regard, learned senior  counsel  for  the  petitioner  pressed
into service a Constitution Bench decision rendered in the case of State  of
West Bengal &amp; Ors. vs. Committee for Protection of Democratic  Rights,  West
Bengal &amp; Ors., (2010) 3 SCC 571.  After considering  various  constitutional
provisions relating to the State and the Union as well as <a href="/doc/1868602/" id="a_43">Section 6</a>  of  the
DSPE Act, the Bench has concluded thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">      “69. In the final analysis, our answer to  the  question  referred  is
      that a direction by the High Court, in exercise  of  its  jurisdiction
      under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_44">Article 226</a>  of  the  Constitution,  to  CBI  to  investigate  a
      cognizable offence alleged to have been committed within the territory
      of a State without the consent of that State will neither impinge upon
      the federal structure of the Constitution nor violate the doctrine  of
      separation of power and shall be valid in law. Being the protectors of
      civil liberties of the citizens, this Court and the High  Courts  have
      not only the power and jurisdiction but also an obligation to  protect
      the fundamental rights, guaranteed by Part III in  general  and  under
      <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_45">Article  21</a>  of  the  Constitution  in   particular,   zealously   and
      vigilantly.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">      70. Before parting with the case, we deem it  necessary  to  emphasise
      that despite wide powers conferred by  Articles  32  and  226  of  the
      Constitution, while passing any order, the Courts must  bear  in  mind
      certain  self-imposed   limitations   on   the   exercise   of   these
      constitutional powers. The very plenitude of the power under the  said
      articles requires great  caution  in  its  exercise.  Insofar  as  the
      question of issuing a direction to CBI to conduct investigation  in  a
      case is concerned, although no inflexible guidelines can be laid  down
      to decide whether or not such power should be exercised but  time  and
      again it has been reiterated that such an order is not to be passed as
      a matter of routine or  merely  because  a  party  has  levelled  some
      allegations against the local police. This extraordinary power must be
      exercised sparingly, cautiously and in exceptional situations where it
      becomes necessary to provide  credibility  and  instil  confidence  in
      investigations  or  where  the  incident   may   have   national   and
      international ramifications or where such an order  may  be  necessary
      for doing complete  justice  and  enforcing  the  fundamental  rights.
      Otherwise CBI would be flooded with a large number of cases  and  with
      limited resources, may find it difficult to properly investigate  even
      serious cases and in the process lose its credibility and purpose with
      unsatisfactory investigations.</blockquote>


<p id="p_38">      71. <a href="/doc/91463868/" id="a_46">In Minor Irrigation &amp; Rural Engg. Services, U.P.  v.  Sahngoo  Ram
      Arya</a> this Court had said that an order directing  an  enquiry  by  CBI
      should be passed only when  the  High  Court,  after  considering  the
      material on record, comes to a  conclusion  that  such  material  does
      disclose a prima facie case calling for an investigation by CBI or any
      other similar agency. We respectfully concur with these observations.”


</p><p id="p_39">17)   As rightly pointed out that in the absence of any  direction  by  this
Court to lodge an FIR into the matter  of  alleged  disproportionate  assets
against the petitioner, the Investigating Officer could not take  resort  to
<a href="/doc/279174/" id="a_47">Section 157</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in  short  ‘the  Code’)
wherein the  Officer-in-charge  of  a  Police  Station  is  empowered  under
<a href="/doc/833310/" id="a_48">Section  156</a>  of  the  Code  to  investigate  on  information  received   or
otherwise.  <a href="/doc/1868602/" id="a_49">Section 6</a> of the DSPE Act prohibits the CBI from exercising  its
powers and jurisdiction without the consent of the Government of the  State.
 It is pointed out on the side of the petitioner that, in the present  case,
no such consent was obtained by the CBI and submitted that  the  second  FIR
against the petitioner is contrary to <a href="/doc/1773948/" id="a_50">Section 157</a> of the Code and <a href="/doc/1868602/" id="a_51">Section  6</a>
of the DSPE Act. It is not in dispute that the consent was declined  by  the
Governor of the State and in such circumstance also the second FIR No.  R.C.
0062003A0019 dated 05.10.2003 is not sustainable.
</p><p id="p_40">18)   Mr. Mohan Parasaran, learned  ASG  as  well  as  Ms.  Kamini  Jaiswal,
learned counsel for the intervener after taking us through the  order  dated
18.09.2003 and other orders submitted that  the  CBI  was  well  within  its
power to pursue the second  FIR  No.  R.C.  0062003A0019  dated  05.10.2003.
Among various  directions,  Mr.  Mohan  Parasaran,  learned  ASG  very  much
pressed into service  the  direction  in  para  13(g)  of  the  order  dated
18.09.2003.  The said direction reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">      “(g) CBI  shall  take  appropriate  steps  for  holding  investigation

According to Mr. Mohan Parasaran, liberty  was  granted  by  this  Court  to
proceed against the petitioner.  He also relied  on  para  9  of  the  order
dated 25.10.2004 – <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_52">M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India and Others</a>,  (2007)  1  SCC

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">      9. The further investigation report filed by CBI  in  this  connection
      while indicating large-scale irregularities does not in fact show  any
      link between such irregularities and the Taj Corridor matter which  is
      the  subject-matter  of  reference  before  the  Special  Bench.   CBI
      therefore is at liberty to proceed with and take action on  the  basis
      of their investigation in respect of this FIR. In the event  any  link
      is disclosed in the course of  such  investigation  between  facts  as
      found and the Taj Corridor Project, CBI will bring  the  same  to  the
      notice of this Court. In any event,  CBI  will  be  entitled  to  take
      action on the basis of the investigation as it may think fit.”


In addition to the above, he also pressed into service para 4 of  the  order
dated 19.07.2004 – <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_53">M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India and Others</a>,  (2007)  1  SCC

      No. RC 0062003A0019 is concerned, three months’ time is granted.”

In view of the argument of  Mr.  Mohan  Parasaran  as  well  as  Ms.  Kamini
Jaiswal relying on the above directions, we  have  gone  through  all  those
orders meticulously.  According to us, the entire issue revolves around  the
order  dated  18.09.2003  passed  by  this  Court  as  the  FIR  was   filed
immediately thereafter on 05.10.2003.  The said FIR as well as  the  counter
affidavit filed by the CBI states that the FIR has been  filed  as  per  the
directions contained in the order dated 18.09.2003.  A perusal of  the  same
shows that the Assistant Registrar of this Court has been described  as  the
Complainant.  On going through all the orders, we are of the view  that  the
said objection of the petitioner cannot  be  rejected.   A  perusal  of  the
series of orders passed in W.P. No. 13381 of 1984 - <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_54">M.C. Mehta vs. Union  of
India and Others</a> clearly show that the order dated  18.09.2003  is  preceded
by other orders issued from  time  to  time  only  in  connection  with  Taj
Heritage Corridor Project.  While considering the directions issued  in  the
order  dated  18.09.2003,  it  is  incumbent  to  refer  the  orders   dated
16.07.2003, 21.08.2003 and 11.09.2003.  We have  already  noted  that  those
previous three orders passed by this Court state that the CBI  was  directed
to interrogate the persons involved and also to verify their assets  because
it was alleged that the amount of Rs. 17 crores was released without  proper
sanction. It is relevant to mention  that  in  the  order  dated  25.10.2003
(which we have already quoted in the earlier  paras)  this  Court  mentioned
that it was not monitoring disproportionate assets case since no link  could
be found between the Taj Corridor matter and the assets of  the  petitioner.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">(para 9 of the order dated 25.10.2004)  It is also  relevant  to  refer  the
next order dated 07.08.2006 wherein the same was once again  reiterated.  It
is true that in the order dated 25.10.2004, liberty was granted to  the  CBI
that in the event any link is disclosed in the course of such  investigation
between the Taj Corridor Project and the assets, CBI is free to bring it  to
the notice of this Court.  The fact remains that  the  investigation  report
filed by the CBI before this Court which was considered on 25.10.2004  shows
that  large-scale  irregularities  does  not  show  any  link  between  such
irregularities and the Taj Corridor matter.  The said finding/conclusion  by
this Court was based on the investigation report of the  CBI.   In  view  of
the same, we are satisfied that CBI cannot be permitted  to  take  the  view
that two cases, namely, Taj Corridor and Disproportionate  Assets  case  are
same and the investigation was done in both the cases as per the  directions
of this Court.   After  reading  the  entire  orders  dated  18.09.2003  and
25.10.2004, the stand of the CBI is to be rejected as unacceptable.
</blockquote><p id="p_41">19)   It is also brought to our notice that merely  because  various  orders
of this Court including the order dated 18.09.2003 has been communicated  to
various authorities in terms of the provisions of the rules of  this  Court,
the CBI is not justified in putting the Assistant Registrar  of  this  Court
as informant/complainant.  Further as rightly pointed out by Mr. Salve,  the
complainant/Assistant Registrar would not and cannot be  a  witness  in  the
case to corroborate the statements made in the  FIR  No.  R.C.  0062003A0019
dated 05.10.2003.  As rightly pointed out, proceeding  further,  as  if  the
said  Assistant  Registrar  of  this  Court  made  a  complaint  cannot   be
sustained.
</p><p id="p_42">20)   We have already pointed out  after  reading  various  orders  of  this
Court which show that Taj Corridor  was  the  subject  matter  of  reference
before the Special Bench.  Various directions  issued  in  the  order  dated
18.09.2003 have to be read  in  the  light  of  the  previous  orders  dated
16.07.2003, 21.08.2003 and 11.09.2003 as well  as  subsequent  orders  dated
25.10.2004 and 07.08.2006 wherein this Court has clarified that it  was  not
monitoring the disproportionate assets case.  We are satisfied that  reading
of all the orders of this Court clearly show the direction to lodge FIR  was
issued  only  with  respect  to  Taj  Corridor  matter,  more  particularly,
irregularities therein.  In fact, the direction was confined to find out  as
to who cleared the project of Taj Corridor  and  for  what  purpose  it  was
cleared and whether there was any illegality or  irregularity  committed  by
officers and other persons concerned in the State.  We  have  already  noted
all those orders which clearly state that the CBI  is  free  to  interrogate
and verify the assets of the officers/persons relating to release of Rs.  17
crores in connection with Taj Corridor matter.
</p><p id="p_43">21)   As discussed above and after reading all  the  orders  of  this  Court
which are available in the ‘compilation’, we are satisfied that  this  Court
being the ultimate custodian of the fundamental rights  did  not  issue  any
direction to the CBI to conduct a roving inquiry against the assets  of  the
petitioner commencing from  1995  to  2003  even  though  the  Taj  Heritage
Corridor Project was conceived only in July, 2002 and an amount  of  Rs.  17
crores was released in August/September, 2002.  The method  adopted  by  the
CBI is unwarranted and without jurisdiction.  We  are  also  satisfied  that
the CBI has proceeded without proper understanding of various  orders  dated
16.07.2003, 21.08.2003, 18.09.2003,  25.10.2003  and  07.08.2003  passed  by
this Court.  We  are  also  satisfied  that  there  was  no  such  direction
relating to second FIR, namely, FIR No. R.C. 0062003A0019 dated  05.10.2003.
 We have already referred to the Constitution Bench decision of  this  Court
in Committee for  Protection  of  Democratic  Rights,  West  Bengal  (supra)
wherein this Court observed that only  when  this  Court  after  considering
material on record comes to a conclusion that such material does disclose  a
prima facie case calling for  investigation  by  the  CBI  for  the  alleged
offence, an order directing inquiry by the CBI could be passed and that  too
after giving  opportunity  of  hearing  to  the  affected  person.   We  are
satisfied that there was no such finding or satisfaction  recorded  by  this
Court in the matter of disproportionate assets  of  the  petitioner  on  the
basis of the status report dated 11.09.2003 and,  in  fact,  the  petitioner
was not a party before this  Court  in  the  case  in  question.   From  the
perusal of those orders, we are also satisfied that  there  could  not  have
been any material before this Court about the disproportionate  assets  case
of the petitioner beyond the Taj Corridor Project  case  and  there  was  no
such question or issue about disproportionate assets of the petitioner.   In
view  of  the  same,  giving  any  direction  to  lodge  FIR   relating   to
disproportionate assets case did not arise.
</p><p id="p_44">22)   We finally conclude that anything beyond the Taj Corridor  matter  was
not the subject-matter of reference before the Taj  Corridor  Bench.   Since
the  order  dated  18.09.2003  does  not  contain  any  specific   direction
regarding lodging of FIR in  the  matter  of  disproportionate  assets  case
against the petitioner, CBI is not justified in proceeding with the FIR  No.
R.C. 0062003A0019 dated 05.10.2003.  In view of  the  above  discussion,  we
are satisfied that the CBI exceeded its  jurisdiction  in  lodging  FIR  No.
R.C. 0062003A0019 dated 05.10.2003 in the  absence  of  any  direction  from
this Court in the order dated 18.09.2003 or in any subsequent orders.
</p><p id="p_45">23)   Regarding the intervention application - I.A. No. 8 of 2010  filed  by
Shri Kamlesh Verma, though an  objection  was  raised  about  his  right  to
intervene in the matter, it is not in dispute that against the rejection  of
the sanction to  proceed  against  the  petitioner  by  the  State,  he  had
preferred a Writ Petition (C) No. 2019 of 2009 in the Allahabad  High  Court
which is  still  pending.   It  is  pointed  out  that  intervener  was  not
associated with the Taj Corridor matter before this Court at any stage  when
the   orders   dated   16.07.2003,   21.08.2003,   11.09.2003,   18.09.2003,
19.07.2004, 25.10.2004, 07.08.2006, 27.11.2006, 06.08.2007,  10.10.2007  and
27.04.2007 were passed.  It is true that the intervener has no  legal  right
to intervene in the matter of this kind where CBI has been  prosecuting  the
case vigorously against the  petitioner.  Inasmuch  as  the  intervener  has
challenged the order of the Governor of U.P. declining to grant sanction  to
prosecute the petitioner and the said  matter  is  pending  in  the  Lucknow
Bench of the Allahabad High Court, in order to assist the  Court,  we  heard
his counsel Ms. Kamini Jaiswal.  It is true that this Court  has  held  that
when investigating agency like CBI and Union of  India  are  contesting  the
matter  effectively,  the  third  party  was  not   permitted   to   canvass
correctness of the judgment by way of PIL (<a href="/doc/1787029/" id="a_55">Union of India &amp;  Anr.  vs.  W.N.
Chadha</a>, 1993 (Supp) 4 SCC 260) and <a href="/doc/1312184/" id="a_56">Janata Dal vs.  H.S.  Chowdhary  &amp;  Ors</a>.,
(1991) 3 SCC 756.  While accepting the above principles reiterated in  those
decisions, in view of the peculiar  facts  that  the  intervener  -  Kamlesh
Verma is pursuing his writ petition  against  the  petitioner  in  the  High
Court, we heard his counsel to assist the  Court.   In  view  of  the  above
special circumstance, we allow I.A. No. 8 of 2010 and  the  same  cannot  be
cited as a precedent for other cases.
</p><p id="p_46">24)   In the light of the above discussion, we hold that in the  absence  of
any specific direction from this Court in the order dated 18.09.2003 or  any
subsequent orders, the CBI has exceeded its jurisdiction in lodging FIR  No.
R.C.  0062003A0019  dated  05.10.2003.   The   impugned   FIR   is   without
jurisdiction and any investigation pursuant thereto is  illegal  and  liable
to be quashed, accordingly quashed.  The writ petition is allowed.
