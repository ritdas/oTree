     Petition claiming to be a social worker and a
public spirited person has filed this writ petition and
his grievance in that respondent nos.3 and 4 have
installed a Electricity Power Generation Plant (Power
House) near Tawa River at Sarni in District Betul
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 :2:</span>




(M.P.) it is adjacent to various villages and for the
purpose of generation of electricity hard coal is used
which is supplied from the coal mines belonging to
Western Coal Field Limited. It is alleged that during
the process of generation of electricity coal dust
(chura) rejected by the plant/machinery is dumped in
a dump yard which is adjacent to Tawa Dam (Tawa
River) which ultimately merges into the Naramada
River     near    Hoshangabad         (M.P.).   The     area    is
surrounded       by   various    colonies   belonging    to    the
Electricity Board, Western Coal Field Limited and many
villages. It is inhabited by the employees working for
these establishment and other villages who use the
water from the dam/river for drinking purpose. It is
said that the coal dust (chura) which is known as mill
reject coal comes into the dam/river as a result the
water is polluted and it becomes unsuitable for human
consumption or drinking purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.      Accordingly, contending that the Authority of the
State Government and the Pollution Control Board are
not taking any action for preventing the aforesaid
pollution being caused by the respondents to the river
in question, this writ petition has been filed.
</p><p id="p_3">3.      On notice being issued, respondent no.2, the
statutory authority discharging function under the
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Pollution Control Act</a>, represented by Shri Ashish
Shroti have filed a detailed reply along with an inquiry
report vide Annexure R-1 and from this report, it is
clear that the contention of the petitioner are not
correct. In the report submitted by the authorities of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            :3:</span>




the Pollution Control Board, it indicated that the coal
dust is collected and dumped in an area which is
surrounded by the thick wall there is no question of
coal dust going into the river or the dam in question.
Sometimes    in   the    rainy   season    there    may   be
possibility of seepage but that is not very alarming
and contending that there is no pollution in the river
as alleged, a report from the Central Laboratory is
also field with regard to testing of the water of the
river and the report indicates that no adverse material
is available to say that the water is polluted. By filing
a detailed documents along with Annexure/R-2. Shri
Ashish Shroti points out that the contention of the
petitioner that the coal dust being dumped by the
respondent nos.3 and 4 is causing pollution is not
correct.
</p><p id="p_4">4.   That apart, respondent nos.3 and 4 have also
filed a detailed reply and they deny the allegation
made in the writ petition. On the contrary they say
that initially this coal dust was being sold by auction
to   respondent   no.5    and    on   a   dispute   between
respondent nos.3 ,4 and 5, arbitration proceedings
were initiated which has now been concluded. It is
further stated by respondent nos.3 and 4, that as far
as the coal mill reject is concerned they are proposing
to use them and convert it to do carpentering work for
the coal handling plant yard itself and therefore within
a short period of time even this problem would be
rectified.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  :4:</span>




<p id="p_5">5.    Shri Anand Nayak, invites our attention to the
report submitted by the Pollution Control Board and
argues    that    in     this    report       it   is    indicated     that
respondent       nos.3     and        4    should       take   steps    for
auctioning of the coal dust which is collected so that
even if there is any chances of pollution by the
amalgamation of coal dust the same can be ruled out.
However, Shri Vivek Rusia submits that this would not
be necessary once the respondents as indicated have
already initiated process for using the coal dust for
carpentering purpose and various other purpose.
</p><p id="p_6">6.    Having considered the rival contentions and on
going through the report submitted by the Pollution
Control Board, we are satisfied that the allegation of
the petitioner with regard to pollution being caused in
the river because of the coal dust being dumped is not
correct. The report of the Pollution Control Board
particularly the report with regard to testing of water
of the river does not indicate any pollution, therefore,
the    contentions       of     the       petitioner     seems    to    be
baseless. That apart, with regard to apprehension
indicated by the Pollution Control Board in the matter
of    removal    of    the      coal      dust,    in    the   additional
submission submits by respondent nos.3 and 4 in
para-12 it has been clearly indicated that the disposal
of the mill reject coal sold by auctioning through
contractor is now being stopped w.e.f. February, 2013
and very soon the same mill reject coal which is
dumped and stocked in the Coal Handelling Plant is
being used for the purpose of carpentering of the coal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               :5:</span>




stock yard. That apart, as huge quantity of coal is
required for power generation, the mill reject coal
will be mixed with superior quality of imported coal
and then used.
</p><p id="p_7">7.    Accordingly, in the light of the aforesaid, we see
no reason to make any further indulgence instead we
observe that respondent nos.3 and 4 may proceed to
utilize the coal dust as indicated by them, in the
additional submission so that remotest possibility of
pollution be controlled is ruled out.
</p><p id="p_8">      With the aforesaid observations for the present,
we    find   no   case   is   made   out   for   any   further
indulgence into the matter accordingly, this petition
stands disposed of.
