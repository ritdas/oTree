                                       Dated : September 12 , 2013

JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON)

     Besides controverting the factual averments made by the

applicant in his application, the respondent has challenged the very

maintainability of the present application on the ground that it is

hopelessly barred by time and also in view of the fact that no

environmental clearance is contemplated in law for establishing a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   1</span>
 Sewage Treatment Plant (for short the 'STP'). It is contended by the

respondent,    State   of   Haryana,    that   the   application   under

consideration has been filed much beyond the prescribed period of

limitation under <a href="/doc/86312185/" id="a_1">Section 14(3)</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act,

2010 (for short 'the NGT Act'). The public at large, including the

applicant had the knowledge when the notifications under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_2">Sections

4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_3">6</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 were published in the

newspaper on 14th/15th January, 2010 while the present application

has been instituted on 24th May, 2013, which is highly delayed

having been filed much beyond the period of six months + additional

60 days in terms of Section 14(3) of the NGT Act. The application is

hopelessly barred by time and beyond that period the Tribunal has

no jurisdiction to condone the delay in face of the language of

Section 14(3) of the NGT Act.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.   With the consent of the learned counsel appearing for the

parties, this point of limitation in issue was treated as preliminary

issue and thus, we proceed to deal with only the question of

limitation at the first instance.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.   The applicant claims to be the owner in possession of the

fertile agricultural land comprised in Hadbast No. 386, Khewat

No.1, Khasra Nos. 300, 301, 302, 303, 307 and 308 in Village

Narkatari, Tehsil Thanesar, District Kurukshetra, Haryana.          The

respondents are proposing to set up an STP in Khasra Nos. 200 to

222 across the 40 feet road from the applicant's land. The applicant

has filed a map showing the location of the STP. According to that

plan, the STP is located at a distance of only 35 mts. from the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    2</span>
 residential colony across the road where the applicant's land is

located. Just adjacent to the land of the applicant, there is an old

Hanuman Mandir of immense religious and cultural significance for

the entire locality. The STP, besides causing serious environmental

issues, is also hurting the religious sentiments of the people and is

contrary to the rules governing the subject. The Gram Panchayat

for Village Narkatari had passed a resolution on 20th May, 2013

stating that the current location of the STP is not in general public

interest and the STP should be located at some distance from the

village abadi.   The Trust, Bhishma Pitamah Ban Ganga Mandir

Society, had also passed a resolution stating that the construction

of the STP so close to the 26 foot image of Shri Hanuman ji would

damage the historical significance of the temple besides hurting the

religious sentiments of the villagers as well as the followers who visit

the temple.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.   It is the specific case of the applicant that the action of the

respondent in establishing the STP at the site in question is in

direct contravention of the Environmental Clearance Notification,

2006 (for short the 'Notification of 2006') which stipulates the

requirements for such projects to obtain prior EC even before the

commencement of the work. In terms of this Notification, all the

four stages of Screening, Scoping, Public Hearing and Appraisal

have to be completed before the EC could be granted to such a

project. The STP of the kind that is proposed to be established at

the site in question falls in Category 'B' of projects in the schedule

to the Notification. It is specifically covered under clauses 7(h) and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   3</span>
</p><p id="p_6"> (i) of the Schedule. The EC is to be considered and granted by the

State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), and

since no prior EC has been obtained as envisaged under the

Notification, no construction could be permitted to be commenced

for the proposed STP.         Even the action of the respondent in

completing    the   acquisition     process,   without    assessing   the

environmental impact of the proposed STP is in contravention of the

law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/992326/" id="a_4">Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board v.            C. Kenchappa</a>

(2006) 6 SCC 371 where the Court stated that, "in future before

acquisition of lands for development, the consequences and adverse

impact   of   development      on   environment    must     be   properly

comprehended and the lands be acquired for development that they

do not gravely impair the ecology and environment."          The STP is

located so near to the residential colonies, religious place and the

agricultural lands that it would have an adverse effect on the

surrounding environment like generation of odour, breeding of

mosquitoes, which would result in various bacterial diseases,

fungus, parasites, increase in noise levels and visual problems. On

the above factual matrix of the case, the applicant has filed a

petition under <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_5">Sections 14</a>, <a href="/doc/1235658/" id="a_6">15(b)</a> and (c) read with <a href="/doc/868941/" id="a_7">Sections 18(1)</a>

and (2) of the NGT Act praying that the respondent be restrained

from carrying on construction activity of the proposed STP at the

site in question and also to direct it to re-locate the proposed project

to an alternative location.
</p>
<p id="p_7">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     4</span>
</p><p id="p_8"> 5.   According to the applicant, he came to know of the setting up

of the STP at the site in question from the newspaper dated 19th

May, 2013 and he has filed the present application without any

delay on 24th May, 2013. Not only this, even the Gram Panchayat

had passed the resolution opposing establishment of STP at the site

in question on 20th May, 2013 which was then widely circulated. In

these circumstances, the knowledge attributable to the applicant,

which would provide a 'cause of action' to the applicant to institute

the present application would relate to 19th/20th May, 2013. Thus,

the 'cause of action' relating to the environmental issues for

institution of the present application arose when it was disclosed

with certainty by the authorities concerned that STP shall be located

at the site in question.    Earlier proceedings relating to subject

matters other than environment cannot be a 'cause of action' for

invocation of the provisions of Section 14 of the NGT Act.        The

respondent filed its reply and took the stand that the STP at the site

in question is based upon the latest technology that is Moving Bed

Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) which works on aerobic process. The site is

on natural flow/slope gradient and far away from the village abadi.

The land had been acquired for this very purpose and no other

suitable site was available. According to the respondent, there is

neither a possibility of any kind of nuisance caused to the public or

inhabitants residing nearby, nor is there any possibility of

environmental pollution.    Presently, the sewage water is flowing

through an open drain.     Once the plant is established the entire

sewage water will flow through a rising main (pipe) from existing


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  5</span>
 disposal to the proposed Sewage Treatment through underground

pipeline of 1000 mm i/d diameter from a distance of 2.1. kms., i.e.

from the town itself. The Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) will

reduce to 10 mg/l against the present level of 200 mg/l.              After

treatment, the effluent will be discharged in existing siphon under

the SYL channel through RCC carrier pipes of 1000 mm i/d

diameter of length 2.5 kms, i.e. at a distance of two and a half

kilometer from the site of the STP. It is specifically averred that the

Notification    of   2006   does   not   cover   a   project   relating   to

establishment of STP as none of the entries in the Schedule to this

Notification specifically state or mention the establishment of STPs.

Thus, the entire petition is stated to be ill-founded and untenable.

With regard to the objection relating to limitation, it is stated that

the notifications under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_8">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_9">6</a> of the Land Acquisition Act

were published in different newspapers including the Times of India

and Punjab Kesari on 14th January, 2010 and 15th January, 2010

respectively.    Both these papers have circulation in the State of

Haryana. Despite having gained knowledge that the land had been

acquired for establishment of STP in the year 2010 the applicant did

not take any action till 2013 and therefore, the petition is barred by

time and laches. The Collector had also passed his award which

was also known to all the persons.           It is also stated that the

notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_10">Section 4</a> was challenged in the case of <a href="/doc/54406270/" id="a_11">Amar Pal

and Ors. v. State of Haryana</a> before the High Court of Punjab and

Haryana at Chandigarh, which came to be disposed of by an agreed

order in regard to substitution of Khasra numbers stated in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     6</span>
 notification. The applicant had the complete knowledge about the

intention of the State to set up an STP project at the site in question

in the year 2010.        Hence, the application now filed, in the year

2013, is hopelessly barred by time. In any case, the Tribunal has

no jurisdiction to condone the delay beyond six months' plus 60

days from the date the cause of action had arisen. The respondent

has also averred that the project is likely to cause a loss of nearly 27

crores of rupees to the government out of which 1/3rd expenditure

has already been incurred. The project is for public welfare and will

help in the protection of environment, thus, they pray for dismissal

of the application.
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.     In light of the above contentions and pleadings of the parties,

we are called upon to consider and answer the following two

questions:
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     1. Whether the application filed by the applicant is barred by

       time and whether the Tribunal has any jurisdiction to condone

       the said delay?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     2. Whether it is mandatory for a project proponent to obtain

       environmental clearance prior to the establishment of STP?
</blockquote>

<p id="p_11">7.     At the very threshold, it will be useful to refer to the relevant

provision of the NGT Act that prescribes limitation for institution of

an application. Section 14 of the NGT Act reads as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             "14. Tribunal to settle disputes -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">             (1)The Tribunal shall have the jurisdiction over all
             civil cases where a substantial question relating to
             environment (including enforcement of any legal
             right relating to environment), is involved and such

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                     7</span>
           question arises out of the implementation of the
          enactments specified in Schedule I.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          (2)The Tribunal shall hear the disputes arising from
          the questions referred to in sub-section (1) and
          settle such disputes and pass order thereon.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">          (3)No application for adjudication of dispute under
          this section shall be entertained by the Tribunal
          unless it is made within a period of six months
          from the date on which the cause of action for such
          dispute first arose:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">          Provided that the Tribunal may, if it is satisfied that
          the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause
          from filing the application within the said period,
          allow it to be filed within a further period not
          exceeding sixty days."
</blockquote><p id="p_12">8.      From a bare reading of the above provision, it is clear that

the Tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases where substantial

question relating to environment is involved and such question

arises out of implementation of the enactments specified in

Schedule I to the NGT Act. Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_12">Section 14</a> deals with

the period of limitation. It opens with a negative expression and

requires that the application for adjudication of disputes under

<a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_13">Section 14</a> has to be filed before the Tribunal within a period of six

months from the date on which the cause of action for such dispute

first arose. However, this sub-section contains a proviso which

empowers the Tribunal to entertain an application beyond the

period of six months but not exceeding a further period of sixty

days, provided the applicant is able to show that he was prevented

by sufficient cause for filing the application within the prescribed

period of six months.
</p>
<p id="p_13">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  8</span>
</p><p id="p_14"> 9.        The unassailable position of law that emerges from the

reading of <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_14">Section 14(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_15">14(3)</a> and the proviso to Section 14(3) of

the NGT Act is that the Tribunal will have no jurisdiction to condone

the delay beyond sixty days after the expiry of six months from the

date on which the cause of action for such dispute first arose. The

legislature, in its wisdom, has worded Section 14(3) of the NGT Act

in a negative manner and has placed a limitation upon the power of

the Tribunal to condone the delay. This is the provision governing

the limitation, and therefore, must be construed upon its plain

reading. Firstly, the Tribunal, in the absence of the proviso to

<a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_16">Section    14(3)</a>,   would   have   no   jurisdiction   to   entertain   the

application raising an environmental issue beyond the prescribed

period of six months. It is only with the aid of proviso to Section

14(3) of the NGT Act that the Tribunal can exercise the power to

condone the delay beyond the prescribed period of six months but

with a further restriction that the application ought to have been

filed within sixty days of expiry of the period of six months, as

prescribed under Section 14(3) of the NGT Act.

<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">10.       This Tribunal, in one of its recent judgments in the case of

<a href="/doc/97059486/" id="a_17">Nikunj Developers &amp; Others v. the State of Maharashtra &amp; Others</a>

[2013 ALL(I) NGT(1) PB 40] has taken a view that the statutorily

prescribed limitation has to be strictly adhered to and cannot be

relaxed merely on equitable grounds. Further, applying the rule of

literal construction, the Tribunal also stated that it cannot be vested

with the power to condone the delay beyond the period of 90 days,

as prescribed under Section 16 of the NGT Act, which is worded

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                    9</span>
 identically to the proviso to Section 14(3) of the NGT Act. Referring

to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/555540/" id="a_18">Chhattisgarh

State Electricity Board v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission</a>

(2010) 5 SCC 23, the Tribunal stated that keeping in view the

language of Section 16 of the NGT Act and such similar provision

like <a href="/doc/193679715/" id="a_19">Section 35</a> of the Central Excise Act, 1944, which are para

materia, the authorities cannot entertain the appeal by condoning

the delay beyond the specified period, even if there was complete

exclusion of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_20">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act. Normally, the

grammatical construction of the limitation provision is the only safe

guide. The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/80655/" id="a_21">R. Rudraiah &amp; Anr.

v.    State of Karnataka &amp; Ors</a>. [1998 (3) SCC 23] held that it is the

duty of all courts of justice to take care of general good of the

community. Hard cases do not make bad law. Limitation may work

to cause injustice in particular cases but hardship is not a reason to

depart from the normal rule to relieve the hardship.       Thus, on a

plain reading of the above provision, it is clear that the contention of

the respondent that beyond the period of six months plus sixty

days, the Tribunal will have no jurisdiction to condone the delay,

cannot be faulted.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">11.       However, the incidental but most significant question that

has to be answered by the Tribunal is, as to whether the application

filed by the applicant was filed beyond the above stated period (six

months plus sixty days) or not.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">12.       Before we refer to the factual aspects of the present case

relating to limitation, it will be imperative for us to examine various

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                   10</span>
 legal niceties of Section 14 of the NGT Act. Section 14 of the NGT

Act vests a very wide range of powers in the Tribunal to entertain

applications including enforcement of legal rights relating to

environment, where they arise out of implementation of the

enactments specified in Schedule I to the NGT Act. Sub-section (3)

of <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_22">Section 14</a> can be dissected as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">      (a) No application for adjudication of disputes under this

Section shall be entertained by the Tribunal unless it is made within

a period of six months from the date on which the cause of action

for such dispute first arose.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      (b) The Tribunal may, if it is satisfied that the applicant was

prevented by a sufficient cause from filing the application within the

said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not exceeding

sixty days.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">13.        The NGT Act has been enacted with the object of providing

for establishment of this Tribunal for the effective and expeditious

disposal     of   cases   relating   to    environmental   protection   and

conservation of forests and other natural resources including

enforcement of any legal right relating to environment and for giving

other contemplated reliefs and even dealing with matters incidental

thereto. The Tribunal thus, has original jurisdiction in terms of

Section 14 of the NGT Act. This wide jurisdiction is expected to be

exercised by the Tribunal in relation to substantial questions

relating to environment or enforcement of legal rights relating to

environment, when it arises from the implementation of one or more

of the Acts specified in Schedule I to the NGT Act. The pre-requisite
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                      11</span>
 for the applicant to invoke original jurisdiction of the Tribunal,

subject to other limitations stated in Section 14 of the NGT Act, is

that the application must raise substantial question relating to

environment. This Tribunal, in the case of <a href="/doc/161378671/" id="a_23">Goa Foundation &amp; Anr. v.

Union of India &amp; Ors</a>., pronounced on 18th July, 2013, on the scope

of the expressions 'substantial question relating to environment' as

well as 'dispute', as referred to in Section 14 of the NGT Act, held as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">           "24. Section 2(m) of the NGT Act classifies
           'substantial question relating to environment'
           under different heads and states it to include the
           cases where there is a direct violation of a specific
           statutory environmental obligation as a result of
           which the community at large, other than an
           individual or group of individuals, is affected or is
           likely to be affected by the environmental
           consequences; or the gravity of damage to the
           environment or property is substantial; or the
           damage to public health is broadly measurable. The
           other kind of cases are where the environmental
           consequences relate to a specific activity or a point
           source of pollution. In other words, where there is a
           direct violation of a statutory duty or obligation
           which is likely to affect the community, it will be a
           substantial question relating to environment
           covered under <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_24">Section 14(1)</a> providing jurisdiction
           to the Tribunal. When we talk about the
           jurisdiction being inclusive, that would mean that a
           question which is substantial, debatable and
           relates to environment, would itself be a class of
           cases that would squarely fall under Section 14(1)
           of the NGT Act. Thus, disputes must relate to
           implementation of the enactments specified in
           Schedule I to the NGT Act. At this stage, reference
           to one of the scheduled Acts i.e. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_25">Environment
           Protection Act</a>, 1986 may be appropriate. The object
           and reason for enacting that law was primarily to
           address the concern over the state of environment
           that had grown the world over. The decline in
           environmental quality has been evidenced by
           increasing pollution, loss of vegetal cover and
           biological diversity, excessive concentrations of
           harmful chemicals in the ambient atmosphere and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                  12</span>
 in food chains, growing risks of environmental
accidents and threats to life support systems.
</blockquote><p id="p_27">These were the considerations that weighed with
the legislature to ensure implementation of the UN
Conference on the Human Environment held at
Stockholm in June, 1972 to take appropriate steps
for protection and improvement of human
environment. The essence of the legislation, like the
NGT Act, is to attain the object of prevention and
protection of environmental pollution and to
provide administration of environmental justice and
make it easily accessible within the framework of
the statute. The objects and reasons of the
scheduled Acts would have to be read as an integral
part of the object, reason and purposes of enacting
the NGT Act. It is imperative for the Tribunal to
provide an interpretation to <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_26">Sections 14</a> to <a href="/doc/562722/" id="a_27">16</a> read
with Section 2(m) of the NGT Act which would
further the cause of the Act and not give an
interpretation which would disentitle an aggrieved
person from raising a substantial question of
environment from the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

***

</p><p id="p_28">35. The expression 'disputes' arising from the
questions referred to in sub-section (1) of Section
14 of the NGT Act, is required to be examined by us
to finally deal with and answer the contentions
raised by the parties before us. The expression
used in sub-section (1) supra is the expression of
wide magnitude. The expression 'question' used in
sub-section (1) in comparison to the expression
'dispute' used in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_28">section 14</a> is of
much wider ambit and connotation. The disputes
must arise from a question that is substantial and
relates to environment. This question will obviously
include the disputes referred to in <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_29">Section 14(2)</a>. It
is those disputes which would then be settled and
decided by the Tribunal. These expressions are
inter-connected and dependent upon each other.
They cannot be given meaning in isolation or de
hors to each other. The meaning of the word
'dispute', as stated by the Supreme Court in
<a href="/doc/594047/" id="a_30">Canara Bank v. National Thermal Power Corporation</a>
(2001)1 SCC 43 is "a controversy having both
positive and negative aspects. It postulates the
assertion of a claim by one party and its denial by
the other". The term dispute, again, is a generic
term. It necessarily need not always be a result of a
legal injury but could cover the entire range
between genuine differences of opinion to fierce
controversy. Conflicts between parties arising out of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                       13</span>
 any transaction entered between them is covered by
the term 'dispute'.
</p><p id="p_29">36. The counsel appearing for the respondents,
while referring to this expression, relied upon the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/20683/" id="a_31">Inder
Singh Rekhi v. DDA</a> , (1988) 2 SCC 338 to support
the contention that the dispute, as referred under
the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_32">Arbitration Act</a>, 1940 arises where there is a
claim and there is a denial and repudiation of such
claim.
</p>
<p id="p_30">37. The judgment relied upon by the respondents
is not of much help to them inasmuch as the
<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_33">Arbitration Act</a>, 1940 operates in a different field
and the meaning to the expression dispute
appearing in that Act has to be understood with
reference to the provisions of that Act specifically.
The said Act is only intended to resolve the disputes
between two individuals arising out of a transaction
under the Arbitration law. However, the present
case, the NGT which relates to environment as
such. It is not individual or a person centric but is
socio-centric, as any person can raise a question
relating to environment, which will have to be
decided by the Tribunal with reference to the
dispute arising from such a question. It is not
necessary that such a question must essentially be
controverted by other person or even the authority.
The essence of environmental law is not essentially
adversarial litigation. To give an example, could any
authority or person deny the question relating to
cleanliness of river Yamuna? Any person could
approach the Tribunal to claim that the pollution of
Yamuna should be controlled, checked and even
prevented. None of the parties or authorities may be
able to dispute such a fact may even contend that
steps are required to be taken to control, prevent
and ensure restoration of clean water of Yamuna.
Thus, dispute as understood to be raising a claim
and being controverted by the other party is not
apparently the sine qua non to invocation of
Tribunal's jurisdiction under the scheme of
Sections 14 to 16 of the NGT Act. This approach is
further substantiated from the use of the
expressions 'cases relating to environmental
protection and conservation of forests and other
natural resources including enforcement of any
legal right relating to environment and giving relief
and compensation for damages to persons and
property and for matters connected therewith or
incidental thereto' used in the preamble of the Act"

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                       14</span>
</p><p id="p_31"> 14. In the present case, the applicant has invoked the jurisdiction

of the Tribunal under Section 14 of the NGT Act with regard to

establishment of STP on a location which, according to the

applicant, is bound to create environmental problems and would

adversely affect the public health. It will result in pollution of

underground water besides causing emission of obnoxious gases

and creating public nuisance, owing to being adjacent to residential

colony and religious places. Thus, it would certainly involve a

question relating to environment arising from the implementation of

Acts specified in Schedule I to the NGT Act. Thus, the present case

indisputably falls within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, of course,

subject to the plea of limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">15. To further examine the question of limitation, we must

deliberate upon what does the expression 'cause of action' mean.

Furthermore, such cause of action has to relate to 'such dispute', as

stated in Section 14 of the NGT Act. The period of six months shall

be computed from the date on which the cause of action first arose

in relation to such dispute. Both the expressions - 'cause of action'

and 'such dispute' - have to be read together. One of the settled

rules of construction is noscitur a sociis i.e. the meaning of a word

or an expression is to be judged by the company it keeps.

Deliberating upon the application of this rule of interpretation,

Justice   G.P.   Singh,   in   his        book   "Principles   of   Statutory

Interpretation", 13th ed. 2012, while referring to a decision by Privy

Council, inter alia, has stated:
</p>
<p id="p_34">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                     15</span>
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">           "It is a legitimate rule of construction to construe
          words in an Act of Parliament with reference to
          words found in immediate connection with them. It
          is a rule wider than the rule of ejusdem generis;
          rather the latter rule is only an application of the
          former." The rule has been lucidly explained by
          GAJENDRAGADKAR, J. in the following words:
          "This rule, according to MAXWELL, means that
          when two or more words which are susceptible of
          analogous meaning are coupled together, they are
          understood to be used in their cognate sense. They
          take as it were their colour from each other, that is,
          the more general is restricted to a sense analogous
          to a less general. The same rule is thus interpreted
          in Words and Phrases. Associated words take their
          meaning from one another under the doctrine of
          noscitur a sociis, the philosophy of which is that the
          meaning of the doubtful word may be ascertained
          by reference to the meaning of words associated
          with it; such doctrine is broader than the maxim
          ejusdem generis."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_35">16. 'Cause of action', therefore, must be read in conjunction with

and should take colour from the expression 'such dispute'. Such

dispute will in turn draw its meaning from <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_34">Section 14(2)</a> and

consequently Section 14(1) of the NGT Act. These are inter-

connected and inter-dependent. 'Such dispute' has to be considered

as a dispute which is relating to environment. The NGT Act is a

specific Act with a specific purpose and object, and therefore, the

cause of action which is specific to other laws or other objects and

does not directly relate to environmental issues would not be 'such

dispute' as contemplated under the provisions of the NGT Act. The

dispute must essentially be an environmental dispute and must

relate to either of the Acts stated in Schedule I to the NGT Act and

the 'cause of action' referred to under Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_35">Section 14</a>

should be the cause of action for 'such dispute' and not alien or

foreign to the substantial question of environment. The cause of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                 16</span>
 action must have a nexus to such dispute which relates to the issue

of environment/substantial question relating to environment, or any

such proceeding, to trigger the prescribed period of limitation. A

cause of action, which in its true spirit and substance, does not

relate to the issue of environment/substantial question relating to

environment arising out of the specified legislations, thus, in law

cannot trigger the prescribed period of limitation under Section

14(3) of the NGT Act. The term 'cause of action' has to be

understood in distinction to the nature or form of the suit. A cause

of action means every fact which is necessary to establish to

support the right to obtain a judgment. It is a bundle of facts which

are to be pleaded and proved for the purpose of obtaining the relief

claimed in the suit. It is what a plaintiff must plead and then prove

for obtaining the relief. It is the factual situation, the existence of

which entitles one person to obtain from the court remedy against

another. A cause of action means every fact which, if traversed,

would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to support his

right to a judgment of the court. In other words, it is a bundle of

facts which, taken with the law applicable to them, gives the

plaintiff a right to relief against the defendant. It does not comprise

evidence necessary to prove such facts but every fact necessary for

the plaintiff to prove to enable him to obtain a decree. The

expression 'cause of action' has acquired a judicially settled

meaning.    In the restricted sense, cause of action means the

circumstances forming the infraction of the right or the immediate

occasion for the action. In wider sense, it means the necessary


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                  17</span>
 conditions for the maintenance of the suit including not only the

infraction coupled with the right itself. To put it more clearly, the

material facts which are imperative for the suitor to allege and prove

constitute the cause of action. (Refer: Rajasthan High Court

</p><p id="p_36">17.     Upon analysis of the above judgments of the Supreme

Court, it is clear that the factual situation that existed, the facts

which are imperative for the applicant to state and prove that give

him a right to obtain an order of the Tribunal, are the bundle of

facts which will constitute 'cause of action'. This obviously means

that those material facts and situations must have relevancy to the

essentials or pre-requisites provided under the Act to claim the

relief. Under the NGT Act, in order to establish the cause of action,

pre-requisites are that the question must relate to environment or it

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                  18</span>
 should be a substantial question relating to environment or

enforcement of any legal right relating to environment. If this is not

satisfied, then the provisions of Section 14 of the NGT Act cannot be

called in aid by the applicant to claim relief from the Tribunal. Such

question must fall within the ambit of jurisdiction of the Tribunal

i.e. it must arise from one of the legislations in Schedule I to the

NGT Act or any other relevant provision of the NGT Act.               For

instance, the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction to determine any

question relating to acquisition of land or compensation payable in

that   regard.   However,   it   would   have   jurisdiction   to   award

compensation for environmental degradation and for restoration of

the property damaged. Thus, the cause of action has to have

relevancy to the dispute sought to be raised, right to raise such

dispute and the jurisdiction of the forum before which such dispute

is sought to be raised.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">18.      Having dealt with the legal aspect relating to limitation, we

must now deal with the facts of the present case. It is an

undisputed position before us that the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_45">Section 4</a>

of the Land Acquisition Act for acquisition of the land to set up an

STP had been issued by the competent authority on 10th January,

2010 and was published in the newspapers on 14th/15th January,

2010. Thereafter, the news item was published on 19th May, 2013

and 20th May, 2013 declaring that the path for installation of STP

outside the city had been finally cleared and the plant shall be set

up soon and would become a reality. On 20th May, 2013, the Gram

Panchayat, Narkatari, passed a resolution stating that it had come

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                   19</span>
 to know that the land stated in the notification, measuring about 18

acres, had been acquired and the STP was being set up there, and

for the reasons stated therein, was opposing the same. The

resolution also noticed that the Government was bent upon

installing the plant, which was not in public interest. The Municipal

Councillor, Thanesar, upon a meeting with the residents of Ward

No.27, Shanti     Nagar, Kurukshetra, had         also raised    serious

objections with regard to the construction of the STP at the site in

question. He, inter alia, referred to the adverse impact on the life of

Dalit Colony near the plant. Also, there was the Bhism Kund Baan

Ganga religious spot in close proximity of the plant, where pilgrims

come from various parts of the country. Further, a petition was filed

before the High Court challenging the acquisition of the land in

question which came to be known as Civil Writ Petition No. 18732 of

2011 and was disposed of by the High Court by a consented order

dated 21st December, 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">19.     It is evident from the above facts that the establishment of

the STP at the site in question or the substituted Khasra numbers

came to public light and became a contentious issue between the

Government     and   the   public    at   large   raising   health   and

environmental issues in the year 2013. It is noteworthy that all the

representations, objections, etc. were made to the declaration

notified in the newspapers on 19th May, 2013 that the STP was

going to be set up at the site in question.
</p>
<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">20.     According to the applicant, the limitation will trigger from

19/20th May, 2013, when the matter in relation to finally setting up
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                    20</span>
 the STP at the site in question was published in the newspapers.

The applicant filed the application on 24th May, 2013 i.e. within a

few days of his acquiring the knowledge when the cause of action

arose in his favour. Furthermore, the establishment of the STP at

the site in question received wide publicity on 19/20th May, 2013

whereafter many individuals, public organisations and, in fact, the

public at large, raised objection to the construction of the STP, thus,

giving rise to various environmental issues during that period.

Therefore, the application filed by the applicant is within the

prescribed period of limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">21.     On the contrary, according to the respondent, the cause of

action arose when the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_46">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_47">6</a> of the

Land Acquisition Act was issued on or about 7/10th January, 2010.

This notification was published in the newspapers. Therefore, the

applicant would be deemed to have knowledge of establishment of

the STP in January, 2010 whereas the petition was filed in the year

2013. The application is, therefore, barred by time as the delay is

more than 60 days over the prescribed period of six months from

the date of cause of action and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to

condone the delay.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">22.     The entire controversy revolves as to the effect of the

issuance of the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_48">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_49">6</a> of the Land

Acquisition Act and whether it will constitute cause of action under

the NGT Act. We have no hesitation in answering this question in

the negative. The reasons for the same are that the notification

issued under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_50">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_51">6</a> of the Land Acquisition Act per se
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                   21</span>
 does not raise a substantial question relating to environment. This

notification is for a different and distinct purpose. The provisions of

the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_52">Land Acquisition Act</a> operate in an entirely different realm/field

and have distinct consequences. The questions arising in relation to

the validity of acquisition or payment of compensation do not

constitute 'dispute' within the meaning of and for the purpose of

Section 14 of the NGT Act. The Tribunal, in any case, would have no

jurisdiction to venture upon the adjudication of such an issue.

Furthermore, the Government was competent to change the 'public

purpose' stated in the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_53">Section 4</a> and even could

de-notify the area or give up the entire project upon hearing

objections under <a href="/doc/66420479/" id="a_54">Section 5</a> of the Land Acquisition Act. Change of

purpose and de-notification by the State Government in accordance

with law is permissible. If the Government would have de-notified

the land from acquisition or if the High Court had quashed the

notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_55">Section 4</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, then the

entire project of STP would have come to an end and the

proceedings, if any, initiated by the applicant under the NGT Act

would have been an exercise in futility.
</p>
<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">23.     Another important aspect is that the location, the Khasra

number, etc. sought to be acquired under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_56">Section 4</a> of the Land

Acquisition Act could be changed by the competent authority while

issuing the notification under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_57">Section 6</a> of the Land Acquisition Act.

The High Court, vide its order dated 21st December, 2012 permitted

the change of Khasra number by agreement. In other words, the

very location of the STP, from the initial site, stood changed to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                  22</span>
 khasra number recorded in the order of the High Court. These were

very material changes but fell within the field of acquisition

proceedings. They do not have any impact on environmental issues

in regard to establishment of the STP.
</p>
<p id="p_49">
</p><p id="p_50">24.     In these circumstances, it cannot be stated that the cause

of action contemplated under Section 14 of the NGT Act could be

related to and deemed to have triggered the period of limitation for

the purpose of Section 14 of the NGT Act. The cumulative effect of

the above discussion would be that, the limitation has to be

computed from the date when there was a firm decision by the

Government or other authorities concerned to establish the STP at

the site in question and it was so publicly declared and the date for

the same being 19/20th May, 2013 and the applicant having filed

the petition within a few days (within the prescribed period of

limitation of six months), the question of the application being time

barred does not arise. Another contention was also raised before us

that it being a continuing cause of action, the objection raised by

the respondent would be of no consequence. We do not consider it

necessary to deal with this contention in any elaboration in view of

the finding returned by us above that the petition is not at all

barred by time.

<p id="p_51">
</p><p id="p_52">25. In the recent past, there had been global environmental

concerns.   Environmental and ecological issues drew the attention

of various authorities and bodies all over the world as adverse

impact on environment of one country could prejudicially affect the

citizenry and environment of the other country. These concerns at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                 23</span>
 different quarters led to the United Nations Conference on Human

Environment at Stockholm in June 1972. India participated in this

Conference and then decided to take steps for protection and

improvement of environment in India resulting in, amongst others,

the enactment of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_58">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 (for short

'Act of 1986').       <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_59">This Act</a> of 1986 defines in <a href="/doc/186305121/" id="a_60">Section 2(a)</a>

"Environment" as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">             "environment" includes water, air and land and the
             inter-relationship which exists among and between
             water, air and land, and human beings, other living
             creatures, plants, micro-organism and property."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_53">26. It may be noticed at this stage itself that the NGT Act also

defines 'environment' in identical terms to the definition of

'environment' in the Act of 1986.            The term 'environmental

pollutant' has also been defined under the Act of 1986 to mean any

solid, liquid or gaseous substance present in such concentration as

may be or tend to be injurious to the environment. 'Handling' in

relation to any substance means the manufacture, processing,

treatment,     package,   storage,    transportation,    use,      collection,

destruction, conversion, offering for sale, transfer or the like of such

substances.      'Hazardous substance' means any substance or

preparation which, by reason of its chemical or physico-chemical

properties or handling is liable to cause harm to human being, other

living   creatures,   plants,   micro-organisms,        property     or   the

environment. These definitions under the Act of 1986 give us an

idea of the legislative intent in relation to the protection and

improvement of environment contemplated under the scheme of the

Act of 1986. The expression 'environment' has been defined in very

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                     24</span>
 wide terms and its definition being inclusive in nature, would not be

exhaustive and would cover everything that a human being can

think of in relation to water, air and land, living creatures, plants

etc.   The 'environmental pollutants' again have been defined in

terms of very wide magnitude so as to include all kinds of pollutants

which will or are even likely to adversely affect the environment or

injure the same.
</p>
<p id="p_54">27. The word 'environment' is an expression of broad spectrum

which inculcates in its sweep both hygienic atmosphere and

ecological   balance.     The     right   to   life   with   human   dignity

encompasses within its ambit the preservation of environment,

ecological balance free from air and water pollution. It also includes

maintaining proper sanitation without which it may not be possible

to enjoy     life. The   conduct or actions, which would              cause

environmental pollution and disturb the ecological balance should

be regarded as violation of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_61">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.

Therefore, promoting environmental protection implies maintenance

of environment as a whole comprising the man-made and the

natural environment. It is, therefore, not only the duty of the State

but also the duty of every citizen to maintain hygienic environment.

Thus, there is a constitutional imperative on the State Governments

and the municipalities to take adequate measures to promote,

protect   and   improve    both    the    man-made       and   the   natural

environment (Refer: <a href="/doc/27930439/" id="a_62">Virender Gaur vs. State of Haryana</a> (1995) 2

SCC 577).

</p><p id="p_56"> 28. The judicial precedents by various Courts, including the

Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, have expanded <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_63">Article 21</a> of the

Constitution of India to include the right to clean and decent

environment. Right to live with human dignity, hence includes, the

right to clean environment, as no human being can properly enjoy

his life and living unless the environment surrounding him is

hygienic, clean and decent. This is the concept of environment as

understood under the Indian Environmental and Constitutional

jurisprudence.    When one makes a conjoint reading of the Act of

1986 and other environment legislations along with the provisions

of the NGT Act, only one conclusion is possible and that is, that the

Legislature intended to give environment the widest meaning on the

one hand and protection to the same of highest order on the other.

It has equated the right to clean environment to the fundamental

rights enshrined in Chapter III of our Constitution and has also

provided for effective and expeditious disposal of the environmental

issues. Once the environment is understood in its wide spectrum

and correct perspective, then all the matters which cause or are

likely to cause environmental pollution or injury would be the

matters covered under the provisions of the above referred

legislations.   The Notification of 2006 deals with the manner and

methodology in accordance with which the EC is to be granted to

various projects and activities.       Under Regulation 2 of the

Notification of 2006, it is prescribed that the projects or activities

which are specified in the Schedule to the Notification of 2006,

would require EC from the competent authority.        Projects falling


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                  26</span>
        under Category 'A' in the Schedule of the Notification of 2006 would

       require EC from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF)

       while the projects falling in the Category 'B' would be required to be

       granted EC by the State Environmental Impact Assessment

       Authority (SEIAA). Such projects should take EC before any actual

       or even preparatory works are carried out by the project proponent

       except to the extent of securing land for the project.                               All new

       projects or activities listed in the Schedule would require such

       clearance. The expansion or modernization of the projects or

       activities, which crosses the threshold limits given in the Schedule,

       would also require such clearance.                         Thereafter the process of

       categorization of the project, selection of site, screening, scoping and

       appraisal has to be followed, finally culminating into grant or

       refusal of the EC by the said authorities.                       The Schedule to the

       Notification of 2006 refers to various projects and activities that

       would require such environmental clearance. In the present case,

       the applicant has placed reliance upon Clause 7(h) and (i) of the

       Schedule, which is relatable to Regulation 2 and 7 of the

       Notification of 2006.              The said entries of the Schedule read as

       under: -

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                          27</span>

</p><p id="p_58">       29. In terms of the above entries of the Schedule, all projects

       relating    to   common   effluent   treatment   plants   and      common

       municipal solid waste management facility fall in category 'B' of the

       Schedule and would, therefore, require EC from SEIAA.


</p><p id="p_59">       30. The contention of the applicant is that both these entries have

       to be construed liberally so as to achieve the object of the Act, thus,

       covering even the STPs under these entries. On the contrary, the

       contention on behalf of the respondent is that, since the STPs have

       not been specifically included in the Schedule to the Notification of

       2006 when other projects or activities have been, it must follow that

       STP has been excluded from the operation of the Schedule and

       thus, no EC needs to be obtained by the project proponent from

       SEIAA.      Thus, firstly we have to consider whether these entries

       should be construed strictly or liberally and if so to what effect.


</p><p id="p_60">       31. The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/185550/" id="a_64">Commissioner of Income Tax

       vs. Teja Singh</a> AIR 1959 SC 352 held that a statute or any enacting

       provision therein, must be so construed as to make it effective and

       operative on the principle expressed in the maxim ut res magis

       valeat quam pereat.
</p>
<p id="p_61"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                            28</span>
</p><p id="p_62"> 32. While dealing with a social welfare legislation, the provisions

and the words therein are to be given a liberal and expanded

meaning.   Of course, liberal construction does not mean that the

words shall be forced out of their natural meaning but they should

receive a fair and reasonable interpretation so as to attain the object

for which the instrument is designed and the purpose for which it is

applied. Both the object and purpose in relation to its application

are thus, relevant considerations for interpretation.     The Courts

have also permitted departure from the rule of literal construction

so as to avoid the statute becoming meaningless or futile. In the

case of <a href="/doc/27215/" id="a_65">Surjit Singh v. Union of India</a> (1991) 2 SCC 87 and Sarajul

Sunni Board v. Union of India AIR 1959 SC 198, the Supreme Court

has also held that it is not allowable to read words in a statute

which are not there, but where the alternative allows, either by

supplying words which appear to have been accidentally omitted or

by adopting a construction which deprives certain existing words of

all meaning, it is permissible to supply the words.       It is also a

settled cannon that in case of a social or beneficial legislation, the

Courts or Tribunals are to adopt a liberal or purposive construction

as opposed to the rule of literal construction.


33   In light of the above stated three principles, let us examine the

object and purpose of the above legislations and the meaning that

the entries under Clause 7(h) and (i) of the Schedule to the

Notification of 2006 should receive. The object of the legislation is

to protect, sustain and improve the environment.               So an

interpretation, which would further this object has to be adopted

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                   29</span>
 rather than a strict construction, which may result in rendering the

very object and provisions of such legislations ineffective and futile.

We are not oblivious to the restrictions to the rule of liberal

construction, but in the case of a social or beneficial legislation,

particularly relating to a subject like the environment, adoption of

the liberal rule of construction would be more appropriate.         An

interpretation which would practically frustrate the very purpose of

inclusion of the common affluent treatment plants and municipal

solid waste management plants to entries 7(h) and (i) should be

avoided and the one which would attain the object and further the

purpose of these provisions should be adopted.          It cannot be

disputed, even by any stretch of imagination, that STP is

established to treat a very serious pollutant i.e. sewage, and STP

itself is a potential pollutant in the event of any mis-happening. It

has the potential to cause environmental degradation and adversely

affect the public health. Thus, it could be said that the framers of

the law on the one hand intended to make the provisions

prescribing stringent measures, imposing heavy penalties and

ensuring adherence to the prescribed standards of environment for

its prevention and control, while on the other hand excluded from

the scope of Notification of 2006, such projects which are dealing

with serious pollutants and are in itself potentially hazardous.


</p><p id="p_63">34. The legislative intent behind enacting a particular statute is

one of the relevant considerations in regard to the interpretation of

the same. The courts do examine the legislative intent to find the

real object and purpose of an Act and the scope of application of its

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                  30</span>
 various provisions. The entries in the Schedule to the Notification of

2006 have to be construed purposively so as to achieve the object of

the principle legislation and not to interpret them so narrowly as to

frustrate the very object behind enactment of the same i.e. for

prevention and control of environmental pollution.


</p><p id="p_64">35. It is an acknowledged fact that the sewage in any town travels

through open drains where large amounts of industrial waste,

domestic discharge and trade effluents are directly or indirectly

discharged into such drains. Before these drains reach the STPs,

they undoubtedly contain sewage and other trade effluents,

including chemical effluents.    In other words, it is mixed effluent

and not a sewage waste simplicitor.
</p>
<p id="p_65">
</p><p id="p_66">36. Entry 7(i) of the Schedule to the Notification of 2006 deals with

establishment of the projects relating to any municipal solid waste

management facility.     The Notification of 2006 does not define

'municipal solid waste'.     However, the Municipal Solid Waste

(Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, under Rule 3 (xv) defines

'Municipal Solid Waste' as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_67">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     ""municipal solid waste" includes commercial and residential
     wastes generated in a municipal or notified areas in either
     solid or semi-solid form excluding industrial hazardous wastes
     but including treated bio-medical wastes;"
</blockquote><p id="p_68">37. From the plain language of the above provision, it is clear that

such waste would include commercial and residential waste

generated in a notified area. Importantly, it includes both solid and

semi-solid waste but excludes industrial hazardous waste.        This

definition opens with inclusive words, then specifically provides


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                  31</span>
 what is excluded from its ambit and scope then further includes

even the bio-medical wastes.    This definition is generic and is an

inclusive definition which simultaneously provides for exclusion of

industrial hazardous waste.    When the framers have specifically

provided for the exclusion in no uncertain terms and the definition

being inclusive and not exhaustive in nature, the other wastes, and

particularly wastes of semi-solid nature, would be deemed to be

included in this definition. It is a uniformly accepted norm of

interpretation that the word 'includes' when used in a definition

clause would reflect that the Legislature does not intend to restrict

the definition.    It makes the definition enumerative but not

exhaustive. 'Sewage' primarily arises from the residential areas and

contains amongst others, as noticed above, other domestic waste

and some trade effluents as well. This definition, therefore, would

include municipal waste of the semi-solid nature, which is not

resulting from the industrial hazardous wastes.


</p><p id="p_69">38. At this stage, we may also refer to some literature that have

been relied upon by the applicant.      United Nations Environment

Programme,    in   the   guidelines   for   the   preparation    of     an

environmental impact assessment document for STP's, in 1991 in

particular have provided that the STP's are constructed to transport

raw sewage into municipal waste and retrieve and re-use treated

sewage water. End products of STP's are sludge and treated sewage

water.   Both can contain, in addition to organic bio-medical

substances   and   micro-organisms,     non-biogradable    and        toxic

substances as well, due to contamination of sewage with industrial

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                 32</span>
 water. Most STP's and disposal processes are serious sources that

create offensive odour.
</p>
<p id="p_70">
</p><p id="p_71">39. The MoEF, Government of India, has provided a technical EIA

Guidance Manual for common municipal solid waste management

facilities.   Annexure VII to this Manual is the application form

prescribed for obtaining EIA Clearance in Form 1.          A project

proponent is required to take clearance upon filling up of such form.

Clause 4 of this Form deals with production of solid waste during

construction or operation or decommissioning, under which in

Column 4.6, the project proponent is supposed to provide details of

the sewage sludge or other sludge released from effluent treatment

and under Column 4.2, it is supposed to state with details of

municipal waste (domestic and/or commercial waste) which the unit

is likely to discharge. This shows an appropriate linkage between

municipal solid waste and the sewage to determine the proper

impact on environment.     We may also refer to the observations of

the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of <a href="/doc/339109/" id="a_66">Almritra H. Patel

and Ors. vs. Union of India</a> (2002) SCC 679 where in paragraph 13

of the judgment, the Supreme Court held "domestic garbage and

sewage is a large contributory of solid waste. The drain system in a

city is intended to cope with household effluents. This is so in a

planned city.     But when a large number of inhabitants live in

unauthorised colonies with no proper dealing with the domestic

effluents or in slums with no care for hygiene, the problem becomes

more complex." This itself shows that the highest Court of the land

treated domestic waste as containing both the elements, i.e garbage

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                 33</span>
 and sewage. The above discussion clearly demonstrates that the

'common municipal solid waste management facility' would take

within its ambit, even such plants that deal with sewage, which

essentially is a semi-solid municipal waste and is required to be

treated and managed by the municipal authorities in discharge of

their statutory duty. As already noticed, even with the mandate of

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_67">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, the municipal authorities are

under an obligation to ensure proper collection, treatment and

utilization of the end product in relation to sewage.


</p><p id="p_72">40. Now, we shall proceed to discuss the alternative contention on

behalf of the applicant that such STP's would be covered under

Clause 7(h) of the Schedule to the Notification of 2006. By framing

the Schedule to the Notification of 2006, the legislature has

attempted to specify the projects which are required to take EC from

the competent authorities before establishment and operation of any

projects specified therein.     The Schedule has a reference to

Regulations 2 and 7 of the Notification of 2006.         In terms of

paragraph (2), every project and activity specified in the Schedule

requires environmental clearance. The expression 'activity' is of a

very generic nature and in fact, is incapable of being described in

definite terms.   This expression has been used in addition to the

term 'project'.   Projects normally are referred to an industrial or

other process which are of definite character. The expression

'activity', being of a very generic nature is capable of wide

connotation.      Paragraph (4) of the 2006 Notification, while

categorizing all projects and activities into Category A and Category

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                  34</span>
 B, uses in sub-para (ii) of Para 4 the word 'included', which again,

would mean that these are not exhaustive in definite terms. Certain

leverage has to be provided while expanding or explaining the terms

used under various entries of the Schedule to Notification of 2006.

They would require liberal construction to achieve the object of the

legislations enumerated in Schedule I to the NGT Act. The same has

been held even in regard to the entries in the Constitutional lists,

the same being the fields of legislation, which have received liberal

construction, inspired by a broad and generous spirit and not a

narrow or pedantic approach (Refer : Rajiv Sarin and Ors. v. State

of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. (2011) 8 SCC 708).
</p>
<p id="p_73">
</p><p id="p_74">41. 'Common effluent treatment plant' (for short the 'CETP'), on its

plain reading would mean a treatment plant that treats the common

effluents to produce a non-pollutant end product, is non-pollutant.

The expression 'effluent' has neither been defined under the Act of

1986 nor under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_68">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 (for short the '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_69">Water Act</a>').      Even the Hazardous Wastes

(Management and Handling) Rules, 2008 do not define the term

'effluent'.   In common parlance, 'effluent' is explained as liquid

waste or sewage discharged into a river or the sea or any water

body. (Refer: Oxford English Dictionary and the Black's Law

Dictionary, Ninth Edition).   However, the same dictionary defines

'industrial effluent' as an effluent contaminated with trade effluents.


</p><p id="p_75">42. The above explanation shows that 'effluent' can be in various

forms and is discharged into different water bodies or places where



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                  35</span>
 it would affect the water and in turn the environment in one form or

the other.

Need for Environment Clearance


</p><p id="p_77">43. The Notification of 2006 is the regulatory regime in relation to

protection and betterment of environment. It provides how and in

what manner clearance is to be granted to various projects and

activities to ensure adherence to maintenance of environmental

standards. What should be the prescription for trade and industrial

effluent and what kind of standards are to be maintained, including

whether a project has satisfactorily installed STP and other anti-

pollution devices, is primarily intended to ensure that no injury is

caused to the environment. Thus, the Notification of 2006 furthers

the cause and object of the environmental legislations in our

country.
</p>
<p id="p_78">
</p><p id="p_79">44. Effluent means discharge of any liquid gaseous or other

substances into water bodies etc., and would take within its ambit

even discharge of sewage coupled with other industrial and trade

effluents. Such effluent would be required to be treated at a CETP of

which STP itself may be an integral part.      As we have already

noticed and even anticipated, the drains which carry the sewage

also contain other domestic discharge. Industrial and trade effluents

get discharged directly into the drains by the industries or other

activities which generate polluted effluents. Thus STP would have to

treat effluents which contain even other pollutants than sewage

simplicitor.

requirements of technical EIA clearance of effluent treatment plants,

have, in paragraph 4.1 of the guidance manual stated as follows:

          environmental clearance for Category B and
          Category A projects are shown in Figure 4.1 and
          Figure 4.2 respectively. Each stage in the process of

          discussed in subsequent sections. The timelines
          indicated against each stage are the maximum
          permissible timelines set in the Notification for said
          task. In case the said task is not cleared/objected to
          by the concerned Authority, within the specified

<p id="p_90">46. The bare reading of the above shows that establishment,

expansion and even modernisation of CETPs require EC, being a

category B project. Any treatment plant that deals with such

effluents having more than 10% of industrial contributions by

volume has to be treated as a combined treatment plant. On the

strength of this guide, it becomes clear that the material

consideration for determining the nature of the project or activity is

the kind of effluent that it receives for the purpose of treatment.

There is nothing on record before us to show that the STP in

question is so established as to treat exclusively sewage and nothing

else. On the contrary, the sketch filed by the respondent (Annexure

R.3) shows that the sewage is carried by an open drain and would

be so carried to the site of STP (for treatment). It is just by the side

of a metal road and travels through the abadi and the sludge is

carried through an open drain from the entire city. This is

demonstrable of the fact that it is not sewage per se that is taken by

the open drain to the site but is a mixture of various distinct

effluents. Thus, such an STP would even fall under the entry 7(h)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                   38</span>
 because this plant would be treating the effluents in the semi-solid

form and even sludge and would contain more than 10% of

industrial or other contaminated chemical effluents. Such a plant is

not only treating the effluents/sewage but also has to ensure that

the ultimate discharge from such plant is strictly within the

parameters prescribed so that the waste water is capable of being

used for irrigation or recycled for other purposes while the other

waste/sludge is to be properly disposed of.        This is where the

respondent has failed to place scientific data on record to show that

it is exclusively the sewage which is capable of being treated to bring

the ultimate discharge within the prescribed parameters of Bio-

chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and others and also to ensure its

proper re-use or recycling. We can reasonably conclude that the

open nallah does not carry only the sewage waste but other effluents

as well which are required to be treated by a CETP and the

capability of the STP requires scientific and appropriate scrutiny

from an expert body before it can be permitted to become

operational and it is a fit case where it would cover combined waste

water treatment plant i.e. CETP excepting sewage along with

industrial effluents.
</p>
<p id="p_91">
</p><p id="p_92">47. The above deliberations now bring us to another important

facet of the present case as to the necessity for such a plant to

obtain EC under the Notification of 2006. The very purpose of

setting up an STP is to attain betterment in the field of environment.

Under this project, it is expected to bring the entire sewage for

treatment to the plant and then to ensure that the end products

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                  39</span>
 from such treatment are in conformity with the prescribed

parameters and the water in relation to the sludge and the water

content both. The water should be capable of being recycled for

irrigation and other allied purposes. This object would stand

frustrated if the sewage is containing other contaminated effluents

i.e. trade effluents, industrial effluents and other domestic discharge

containing high pollutants. Then the end result would be that even

if the sewage is treated, still the ultimate product being discharged

from the plant would remain contaminated, acidic or unusable for

different purposes. On account of the experience gained and on

account of improvements in the field of science, it is now possible to

anticipate as to what ought to be a broad activity of the project. The

authorities should be able to take scientific view at the initial stages

of installation of an STP.   The expert bodies like SEIAA and EAC

would, at the stage of scoping and appraisal contemplated in terms

of the Notification of 2006, be able to take an objective and rational

view in regard to establishment and operation of the STP simplicitor

or requirement of any additional anti-pollution measures to be

taken by the project proponent in the interest of environment and

public health. It is the stage whether they should proceed with the

project or the project needs other supplementary treatment plants

to ensure adherence to prescribed standards. They can have a

comparative study of the harmful effects of the project, considering

it on the touchstone of sustainable development and human

environment and welfare. Sewage itself is a very serious pollutant. It

can result in tremendous health hazards and cause injury to the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                   40</span>
 environment including intolerable odour.      It carries pathogenic

organisms that can transmit diseases to humans and animals, hold

nutrients that may cause eutrophication of receiving water bodies

and can lead to eco toxicity. The purpose of the environmental

legislations referred to in the NGT Act is to prevent environmental

degradation on the one hand and its improvement on the other. To

perform these functions collectively and effectively, it would be

necessary for such projects to get EC at the very threshold. It would

help to further the cause of the legislations as well as the larger

public purpose. On the contrary, it may prove to be a futile exercise

if the plant is established and still it is unable to treat the mixed

waste of different components which comes from the drain to the

site of the plant. At the present stage, it may be a remedial measure

but later on it may prove to be a disaster and a complete waste of

public money.

in favour of the applicant and against the respondent. While

allowing the application, we direct the respondent to seek EC from

SEIAA at the earliest and in any case not later than one month from

today. We further direct SEIAA to process the application and

complete the entire exercise of granting clearance - conditional or

otherwise - or refusing the same within two months thereafter. In

the circumstances of the case, we would not direct removal of the

plant to the extent to which it has already been constructed at the

site as all acts done so far and that may be done hereafter would be
