4.   He applied for membership in the club, which was neither refused nor
accepted. When he sought to know what happened, the club refused even to
give any information generally. Then he approached under Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_3">Information
Act</a>, by filing a formal application seeking information: a) number of applications
received and pending for outstation membership in Willington Gymkhana Club
(WGC) with a deposit of Rs. Five Lakh as on 01.09.2012; b) number of
applications considered and approved by the Managing Committee of WGC; c)
number of rejected applications; d) whether the membership was given as per
serial number according to seniority, if not the criterion fixed for giving
membership and the criterion fixed for rejecting the application; e) genesis of
the grounds fixed for giving the membership and for rejecting the application for
membership; f) minutes of each meeting of the Managing Committee as well as
of the Sub-Committee for membership, where the decision to appoint or reject
the applications for membership was taken;          g) names of the applicants given
the membership and the names of those not given and rejected in the outstation
category and h) break-up of the applicants given the membership in the
outstation   category   and   how   many      civilians   and   people   from    defence
background. Since no information was given, the appellant approached this
Commission. The Club refused to give information claiming that it was not public
authority under <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_4">RTI Act</a>.




CIC/SH/A/2014/000684                                                                Page 3
 5.   Appellant insisted that respondent body is a public authority because the</pre>
<p id="p_1">Government gave a huge and very valuable land in Udakamandalam (Ooty) to
the Wellington Gymkhana Club by the Government. Instead of behaving like a
public authority under <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_5">RTI Act</a>, 2005, the WGC is wrongfully claiming that it was
not so, exercising power in arbitrary manner in allotting membership, not
following seniority rule or any other reasonable criterion. When he applied for
membership four years ago, he was refused the membership. The complainant
said that till date no information has been provided to him about his rejection of
his application. He said: "Minimum courtesy and fairness demands to tell me if
my application was rejected and I must be explained the reasons for rejected".
He said, when requested for the status, one office-bearer said "Sorry sir, you
know the system".
</p>
<p id="p_2">6.    Shri AnandDarbari further submitted: The Wellington Gymkhana Club is
an affiliated club of Delhi Gymkhana Club.              If the latter is providing
benefits/facilities to its members and maintaining the seniority-list-applicants-
waiting for membership, why not the WGC follow the same? He filed the
application for membership under the category of outstation-applicant, as he
would be going once in a year to his in-laws place and would like to play there.
He also complained that the club is charging an exorbitant amount Rs. 7.5 lakh
for membership.
</p>

<p id="p_3">7.    The Commission's order dated 21.09.2017:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      7.    The Wellington Gymkhana Club, whether public authority under <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_6">RTI Act</a> or
      not, has a duty as a trustee to be transparent in its administration when it is
      dealing with hue landed property including the money of the public. If what
      complainant stated is true, it's deplorable and also a shame to hear about such
      trustees. Neither party submitted any material to support their contentions.
      Hence the Commission directs appellant, the CPIO, Ministry of Youth Affairs and
      Sports and the President of the Wellington Gymkhana Club to submit material in
      support of their claims including the following:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         a. Documents pertaining to the allocation of land to the Wellington
            Gymkhana Club WGC;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">         b. Recognition, registration and certification granted to WGC, if any;
         c. Audit Reports of balance sheet for the last five years;
         d. List of members with the date on which membership was given
         e. List of applications for membership pending along with the date of
            application, date of consideration, the number-indicating seniority, if any,
            etc

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      8.     All parties shall exchange their documents and submit them to the
      Commission before 16.10.2017 along with acknowledgement of service of copies
      on other parties.
</blockquote>
<pre id="pre_2">CIC/SH/A/2014/000684                                                              Page 4
       9.    The case is posted on 17.10.2017 at 2:00PM.

Hearing on 17.10.2017

8.    As              per              their              websites              Delhi
(https://www.delhigymkhana.org.in/affiliated_clubs/)              and            Ooty
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_5">(https://wellingtongymkhanaclub.co.in/club-affiliations), it appears that each
club is mutually affiliated to other. The officers representing the respondent
authority stated that no application fee of Rs. 7.5 lakh was received from this
appellant. Wellington Gymkhana Club receives substantive finances from
members' as membership fee. He also claimed that the 67 acre land where the
club is located was granted by the British Government in the year 1923 for a
period of 100 years and presently Rs. 220/- is being paid per year as rent. He
claimed that because their club was given land by British Government, it cannot
be considered as public authority under Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_7">Information Act</a>. The said lease
deed expires in the year 2023 and it was signed by four parties.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_4">9.    The fact that the club is enjoying the exclusive possession of thousands of
rupees worth land of 67 acres in prime area of tourist destination city
Udakamandalam for a paltry lease of Rs 220 per year, is enough to show that
the Gymkhana Club Ooty is directly and substantially funded by Government and
hence it has to be answerable and accountable for its activities. It is a public
body and also public authority under <a href="/doc/1097458/" id="a_8">section 2(h)</a> of Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_9">Information Act</a>. It
is pathetic to note that this body does not know that they cannot claim any
privilege because British Government transferred land and to plead that they are
not amenable to the laws passed by post Independence Government of India.
Does it mean that Gymkhana Club,Ooty, will be a-sovereign-independent-67-
Acre nation separate from India and loyal only to British Government?           They
should not think that they are under tutelage of British Rule even now. As per
<a href="/doc/1254651/" id="a_10">Article 294</a> of Indian Constitution, the Independent Indian Government succeeds
to all assets, rights, liabilities and obligations which were vested in British Rulers
(His Majesty). <a href="/doc/1254651/" id="a_11">Article 294</a> says:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      294. Succession to property, assets, rights, liabilities and obligationsin
      certain cases from the commencement of this Constitution-</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">      (a) all property and assets which immediately before such commencement were
      vested in His Majesty for the purposes of the Government of the Dominion of
      India and all property and assets which immediately before such commencement


CIC/SH/A/2014/000684                                                             Page 5
       were vested in His Majesty for the purposes of the Government of each Governors
      Province shall vest respectively in the Union and the corresponding State, and
</p><p id="p_6">      (b) all rights, liabilities and obligations of the Government of the Dominion of
      India and of the Government of each Governors Province, whether arising out of
      any contract or otherwise, shall be the rights, liabilities and obligations
      respectively   of   the   Government   of   India   and   the   Government   of   each
      corresponding State, subject to any adjustment made or to be made by reason of
      the creation before the commencement of this Constitution of the Dominion of
      Pakistan or of the Provinces of West Bengal, West Punjab and East Punjab.
</p>

<p id="p_7">10.   <a href="/doc/932931/" id="a_12">Article 295</a> deals with succession to property, assets, rights, liabilities and
obligations in other cases (other than cases mentioned under <a href="/doc/1254651/" id="a_13">Article 294</a>) in a
similar way vesting in Union or states as per the Constitution or according to
agreements.
</p>
<p id="p_8">11.   The contention of the representatives of Gymkhana Club appears to be
almost anti-national or club is not conscious of the basic facts that they are
paying lease amount of Rs 220 to Government (after Independence) and
Government is having complete authority to cancel or continue the lease in
2023. As per the Article referred above, the Government is now the owner of the
land leased out to Gymkhana Club. There is none to explain them that the
Government is a continuous body, with a responsibility to honor all the
agreements, if not properly rescinded. Either in 2023 or before that the
Government has power to cancel the lease, including breach of law such as Right
to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_14">Information Act</a>. In such a case, the gymkhana club will struggle to exist. This
is the test prescribed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in Thallappallem Case,
[2013(12) SCALE 527]. During the contentions, the representatives of WGC
stated that they are collecting Rs. 7.5 lakh per membership. But their website
does not indicate the charge anywhere. They have not officially disclosed any list
of members nor is there any seniority list of applicants waiting for membership.
There is an absolute lack of transparency relating to the policy, method, process
and decision making in sanctioning membership, which is the crux of this second
appeal. In the absence of disclosure of such information, the management of
Club can assume arbitrary power to sell the membership at huge cost as per
their whims and fancies. This means corruption. Any organization like Gymkhana
Club is expected to act as a trust in good faith while dealing with public in
general and managing the public money. The WGC has an ethical and legal duty

CIC/SH/A/2014/000684                                                                    Page 6
 as a trustee to exercise its authority to grant membership in utmost fair manner.
The   Right   to   <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_15">Information   Act</a>   also   insists   on   maximum   disclosure   of
administration related information voluntarily. In spite of their undertaking to
the Commission to provide necessary documents and the direction of the
Commission based on such assurance, the management of WGC has not
submitted any papers including a copy of lease deed. This established their anti-
transparency attitude and also the merit in the contentions of the appellant, who
felt harassed.
</p>

<p id="p_9">12.   Thus the Commission declares that the Wellington Gymkhana Club,Ooty is
the public authority under <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_16">RTI Act</a>, 2005 and directs WGC to designate officers
as CPIO and First Appellate Authority, declare their names, addresses and
contact numbers on website and also prominently display at notice board of the
office, create an RTI wing, provide necessary infrastructural facilities, train the
staff in <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_17">RTI Act</a> and practices to start giving information in a responsive and
responsible manner. They are also required to comply with the obligation under
<a href="/doc/13503/" id="a_18">Section 4</a> of Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_19">Information Act</a>, by publishing the information of all
categorizations as prescribed under <a href="/doc/1576851/" id="a_20">Section 4(1)(b)(c)</a> and (d) within 14 days, if
not appellant or any other person can file complaint of non-compliance of
mandate of Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_21">Information Act</a> and in such event, the CPIO, and, if the
CPIO is not designated, President or Secretary of the organization shall be liable
to face the penal proceedings under <a href="/doc/1369783/" id="a_22">Section 20</a> of RTI Act, 2005.
</p>
<p id="p_10">13.   The Commission directs the respondent authority to provide certified copy
of lease deed and all other information as directed on 21.09.2017 to the
appellant, besides giving him reasons for rejection of his application for
membership, with every other information sought by him, within 14 days from
the date of receipt of this order, along with report of compliance of this order.
