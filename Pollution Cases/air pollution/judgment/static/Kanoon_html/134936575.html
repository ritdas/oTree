            (Oral)

       1.      The writ petitioner is running a wood based Industrial Unit

               at Laloo, Shishgari Bagh, Hyderpora, Budgam from the

               year 2005. It is stated that the said unit is running in a tin

               shed. The unit is engaged in wood furniture and joinery.

               The      unit         is      having             registration   certificate   dated

               29.11.2005, issued by the District Industries Centre,

               Budgam. The petitioner is also licensed by Jammu and

               Kashmir, Forest Department for running the Secondary

               Wooden Based Industrial Unit. For running the industrial
      unit, petitioner is required to install the electric motor.

     Based on the permissions, aforesaid, petitioner has

     installed     3 hp   Motor. The petitioner's     unit is    also

     registered with the J&amp;K Shops and <a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_1">Establishment Act</a>,

     1966, annexures-B &amp; C of the writ petition.

2.   The petitioners' unit is established in 8 marlas of land

     falling under Survey No. 5,         gifted   to him by his

     grandmother. It appears that with respect to the property

     in question, a civil suit is pending between petitioner, his

     brother, mother with his maternal uncle. According to the

     petitioner,    the   maternal   uncle   in   order   to    wreck

     vengeance for initiating the litigation against them have

     started to trouble the petitioner by filing complaints to

     the Pollution Control Board (PCB) stating that the unit is

     causing serious noise pollution and, therefore, action

     should be taken. The private respondent are related and</pre>

<p id="p_1">     maternal uncles of the petitioner. They are seriously

     pursuing the Pollution Control Board to take action so as

     to close the unit. On the basis of complaint, the Pollution
      Control Board has initiated action and have issued two

     notices, one annexure-E dated 03.12.2016 and second,

     annexure-F dated        02.01.2017. In both the notices,

     petitioner was directed          to   take necessary remedial

     measures and submit compliance within a time frame,

     failing which     it was stated       that legal action would be

     taken.
</p>
<p id="p_2">3.   The      petitioner,   replied   to    the   legal   notice   dated

     10.01.2017, stating that in order to control the noise

     pollution allegedly caused by the 3hp motor a brick wall

     has to be put up by replacing the existing tin sheets. He

     has further stated that for replacing the tin sheet by brick

     wall, he is required to seek permission from Srinagar

     Municipal Corporation (SMC). The petitioner, therefore,

     pleads that till requisite permission is obtained from SMC,

     his unit shall not be disturbed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">4.   On this premise, writ petition has been filed for the

     following relief:-
</p><p id="p_4">        (a) Mandamus,        commanding         the    official
           respondents, to provide an adequate and
           sufficient time to the petitioner to introduce the
           remedial measures in the shape of replacement
           of existing Tin Sheets by brick walling after
           obtaining permission from the Srinagar
           Municipal Corporation and after obtaining the
           modification of the status-quo order passed by
           the trial court.
</p><p id="p_5">       (b) Mandamus,        commanding         the    official
           respondents no to close the Industrial Unit of
           the petitioner without following the due
           procedure of law as provided in the Air
           Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.   After notice, on behalf of PCB, Mr. Muzaffar Nabi Lone, GA

     appeared but has not filed the objections on behalf of

     PCB. However, private respondents represented by Mr.

     Mir Majid, Adv. have filed their objections.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.   Considering the nature of controversy, scope of relief

     sought for and the reason for filing the instant writ

     petition   and   also   taking   into   consideration   the

     apprehensions, expressed by private respondents on the

     issue of noise pollution, the writ petition is admitted to

     hearing and taken up for final disposal in the following

     manner:-
</p><p id="p_8"> (i)    Admittedly, petitioner seeks time to implement
       the directions   of the pollution control board,
       stating that he would construct a brick wall
       after obtaining approval from SMC. He has fairly
       stated that application is yet to be filed before
       the PCB and the reason for non-filing the same
       is that the PCB has to specify the remedial
       measures that should be taken so that all the
       directions can be addressed in one go.       As a
       result   the     complaint   filed   by    private
       respondents will be put to rest once for all. It
       appears that private respondents who are the
       close relatives of the petitioner seeks a pound
       of flesh stating that the unit should be closed
       forthwith since it is running without permission
       of PCB and also primarily on the land dispute
       pending in the court.
</p><p id="p_9">(ii)   Learned counsel for the PCB while reacting to
       the complaint filed by private respondents has
       suggested the installation of PCDs/PCMs in the
       unit. The measures which are to be taken to
       arrest the pollution has to be specified by the
       Authority if and when a request is        made by
       the petitioner. Petitioner is yet to seek the
       guidance of the PCB.
</p><p id="p_10"> (iii)   Admittedly, the unit is running on a permission,
        granted by various Government agencies. The
        only further requirement that is wanted is the
        approval of PCB. Therefore, the issue that
        arises for consideration is proper method to be
        adopted for ensuring proper compliance of the
        law on pollution control and also to enable the
        unit to run which is otherwise permitted by
        other Government departments of the State.
</p><p id="p_11">(iv)    This Court has also to take into consideration
        the objections of      the private respondents.
        Keeping all this in mind, since petitioner has
        already responded to the notice of the PCB
        stating that he will take proper measures but
        for want of adequate inputs from PCB, the
        effective control of noise    and other forms of
        pollution    has not been undertaken. In the
        result, petitioner is granted two weeks' time to
        approach the Regional Director, J&amp;K State
        Pollution Control Board with an application and
        request     appropriate   instructions   from   the
        Authority as to what are the pollution control
        methods,     to   be   adopted   and     accordingly
        implemented.
</p><p id="p_12"> (v)      The suggestions made by the Pollution Control
         Authority be implemented            within the time
         framed, fixed by the Authority concerned.
</p><p id="p_13">(vi)     The petitioner shall also submit an application
         before the SMC for grant of permission for
         taking up construction so as to enable the
         industrial   unit     to     comply           with    the
         suggestions/directions of PCB.
</p><p id="p_14">(vii)    The   Authority     (PCB)   shall    give      necessary
         assistance to the petitioner, enabling him to
         complete the requirements of Pollution Control
         law for running the unit.
</p><p id="p_15">(viii)   With respect to civil suit pending before the
         court below, the parties are at liberty to pursue
         the same on merits.
</p><p id="p_16">(ix)     In the event, petitioner does not make an
         application(s) before the PCB and SMC within
         the time frame, prescribed by authorities            the
         PCB    Authorities    are   at      liberty     to   take
         appropriate action as per law.
</p><p id="p_17">(x)      The position as on date as it exists on spot to
         continue the above directions are complied.
</p><p id="p_18">(xi)     The private respondents are at liberty to raise
         their objections before the authorities and the
         authorities shall provide them an opportunity of
                      being heard in the matter at the appropriate
                     stage.
</p><p id="p_19">    7.     The writ petition along with connected MPs is, accordingly,
           disposed of as above.
</p><p id="p_20">    8.     Interim, direction shall also stand vacated.
