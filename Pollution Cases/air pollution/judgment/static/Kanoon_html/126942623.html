<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                            1</span>
<p id="p_3">and 15.12.2018. The brief facts necessary to appreciate the

controversy raised in the present case are as follows.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.     The respondent, Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. / Vedanta Ltd.,

was operating a copper smelter plant at the State Industries Promotion

Corporation of Tamil Nadu Ltd. (S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>OT) Industrial Complex at

Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu. On 01.08.1994, the respondent received a

No-Objection Certificate [“NOC”] from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control

Board [“TNPCB”] for the production of blister copper and sulphuric

acid. The environmental clearance to the project by the Ministry of

Environment, Forest, and Climate Change [“MoEF”] followed on

16.01.1995.   On    17.05.1995,   the   State   MoEF     also   granted

environmental clearance to the respondent. The TNPCB granted its

consent under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981

[“<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air Act</a>”] and Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974

[“<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Water Act</a>”] on 22.05.1995. After obtaining the requisite permissions,

the consent to operate the plant was issued on 14.10.1996 by the

TNPCB. Production commenced on 01.01.1997.               However, the

environmental clearances that were granted were challenged before

the Madras High Court in Writ Petition Nos.15501-15503/1996,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                      2</span>
5769/1997, and 16961/1998. On 20.05.1999, the TNPCB granted its

consent for production of two more products, namely, phosphoric acid

and hydrofluorosilicic acid. On 21.09.2004, a Supreme Court

Monitoring Committee was constituted to verify the compliance status

of hazardous waste management. It recommended to the MoEF that

the environmental clearance for the proposed expansion should not be

granted, and if granted, should be revoked. On 19.04.2005, the

TNPCB issued consent to operate, subject to fulfillment of various

conditions for the expanded capacity. Meanwhile, the Madras High

Court, on 28.09.2010, allowed the various writ petitions that had been

filed and quashed the environmental clearances granted to the

respondent and directed the TNPCB to close down the plant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.    Meanwhile, on 23.03.2013, the residents of nearby areas

started complaining of irritation, throat infection, severe cough,

breathing problem, nausea etc. due to emissions from Sterlite

Industries. Reports were obtained after inspection of the premises by

the TNPCB. Based on these reports, the TNPCB issued a show-cause

notice dated 24.03.2013 and directed closure of the unit under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Section

31A</a> of the Air Act on 29.03.2013. This order was stayed by the NGT


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                     3</span>
on 31.05.2013, allowing the respondent to commence production

subject to certain conditions. Against this, the TNPCB filed Civil Appeal

Nos.4763-4764 of 2013, which will be disposed of by the judgment

delivered in this case. Finally, on 08.08.2013, the NGT set aside the

TNPCB order dated 29.03.2013, against which, Civil Appeal Nos.
</p>
<p id="p_6">8773-8774 of 2013 were filed, which again will be disposed of by this

judgment. It is important to note that the appellants herein raised the

issue of maintainability of the respondent’s appeal before the NGT,

stating that an appeal should have been filed first before the appellate

authority under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a> / the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_8">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010

[“NGT Act”]. This ground of maintainability was decided against the

appellants by the impugned order dated 08.08.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.     Owing to various interim orders passed by the NGT, the

respondent continued to operate its plant. On 13.04.2016, the TNPCB

granted consent to operate the plant for one year subject to certain

conditions. Post inspection of the unit of the respondent in March

2017, the TNPCB issued a show-cause notice dated 14.03.2017 for

violations under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_10">Water Act</a> which, apparently, was

not pursued. On 06.09.2017, an inspection report by the TNPCB was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                        4</span>
made, and an order passed on 07.09.2017, granting renewal of

consent to operate only till 31.03.2018 subject to various conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_8">Meanwhile, a protest had been organized in March 2018 by some

persons against the proposed expansion sought by the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_9">The respondent, therefore, had to file Writ Petition No.7313 of 2018

before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court for police

protection. This Writ Petition was disposed of by an order dated

04.04.2018 with a direction to consider the respondent’s application.
</p>
<p id="p_10">On 09.04.2018, the TNPCB refused renewal of consent to operate to

the respondent’s unit based on non-compliance with certain conditions

that were laid down under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">Water Act</a>. On

12.04.2018, the respondent filed Appeal Nos.36-37 of 2018 before the

appellate authority under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_13">Section 28</a> of the Water Act. In these

appeals, various orders were passed, until, on 06.06.2018, the

following order was passed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         “APPLICATIONS 28 &amp; 29 / 2018, APPLICATIONS 30

On 10.07.2018, the matter was further adjourned as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">          “APPLICATIONS 28 &amp; 29 / 2018, APPLICATIONS 30

         21.8.2018.”


Finally, on 18.12.2018, i.e., three days after the impugned order was

passed by the NGT on 15.12.2018, an order passed by the appellate

authority was as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">              “APPLICATIONS 28, 29, 30 &amp; 31 / 2018 AND

</p><p id="p_15">5.     On 12.04.2018, an order was passed by the TNPCB under

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_14">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_15">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act directing

that the respondent’s unit shall not resume production without

obtaining prior approval/renewal or consent from the TNPCB. This was

followed by two orders, both dated 23.05.2018, again issued under the

same Sections, this time to close down the respondent’s unit and

disconnect power supply to it. Finally, on 28.05.2018, an order was

issued by the Government of Tamil Nadu under <a href="/doc/728591/" id="a_16">Section 18(1)(b)</a> of the

Water Act stating:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">             “It is brought to the notice of the Government that
         Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board did not renew the
         Consent to Operate to M/s.Vedanta Limited, Copper

         Subsequently, on 23.5.2018, Tamil Nadu Pollution
         Control Board has also issued directions for closure
         and disconnection of power supply to the Unit. The
         power supply has been disconnected on 24.5.2018.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">             2. Under <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_18">Article 48-A</a> of the Constitution,
             “the State shall endeavour to protect and

<p id="p_16">             3. Under sections, 18(1)(b) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_19">Water Act</a>, 1974

         Control Board to seal the unit and close the plant
         permanently.”


</p><p id="p_17">6.     On the same date, the TNPCB issued a letter to the District

Collector, inter alia, directing him to seal the respondent’s unit. These

six orders became the subject matter of a composite Appeal No. 87 of

2018 under Section 16 of the NGT Act.
</p>
<p id="p_18">7.     A writ petition was filed by the respondent before the Madurai

Bench of the Madras High Court on 18.06.2018 so that the respondent

could access its unit to maintain its plant. This was dismissed as

withdrawn on 09.07.2018.
</p>
<p id="p_19">8.     The appellants then took up a plea of maintainability of the

composite appeal. As this was not being disposed of by the NGT, this

Court, by its order dated 17.08.2018, directed the NGT to render its

final findings, both on maintainability as well as on merits. On

20.08.2018, the NGT constituted a Committee to go into the material

produced by the parties to the Civil Appeal and to visit the site. This

Committee was ultimately headed by Justice Tarun Agarwala, former

Chief Justice of the Meghalaya High Court, together with two experts,

one being a representative of the Central Pollution Control Board

order, the appellants knocked on the doors of this Court. This Court

disposed of this appeal on 10.09.2018, by stating:

Both the respondent as well as the appellants made their detailed

comments on the Committee’s report. The NGT then heard final

arguments and dictated the impugned order on 15.12.2018, in which it

substantially accepted the Committee’s recommendations. In doing so,

it set aside the six impugned orders in the composite appeal. One

major bone of contention of both the State of Tamil Nadu as well as

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                  14</span>
the TNPCB in this case is that the appeal before the NGT is not

maintainable and hence, the order dated 15.12.2018 is without

jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_54">10.     As a postscript to this order, the TNPCB looked into the matter

again, and issued yet another rejection letter dated 22.01.2019, by

which the respondent’s application seeking renewal of consent to

operate was rejected, stating that the conditions of various previous

consents over the last 20 years had not been followed.
</p>
<p id="p_55">11.     We have heard wide-ranging arguments from learned counsel

appearing on behalf of all the parties as well as the intervenors, on

maintainability as well as on merits. Since we will be deciding this case

on maintainability alone, we have not ventured to state anything on the

merits of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_56">12.     Shri C.S. Vaidyanathan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on

behalf of the TNPCB, showed us various provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_20">Water Act</a>,

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_21">Air Act</a>, and the NGT Act and argued that the six impugned orders

before the NGT were orders which could not have been corrected by

the NGT. Insofar as the first order dated 09.04.2018 was concerned,

an appeal was pending before the appellate authority, as a result of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                       15</span>
which, the NGT, when it set aside the said order, could not have done

so.   Similarly,   the   orders   dated 12.04.2018,   23.05.2018,    and

28.05.2018, made under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_22">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_23">Section

31A</a> of the Air Act, were composite orders issued. As orders under

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_24">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act were not appealable to the NGT either

under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_25">Air Act</a> or under Section 16 of the NGT Act, the Tribunal

acted without jurisdiction in interfering with these orders. Further, the

order dated 28.05.2018, issued by the Government of Tamil Nadu

under <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_26">Section 18</a> of the Water Act, was certainly not an appealable

order under either the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_27">Water Act</a> or the NGT Act, and could only have

been corrected in judicial review in a writ petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_28">Article

226</a> of the Constitution of India or in a suit before a Civil Court.
</p>
<p id="p_57">According to him, therefore, the setting aside of such an order was

also completely without jurisdiction. Shri K.V. Viswanathan, learned

Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu,

added to these submissions. He cited some of our judgments as well

as statutes and judgments of the English Courts to show that once an

appeal is available to an appellate authority, after which an appeal lies

to the NGT, a party cannot leapfrog directly to the NGT. Apart from

this, the learned Senior Advocate also argued, based on the scheme
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                       16</span>
of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_29">Water Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_30">Air Act</a>, and NGT Act, that all the appeals filed before

the NGT were incompetent. Shri Guru Krishnakumar, learned Senior

Advocate appearing on behalf of the TNPCB, also went on to criticize

the order passed by the NGT dated 08.08.2013 on maintainability.
</p>
<p id="p_58">According to him, no doctrine of necessity could be imported if an

appellate tribunal was not constituted, as a result of which an appeal

could not be argued before the appellate authority. Consequently, a

leapfrog appeal would not be maintainable before the NGT. According

to the learned Senior Advocate, this order also had to be set aside for

the reason that even assuming that the appellate authority was not

constituted on the date on which an appeal could have been preferred

to it, the NGT, being a second appellate tribunal, would not have

jurisdiction, and that either a suit or a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_31">Article 226</a>

would have to be filed against the original order.
</p>
<p id="p_59">13.    As against these arguments, Shri C.A. Sundaram, learned

Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents in all three

appeals, sought to sustain the order of the NGT in these three

appeals. The learned Senior Advocate painstakingly took us through

all the orders that were impugned before the NGT, together with the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                       17</span>
relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_32">Air Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_33">Water Act</a>, and the NGT Act.
</p>
<p id="p_60">According to the learned Senior Advocate, so far as the order dated

09.04.2018 is concerned, thanks to a government affidavit filed, the

appeal before the appellate authority had become infructuous, as a

result of which, a direct appeal to the NGT would obviously become

maintainable. Insofar as the combined orders under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_34">Sections 33A</a> and

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_35">31A</a> of the Water Act and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_36">Air Act</a>, respectively, are concerned,

according to him, an express appeal is provided to the NGT against

orders passed under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_37">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act, and even if there is

no appeal provided under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_38">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act, yet, as four out of

five items in these orders dealt with the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_39">Water Act</a>, the order could be

stated to be substantially an order under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_40">Water Act</a>, and therefore,

appealable as such. He added that, in any case, such orders could be

corrected under Section 14 of the NGT Act to avoid piecemeal

litigation. Further, in any case, according to the learned Senior

Advocate, a direction made under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_41">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act is

undoubtedly equivalent to an order made under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_42">Section 31</a> of the Air

Act, and therefore, would be expressly appealable under Section 16 of

the NGT Act. Another without prejudice argument was made, that

assuming all other arguments failed, these matters are only
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                      18</span>
procedural, and therefore, appeals must necessarily land up before the

expert tribunal which is so constituted as an expert tribunal to deal with

all matters relating to the environment. For this, he referred to and

relied strongly upon Sections 14, 15, 29, and 33 of the NGT Act.
</p>
<p id="p_61">Insofar as the attack made upon the order dated 28.05.2018 of the

Government of Tamil Nadu under <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_43">Section 18</a> of the Water Act is

concerned, Shri Sundaram argued that on a proper construction of

<a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_44">Section 18</a> read with the other provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_45">Water Act</a>, only a

general order, dealing with general matters, could be passed under the

said Section, and not an order to shut down one particular industry.
</p>
<p id="p_62">Since the <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_46">Section 18</a> order purports to deal with only one particular

industry, it is non est and liable to be ignored. An alternate argument

made is that even though the order states that it is made under

<a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_47">Section 18</a>, it can otherwise be traced to <a href="/doc/423562/" id="a_48">Section 29</a> of the Water Act

as an order made in revision, and would, therefore, be appealable as

such. The learned Senior Advocate then argued that, in any case, this

is an order by which a direction has been made by the State

Government to the TNPCB and, therefore, does not directly affect his

client. He also argued that when this order was challenged before the

NGT, the defence of the Government and the TNPCB would be that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                        19</span>
this is an order which, though binding on the TNPCB, would also

impact the respondent. This being the case, the NGT could always go

into whether such a defence is a valid defence, and could, therefore,

decide the matter. He also went on to state that the NGT is an expert

body constituted specifically under a special Act, which is far better

equipped than the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_49">Article 226</a> exercising its powers

in the writ jurisdiction, and therefore, all matters dealing with the

environment should necessarily be decided by the NGT alone. He also

relied upon our judgment in <a href="/doc/1152518/" id="a_50">L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India and

Ors</a>., (1997) 3 SCC 261 [“L. Chandra Kumar”], in which it has been

made clear that Tribunals can exercise powers of judicial review and

that, therefore, being the equivalent of a High Court, the NGT could, in

exercise of its powers of judicial review, have interfered with the State

Government’s orders passed under <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_51">Section 18</a> of the Water Act.

</p><p id="p_155">18.    It is important now to advert to both the orders dated

08.08.2013    and   15.12.2018,    insofar    as   they   deal   with   the

maintainability of the appeals before them.
</p>
<p id="p_156">19.    By the judgment of the NGT dated 08.08.2013, the NGT

disposed of the plea on maintainability as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">         “62. Another aspect that would support the view that
         we are taking is the doctrine of necessity. Wherever in
         the facts and circumstances of the case, it is
         absolutely inevitable for a person to exercise another
         right available to it under the statute and where it is
         unable to exercise the preliminary right of appeal
         because of non-existence or non-proper constitution of
         the appellate authority and for its effective and
         efficacious exercise of right, it becomes necessary for
         the appellant-company to invoke another remedy, then
         the same would be permitted unless it was so
         specifically barred by law governing the subject and
         the rights of the parties. It was upon the appellant-</blockquote>
<p id="p_157">         company, particularly keeping in view the emergent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                                         38</span>
situation created by issuance of the order dated
29th March, 2013, to avail of its right to appeal without
any undue delay and as was rightly done by it within
two days of the passing of the order. The unit of the
appellant-company had been directed to be shut down
and the appellant-company obviously could not have
taken recourse to the remedy under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_107">Section 31</a> of the
Air Act as the authority itself was not properly
constituted and was not functional. Besides the aid of
the doctrine of necessity, the appellant-company has
also placed its reliance on <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_108">Section 31B</a> of the Air Act.
An appeal against the order passed by the appellate
authority in exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_109">Section 31</a> of
the Air Act lies to the NGT in terms of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_110">Section 31B</a> of
the Air Act. In other words, the appellate order passed
by the proper authority under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_111">Section 31</a> of the Air Act
is appealable to the NGT in terms of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_112">Section 31B</a>.
Thus, the NGT is the appellate authority of the
appellate authority constituted under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_113">Section 31</a> of the
Air Act by the State Government. The appellant-
company has itself given up its right of first appeal
before the appellate authority in view of the peculiar
facts and circumstances of the case. The respondents
have placed reliance upon the judgment of the
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/32597732/" id="a_114">Manohar Lal v. Union of India</a>,
(2010) 11 SCC 557 where the Court had taken the
view that no higher authority in the hierarchy or an
appellate or revisional authority can exercise the
power of the statutory authority nor the superior
authority can mortgage its wisdom and direct the
statutory authority to act in a particular manner. Firstly
this judgment on facts and law has no application to
the present case. Secondly, the non-constitution of the
authority itself would bring the present case outside
the application of the judgment of the Supreme Court
in the case of Manohar Lal (supra).
</p><p id="p_158">63. We are unable to contribute ourselves to the
contention raised that a direction passed under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                             39</span>
         <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_115">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act is not covered under the
         expression ‘order’ used in <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_116">Section 31</a> of the Air Act.
         Any direction essentially would contain an element of
         order as it requires and calls upon the parties to
         comply with the same. ‘Direction’ itself means an
         order; an instruction how to proceed, like the judge's
         direction to the jury, while ‘Order’ is defined as a
         command, direction or instruction. This is how
         the Black's Law Dictionary, 9th Edition, refers to these
         two expressions. In other words, they can be used as
         synonyms. They are not conflicting terms and one can
         be read into the other. Thus, we find no substance in
         this contention raised on behalf of the respondents.
</p><p id="p_159">         64. An appellate authority, which is constituted under
         the statute, is completely distinct and different from an
         administrative authority constituted otherwise even to
         deal with adjudicatory proceedings. In the case of an
         appellate authority, it must satisfy the existence de
         facto and must function de jure, in accordance with
         law. If the appellate authority itself was not in
         conformity with the notification, it cannot be said that it
         could function in accordance with law without
         constitution of the three Member appellate authority.
         The cumulative effect of this discussion is that the
         objection in regard to maintainability is without any
         substance and is liable to be rejected. In view of this
         finding, it is not necessary for us to examine whether
         this could be treated as a petition under <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_117">Section 14</a> of
         the National Green Tribunal Act (for short ‘the NGT
         Act’) even if it was not maintainable in view of the
         objection taken by the respondent in regard to
         maintainability of the present appeal.”


</p><p id="p_160">20.    Insofar as the judgment dated 15.12.2018 is concerned, the

NGT, on maintainability, held as follows:
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                                       40</span>
<p id="p_161">“44. It is undisputed that this Tribunal is an Appellate
Authority as far as orders of closure under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_118">Air Act</a>
and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_119">Water Act</a> are concerned. The impugned
orders dated 12.04.2018, 23.05.2018 and 28.05.2018
are such orders. Mere fact that an appeal against the
order declining renewal of Consent to Operate is
provided for and was filed cannot be in the facts and
circumstances of the present case, be a bar to
exercise of powers of the Appellate Authority by this
Tribunal. As already noted, the Appellate Authority has
declined to proceed with the matter. The grounds in
the impugned orders dated 09.04.2018, 12.04.2018,
23.05.2018 and 28.05.2018 are identical. If the
appeals are held to be not maintainable, the appellant
will be without any remedy against the order of
closure. Order of the Appellate Authority is also
appealable before this Tribunal under Section 16(f) of
the NGT Act, 2010. We, thus, do not find any merit in
this case in the objections of the respondent.
</p><p id="p_162">45. Mere fact that the State of Tamil Nadu also
endorsed the order of the TNPCB and that order of the
State is not appealable to this Tribunal, does not
deviate from the legal position that order of TNPCB is
appealable to this Tribunal. Moreover, order of the
State of Tamil Nadu is not a policy matter but mere
endorsement of order of the TNPCB.
</p><p id="p_163">46. The judgments relied upon by the respondents are
distinguishable. Unlike Educanti Kistamma v. Deokar’s
Distillery [(2003) 5 SCC 669], this is not a case where
the first order has not been challenged. Challenge
before us is to the first order as well as subsequent
orders. Basis for all the orders is common.

</p><p id="p_164">48. The order of the Government of Tamil Nadu issued
under <a href="/doc/728591/" id="a_120">Section 18(1)(b)</a> of the Water Act also cannot be
said to be an independent order but relied on and
endorsing the views of the TNPCB which is under

         challenge and that are not sufficient for ordering
         closure or refusal to grant even consent. If there are
         no other materials for the Government of Tamil Nadu
         to arrive at conclusion of closure on the ground of
         irreversible pollution being caused to the environment
         allowing the unit to function, then it cannot be said to
         be a policy decision to close down the industry
         permanently and if any order was passed based on
         the order by the Pollution Control Board, without
         independent application of mind and arbitrarily, then
         that can also be incidentally considered by the
         Tribunal for the purpose of deciding the question of
         legality of that order. So, under the present
         circumstances, it is not a case of this Tribunal
         entertaining the appeals where there is inherent lack of
         jurisdiction to entertain the same.
</p><p id="p_165">         49. In the present proceedings, as already noted, the
         Appellate Authority having declined to proceed with
         the matter and the order of closure being appealable
         before this Tribunal, there is no ground to reject the
         appeal on the ground of maintainability so as to
         deprive the appellant any judicial remedy in the
         matter.”


(I)    RE: ORDER DATED 09.04.2018


</p><p id="p_166">21.    This order is an order which rejected renewal of consent to

operate, and therefore, is traceable to <a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_121">Section 27</a> of the Water Act and

<a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_122">Section 21</a> of the Air Act. There is no doubt whatsoever that an appeal

against an order made under <a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_123">Section 27</a> of the Water Act is

appealable to the appellate authority under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_124">Section 28</a> of the said Act.

order or decision of the appellate authority under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_126">Section 28</a>, it is then

appealable to the NGT. This is made clear also by Section 16(a) of the

NGT Act. Equally, an order refusing consent under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_127">Section 21</a> of the

Air Act is appealable to the appellate authority under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_128">Section 31</a> of the

Air Act, and thereafter, from the said appellate authority’s order, to the

NGT, under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_129">Section 31B</a> of the Air Act and Section 16(f) of the NGT

Act.
</p>
<p id="p_168">22.    As has been stated hereinabove, it is clear that an appeal to the

order of refusal of consent to operate dated 09.04.2018. Shri

Sundaram, however, argued before us that the order dated 06.06.2018

made by the appellate authority, which we have set out hereinabove,

makes it clear that the appeals could not be heard since the State

Government had passed an order dated 28.05.2018 directing the

TNPCB to close down the plant permanently. What is missed by Shri

Sundaram is the fact that the said order expressly states that the

appeals could not be decided at this juncture and were hence

adjourned to 10.07.2018. The said appeals on 10.07.2018 were further

adjourned, and it is only on 18.12.2018 that they were finally

withdrawn as being infructuous in view of the fact that the NGT had

passed its order on 15.12.2018 in which it had set aside the order

dated 09.04.2018.

<p id="p_169">23.    What becomes clear from the above narration of facts is the

fact that while an appeal was still pending before the appellate

authority, the NGT took up a matter directly against the original order

dated 09.04.2018 which was challenged before the appellate authority

even before the appellate authority could decide the same. However,

Shri Sundaram referred to <a href="/doc/1356447/" id="a_132">Section 28(4)</a> of the Air Act and <a href="/doc/1868067/" id="a_133">Section

must be decided expeditiously, and if they were not so decided, an

appeal would lie to the NGT against a decision by the appellate

authority not to decide the matter before it expeditiously. This

argument must also be negatived as, in point of fact, no appeal was

preferred from any orders of the appellate authority adjourning the

        creating rights of appeal against the grant of permit

        order granting the permit. Issuance of the permit is
        only a ministerial act necessarily following the grant of
        the permit. The appeals before the State Transport
        Appellate Tribunal and the further appeal to the
        Mysore Revenue Appellate Tribunal are, therefore, not
        competent under <a href="/doc/850762/" id="a_141">Section 64</a> of the Act and both the

        and to interfere with the order of the Regional
        Transport Authority granting the permit which had
        already been affirmed in appeal by the State Transport
        Appellate Tribunal and further in second appeal by the
        Mysore Revenue Appellate Tribunal. There was,
        therefore, a clear error of jurisdiction on the part of
        both the Tribunals in interfering with the grant of the
        permit to the appellant. The High Court was, therefore,
        not right in dismissing the writ application of the

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">         “7. The aforesaid provision, thus, confers a right upon
         any of the aggrieved parties mentioned therein to
         prefer an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal. This
         statutory provision does not impose any condition of
         pre-deposit for entertaining the appeal. Therefore, right
         to file the appeal and have the said appeal decided on
         merits, if it is filed within the period of limitation, is
         conferred by the statute and that cannot be taken
         away by imposing the condition of deposit of an
         amount leading to dismissal of the main appeal itself if
         the said condition is not satisfied. Position would have
         been different if the provision of appeal itself contained
         a condition of pre-deposit of certain amount. That is
         not so. Subsection (3) of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_146">Section 53B</a> specifically cast
         a duty upon the Appellate Tribunal to pass order on
         appeal, as it thinks fit i.e. either confirming, modifying
         or setting aside the direction, decision or order
         appealed against. It is to be done after giving an

          opportunity of hearing to the parties to the appeal. It,
          thus, clearly implies that appeal has to be decided on
          merits. The Appellate Tribunal, which is the creature of
          a statute, has to act within the domain prescribed by
          the law/statutory provision. This provision nowhere
          stipulates that the Appellate Tribunal can direct the
          appellant to deposit a certain amount as a condition
          precedent for hearing the appeal. In fact, that was not
          even done in the instant case. It is stated at the cost of
          repetition that the condition of deposit of 10% of the
          penalty was imposed insofar as stay of penalty order
          passed by the CCI is concerned. Therefore, at the
          most, stay could have been vacated. The Appellate
          Tribunal, thus, had no jurisdiction to dismiss the
          appeal itself.”

        and the High Court of Mysore not being invested by
        any statute of under its constitution with that
        jurisdiction was incompetent to entertain a passing off
        action.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_30">        But it was urged that in a State the High Court is at the
        apex of the hierarchy of civil courts and has all the
        powers which the subordinate courts may exercise,
        and it is competent to entertain all actions as a Court
        of original jurisdiction which may lie in any court in the
        State. For this exalted claim, there is no warrant in our
        jurisprudence. Jurisdiction of a court means the extent
        of the authority of a court to administer justice
        prescribed with reference to the subject-matter,
        pecuniary value and local limits. Barring cases in
        which jurisdiction is expressly conferred upon it by
        special statutes, e.g. the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_150">Companies Act</a>; the <a href="/doc/444965/" id="a_151">Banking
        Companies Act</a>, the High Court of Mysore exercises
        appellate jurisdiction alone. As a court of appeal it
        undoubtedly stands at the apex within the State, but
        on that account it does not stand invested with original
        jurisdiction in matters not expressly declared within its
        cognizance.”

<blockquote id="blockquote_38">         “20. On a scrutiny of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_163">Section 7-I</a>, we notice that the
         language is clear and unambiguous and it does not
         provide for an appeal against the determination made
         under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_164">Section 7-Q</a>. It is well settled in law that right of
         appeal is a creature of statute, for the right of appeal
         inheres in no one and, therefore, for maintainability of
         an appeal there must be authority of law. This being
         the position a provision providing for appeal should
         neither be construed too strictly nor too liberally, for if
         given either of these extreme interpretations, it is
         bound to adversely affect the legislative object as well
         as hamper the proceedings before the appropriate
         forum. Needless to say, a right of appeal cannot be
         assumed to exist unless expressly provided for by the
         statute and a remedy of appeal must be legitimately
         traceable to the statutory provisions. If the express
         words employed in a provision do not provide an
         appeal from a particular order, the court is bound to
         follow the express words. To put it otherwise, an
         appeal for its maintainability must have the clear
         authority of law and that explains why the right of
         appeal is described as a creature of statute. (<a href="/doc/1350326/" id="a_165">See

<blockquote id="blockquote_39">31.    From the above authorities, it is clear that an appeal is a

creature of statute and an appellate tribunal has to act strictly within

the domain prescribed by statute. It is obvious that an appeal would lie

from an order or decision of the appellate authority under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_174">Section 28</a> of

the Water Act to the NGT only under <a href="/doc/170325745/" id="a_175">Section 33B(a)</a> of the Water Act

from an order or decision of the appellate authority under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_176">Section 31</a> of

the Air Act to the NGT only under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_177">Section 31B</a> of the Air Act read with

would be incompetent. NGT’s jurisdiction being strictly circumscribed

by <a href="/doc/156852187/" id="a_180">Section 33B</a> of the Water Act, read with <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_181">Section 31B</a> of the Air Act,

read with <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_182">Section 16(a)</a> and (f) of the NGT Act, would make it clear

that it is only orders or decisions of the appellate authority that are

appealable, and not original orders. On the facts of the present case, it

is clear that an appeal was pending before the appellate authority

when the NGT set aside the original order dated 09.04.2018. This

being the case, the NGT’s order being clearly outside its statutory

powers conferred by the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_183">Water Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_184">Air Act</a>, and the NGT Act,

would be an order passed without jurisdiction.

<p id="p_189">(II)   RE: ORDERS PASSED UNDER SECTION 33A OF THE WATER ACT AND

       SECTION 31A OF THE AIR ACT


</p><p id="p_190">35.    We have referred to the orders dated 12.04.2018, 23.05.2018,

and 28.05.2018 passed by the TNPCB under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_186">Sections 33A</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_187">31A</a> of

the Water Act and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_188">Air Act</a> respectively. At this juncture, it is important

to state that <a href="/doc/156852187/" id="a_189">Section 33B</a> of the Water Act and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_190">Section 31B</a> of the Air


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                                                       56</span>
Act were both enacted on 18.10.2010, which is the very date on which

the NGT Act came into force. What is important to note is that whereas

<a href="/doc/2583923/" id="a_191">Section 33B(c)</a> of the Water Act read with Section 16(c) of the NGT Act

make it clear that directions issued under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_192">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act

are appealable to the NGT, directions issued under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_193">Section 31A</a> of the

Air Act are not so appealable. In fact, the statutory scheme is that

directions given under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_194">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act are not appealable.
</p>
<p id="p_191">This being the case, all the aforesaid orders, being composite orders

issued under both the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_195">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_196">Air Act</a>, it will not be possible

to split the aforesaid orders and say that so far as they affect water

pollution, they are appealable to the NGT, but so far as they affect air

pollution, a suit or a writ petition would lie against such orders. Shri

Sundaram’s argument that these orders being substantially relatable to

the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_197">Water Act</a> would, therefore, not hold, as such orders are composite

orders made both under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_198">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_199">Air Act</a>. Equally

disingenuous is the reference to Section 14 of the NGT Act which only

refers to the original jurisdiction of the NGT and not to its appellate

jurisdiction. Also, to state generally that the subject matter of

environment lies with the NGT, is an argument of despair that must be

dismissed for the reason that as held by us hereinabove, an appeal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                                                      57</span>
being a creature of statute, a statute either confers a right of appeal or

it does not. In the present case, we have seen that so far as directions

issued under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_200">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act are concerned, there is no

right of appeal conferred by the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_201">Air Act</a> read with the NGT Act. The

ingenious argument made by Shri Sundaram that, in any case, a

“direction” under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_202">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act is nothing but an “order”,

and would, therefore, be appealable as such under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_203">Section 31B</a> of the

Air Act read with Section 16(f) of the NGT Act would drive a coach-
</p>
<p id="p_192">and-four through the statutory scheme that has just been adverted to.
</p>
<p id="p_193">We have seen how all the appellate proceedings to the NGT, whether

under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_204">Air Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_205">Water Act</a>, or the NGT Act have been brought

into force on the same date. Whereas the identical power to give

directions by the Board under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_206">Water Act</a> is appealable to the NGT,

the same power to give directions by the Board under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_207">Air Act</a> is not

so appealable. The absence of any mention of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_208">Section 31A</a> in <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_209">Section

31B</a> of the Air Act, given the statutory scheme as aforesaid, makes it

clear that even this argument must be rejected. Also, “directions” that

are issued under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_210">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act are of a different quality

from “orders” referred to in <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_211">Section 31</a> of the same Act. Directions are

the Act and are not quasi-judicial in nature, whereas orders that are

appealed against under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_212">Section 31</a> are quasi-judicial orders made,

inter alia, under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_213">Section 21</a> of the Air Act. For this reason also, we

cannot accept the aforesaid argument of Shri Sundaram. However,

Shri Sundaram argued, with particular reference to the explanation to

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_214">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act that “directions” partake of the nature of

“orders” when closure of any particular industry or stoppage of supply

of electricity qua any single industry is made, and therefore, such

directions are appealable as orders under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_215">Section 31</a> of the Air Act.
</p>
<p id="p_194">This argument is also of no avail as <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_216">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act

contains an identical explanation to that contained in <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_217">Section 31A</a> of

the Air Act. Despite this, the legislative scheme, as stated

hereinabove, is that so far as directions under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_218">Water Act</a> are

concerned, they are appealable, but so far as directions under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_219">Air

Act</a> are concerned, they are not appealable. Hence, reference made

to P. Ramanatha Aiyer’s Law Lexicon and Black’s Law Dictionary,

which state that in certain circumstances, orders are also directions

and vice versa, would not apply to the present case, given the express

statutory scheme. In this connection, Shri Sundaram cited <a href="/doc/14042890/" id="a_220">Kanhiya

Lal Omar v. R.K. Trivedi</a>, (1985) 4 SCC 678, and relied upon
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                                                    59</span>
paragraph 17, where this Court held, referring to <a href="/doc/359300/" id="a_221">Article 324(1)</a> of the

Constitution of India, that a “direction” may be equated with a specific

or a general order. The context of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_222">Article 324</a> being wholly different, it

is obvious that this authority also has no application, given the

statutory scheme in the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_195">36.    Shri Sundaram then cited <a href="/doc/174675/" id="a_223">Maharashtra State Board of

Secondary     and       Higher   Secondary   Education     v.   Paritosh

Bhupeshkumar Sheth</a>, (1984) 4 SCC 27. In this judgment, the High

Court had struck down Regulation 104 of the Maharashtra Secondary

and Higher Secondary Boards Regulations, 1977, by which, no re-

<p id="p_196">evaluation of an answer book given in an examination can be

undertaken. In setting aside the High Court judgment, this Court stated

that the process of re-evaluation of answer papers is extremely time

consuming, would involve several thousand man-hours, and is bound

to throw the entire system out of gear. Further, it is in public interest

that the results of public examinations, when published, should have

some finality attached to them [see paragraph 27]. It is in this context

that this Court held:
</p>
<p id="p_197">         “29. …… It is equally important that the Court should
         also, as far as possible, avoid any decision or

          interpretation of a statutory provision, rule or bye-law
          which would bring about the result of rendering the
          system unworkable in practice. ……”


To bodily lift the aforesaid sentence and apply it to the fact situation

here would be a huge leap which we are not prepared to make.

<p id="p_198">Further, given the statutory scheme as aforesaid, it is not possible for

us to provide an appeal where there is none in the guise of making an

appellate system workable in practice.
</p>
<p id="p_199">37.    Shri Sundaram then relied upon this Court’s judgments in

Galada Power &amp; Telecommunication Ltd. v. United India

Insurance Co. Ltd., (2016) 14 SCC 161 and <a href="/doc/138361281/" id="a_224">Allokam Peddabbayya

v. Allahabad Bank</a>, (2017) 8 SCC 272 for the proposition that the right

of appeal is a statutory right, and like all other statutory rights, it can be

waived, unless its waiver is detrimental to public interest. The question

in these appeals is not whether an appellant may waive a statutory

right of appeal. The question is whether the NGT, which is only

invested with the jurisdiction of entertaining an appeal from an order of

an appellate authority, is jurisdictionally capable of entertaining an

appeal directly from the original authority. It is clear, as has been held

by us, that the NGT possesses no such jurisdiction.

<p id="p_202">(III)   RE: ORDER PASSED UNDER SECTION 18 OF THE WATER ACT

</p><p id="p_203">39.     So far as the order dated 28.05.2018 is concerned, this order is

expressly stated to be made under <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_225">Section 18</a> of the Water Act. There

is no doubt whatsoever that such an order is not appealable to the

NGT either under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_226">Water Act</a> or under the NGT Act. However, Shri

Sundaram has argued that <a href="/doc/656953/" id="a_227">Section 18</a> is referable to orders generally

made, and falls under Chapter IV of the Water Act, which deals with

powers and functions of Boards, as opposed to the Sections that

follow in Chapter V, which deals with prevention and control of water

pollution, which orders are made against individuals and individual

industries. On the assumption that Shri Sundaram is correct in this

argument, it is clear that such order can only be set aside in a suit by a

Civil Court, or under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_228">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India by a High

Court. It is not possible to agree with the argument of Shri Sundaram

that such orders can be ignored, being non est. It is settled that an

order can only be set aside either in a suit, or by the High Court in the

exercise of judicial review. Faced with this, Shri Sundaram then

argued that though the said order states that it is traceable to <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_232">Section

18</a> of the Water Act, it can, in fact, be traced to <a href="/doc/1429168/" id="a_233">Section 29</a> of the same

Act. <a href="/doc/1429168/" id="a_234">Section 29</a> deals with the revisional power, in which the State

Government is to pass a quasi-judicial order after hearing both the

State Board and the person who is affected. Quite obviously, this order

is not a quasi-judicial order as the State Government has not found it

necessary to hear either the State Board, or any person affected by

such order. Further, such order does not purport to be an order which

either affirms or sets aside any order made under <a href="/doc/813302/" id="a_235">Sections 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1004117/" id="a_236">26</a>, or

have the power of judicial review, save and except a challenge to the

up. For this, he relied strongly upon paragraphs 90 and 93 of the

<blockquote id="blockquote_53">         “93. Before moving on to other aspects, we may
         summarise our conclusions on the jurisdictional
         powers of these Tribunals. The Tribunals are
         competent to hear matters where the vires of statutory
         provisions are questioned. However, in discharging
         this duty, they cannot act as substitutes for the High
         Courts and the Supreme Court which have, under our
         constitutional set-up, been specifically entrusted with
         such an obligation. Their function in this respect is only
         supplementary and all such decisions of the Tribunals
         will be subject to scrutiny before a Division Bench of
         the respective High Courts. The Tribunals will
         consequently also have the power to test the vires of
         subordinate legislations and rules. However, this
         power of the Tribunals will be subject to one important
         exception. The Tribunals shall not entertain any
         question regarding the vires of their parent statutes
         following the settled principle that a Tribunal which is a
         creature of an Act cannot declare that very Act to be

         unconstitutional. In such cases alone, the High Court
         concerned may be approached directly. All other
         decisions of these Tribunals, rendered in cases that
         they are specifically empowered to adjudicate upon by
         virtue of their parent statutes, will also be subject to
         scrutiny before a Division Bench of their respective
         High Courts. We may add that the Tribunals will,
         however, continue to act as the only courts of first
         instance in respect of the areas of law for which they
         have been constituted. By this, we mean that it will not
         be open for litigants to directly approach the High
         Courts even in cases where they question the vires of
         statutory legislations (except, as mentioned, where the
         legislation which creates the particular Tribunal is
         challenged) by overlooking the jurisdiction of the
         Tribunal concerned.”

Court held:

“orders”, sub-sections (3) and (4) thereof used the
word “decision”. In terms of sub-section (5), the orders
and directions of TRAI were treated as binding on the
service providers, Government and all other persons
concerned. <a href="/doc/656953/" id="a_258">Section 18</a> provided for an appeal against
any decision or order of TRAI. Such an appeal could
be filed before the High Court. The Amendment made
in 2000 is intended to vest the original jurisdiction of
TRAI in TDSAT and the same is achieved by <a href="/doc/1480142/" id="a_259">Section
14(a)</a>. The appellate jurisdiction exercisable by the
High Court is also vested in TDSAT by virtue of <a href="/doc/1480142/" id="a_260">Section

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_261">Section 14-N</a> provides for transfer to all appeals
pending before the High Court to TDSAT and in terms
of clause (b) of sub-section (2), TDSAT was required to
proceed to deal with the appeal from the stage which
was reached before such transfer or from any earlier
stage or de novo as considered appropriate by it.
Since the High Court while hearing appeal did not
have the power of judicial review of subordinate
legislation, the transferee adjudicatory forum
i.e. TDSAT cannot exercise that power under <a href="/doc/1480142/" id="a_262">Section

encourage rampant violation of the orders without any
penal consequence and the entire scheme of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_263">TRAI

used in <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_264">Section 29</a> of the TRAI Act was interpreted to
include orders and regulations in the context of the
factual matrix of that case and the apprehension of the
Court that <a href="/doc/1429168/" id="a_265">Section 29</a> would otherwise become
unworkable, but the same cannot be read as laying
down a proposition of law that the words “direction”,

         SCC 261 : 1997 SCC (L&amp;S) 577] and reiterated the

         answered in the following terms: in exercise of the
         power vested in it under <a href="/doc/1339240/" id="a_268">Section 14(b)</a> of the TRAI
         Act, TDSAT does not have the jurisdiction to entertain

         <a href="/doc/813701/" id="a_269">Section 36</a> of the TRAI Act.”


In the present case, it is clear that Section 16 of the NGT Act is cast in

terms that are similar to <a href="/doc/13831203/" id="a_270">Section 14(b)</a> of the Telecom Regulatory

Authority of India Act, 1997, in that appeals are against the orders,

decisions, directions, or determinations made under the various Acts

mentioned in <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_271">Section 16</a>. It is clear, therefore, that under the NGT Act,

the Tribunal exercising appellate jurisdiction cannot strike down rules

or regulations made under this Act. Therefore, it would be fallacious to

state that the Tribunal has powers of judicial review akin to that of a

High Court exercising constitutional powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_272">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India. We must never forget the distinction between a

superior court of record and courts of limited jurisdiction that was, in

the felicitous language of Gajendragadkar, C.J., in Re: Special

Reference, (1965) 1 SCR 413, made in the following words:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_55">         “We ought to make it clear that we are dealing with the
         question of jurisdiction and are not concerned with the
         propriety or reasonableness of the exercise of such
         jurisdiction. Besides, in the case of a superior Court of
         Record, it is for the court to consider whether any
         matter falls within its jurisdiction or not. Unlike a Court
         of limited jurisdiction, the superior Court is entitled to
         determine for itself questions about its own jurisdiction.
         “Prima facie”, says Halsbury, “no matter is deemed to
         be beyond the jurisdiction of a superior court unless it
         is expressly shown to be so, while nothing is within the
         jurisdiction of an inferior court unless it is expressly
         shown on the face of the proceedings that the
         particular matter is within the cognizance of the
         particular court [Halsbury’s Laws of England, vol. 9, p.

For this reason also, we are of the view that the State Government

order made under <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_273">Section 18</a> of the Water Act, not being the subject

matter of any appeal under Section 16 of the NGT Act, cannot be

“judicially reviewed” by the NGT. Following the judgment in BSNL

(supra), we are of the view that the NGT has no general power of

judicial review akin to that vested under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_274">Article 226</a> of the Constitution

of India possessed by the High Courts of this country. Shri Sundaram’s

strong reliance on the NGT judgment dated 17.07.2014 in Wilfred v.
</p>
<p id="p_223">Ministry of Environment and Forests must also be rejected as this

NGT judgment does not state the law on this aspect correctly. This

contention is also without merit, and therefore, rejected.
</p>


<p id="p_224">43.    Shri Sundaram then argued that, in any case, this order is an

order made by the State Government against the TNPCB, and is

therefore, a direction to the TNPCB and not a direction to his client. If

this were so, and the order had no effect on his client, there would

have been no necessity to file an appeal before the NGT against such

order. We have seen, however, that this order has been challenged on

merits by the respondent before the NGT. To then say that this order

which is challenged would be defended on certain grounds, as a result

of which, the NGT then gets vested with the jurisdiction to decide the

same, is again to put the cart before the horse. It is clear that no

appeal is provided against orders made under <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_275">Section 18</a> of the Water

Act, and the attempt to bring the NGT in by the backdoor, as it were,

would, therefore, have to be rejected. Also, to argue that as against a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                                                                       74</span>
writ court acting under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_276">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, the NGT

is an expert body set up only to deal with environmental matters, again

does not answer the specific issue before this Court. As we have held

earlier, an appeal being a creature of statute, an order passed under

<a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_277">Section 18</a> of the Water Act is either appealable or it is not. If it is not,

no general argument as to the NGT being an expert body set up to

hear environmental matters can be of any help.
</p>


<p id="p_225">44.    Equally, so far as the order dated 08.08.2013 is concerned, we

have seen how the NGT stated that the doctrine of necessity would

take over if an appellate authority under the Act is not properly

constituted so that no appeal can then be effectively preferred. This,

again, is an argument that cannot be countenanced. If an appellate

authority is either not yet constituted, or not properly constituted, a

leapfrog appeal to the NGT cannot be countenanced. As has been

held by us supra, the NGT is only conferred appellate jurisdiction from

an order passed in exercise of first appeal. Where there is no such

order, the NGT has no jurisdiction.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                                                          75</span>
<p id="p_226">45.    In conclusion, we are cognizant of the fact that the respondent’s

plant has been shut down since 09.04.2018. Since we have set aside

the impugned judgments of the NGT on the ground of maintainability,

the order dated 22.01.2019 passed by the TNPCB, being a

consequential order, is also set aside. The respondents are relegated

to the position that the six orders impugned before the NGT, dealt with

by the impugned judgment dated 15.12.2018, and the order dated

29.03.2013, dealt with by the final judgment dated 08.08.2013, are

alive and operative. Given the fact that we are setting aside the NGT

judgments involved in these appeals on the ground of maintainability,

we state that it will be open for the respondents to file a writ petition in

the High Court against all the aforesaid orders. If such writ petition is

filed, it will be open for the respondent to apply for interim reliefs

considering that their plant has been shut down since 09.04.2018.
