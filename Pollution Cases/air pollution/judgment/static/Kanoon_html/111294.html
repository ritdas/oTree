JUDGMENT:
</pre>


<p id="p_1">S.SAGHIR AHMAD, J.
</p><p id="p_2">      This  case, which was finally decided by this Court by
its Judgment dated December 13, 1996, has been placed before
us  for determination of the quantum of pollution fine.	  It
may  be	 stated that the main case was disposed of with	 the
following  directions:-	 1.  The public trust  doctrine,  as
discussed by us in this judgment is a part of the law of the
land.	2.  The prior approval granted by the Government  of
India,	Ministry  of  Environment and Forest by	 the  letter
dated  November 24, 1993 and the lease-deed dated April	 11,
1994  in favour of the Motel are quashed.  The lease granted
to  the Motel by the said lease-deed in respect of 27 bighas
and  12	 biswas	 of area, is cancelled and set	aside.	 The
Himachal  Pradesh  Government shall take over the  area	 and
restore	 it  to	 its original-natural conditions.   3.	 The
Motel  shall  pay  compensation	 by  way  of  cost  for	 the
restitution of the environment and ecology of the area.	 The
pollution  caused by various constructions made by the Motel
in  the river bed and the banks of the river Beas has to  be
removed	 and reversed.	We direct NEERI through its Director
to inspect the area, if necessary, and give an assessment of
the  cost  which is likely to be incurred for reversing	 the
damage caused by the Motel to the environment and ecology of
the  area.  NEERI may take into consideration the report  by
the  Board  in	this  respect.	4.  The	 Motel	through	 its
management  shall show cause why pollution fine in  addition
be  not imposed on the Motel.  5.  The Motel shall construct
a boundary wall at a distance of not more than 4 meters from
the  cluster  of rooms (main building of the Motel)  towards
the  river basin.  The boundary wall shall be on the area of
the  Motel which is covered by the lease dated September 29,
1981.	The Motel shall not encroach/cover/utilise any	part
of  the	 river basin.  The boundary wall shall separate	 the
Motel building from the river basin.  The river bank and the
river  basin shall be left open for the public use.  6.	 The
Motel  shall  not  discharge untreated	effluents  into	 the
river.	 We  direct the Himachal Pradesh  Pollution  Control
Board  to  inspect the pollution  control  devices/treatment
plants	set  up	 by  the   Motel.   If	the   effluent/waste
discharged  by the Motel is not conforming to the prescribed
standards,  action  in accordance with law be taken  against
the Motel.  7.	The Himachal Pradesh Pollution Control Board
shall  not  permit the discharge of untreated effluent	into
river	Beas.	 The   Board	 shall	 inspect   all	 the
hotels/institutions/factories  in  Kullu-Manali area and  in
case  any  of them are discharging untreated  effluent/waste
into  the  river, the Board shall take action in  accordance
with  law.   8.	 The Motel shall show cause on December	 18,
1996  why  pollution-fine  and	damages be  not	 imposed  as
directed by us.	 NEERI shall send its report by December 17,
1996.	To be listed on December 18, 1996." Pursuant to	 the
above  Order,  notice  was  issued requiring  the  Motel  to
show-cause on two points;  (i) why the Motel be not asked to
pay  compensation  to reverse the degraded  environment	 and
</p><p id="p_3">(ii)  why pollution fine, in addition, be not imposed.	 Mr.
G.L.  Sanghi, learned Senior Counsel, appearing for M/s Span
Motel  Private Ltd., has contended that though it is open to
the   Court,  in  proceedings  under   <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1">Article	32</a>  of	 the
Constitution,  to  grant compensation to the  victims  whose
Fundamental  Rights might have been violated or who are	 the
victims	 of  an	 arbitrary executive action  or	 victims  of
atrocious  behaviour  of public authorities in violation  of
public	duties cast upon them, it cannot impose any fine  on
those  who are guilty of that action.  He contended that the
fine  is a component of Criminal Jurisprudence and cannot be
utilised  in civil proceedings specially under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2">Article 32</a> or
226  of	 the Constitution either by this Court or  the	High
Court  as  imposition  of  fine would  be  contrary  to	 the
provisions   contained	in  <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_3">Article  20</a>	  and  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_4">21</a>   of	 the
Constitution.  It is contended that fine can be imposed upon
a  person  only	 if it is provided by a	 statute  and  gives
jurisdiction  to  the Court to inflict or impose  that	fine
after  giving a fair trial to that person but in the absence
of any statutory provision, a person cannot be penalised and
no  fine can be imposed upon him.  Mr.	M.C.  Mehta, who has
been pursuing this case with the usual vigour and vehemence,
has  contended	that  if a person  disturbs  the  ecological
balance	 and tinkers with the natural conditions of  rivers,
forests,  air  and water, which are the gifts of nature,  he
would  be  guilty  of  violating not  only  the	 Fundamental
Rights, guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_5">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, but
also   be  violating  the   fundamental	 duties	 to  protect
environment  under  <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_6">Article  51A(g)</a> which provides  that  it
shall  be  the duty of every citizen to protect and  improve
the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and
wildlife  and to show compassion for living creatures.	 The
planet	Earth  which is inhabited by human beings and  other
living	creatures, including animals and birds, has been  so
created	 as  to cater to the basic needs of all	 the  living
creatures.   Living  creatures do not necessarily  mean	 the
human  beings, the animals, the birds, the fish, the  worms,
the  sepents,  the hydras, but also the plants of  different
varieties,  the	 creepers, the grass and the  vast  forests.
They  survive on fresh air, fresh water and the sacred soil.
They  constitute  the  essential elements  for	survival  of
"life"	on  this  planet.  The living  creatures,  including
human  beings,	lived  peacefully all along.  But  when	 the
human  beings started acting inhumanly, the era of  distress
began  which  in it wake brought new problems for  survival.
The industrial revolution brought an awakening among the men
inhabiting  this  Earth	 that  the   Nature,  with  all	 its
resources  was	not  unlimited and forever  renewable.	 The
uncontrolled  industrial  development generating  tonnes  of
industrial  waste  disturbed  the   ecological	balance	  by
polluting the air and water which in turn, had a devastating
effect	on the wildlife and, therefore, the early efforts to
protect	 the  environment  related  to	the  protection	  of
wildlife.   But then the two world wars, the first world war
(1914-1918)  and the second world war (1939 to 1945)  during
which  atomic  bombs were exploded resulting in the loss  of
thousands  of  lives  and burning down of vast	expanses  of
forests,  made	the  man realise that if  the  environmental
disturbances  were not controlled, his own survival on	this
planet	would  become  impossible.    The  United   Nations,
therefore,  held  a  Conference	 on  human  environment	  at
Stockholm  in 1972.  In the wake of the resolutions  adopted
at  that Conference, different countries at different stages
enacted	 laws  to  protect the deteriorating  conditions  of
environment.   Here in India, the Legislature enacted  three
Acts,  namely, The Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974;  the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1981  and  <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_9">The Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986.  It	also
enacted	 the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution)	Cess
Act</a>, 1977.  Under these Acts, Rules have been framed to give
effect	to  the provisions thereof.  They are :	  The  Water
(Prevention  and  Control  of Pollution) Rules,	 1975;	 The
Water  (Prevention &amp; Control of Pollution) Cess Rules, 1978;
The  Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules,  1982;
The   Air  (Prevention	&amp;   Control  of	 Pollution)   (Union
Territories)  Rules,  1983;   The  Environment	(Protection)
Rules, 1986;  The Hazardous Wastes (Management and Handling)
Rules,	1989;	The  Manufacture,   Storage  and  Import  of
Hazardous  Chemicals  Rules,  1989, The	 Chemical  Accidents
(Emergency  Planning, Preparedness and Response) Rules, 1996
and  hosts of other Rules and Notifications.  In addition to
these  Acts and Rules, there are, on the Statute Book, other
Acts  dealing,	in a way, with the Environmental  laws,	 for
example,   the	 <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_11">Indian	 Forest	  Act</a>,	1927;	<a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_12">The   Forest
(Conservation)	Act</a>,  1980;  The Wildlife (Protection)	Act,
1972  and the Rules framed under these Acts.  Various States
in  India have also made their Environmental laws and  rules
for  the  protection of environment.  Apart from  the  above
Statutes  and the Rules made thereunder, <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_13">Article 48A</a> of	 the
Constitution  provides	that  the State shall  endeavour  to
protect	 and  improve the environment and to  safeguard	 the
forests and wildlife of the country.  One of the fundamental
duties	of every citizen as set out in <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_14">Article 51A(g)</a> is  to
protect	 and  improve  the  natural  environment,  including
forests,  lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have  compassion
for  living  creatures.	  These	 two  Articles	have  to  be
considered  in	the light of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_15">Article 21</a> of the	Constitution
which  provides that no person shall be deprived of his life
and   liberty  except  in   accordance	with  the  procedure
established   by   law.	  Any	disturbance  of	 the   basic
environment  elements, namely air, water and soil, which are
necessary  for	"life", would be hazardous to "life"  within
the  meaning  of  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_16">Article 21</a> of the  Constitution.   In	 the
matter	of  enforcement	 of rights under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_17">Article 21</a>  of	 the
Constitution,  this Court, besides enforcing the  provisions
of  the	 Acts  referred to above, has also given  effect  to
Fundamental   Rights  under  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_18">Article  14</a>   and	<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_19">21</a>  of	 the
Constitution  and has held that if those rights are violated
by disturbing the environment, it can award damages not only
for  the restoration of the ecological balance, but also for
the  victims who have suffered due to that disturbance.	  In
order	to  protect  the  "life",   in	order	to   protect
"environment"  and in order to protect "air, water and soil"
from  pollution,  this Court, through its various  judgments
has  given  effect to the rights available, to the  citizens
and  persons  alike, under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_20">Article 21</a> of  the  Constitution.
The   judgment	for  removal  of  hazardous  and   obnoxious
industries  from  the residential areas, the directions	 for
closure	 of certain hazardous industries, the directions for
closure	 of slaughter-house and its relocation, the  various
directions  issued  for the protection of the Ridge area  in
Delhi,	the  directions	 for setting up	 effluent  treatment
plants to the Industries located in Delhi, the directions to
Tanneries  etc.,  are  all judgments which seek	 to  protect
environment.   In  the matter of enforcement of	 Fundamental
Rights under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_21">Article 21</a>, under Public Law domain, the Court,
in   exercise  of  its	powers	 under	<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_22">Article	 32</a>  of	 the
Constitution,  has  awarded damages against those  who	have
been  responsible  for	disturbing  the	 ecological  balance
either by running the industries or any other activity which
has the effect of causing pollution in the environment.	 The
Court  while  awarding damages also enforces  the  "POLLUTER
PAYS  PRINCIPLE"  which	 is widely accepted as	a  means  of
paying	for  the cost of pollution and control.	 To  put  in
other  words,  the  wrongdoer,	the polluter,  is  under  an
obligation   to	 make  good  the   damage  caused   to	 the
environment.   The recognition of the vice of pollution	 and
its impact on future resources was realised during the early
part  of  1970.	 The United Nations Economic Commission	 for
Europe,	 during	 a panel discussion in 1971, concluded	that
the total environmental expenditure required for improvement
of the environment was overestimated but could be reduced by
increased environmental awareness and control.	In 1972, the
Organisation   for  Economic   Cooperation  and	 Development
adopted	 the  "POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE" as  a  recommendable
method	for  pollution cost allocation.	 This principle	 was
also  discussed during the 1972 Paris Summit.  In 1974,	 the
European  Community  recommended  the	application  of	 the
principle  by its member States so that the costs associated
with  environmental  protection	 against  pollution  may  be
allocated  according  to uniform principles  throughout	 the
Community.    In  1989,	 the   Organisation   for   Economic
Cooperation  and Development reaffirmed its use and extended
its  application  to include costs of accidental  pollution.
In  1987,  the	principle  was	acknowledged  as  a  binding
principle  of  law  as	it   was  incorporated	in  European
Community  Law through the enactment of the Single  European
Act,  1987.   <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_23">Article 130r.2</a> of the 1992  Maastricht  Treaty
provides  that Community Environment Policy "shall be  based
on  the	 principle that the polluter should pay."  "POLLUTER
PAYS  PRINCIPLE"  has  also been applied by  this  Court  in
various	 decisions.   In  Indian Council  for  <a href="/doc/1818014/" id="a_24">Enviro  Legal
Action	vs.  Union of India</a>, AIR 1996 SC 1446 = 1996 (2) SCR
503  =	(1996) 3 SCC 212 = JT 1996 (2) SC 196, it  was	held
that  once  the	 activity  carried   on	 was  hazardous	  or
inherently  dangerous, the person carrying on that  activity
was  liable to make good the loss caused to any other person
by  that  activity.   This principle was  also	followed  in
<a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_25">Vellore	 Citizens Welfare Forum vs.  Union of India &amp;  Ors</a>.,
AIR  1996  SC  2715 = (1996) 5 SCC 647= JT 1996 (7)  SC	 375
which  has  also been discussed in the present case  in	 the
main  judgment.	  It was for this reason that the Motel	 was
directed  to  pay  compensation	 by  way  of  cost  for	 the
restitution  of the environment ecology of the area.  But it
is the further direction why pollution fine, in addition, be
not  imposed  which  is the subject matter  of	the  present
discussion.   Chapter  VII  of	the  Water  (Prevention	 and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_26">Control	 of  Pollution)	 Act</a>, 1974 contains  the  provisions
dealing with penalties and procedure.  This Chapter consists
of <a href="/doc/185463094/" id="a_27">Sections 41</a> to <a href="/doc/120172455/" id="a_28">50</a>.  Sub-section (2) and (3) of <a href="/doc/185463094/" id="a_29">Section 41</a>
provide for the punishment and imposition of fine.  They are
quoted	below:-	 "41.(2)  Whoever fails to comply  with	 any
order  issued under clause (e) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/29853635/" id="a_30">Section
32</a>  or any direction issued by a Court under sub-section (2)
of  <a href="/doc/96367367/" id="a_31">Section  33</a> or any direction issued under  <a href="/doc/81392085/" id="a_32">Section	33A</a>,
shall  in  respect  of each failure and	 on  conviction,  be
punishable  with imprisonment for a term which shall not  be
less  than  one year and six months but which may extend  to
six  years and fine, and in case the failure continues, with

This  Chapter  consists	 of <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_52">Sections 37</a> to <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_53">46</a>.	 <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_54">Section  37</a>
provides penalties for failure to comply with the provisions
of  <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_55">Section  21</a> or <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_56">Section 22</a> or with the directions  issued
under  <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_57">Section	31A</a>.  It provides that the person  shall  be
punishable  with imprisonment for a term which shall not  be
less  than  one year and six months but which may extend  to
six  years and with fine, and in case the failure continues,
with  an  additional fine which may extend to five  thousand
rupees	for  every  day.  Sub-section (2)  of  this  Section
provides  that if the failure continues beyond the period of
one year after the date of conviction, the offender shall be
punishable  with imprisonment for a term which shall not  be
less  than two years but which may extend to seven years and
with  fine.  <a href="/doc/159581089/" id="a_58">Section 38</a> also provides penalties for  certain
acts  and it provides that for such acts as are referred  to
in  that  Section,  a  person	shall  be  punishable	with
imprisonment  for a term which may extend to three months or
with  fine  which may extend to ten thousand rupees or	with
both.	<a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_59">Section 39</a> contemplates penalty for contravention of
certain	  provisions  of  the  Act   and  it  provides	 for
imprisonment  for a term which may extend to three months or
with  fine  which may extend to ten thousand rupees or	with
both,  and in the case of continuing contravention, with  an
additional fine which may extend to five thousand rupees for
every  day  during which such contravention continues  after
conviction  for	 the first such contravention.	 <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_60">Section  40</a>
speaks	of offences by Companies while <a href="/doc/185463094/" id="a_61">Section 41</a> speaks  of
offences  by  Government Departments.  All the	three  Acts,
referred  to  above,  also  contemplate the  taking  of	 the
cognizance  of	the offences by the Court.  Thus,  a  person
guilty	of  contravention of provisions of any of the  three
Acts  which constitutes an offence has to be prosecuted	 for
such  offence  and in case the offence is found proved	then
alone he can be punished with imprisonment and fine or both.
The  sine qua non for punishment of imprisonment and fine is
a  fair	 trial	in  a competent court.	 The  punishment  of
imprisonment or fine can be imposed only after the person is
found  guilty.	 In  the instant case, a  finding  has	been
recorded that M/s Span Motel had interfered with the natural
flow of river and thus disturbed the environment and ecology
of  the area.  It has been held liable to pay damages.	 The
quantum of damages is under the process of being determined.
The  Court directed a notice to be issued to show cause	 why
pollution  fine be not imposed.	 In view of the above, it is
difficult  for	us  to hold that the pollution fine  can  be
imposed	 upon  M/s Span Motel without there being any  trial
and  without there being any finding that M/s Span Motel was
guilty	of  the	 offence under the Act and  are,  therefore,
liable	to be punished with imprisonment or with FINE.	This
notice has been issued without reference to any provision of
the  Act.  The contention that the notice should be  treated
to  have been issued in exercise of power under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_62">Article	 142</a>
of  the	 Constitution  cannot be accepted  as  this  Article
cannot be pressed into aid in a situation where action under
that  Article would amount to contravention of the  specific
provisions  of the Act itself.	A fine is to be imposed upon
the  person who is found guilty of having contravened any of
the  provisions	 of  the Act.  He has to be  tried  for	 the
specific  offence and then on being found guilty, he may  be
punished  either  by sentencing him to undergo	imprisonment
for  the period contemplated by the Act or with fine or with
both.	But  recourse  cannot  be taken to  <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_63">Article  142</a>  to
inflict	 upon him this punishment.  The scope of <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_64">Article 142</a>
was  considered in several decisions and recently in Supreme
Court  <a href="/doc/82617574/" id="a_65">Bar Association vs.  Union of India</a>, AIR 1998 SC 1895
=  (1998) 4 SCC 409, by which the decision of this Court  in
V.C.  Mishra, Re, (1995) 2 SCC 584, was partly overruled, it
was  held that the plenary power of this Court under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_66">Article
142</a>  of	 the Constitution are inherent in the Court and	 are
"COMPLEMENTARY"	 to  those  powers  which  are	specifically
conferred  on  the  Court by various statutes.	 This  power
exists	as a separate and independent basis of	jurisdiction
apart  from  the statutes.  The Court further observed	that
though	the powers conferred on the Court by <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_67">Article 142</a> are
curative in nature, they cannot be construed as powers which
authorise  the	Court to ignore the substantive rights of  a
litigant.  The Court further observed that this power cannot
be used to "supplant" substantive law applicable to the case
or  cause  under consideration of the Court.   <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_68">Article	142</a>,
even  with  the	 width of its amplitude, cannot be  used  to
build  a new edifice where none existed earlier, by ignoring
express	 statutory  provisions	dealing with a	subject	 and
thereby	 achieve  something  indirectly	  which	 cannot	  be
achieved  directly.  Similarly, in M.S.	 Ahlawat vs.   Union
of  India &amp; Anr., AIR 2000 SC 168 = (2000) 1 SCC 278, it was
held that under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_69">Article 142</a> of the Constitution, the Supreme
Court cannot altogether ignore the substantive provisions of
a  statute and pass orders concerning an issue which can  be
settled	 only  through	a mechanism  prescribed	 in  another
statute.   Thus, in addition to the damages which have to be
paid by M/s Span Motel, as directed in the main Judgment, it
cannot	be  punished with fine unless the  entire  procedure
prescribed  under the Act is followed and M/s Span Motel are
tried for any of the offences contemplated by the Act and is
found  guilty.	 The  notice issued to M/s  Span  Motel	 why
pollution  fine	 be  not imposed upon  them  is,  therefore,
withdrawn.   But the matter does not end here.	Pollution is
a  civil wrong.	 By its very nature, it is a Tort  committed
against	 the community as a whole.  A person, therefore, who
is   guilty  of	 causing  pollution   has  to  pay   damages
(compensation)	for  restoration  of   the  environment	 and
ecology.   He  has  also to pay damages to  those  who	have
suffered  loss	on account of the act of the offender.	 The
powers of this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_70">Article 32</a> are not restricted and
it can award damages in a PIL or a Writ Petition as has been
held  in  a  series of decisions.  In  addition	 to  damages
aforesaid,  the person guilty of causing pollution can	also
be  held liable to pay exemplary damages so that it may	 act
as  a  deterrent  for others not to cause pollution  in	 any
manner.	 Unfortunately, notice for exmeplary damages was not
issued	to  M/s	 Span Motel although it ought to  have	been
issued.	  The considerations for which "fine" can be imposed
upon  a person guilty of committing an offence are different
from  those  on the basis of which exemplary damages can  be
awarded.   While  withdrawing  the  notice  for	 payment  of
pollution  fine,  we direct a fresh notice be issued to	 M/s
Span  Motel  to	 show  cause why  in  addition	to  damages,
exemplary  damages  be not awarded for having committed	 the
acts set out and detailed in the main judgment.	 This notice
shall  be returnable within six weeks.	This question  shall
be  heard at the time of quantification of damages under the
main judgment.
