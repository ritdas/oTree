appellant and the Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer

challenging  the letters dated December 10, 2003 and September 23, 


2004     addressed   to   the   Madhya   Pradesh   State   Government   and 


letter   dated   November   4,   2004   addressed   to   the   respondent   that

impleaded as respondent - 1 and respondent - 2 respectively.  In its 


counter affidavit in opposition to the writ petition,  the appellant set up 


the case  that there was no provision for pension under the 1986 Act 


or the Madhya Pradesh Consumer Protection Rules, 1987 (for short, 


`State   Rules')   for   payment   of   pension   to   the   President,   State 


Commission. Relying  upon the decision of this Court in the case of 


<a href="/doc/644623/" id="a_2">Justice   P.   Venugopal  v.  Union   of   India   and   Others1</a>,  the   appellant 


stated before the High Court  that the respondent was not entitled to 


clubbing   of   the   two   services.       The   appellant   said   that   if   the   State 


Government intended to grant pension to the petitioner (respondent 


herein)   for   the   service   rendered   by   him     as     President,   State 


Commission   then   requisite   statutory   rule   would   have   to   be   framed 


and duly ratified by the State Legislature as required under <a href="/doc/810562/" id="a_3">Section 


30(2)</a>   of   the   1986   Act.   The   State     Rules   framed   by   the   State 


Government do  not have any provision for payment of pension.

consideration of the matter, vide its judgment dated February 8, 2005 


allowed   the   writ   petition   filed   by   the   present   respondent.   The   High 


Court   held   that   by     office   order   dated   April   5,   2002,     the   State 


Government   had   passed   an   order   that   the   service   rendered   by  the

would   be     counted   as   pensionable   service.   The   High   Court, 


accordingly, did not accept the view of the appellant   and directed it 


to finalize the pension of the petitioner (respondent herein) and make 


payment of pension and other admissible dues within a period of two 


months.

counsel   submitted   that   appeal   was   maintainable   at   the   instance   of 


appellant.     According   to   him,   the   appellant,     Accountant   General, 


Madhya Pradesh, is one of the arms of the Comptroller and Auditor 


General -- a constitutional functionary - which monitors and controls 


all activities connected with audit, accounts and entitlement functions 


of   the   Indian   Audit   and   Accounts   Department.   He   submitted     that 


authorizing pension was the function of the appellant. In this regard, 


he referred to material titled   `Supreme Audit Institution of India - A 


Brief Introduction'  to show  that there are 29 offices of the Accounts 


and   Entitlements   (A&amp;E)   headed   by   Accountants   General   (A   &amp;   E) 


engaged   in   maintaining     accounts   of   the   State   Governments   and 


authorizing GPF and pension payments of their employees. Learned 


senior counsel submitted that for maintaining the appeal under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_25">Article 


136</a>  of  the  Constitution  before  this  Court,  it  was  not  necessary that 


the   appellant   must   be   an   `aggrieved   person'.   In   any   case,     the 


appellant was impleaded as respondent 1 in the writ petition   and it 


was   the   appellant's   action   that   was   challenged   in   the   writ   petition 


before the High Court and, therefore, the appeal was maintainable.

this   Court   in   the   case   of  Justice   P.   Venugopal.   The   question   for 


consideration   in   that   matter   was   as   to   whether   the   period   during 


which Justice P. Venugopal  served as the Commission of Inquiry or 


as   the   Commissioner   of   Payments   under   the   Madras   Race   Club 


(Acquisition  and  <a href="/doc/984780/" id="a_26">Transfer   of  Undertaking)  Act</a>,   1986  could  be  taken 


into consideration for computing the pensionary benefits. This Court, 


while   dealing   with   the   above   question,     referred   to   constitutional 


provisions,   namely,   Articles     112(3)(d)(iii),   217(1),     221   and   224A, 


the provisions contained in the 1954 Act, particularly, <a href="/doc/864814/" id="a_27">Sections 14</a>, <a href="/doc/1482290/" id="a_28">15</a>

          benefits   only   in   terms   of   the   said   Act   and   not 

          otherwise.   The   said   Act   is   a   self-contained   code.   It 

          does not contemplate grant of pension to a retired High 

          Court   Judge   for   holding   any   other   office   of   profit. 

          Clubbing of services for the purpose of computation of

          thus,   the   court   cannot   by   process   of   interpretation   of 

          statutory or constitutional provisions hold so."

          different services of the petitioner could not have been

          payable  to a High Court Judge would  be only for the 

          period rendered in that capacity which would constitute 

          charge to the Consolidated Fund of India and services 

          rendered   subsequent   thereto   in   terms   of   the   order 

          made by a State Government would not be charged to 

          the   Consolidated   Fund.   The   question   as   to   whether 

          such   a   person   would   be   entitled   to   pension   from   the 

          State concerned or not would depend upon the statute 

          or the terms and conditions of appointment."




</blockquote><p id="p_37">21.                  In view of the above legal position, there is no doubt 


that   for   the   purposes   of   computation   of   pension   payable   to   the 


respondent his different services, namely, service as a Judge of the 


High Court and service as President, State Commission cannot   be 


clubbed. The respondent is entitled to pension as a High Court Judge 


only for the period rendered by him in that capacity. The subsequent 


service rendered by him as President, State Commission cannot be 


charged   to   the   Consolidated   Fund   of   India.     This   position   was   not 


disputed   by   the   respondent   in   the   High   Court     nor   it   is   disputed 


before   me.   The   question   is,       whether     respondent   is   entitled   to

by him as President of the State Commission of that State.

          5th April, 2002 that service rendered by him as President

conferred   by   sub-section   (2)   of   <a href="/doc/984780/" id="a_32">Section   30</a>   of   the   1986   Act   has

any  provision in making the service of the President and Members of

silent in this regard. The moot question that falls for determination in 


this   appeal   is,     whether    in   the   absence   of   any  express   rule   in   the 


State   Rules,   was   it   open   to   the     State   Government   of   Madhya

the   State   Commission   would   be   counted   as   pensionable   service. 


The   incidental   question   is   whether     such   order   is   inconsistent   with

which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws.   This is 


what is provided in <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_49">Article 162</a> of the Constitution.  In other words, the

selection   grade   posts   the   Government   cannot   issue   administrative

this Court in Lalit Mohan Deb10  (para 9; pg. 867) said :

terms   and   conditions   of   service   of   the   members   of   the   State

intent   of   `may'   being   directory   and   the   expression   `as   may   be

         scope   for   some   play  for   the   workability   of  the  provision   under 

         the law.  The meaning of the word  "as" takes colour in context 

         with which it is used and the manner of its use as prefix or suffix 

         etc. There is no rigidity about it and it may have the meaning of 

         a   situation   of   being   in   existence   during   a   particular   time   or 

         contingent, and so on and so forth. That is to say, something to 

         happen in a manner, if such a manner is in being or exists, if it 

         does   not,   it   may   not   happen   in   that   manner.   Therefore,   the 

         reading of the provision under consideration makes it clear that 

         manner of declaration is to be followed "as may be prescribed" 

         i.e. "if any" prescribed."

difference in the legal position in a case where power conferred on 


the State Government for framing rules has been exercised but such 


rules remain silent on certain aspects although it had power to make 


rules with regard to those aspects and in the situation where no rules 


have been framed in exercise of the     power conferred on it, insofar 


as executive power of the State is concerned.  The power that vests 


in the State Government in <a href="/doc/40836587/" id="a_63">Section 30(2)</a> to carry out the provisions 


contained in <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_64">Section 16(2)</a> does not take away its executive power to

constitutional provisions or statutory provision in <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_66">Section 16(2)</a> or the

procedure:   (ii)   laying   subject   to   negative   resolution:   and   (iii)   laying

</p><p id="p_106">4.                  The   first   respondent   herein,   retired   as   a   Judge 


from the Madhya Pradesh High Court on 13.8.1998 after putting 


in   a   service   of   more   than   ten   years.   He   was   appointed   as   the 


President   of   the   State   Commission   after   a   short   gap   on 


21.9.1998   vide   Government   notification   dated   18.9.1998. 


Thereafter, he worked for a period of four years, ten months and 


twenty   two   days   as   the   President,   and   demitted   that   office   on 


12.8.2003.

payable to, and the other terms and conditions of service of the 


members of the State Commission (which include the President) 


are governed under the above Act.  The terms and conditions of 


appointment of the first respondent were determined under the 


Government's   letter/order   dated   26.5/3.6.1999,   which   included 


the following terms:-

<p id="p_109">

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">       (ii)       During the period of appointment he shall get pay 

       equal   to   the   pay   payable   to   Judge   of   High   Court   after 

       deducting the pension.   The relief on pension shall not be 

       payable   to   him   in   terms   of   Finance   Department   Office 

       Memorandum No. E-4-Char-79-Ni-5-84 dated 20.10.1984.

</p><p id="p_111">                     Thus, it was clear that during this period he was 


to   receive   a   pay   equal   to   his   pay   as   a   High   Court   Judge   after 


deducting the amount of pension for the services rendered as a 


High court Judge. The relief on pension was also not payable to 


him.     The   allowances   and   other   perquisites   were   to   be   made 


available   to   him   at   par   with  a   Judge   of   a   High   Court.     Thus,   it 


was an appointment for a tenure with specific terms which did

he submitted his pension papers to the office of the appellant on

this   letter   that   according   to   the   pension   calculation   sheet 


submitted on behalf of the first respondent, the pension of first 


respondent   had   been   revised   by   adding   his   service   as   the 


President to the service rendered by him as a High Court Judge, 


and   the   same   was  not   in   accordance   with  law.     It   was  pointed 


out that there was no provision in the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_83">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 


1986 about the admissibility of pension. Besides, a clarification 


was sought on the following three points:-

referred   to   the   Central   Ministry   of   Law   and   Justice   which   had 


replied   by   their   letter   dated   9.9.2002,   alongwith   a   copy   of   the

period undergone as a High Court Judge cannot be clubbed with 


an additional period to refix the pension.   The same position is 


reiterated   by   the   appellant   in   his   subsequent   letter   dated

petition to the Madhya Pradesh High Court (W.P. No.13302/2004) 


which has allowed that petition by the impugned judgment and 


order   dated   8.2.2005.   The   High   Court   has   noted   that   this 


additional liability is being undertaken by the State Government, 


and it is not be drawn from the Consolidated Fund of India, and 


that it is not to exceed the maximum pension payable to a High 


Court Judge and therefore would be valid.

</p><p id="p_133">10.                 The learned counsel for the first respondent Mr. 


Amrendra   Sharan   raised   an   objection   to   the   maintainability   of 


the   appeal   at   the   instance   of   the   appellant.     It   was   contended 


that   since   his   decision   was   challenged,   the   appellant   is   not 


expected to agitate it further.   In this connection, we must note 


that the appellant was joined as the first respondent in the Writ 


Petition in the High Court.  He is in charge of the accounts in the 


State   and   represents   the   Comptroller   and   Auditor   General   of 


India,   who   is   a   Constitutional   Functionary.   The   payment   of 


pension and its supervision is a part of his responsibility.    His 


letters/orders were challenged in the writ petition, and if it was 


his view that the decision of the High Court was erroneous, we 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                        35</span>


do not see any reason as to why he should not be held eligible 


to challenge the decision. He is an administrative authority and 


his decision was approved by the Ministry of Law and Justice. 


Such   petitions   have   been   filed   by   the   Accountant   Generals   in 


the past also. [For reference in the case of Accountant General 


of   Orissa   Vs.   R.   Ramamurthy   reported   in   2006   (12)   SCC   557.] 


Hence we do not find any substance in this objection.

Senior Counsel for the appellant has been that the appellant is 


required   to   read   and   implement   these   provisions   as   they   are. 


The   section   clearly   provides   that   the   terms   and   conditions   of 


service of the member (including President of the Commission) 


will   be   as   prescribed   by   the   State   Government.     `Prescribed' 


means as laid down in the rules.  <a href="/doc/511716/" id="a_90">Section 31</a> of the Act requires 


that these rules are to be laid before the legislature.   Since the 


rules   do   not   provide   for   pension,   one   cannot   incorporate   any 


such  concept  in  the  service  conditions   of the first respondent. 


Mr. Mariarputham, relied upon the judgment of this Court in the 


case   of   State   of   Uttar   Pradesh   Vs.   Singhara   Singh   reported   in 


AIR   1964   SC   358,   and   particularly   first   part   of   paragraph   8

       sound   principle.     Its   result   is   that   if   a   statute   has

       necessarily   prohibits   the   doing   of   the   act   in   any 

       other   manner   than   that  which   has   been   prescribed. 

       The principle behind the rule is that if this were not

learned Senior Counsel appearing for the first respondent, that 


in  the present  case the  rules  are silent  about the  provision for

cannot on its own grant pension by issuing an executive order 


under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_91">Article 162</a> of the Constitution of India.  He relied upon the 


judgment   of   this   Court   in   Sant   Ram   Sharma   Vs.   State   of 


Rajasthan reported in AIR 1967 SC 1910 in this behalf.   A strong

case of Orissa State (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Board 


Vs. Orient Paper Mills reported in 2003 (10) SCC 421, particularly 


paragraph   12   thereof,   to   explain   the   phrase   `as   may   be

provisions of <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_94">Section 16</a> (2) of the act.   The State has therefore 


to exercise its executive power subject to and as limited by this

means prescribed by the rules, it is implied that these rules shall 


be of general application.  If pension is to be covered under the 


concept of terms and condition of service under <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_95">Section 16</a> (2), 


there   has   to   be   a   general   rule   concerning   the   same.     Pension 


denotes   a   periodical   payment   to   be   made   available   to   the 


employee after his retirement, after long years of service which 


are governed by the relevant rules [Ref. Pepsu Road Transport 


Corporation, Patiala Vs. Mangal Singh reported in 2011 (11) SCC 


702].  In the instant case, there are general rules laying down the 


terms   and   conditions   framed   under   the   concerned   statute   but 


they do not make any provision for pension.  As far as the grant 


of pension is concerned, in his first letter dated 10.12.2003, the 


appellant raised the issue with respect to the rate at which the 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                       41</span>


pension is to be calculated.  Mr. Mariarputham, submitted that if 


the   service  in   the   consumer   commission   is   not   to   be   clubbed, 


and even if the State Government is to bear the responsibility, it 


will also have to be provided as to how many years of service in 


the commission will qualify for pension. It is not enough merely 


to   provide   that   the   two   pensions   combined   together   shall   not 


exceed   the   maximum   of   the   pension   prescribed   for   Judges   of 


the Hon'ble High Court. These issues can be dealt with if rules 


are made and not otherwise.

making   rules   in   this   behalf   specifically   for   this   purpose.     A 


provision for pension has thus been made when the legislature 


so   wanted   it,   as   can   be   seen   in   the   case   of   Central

clubbing   of   additional   services,   if   any,   for   the   purpose   of

calculations tendered by the first respondent it is very clear that 


he was clubbing his service as a High Court Judge and as the 


President of the State Commission, to claim the pension, though 


not   exceeding   the   maximum   of   the   pension   prescribed   for

to   whether  a   Judge   rendering   services   subsequently   would  be 


entitled to pension from the State will depend upon the statute

our understanding the provisions of the statute and the rules in 


the present case are clear, and therefore the appellant could not 


be faulted for raising the queries with respect to the claim of the

with   the   said   Board   by   issuing   a   notification   in   the   official

sub-section (2) thereof that the rules may provide for the manner

notifications issued under <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_101">Section 19</a> would be bad.   This court 


negated   this   argument.     The   observations   of   this   court 


concerning  the term `prescribed'  will have  to be  looked  in that

administrative   practice   bordering   on   to   a   rule   of   effecting 


promotions based on merit, and not merely on seniority, and the 


appellant had also been considered for selection.   It was in this

is   whether   such   a   provision   can   be   brought   in   through   an 


executive   order   for   the   benefit   of   an   individual.     In   the   instant

the   Act   read   with   <a href="/doc/40836587/" id="a_105">Section   30</a>   (2)   of   the   Act.     The   rules   do   not

Union Parliament or the State Legislature is to be kept informed 


about the rules. This is because it concerns the public finance

       "the   intention   of   the   Legislature   is   primarily   to   be

Prasad reported in 2007 (7) SCC 140 to the following effect:-





</p><blockquote id="blockquote_67">       "........ It needs little emphasis that the Rules are meant 

       to   be   and   have   to   be   complied   with   and   enforced 

       scrupulously.     Waiver   or   even   relaxation   of   any   rule, 

       unless such power exists under the rules, is bound to 

       provide   scope   for   discrimination,   arbitrariness   and 

       favouritism, which is totally opposed to the rule of law 

       and  our  constitutional   values.   It  goes  without  saying 

       that   even   an   executive   order   is   required   to   be   made 

       strictly in consonance with the rules.  Therefore, when 

       an   executive   order   is   called   in   question,   while 

       exercising   the   power   of   judicial   review   the   Court   is 

       required to see whether the Government has departed 

       from   such   rules   and   if   so,   the   action,   of   the 

       Government is liable to be struck down."

</blockquote><p id="p_168">The   question   is   with   respect   to   payability   of   pension   for   the 


service as the President of the State Commission. It is a matter 


concerning public finance, and such a grant cannot be made at 


the   instance   of   the   State   Government   when   the   rules   do   not 


prescribe   the   same.     In   the   instant   case   the   order   according 


sanction to pension does not prescribe any period for eligibility 


nor   any   rate   at   which   the   pension   is   to   be   paid.   This   is   apart 


from the fact that as seen from the Calculation Sheet tendered 


by the first respondent, the subsequent period of his service as 


the   President   of   the   State   Commission   was   sought   to   be

clubbed   with   the   period   of   his   service   as   a   High   Court   Judge, 


which   is   impermissible.   Such   an   order   for   the   benefit   of   an 


individual   cannot   be   considered   to   be   a   valid   one.     Any   such 


exception being made by exercising executive power would be 


violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_109">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. 





</p><p id="p_169">25.                  In the circumstances the appeal deserves to be

High   Court   is   required   to   be   set-aside.     Accordingly,   this   Civil 


Appeal   is   allowed,   the   judgment   and   order   of   the   High   Court 


dated   8.2.2005   in   Writ   Petition   No.13302/2004   is   hereby   set-

inclined to hold  in  favour of  the respondent No.1,  the payment 


made   so   far   should   not   be   recovered.     He   relied   upon   the 


judgment   of   this   Court   in   the   case   of   Yogeshwar   Prasad   Vs. 


National Institute of Education Planning and Admn. reported in 


2010   (14)   SCC   323   wherein   this   court   held   in   the   facts   of   that 


case   the   grant   of   higher   pay   scales   should   not   be   recovered 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                         51</span>


unless   it   was   a   case   of   misrepresentation   or   fraud.     This 


judgment   in   turn   referred   to   an   earlier   judgment   in   Sahib   Ram 


Vs. State of Haryana reported in 1995 Supp. (1) SCC 18.   In that 


matter the appellant was held to be not entitled to a salary in the 


revised scale.  However, since the higher pay scale was given to 


him   due   to   wrong   construction   of   the   relevant   order   by   the 


authority   concerned   and   not   on   account   of   any 


misrepresentation by the employee, the amount paid till the date 


of   order   was   directed   not   to   be   recovered.     When   this   appeal 


was admitted, stay as prayed by the appellant was declined, but 


it   was   made   clear   that   the   payment   made   by   the   appellant 


pursuant to the judgment of the High Court will be subject to the 


decision   of   appeal.     Mr.   Mariarputham,   learned   counsel   for   the 


appellant   submitted   that   the   appeal   is   canvassed   basically   in 


view   of   the   principle   involved.       In   view   thereof,   although   the 


appeal   is   allowed,   the   additional   pension   paid   to   the   first 


respondent as the President of the State Commission till the end 


of   February   2012,   will   not   be   recovered   from   him.     However, 


from March, 2012 onwards the first respondent shall be entitled 


to   receive   pension   only   for   the   service   rendered   by   him   as   a 


High Court Judge.
