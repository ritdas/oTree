                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        These writ petitions are filed impugning the order

dated    29.6.2018,   passed        by    the   Additional    Chief

Secretary,     Department      of        Forest,   Ecology        and

Environment,      respondent        No.     2   (referred    to    as

'Impugned Order dated 29.6.2018') reviewing the

earlier    order   dated    21.12.2015   published   in   the

Karnataka Gazette bearing No. 1768, Part IV-A dated

30.12.2015 (referred to as, 'Notified order dated

21.12.2015'). Though all the petitioners have called in

question the Impugned Order dated 29.6.2018, and as

such their grievances are similar, they are differently

placed as regards the impact of the Impugned Order

dated 29.6.2018 on their respective rights.


</p><p id="p_2">      2.    The petitioner in WP No. 29328/2018 is a

lessee of an area measuring 10.53 hectares in survey

No.        130     (Part)     of    Honnebagi        Village,

Chikkanayakanahalli Taluk, Tumkur District. The lease

granted in favour of the petitioner is renewed under a

registered Mining Lease Deed for a period of 20 years

from 30.12.2003 to 29.12.2023. The petitioner has

obtained the consent for operation from the Karnataka

State Pollution Control Board under Water (Prevention

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              14</span>




and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 - valid until

30.6.2021.      The    petitioner    has      approached    the

Monitoring    Committee,    Department         of   Mines   and

Geology by filing application dated 4.3.2016, for Work

Permission to resume and recommence the mining

operations in the aforesaid land.          The petitioner has

asserted that the aforementioned land is a Government

class 'C' and 'D' land, and not a 'forest land'.


</p><p id="p_3">      3.   The petitioner, filed writ petition in W.P. No.

12737/2017, seeking directions to the Monitoring

Committee, Department of Mines and Geology, to

consider the petitioner's application dated 4.3.2016 for

Work Permission. The petitioner relied upon the Notified

order dated 21.12.2015.           The then Additional Chief

Secretary,    Department     of     Forest,     Ecology     and

Environment, Government of Karnataka, vide this

Notified Order dated 21.12.2015 had concluded that the

State Government, as part of its policy, had issued
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                15</span>




different orders/circulars/proceedings for (i) retransfer

of all 'C' and 'D' class lands (except those that were

already    notified    as   'Reserve    Forest')    from     Forest

Department to the Revenue Department, (ii) clarifying

that as of 3.1.1991 that the status of 'C' and 'D' class

lands     stood       resumed/vested       in      the     Revenue

Department, and therefore all 'C' and 'D' class lands

transferred to the Forest Department stand resumed to

the Revenue Department as on 3.1.1991 with the sole

exception of 'C' and 'D' class lands which as of 3.1.1991

were notified by the Forest Department as 'Reserve

Forest' under the provisions of the Karnataka Forest

Act/Rules and that the Forest Department cease to have

control over these lands.

<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">        4. A Co-ordinate Bench of this Court was pleased

to dispose of the writ petition in WP No. 12737/2017

directing the concerned authorities to inform, within a

period of     four    weeks,   the     Monitoring        Committee,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            16</span>




Department of Mines and Geology as to the status of the

petitioner's aforementioned land. The petitioner filed a

contempt petition in CCC No. 875/2017 complaining of

deliberate and willful disobedience of the directions

issued by the Coordinate Bench of this Court in W.P.

No. 12737/2017. The then Additional Chief Secretary,

Department of Forest, Ecology and Environment filed an

affidavit, in response to the statements made in the

contempt petition in CCC No. 875/2017, inter-alia

stating that vide the Communication dated 22.8.2017,

he had reported to the Monitoring Committee in

compliance with the directions issued in the writ

petition in WP No. 12737/2017.       This Report dated

22.8.2017 was also enclosed. The then Additional Chief

Secretary stated in this Report that the Law Department

of the Government of Karnataka had opined that the

Notified Order dated 21.12.2015 was valid, and the then

Additional Chief Secretary had not violated any law in

passing such Notified Order dated 21.12.2015.       The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                            17</span>




contempt proceedings in CCC No. 875/2017 was closed

in view of the Report dated 22.8.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     5. When the Monitoring Committee, Department

of Mines and Geology did not consider the petitioner's

application for issuance of Work Permission despite the

Report    dated   22.8.2017,    the   petitioner    filed   an

application namely, IA No.37377/2018 in            WP (C) No.

562/2009 before the Hon'ble Supreme Court seeking

directions to the Monitoring Committee, Department of

Mines and Geology to permit the petitioner to resume

mining    operations.   This    application    is    pending

consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.


</p><p id="p_8">     6.    Meanwhile, the petitioner learnt that the

Notified Order dated 21.12.2015 was reviewed by the

Additional Chief Secretary - respondent No. 2 holding

that the Notified Order dated 21.12.2015 was issued (a)

usurping the powers of the Forest Settlement Officer

under the Karnataka Forest Act, 1963, (b) the Central
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                             18</span>




Empowered Committee was of the opinion that it would

be in contempt of the orders passed by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court on IA No. 212/2014 in Writ Petition

(Civil) No. 562/2009, (c) was passed by a 'non-existent

court', and (d) in violation of the provisions of the

Karnataka Forest Act, 1963, the Karnataka Forest Rules

1969 and the Karnataka Government (Transaction of

Business) Rules 1977.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">     7. The petitioners in WP No. 29336-29362/2018,

who are twenty seven in number, have asserted that

they have been in peaceful cultivation of their respective

lands in Honnebagi Village and other villages, of

Chikkanayakanahalli Taluk, Tumkur District. The State

Government has granted these respective lands to them

under the provisions of the Karnataka Land Grant

Rules. They have also been issued with Saguvali Chits -

title deeds- either in their favour, or in favour of their

predecessor-in-title (their ancestors). The lands granted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                               19</span>




to them in these villages are 'C' and 'D' class lands. The

Government    had    issued    Government     Order    dated

3.1.1991 re-transferring all 'C' and 'D' class lands to the

Revenue Department when it was informed that several

acres of lands, which were classified as 'C' and 'D'

lands, were indiscriminately transferred to the Forest

Department for afforestation /social forestry purposes.

The   Government     had   also    issued   Circular   dated

17.9.1991 clarifying that all 'C' and 'D' class lands,

which were not already notified as 'Reserve Forest'

under the Karnataka Forest Act/ Rules as of 3.1.1991,

stood retransferred/resumed, and vested with the

Revenue Department.
</p>
<p id="p_11">


</p><p id="p_12">      8.    The   Forest Department, accepting         such

vesting/resumption of 'C' and 'D' class lands, requested

the State Government to hand over 323.88 hectares in

Survey Nos. 41, 42 and 43 of Janeeru Village of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                              20</span>




Chikkanayakanahalli Taluk, Tumkur District for the

purposes of afforestation.    Despite the fact that, this

extent of land was made over to the Forest Department

pursuant to its request, Notification dated 4.8.1994

(referred to as 'original Notification dated 4.8.1994)

was issued under Section 4 of the Karnataka Forest

Act,1963 declaring that it had been decided that the

aforesaid extent of 323.88 hectares of land in Janeeru

Village of Chikkanayakanahalli Taluk, Tumkur District

as   Reserve    Forest.           Further,     the       Assistant

Commissioner, Tiptur was appointed as the Forest

Settlement Officer for the purposes of enquiry under the

Karnataka Forest Act, 1963; the Divisional Forest

Officer, Tumkur District was appointed to represent the

State Government in any enquiry by the said Forest

Settlement Officer.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">     9. The Forest Settlement Officer, by Order dated

7.11.2006,   after    conducting     the     requisite    enquiry
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                  21</span>




proceedings, concluded that the extent of 323.88

hectares        of     land           in        Janeeru     village,

Chikkanayakanahalli, Taluk, Tumkur District could not

be   notified    as   'Reserve        Forest'    because    of   the

Government Order dated 3.1.1991, and the later

circulars/proceedings/orders,                   including        the

Government Order dated 7.6.1993.                  This order dated

7.11.2006 was not challenged and attained finality. As

such, the necessary declaration under <a href="/doc/737460/" id="a_4">Section 17</a> of the

Forest Act, 1963 was not issued. Even the Chief

Conservator of Forests, vide his Communication dated

15.12.2008 had also placed on record many infirmities

in the original Notification dated 4.8.1994 requesting

the Government to withdraw the said Notification.


</p><p id="p_15">      10. However, the Department of Forest, Ecology

and Environment, Government of Karnataka issued a

Corrigendum dated 4.9.2014 (published in the Official

Gazette on 5.9.2014) seeking to substitute the schedule
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                   22</span>




in the original Notification dated 4.8.1994. By virtue of

this Corrigendum dated 4.9.2014, the Department of

Forest,     Ecology      and    Environment,    Government       of

Karnataka sought to replace the lands in Janeeru

village    with    the    lands    in   Hosahalli,    Gollarahalli,

Honnebagi,        Bullenahalli,    Manchikatte,      Bagganahalli

and       Sondenahalli     of     Chikkanayakanahalli       taluk,

Tumkur District.           The petitioners, who have been

granted title to the respective lands in the villages of

Honnebagi,        Gollarahalli,    Bullenahalli,      Manchikatte

Villages of Chikkanayakanahalli Taluk, Tumkur district,

impugned the Corrigendum dated 4.9.2014 in writ

petition in W.P. No. 38290-311/2015.                   A learned

Coordinate Bench of this Court disposed of this writ

petition by order dated 14.9.2015 granting liberty to the

petitioners to make a representation to the Secretary,

Department        of   Forest,    Ecology   and      Environment,

Government of Karnataka, within a period of one

month.       This Court directed the said authority to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                               23</span>




consider such representation, if made, after giving

opportunity    of   hearing        to    the   petitioners/their

representatives, and to pass a reasoned and speaking

order. Further, the Secretary, Department of Forest,

Ecology and Environment was also directed to dispose

of the representation that the petitioners could make

within a period of two months from the date of such

representation. Similar writ petitions filed by similarly

placed other aggrieved persons, were also disposed of

with similar directions.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">      11. The then Additional Chief Secretary issued the

Notified Order dated 30.12.2015 after hearing the

petitioners,   setting   aside     the    Corrigendum     dated

4.9.2014, and the original Notification dated 4.8.1994

issued under the provisions of the Karnataka Forest Act

as invalid. This Notified Order dated 30.12.2015 was

not   challenged    by     any     person.       Therefore,   it

attained finality. But, after a lapse of more than two
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                   24</span>




years, the petitioners were served with notice of hearing

of review proceedings initiated by the State Government

for   re-examination        of    the   Notified   Order   dated

21.12.2015 purportedly on the basis of public interest

litigation as per Karnataka Forest Act, 1963.


</p><p id="p_18">      12.      The petitioners in W.P. Nos. 33051-52 &amp;

33820-822 of 2018 challenging the impugned order

dated 29.6.2018 have made similar assertions as made

by petitioners in W.P. Nos. 29336-362/2018, but assert

that they are the owners of respective lands in

Gollarahalli     village,        Chikkanayakanahalli       Taluk,

Tumkur District. These petitioners have also asserted

that their respective lands have been either granted to

them under the provisions of the Karnataka Land Grant

Rules, or their occupation is regularised by the State

Government as permissible in law.

<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">      13.   Mr. Ashok Haranahalli, the learned Senior

advocate and the other counsel for the petitioners
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                   25</span>




primarily canvassed that the impugned order is passed

without jurisdiction. Neither the provisions of the

Karnataka Forest Act, 1963, nor the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_5">General Clauses

Act</a> confer jurisdiction on the respondent - Additional

Chief Secretary to review, or re-examine, or recall the

Notified        Order   dated    21.12.2015;      that   the   then

Additional        Chief    Secretary       had    conducted     the

proceedings, as a quasi-judicial authority, acting under

the directions of a learned Coordinate Bench of this

Court      in    the    writ   petitions   in    WP   No.   38290-

38311/2015 and other similar writ petitions; that if the

State Government was aggrieved by the impugned order

dated 29.6.2018, it ought to have challenged the same

either under the provisions of the Karnataka Forest Act,

or otherwise in a manner known to law; that the

respondent no. 2 has assumed the power to review/re-

examine and recall only because of an opinion from the

learned Advocate General, and that the impugned order

is arbitrary and without application of mind.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                            26</span>




</p><p id="p_21">       14. Mr. Vasanth V. Fernandes, the learned High

Court Government Pleader, while seeking to support the

impugned order dated 29.6.2018, did not dispute that

the    State   Government       had   issued   different

orders/circulars/proceedings for resumption of 'C' and

'D' class lands to the Revenue Department from the

Forest Department; that the State Government had also

clarified that with effect from 3.1.1991 all 'C' and 'D'

class lands stood re-transferred/resumed to, and vested

with, the Revenue department except those lands

which, as of 3.1.1991, were notified as 'Reserve Forest'

under the provisions of the Karnataka Forest Act/Rules;

that    pursuant   to   such     orders/circulars   and

proceedings, all the 'C' and 'D' class lands stood

resumed to the Revenue department. He also did not

dispute that the original Notification 4.8.1994 issued

under Section 4 of the Karnataka Forest Act included

only 323.88 hectares of land in Janeeru Village,

Chikkanayakanahalli Taluk and Tumkur District. But,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                             27</span>




by Corrigendum dated 4.9.2014, the schedule to the

original Notification dated 4.8.1994 was sought to be

substituted by replacing village of Chikkanayakanahalli

taluk, Tumkur district with seven other villages of

Chikkanayakanahalli     Taluk,    Tumkur    District   as

contended by the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">     14.1        Further,   the   learned   High   Court

Government Pleader also did not dispute that the Forest

Settlement Officer, appointed for the purposes of

conducting enquiry under the Karnataka Forest Act,

had concluded vide order dated 7.11.2006 that the

original Notification dated 4.8.1994 could not have been

issued because such notification was issued in respect

of 'C' and 'D' class lands that were vested with the

Revenue department; that this order dated 7.11.2006

was not challenged.   Furthermore, he did not dispute

that the Notified Order dated 21.12.2015 was notified

after hearing the petitioners in the earlier round of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                             28</span>




litigation, who were permitted to file representations,

and that this Notified Order dated 21.12.2015 had not

been challenged.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">     14.2      Crucially,   the   learned   High    Court

Government pleader also did not dispute that the

Karnataka Forest Act provide for power of review and

that the Notified Order dated 21.12.2015 could be

challenged under the provisions of the Karnataka Forest

Act, 1963. He only sought to justify the impugned order

dated 29.6.2018 contending that, even if this order

could be said to be illegal, because another illegal order

viz., the Notified Order dated 21.12.2015 was reviewed,

this Court should not interfere with the impugned

order.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">     15.      Thus,   the   questions   that   arise   for

consideration are (a) whether the impugned order dated

29.6.2018 is invalid for want of jurisdiction, or not? (b)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                               29</span>




whether the said order deserves to be interfered with, or

not?
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">        16. It is a settled law that the power of review is a

creature of statute; such power cannot be exercised

either by a court, or quasi-judicial body, or an

administrative authority unless such power of review is

conferred under the statute.        The Hon'ble Supreme

Court in <a href="/doc/17980234/" id="a_6">Haryana State Industrial Development

Corporation Ltd. vs. Mawasi</a> [(2012) 7 SCC 200],

while    examining    the   scope   of   review   under   the

provisions of Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil

Procedure, with reference to the substantive power in

the Hon'ble Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_7">Article 137</a> of the

Constitution of India to rectify or recall its own order,

has referred to its own earlier decisions wherein it was

held, "....it will be apposite to observe that the power of

review is a creature of the statute and no court or quasi-

judicial body or administrative authority can review its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                              30</span>




own judgement or order or decision unless it is legally

empowered to do so...". Further, the Hon'ble Supreme

Court   has   reiterated   that   review   powers   can    be

exercised within the limits of the statute dealing with

the exercise of power. The mere possibility of two views

on the subject is not a ground for review.                The

jurisdiction of review can be exercised only when there

is an error apparent on the face of the record, distinct

from an error which is not self-evident and has to be

detected by a process of reasoning.        A review petition

has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be an

'appeal in disguise'.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">      17. In the present case, it is undisputed that the

respondent No. 2 has declared the Notified Order dated

21.12.2015 as invalid while re-examining the merits of

such Notified Order in exercise of powers of review. The

respondent No. 2 has tried to justify the exercise of such

power of review by placing reliance upon <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_8">Section 21</a> of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                             31</span>




the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_9">General Clauses Act</a>, 1897. However, the present lis

is as regards the Notification, and the Corrigendum

thereto, issued under the provisions of the Karnataka

Forest Act, 1963.     A learned Division Bench of this

Court called upon the Additional Chief Secretary,

Department of Forest Ecology and Environment to

adjudicate, by a speaking and reasoned order, after

hearing the petitioners, on the merit of the Corrigendum

dated 4.9.2014 issued to substitute the schedule to the

original   Notification   dated   4.8.1994   as   certain

petitioners, who were aggrieved by the issuance of such

Corrigendum, had approached this Court with their

respective writ petitions specifically contending that the

Forest Settlement Officer had concluded, way back in

the year 2006 vide order dated 7.11.2006, that the

original Notification dated 4.8.1994 could not have been

issued as they related to 'C' and 'D' class lands that

were resumed by the State Government to the Revenue

Department; and that this order dated 7.11.2006 had

attained finality as it had remained unchallenged.


</p><p id="p_32">     18.     Therefore, the respondent No. 2 - the

Additional   Chief   Secretary,   Department   of   Forest,

Ecology and Environment was discharging a quasi-

judicial function deciding on the relative merits of the

contentions that impacted rights to properties. Further,

the Notified Order dated 21.12.2015 was issued in

exercise of such quasi-judicial function as regards the

action taken under the provisions of the Karnataka

Forest Act, 1963. Moreover, undisputedly, the State

Government could have recourse to appeal against the

Notified Order dated 21.12.2015 under the provisions of

the Karnataka Forest Act, 1963.        A reading of the

impugned order also establishes that the Notified Order

dated 21.12.2015 is declared as invalid not because of

an error apparent on the face of the record, but after a

detailed reasoning and for errors - an exercise that is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                             33</span>




undertaken in exercising of the appellate jurisdiction.

As such, it will have to be concluded, without entering

into the merits of either the Notified Order dated

21.12.2015, or expressing any opinion on the recourse

that the State Government could have, that the

impugned order dated 29.6.2018 is issued without

jurisdiction and is liable to be quashed.


</p><p id="p_33">      Accordingly, the Writ Petitions are allowed, and

order dated 29.6.2018 passed by the Additional Chief

Secretary,   Department     of   Forest,    Ecology   and

Environment, respondent No. 2 is quashed. No Costs.
