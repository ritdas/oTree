<p id="p_1">PER BHAVNESH SAINI,JM


      This order shall dispose of both the appeals filed by

the   assessee   against   orders      of   ld.    CIT(A)   Shimla   dated

23.07.2014.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.    We have heard ld. Representatives of both the parties

and perused the findings of authorities below.              Both appeals

are decided as under.
</p>

<p id="p_3">ITA 814/CHD/2014        (A.Y. 2007-08)


</p><p id="p_4">3.    The assessee in this appeal challenged the order of ld.
</p>
<p id="p_5">CIT(Appeals)     in   denying       benefit   of     15%    accumulation

amounted to Rs. 2,61,86,197/-.
</p>

<p id="p_6">4.    Briefly the facts of the case are that the assessment

under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1">section 143(3)</a>/<a href="/doc/1837761/" id="a_2">147</a> of the Act was made at income of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        2</span>




Rs. 14,43,57,780/- treating the entire surplus of receipts

over expenditure denying the benefit of 15% accumulation of

Rs.2,61,86,197/- under <a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_3">section 11(1)</a> of the Act as claimed

by the assessee and benefit of 85% accumulation of Rs.
</p>
<p id="p_7">11,81,70,581/- under <a href="/doc/195263/" id="a_4">section 11(2)</a> of the Act as claimed by

assessee considering that requisite notice in statutory form

No. 10 in terms of <a href="/doc/195263/" id="a_5">Section 11(2)</a> of the Act was belatedly

filed.    The Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax, Shimla did not

condone the delay in filing form No.10.                The writ petition of

the   assessee       was   dismissed       by    Himachal     Pradesh      High

Court.      It is stated that assessee Board was constituted by

the State Government under the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 with the main object of performing

the      delegated     power   and    function       to    provide   for    the

prevention and control of water pollution and maintaining

or restoring the wholesomeness of water.                   The assessee has

been granted registration under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_7">section 12AA</a> of the Act

which was later on withdrawn.                   The withdrawal order was

challenged before ITAT and appeal of assessee was allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">It is further stated that appeal of the department is pending

before Himachal Pradesh High Court.                 The Assessing Officer

reopened the assessment under <a href="/doc/1888237/" id="a_8">section 148</a> of the Act.                       The

assessee had declared gross income of Rs.17,45,74,646/-
</p>
<p id="p_9">out of which an amount of Rs. 3,02,17,868/- was claimed as

applied     to   the   charitable    or    religious      purposes   in    India

during the previous year and the balance amount of Rs.
</p>
<p id="p_10">11,81,70,581/- was set apart for future utilization in terms

of <a href="/doc/195263/" id="a_9">Section 11(2)(ii)</a> and Rs. 2,61,86,197/- was shown as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          3</span>




income     accumulated        or   set       apart   upto   to   15%.      The

Assessing Officer found the entire sum as excess of income

over expenditure and made the addition of Rs. 14.43 Cr to

the income of the assessee.
</p>

<p id="p_11">5.   The    assessee      challenged           the   addition    before     ld.
</p>
<p id="p_12">CIT(Appeals) and it was submitted that assessee has been

granted registration under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_10">section 12AA</a> of the Act and that

benefit of 15% of accumulation of Rs. 2.61 Cr. under <a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_11">section

11(1)</a> should have been granted to the assessee as per law.
</p>
<p id="p_13">Other    facts   are    not    relevant         in   the    present     appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_14">Therefore, the same are not discussed.
</p>

<p id="p_15">6.   The ld. CIT(Appeals), considering the submissions of

the assessee found that assessee is registered under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_12">section

12AA</a> of the Act and is therefore,               entitled for exemption as

per law.     However, as regards the addition of Rs.2.61Cr

claiming benefit of 15% accumulation under <a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_13">section 11(1)</a>,

ld. CIT(Appeals) dismissed appeal of the assessee because

the form No. 10 was not filed within time.                   The findings of

ld. CIT(Appeals) in para 5.3 to 5.6 of the appellate order are

reproduced as under :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "Assessee has claimed the benefit of 15% accumulation u/s
     11(1) (a&amp;b) and 85% accumulation u/s 11(2). As per <a href="/doc/1454833/" id="a_14">section
     11</a> reveals that (a) income derived from property held under
     trust wholly for char/table or religious purposes, to the extent
     to which such income is applied to such purposes in India and
     where any such income is accumulated or set apart for
     application to such purposes in India, to the extent to which
     the income so accumulated or set apart is not in excess of
     [fifteen] percent of the income from such property, (b) income
     derived from property held under trust in part only for such
     purposes, the trust having been created before the
     commencement of this Act, to the extent to which such income is

     extent to which the income so set apart is not in excess of
     [fifteen] per cent of the income from-such property.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     5.4    Careful reading of <a href="/doc/1454833/" id="a_15">section 11</a> suggested that only that
     part of income which is derived from the property held under
     trust for charitable or religious purposes would be exempt
     which is applied for such purpose and where such income is
     accumulated or set apart, not in excess of 15% of income from
     such property. <a href="/doc/1454833/" id="a_16">Section 11(2)</a> elaborates further that where 85%
     of the income under clause 11(1) ( a) &amp; (b) is not applied but is
     accumulated the exemption shall be available only on fulfillment
     of conditions that Form No. 10 is duly submitted and the money
     is accumulated or deposited in the specified manner.
     5.5   Hence primary condition for claiming exemption even for
     accumulation of 15% of income is that 85% of the receipts
     should be expended on the stated charitable or religious
     purposes or should have submitted Form 10 and invested in
     the specified manner.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     5.6. In the present case assessee has a total receipt of
     Rs.17,45,74,646/- out of which assessee has utilized or
     applied only Rs.3,02,17,868/- thus assessee has not been
     able to spent 85% of the receipt and did not have requisite
     valid Form 10 for the year under consideration. Hence no
     benefit u/s 11 can be provided to the assessee. Keeping in
     view the facts stated in assessment order and above
     observations the action of A.O. is confirmed i.e. assessee's
     claim of allowing it the benefit under <a href="/doc/1454833/" id="a_17">section 11(1)</a> of 15% is not
     allowable and 85% of accumulation/s 11(2) is not allowed."

<p id="p_16">7.   The    ld.   counsel      for    the     assessee,    at        the   outset

submitted that the issue is covered in favour of the assessee

A.L.N. Rao Charitable Trust reported in 216 ITR 697. The AO did
not discuss this issue in the assessment order while rejecting the
appellant's claim. During the course of appellate proceedings, the
appellant once again referred to the provision of <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_21">Section 11</a> of the
Income Tax Act and reiterated his reliance on the case of A.L.N.

that there is blanket exemption of 15% of total income from the
unspent amount for charitable purposes out of the income of the
Trust for that previous year. The AO in his counter comments
dated 30.08.2013 merely mentioned that the details had already
been considered in the assessment order at Page-11. No
submissions were given by the AO as to why this case is not
applicable in the appellant's case.

<p id="p_19">The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of A.L.N. Rao Charitable
Trust has held as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_20">"A mere look at <a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_22">section 11(1)</a> (a) as it stood at the relevant time
clearly shows that out of the total income accruing to a trust in
the previous year from property held by it wholly for charitable or
religious purposes, to the extent the income is applied for such
religious or charitable purposes, the same will get out of the tax
net but so far as the income which is not so applied during the
previous year is concerned at least 25 per cent, of such income
or Rs. 10,000, whichever is higher, will be permitted to be
accumulated for charitable or religious purpose and it will also get
exempted from the tax net. Then follows sub-section (2) which
seeks to lift the restriction or the ceiling imposed on such
exempted accumulated income during the previous year and
also brings such further accumulated income out of the tax net if
the conditions laid down by sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_23">section 11</a>
are fulfilled meaning thereby the money so accumulated is set
apart to be invested in the Government securities, etc., as laid
down by clause (b) of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_24">section 11</a> apart from
the procedure laid down by clause (a) of <a href="/doc/195263/" id="a_25">section 11(2)</a> being
followed by the assessee-trust. To highlight this point we may
take an illustration. If Rs. 1,00,000 are earned as the total
income of the previous year by the trust from property held by it
wholly for charitable and religious purposes and if Rs. 20,000
are actually applied during the previous year by the said trust
to such charitable or religious purposes the income of
Rs.20,000 will get exempted from being considered for the
purpose of income-tax under the first part of <a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_26">section 11(1)</a>. So
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            7</span>




far as the remaining Rs. 80,000 are concerned if they could not
be actually applied for such religious or charitable purposes
during the previous year then as per <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_27">section 11</a> (1) (a) at least
25 per cent, of such total income from property or Rs. 10,000,
whichever is higher, will also earn exemption from being
considered as income for the purpose of income-tax, that is, Rs.
25,000 will thus get excluded from the tax net. Thus out of the
total income of Rs. 1,00,000 which has accrued to the trust Rs.
25,000 will earn exemption from payment of income-tax as per
<a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_28">section 11(1)</a> (a), second part. Then follows sub-section (2)
which states that the ceiling or the limit or the restriction of
accumulation of income to the extent of 25 per cent, of the
income or Rs. 10,000, whichever is higher, for earning income-
tax exemption as engrafted under <a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_29">section 11(1)</a> (a) will get lifted
if the money so accumulated is invested as laid down by section
ll(2)(b) meaning thereby, out of the total accumulated income
of Rs. 80,000 accruing during the previous year and which could
not be spent for charitable or religious purposes by the trust, the
balance of Rs. 55,000 if invested as laid down by sub-section (2)
of <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_30">section 11</a> will also get excluded from the tax net. But for such
investment and if <a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_31">section 11(1)</a> alone had applied Rs. 55,000
being the balance of the accumulated income would have been
covered by the tax net. Learned counsel for the Revenue
submitted that the investment as contemplated by sub-section
(2)(b) of <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_32">section 11</a> must be investment of all the accumulated
income in Government securities, etc., namely, 100 per cent of the
accumulated income and not only 75 per cent, thereof. And if
that is not done, then only the invested accumulated income to
the extent of 75 per cent, will get excluded from income-tax
assessment. But so far as the remaining 25 per cent, of the
accumulated income is concerned, it will not earn such
exemption. It is difficult to appreciate this contention. The
reason is obvious. <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_33">Section 11</a>, subsection (l)(a) operates on its
own. By its operation two types of income earned by the trust
during the previous year from its properties are given exemption
from income-tax:
</p>
<p id="p_21">(i) that part of the income of the previous year which is
actually spent for charitable or religious purposes in that year;
and

</p><p id="p_22">ii) out of the unspent accumulated income of the previous year
25 per cent, of such total property income or Rs. 10,000,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                           8</span>




whichever is higher, can be permitted to be accumulated by the
trust, earmarked for such charitable or religious purposes. Such
25 per cent, of the income or Rs. 10,000, whichever is higher, will
also get exempted from income-tax. That exhausts the operation of
<a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_34">section 11(1)</a> (a). Then follows sub-section (2) which naturally
deals with the question of investment of the balance of
accumulated income which has still not earned exemption under
subsection (l)(a). So far as that balance of the accumulated
income is concerned, that also can earn exemption from income-
tax meaning thereby the ceiling or the limit of exemption of
accumulated income from income-tax as imposed by subsection
(I) (a) of <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_35">section 11</a> would get lifted if additional accumulated
income beyond 25 per cent, or Rs. 10,000, whichever is higher,
as the case may be, is invested as laid down by <a href="/doc/195263/" id="a_36">section 11(2)</a> after
following the procedure laid down therein. Therefore, sub-section
(2) only will have to operate qua the balance of 75 per cent, of the
total income of the previous year or income beyond Rs. 10,000,
whichever is higher, which has not got the benefit of tax
exemption under subsection (l)(a) of <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_37">section 11</a>. If learned
counsel for the Revenue is right and if 100 per cent, of the
accumulated income of the previous year is to be invested under
sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_38">section 11</a> to get exemption from income-tax,
then the ceiling of 25 per cent, or Rs. 10,000, whichever is
higher, which is available for accumulation of income of the
previous year for the trust to earn exemption from income-tax as
laid down by <a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_39">section 11(1)</a> (a) would be rendered redundant and
the said exemption provision would become otiose. It has to be
kept in view that out of the accumulated income of the previous
year an amount of Rs. 10,000 or 25 per cent, of the total income
from property, whichever is higher, is given exemption from
income-tax by <a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_40">section 11(1)</a> (a) itself. That exemption is unfettered
and not subject to any conditions. In other words, it is an
absolute exemption. If sub section (2) is so read as suggested by
learned counsel for the Revenue, what is an absolute and
unfettered exemption of accumulated income as guaranteed by
<a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_41">section 11(1)</a> (a) would become a restricted exemption as laid
down by <a href="/doc/195263/" id="a_42">section 11(2)</a>. <a href="/doc/195263/" id="a_43">Section 11(2)</a> does not operate to
whittle down or to cut across the exemption provisions
contained in <a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_44">section 11(1)</a> (a) so far as such accumulated income
of the previous year is concerned. It has also to be appreciated
that subsection (2) of <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_45">section 11</a> does not contain any non
obstante clause like " notwithstanding the provisions of sub-

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      section (1) ". Consequently, it must be held that after <a href="/doc/1454833/" id="a_46">section 11(1)</a>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      (a) has full play and if still any accumulated income of the
      previous year is left to be dealt with, and to be considered for
      the purpose of income-tax exemption, sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1454833/" id="a_47">section
      11</a> can be pressed into service and if it is complied with then such
      additional accumulated income beyond 25 per cent, or Rs. 10,000,
      whichever is higher, can also earn exemption from income-tax on
      compliance with the conditions laid down by sub-section (2) of
      <a href="/doc/1454833/" id="a_48">section 11</a>. It is true that sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1454833/" id="a_49">section 11</a> has not
      clearly mentioned the extent of the accumulated income which is
      to be invested. But on a conjoint reading of the aforesaid two
      provisions of <a href="/doc/1454833/" id="a_50">sections 11(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1454833/" id="a_51">11(2)</a>, this is the only result which
      can follow. It is also to be kept in view that under the earlier
      <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_52">Income-tax Act</a> of 1922, exemption was available to charitable
      trusts without any restriction upon the accumulated income. There
      was a change in this respect under the present Act of 1961. Under
      the present Act, any income accumulated in excess of 25 per cent,
      or Rs. 10,000, whichever is higher, is taxable under <a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_53">section 11(1)</a>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      (a) of the Act, unless the special conditions regarding
      accumulation as laid down in <a href="/doc/195263/" id="a_54">section 11(2)</a> are complied with. It
      is clear, therefore, that if the entire income received by a trust is
      spent for charitable purposes in India, then it will not be taxable,
      but if there is a saving, that is to say, an accumulation of 25 per
      cent, or Rs. 10,000, whichever is higher, it will not be included in
      the taxable income. <a href="/doc/195263/" id="a_55">Section 11(2)</a> quoted above further liberalizes
      and enlarges the exemption. A combined reading of both the
      provisions quoted above would clearly show that <a href="/doc/195263/" id="a_56">section 11(2)</a>,
      while enlarging the scope of exemption, removes the restriction
      imposed by <a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_57">section 11(1)</a> (a), but it does not take away the
      exemption allowed by <a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_58">section 11(1)</a> (a). On the express language
      of <a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_59">sections 11(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/195263/" id="a_60">11(2)</a> as they stood on the statute book at
      the relevant time, no other view is possible.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_23">In the light of the aforesaid discussion and keeping in view the
illustration which we have given earlier, the combined operation of
<a href="/doc/250198/" id="a_61">section 11(1)</a> (a) and <a href="/doc/195263/" id="a_62">section 11(2)</a> as applicable at the relevant time
would yield the following result:

      for charitable or religious purposes during the previous year is
      Rs. 1,00,000 and if Rs. 20,000 therefrom are actually applied to
      such purposes in India then those Rs. 20,000 will get exempted

       concerned, even the amended sub section (2) operates qua the

       tax exemption, sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_82">section 11</a> can be pressed into
