             petitioner was manufacturing bricks though, the manufacture of

             bricks is ban.

<p id="p_5">                           It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that

             owner of the land on which the alleged bricks were being prepared

             nor the during investigation the investigating agency has bothered

             to ascertain the land on which the bricks were manufactured, this

             contention of counsel for petitioner has not been controverted by

             learned A.P.P. after going through the case diary. It is further

             submitted that the petitioner was called by the police, the same has

             been incorporated in paragraph no. 45 of the case diary, but he

             was not arrested. The investigation has already concluded. A

             statement has been made in para 3 of the petition that the

             petitioner has no criminal antecedent.
