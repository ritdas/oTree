                   Dated this the 5th April, 2013.

                                   JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The petitioners are persons who have been vending meat at

the Pachalam market, a public market under the first respondent.

As per Ext.P8 order, the Kerala Human Rights Commission,

Thiruvananthapuram, has taken serious note of the pollution

problems created by the conduct of the market. It has been found

that no measure to contain or control the nuisance caused has been

adopted by the first respondent either under the Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 or the                         Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.               Therefore, the Pollution Control

Board has been directed to conduct an inspection of the market, to

issue directions to the first respondent for abatement of the

nuisance and pollution and to initiate further action on the basis of

the recommendations to be made to the said authority. Ext.P8 has

also directed that if the pollution was not abated before 31.3.2013,

and a Clearance Certificate/Consent obtained from the Pollution

Control Board, the licence to the vendors occupying the market

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WPC7657/2013                    2</span>

shall not be renewed.      The petitioners contend that they are

seriously prejudiced by the refusal to renew their licences.

</p><p id="p_2">      2.   Adv.S.Chandrasenan appears for the first respondent

Municipality and Adv.M.Ajay appears for the Pollution Control

Board. I have heard the petitioner as well as the counsel appearing

for the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.   According to the counsel for the fourth respondent,

though directions were issued to the first respondent to adopt

certain measures like installing a bio gas plant and a plant for

treatment of the effluents as well as certain other measures like

raising the height of the compound wall etc, the directions have not

been implemented till date. According to the counsel for the first

respondent, the Corporation has undertaken various measures to

ensure that the pollution caused by the working of the market is

abated. The entire premises have been cleaned, the drains have

been cleared of all wastes and at present, the market is kept in a

clean and safe condition.      The above facts would have to be

ascertained and taken stock of by the fourth respondent who is the

competent authority.         As per Ext.P8 also it is the fourth

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WPC7657/2013                    3</span>

respondent who has been directed to issue the necessary Clearance

Certificate/consent after ensuring that proper measures have been

adopted for ensuring that the public market would be conducted

without causing nuisance to the residents of the locality.

</p><p id="p_4">      4.     This writ petition is therefore disposed of with the

following directions:-
</p>
<p id="p_5">      i) The fourth respondent shall conduct an inspection of the

Pachalam market to assess the efficacy of the measures adopted by

the first respondent Corporation and to ascertain whether the

measures adopted are sufficient to ensure that the market is run

without causing nuisance or health hazards to the residents of the

locality.  If the measures directed to be adopted by the fourth

respondent have been put in place, it shall be open to the fourth

respondent to grant Clearance Certificate/consent to the first

respondent for operating the market.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      ii) As and when Clearance Certificate/consent is issued by the

fourth respondent, it shall be open to the first respondent to

initiate proceedings for renewing the licences of the persons who

have been conducting business in the market. However, the first

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WPC7657/2013                    4</span>

respondent shall adopt effective measures to ensure that the

directions of the fourth respondent are complied with and that the

market is run free of any nuisance to the residents of the locality.
