Coram: Hon'ble Ramesh Ranganathan, C.J.
       Hon'ble Ramesh Chandra Khulbe, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">Hon'ble Ramesh Ranganathan, C.J. (Oral)

               All these Writ Petitions have been filed in larger public interest
seeking a direction to the State Government and the State Pollution Control
Board to cause an inquiry through a body of experts, and to take action against
those industries which are causing environmental degradation, and are acting in
violation of the guidelines prescribed in the Environment (Protection) Rules,
1986 and the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.             It would suffice for the disposal of these four writ petitions to take
note of the contents of, and the relief sought for in, WPPIL No.77 of 2017; and
the directions issued by this Court, therein, from time to time. WPPIL No.77 of
2017 is filed by Shri Himanshu Chandola, an agriculturalist from Udham Singh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2</span>
Nagar District, who complains of the failure of the respondents to take action
against the recalcitrant industries which have caused severe environmental
damage to the surrounding areas. He seeks a writ of mandamus commanding
respondent nos.1 to 3, i.e. the State of Uttarakhand, the District Magistrate,
Udham Singh Nagar and the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and
Pollution Control Board to restrain the private respondents (industries causing
pollution) from spreading pollution in the surrounding public areas, and to take
action against them for causing water and air pollution. A mandamus is also
sought commanding these private industries to ensure that they maintain the
pollution standards as per the existing norms.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.           A Division Bench of this Court, by its order dated 17.08.2018,
directed the Central Pollution Control Board to inspect each and every industry
in the State of Uttarakhand, to ascertain whether or not the norms laid down
under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, the Hazardous Wastes
(Management and Handling) Rules, 1989, and the Environment (Protection)
Rules, 1986 are being complied with, and thereafter submit its report to this
Court.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.           The Central Pollution Control Board submitted its report stating
that an inspection was caused of 793 (highly pollutant industries) red category
industries in the State; their inspection revealed that 239 of such units were
complying with the prescribed norms; 323 establishments in the red category
were not complying with the prescribed norms; 159 units were closed; 43 units
were not traceable; 26 units were still under construction; and 2 units could not
be assessed as they were inaccessible.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.           The Division Bench had, in its order dated 14.02.2019, noted the
submission urged on behalf of the State Pollution Control Board that the total
number of red category industries in the State were 734, the number of units in
the orange category was 2732, and those in the green category were 2700;
during the year 2018-19, closure notices were issued to 214 and show cause
notices were issued to 1812 units; and the State Pollution Control Board was
taking prompt action whenever it found that the industries were not complying
with the prescribed norms. The Division Bench, by its order dated 14.02.2019,
directed the Central Pollution Control Board to furnish the list of 323 red
category industries which were found not to be complying with the prescribed
norms. The Member Secretary of the Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board
was directed to inspect each one of these 323 red category industries, and take
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          3</span>
action against the erring units, and submit an 'Action Taken Report' to this
Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.       A compliance report was, thereafter, filed by the State Pollution Control
Board informing this Court that of the 323 red category industries, identified
by the Central Pollution Control Board, 27 were under closure, 179 of these
units satisfied the prescribed norms, and show cause notices were issued
against the rest. It was also brought to the notice of this Court that the Common
Effluent Treatment Plant at Gadarpur, District Udham Singh Nagar did not
comply with the prescribed norms, and a complaint was made against them
before the Court of the Civil Judge (Junior Division); and, since 90 industries
were connected to this common effluent treatment plants, any action taken by
the Board for closure of this treatment plant could adversely affect these ninety
units for no fault of theirs.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.             The Division Bench, in its order dated 13.06.2019, observed that
failure on the part of the common effluent treatment plant to adhere to the
prescribed norms would necessitate action being taken against them
irrespective of the consequences, as any damage caused to the environment is
irreversible. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to furnish details
of the nature of the deficiencies found in the common effluent treatment plant;
the action required to be taken to bring discharge of effluents, from these
plants, within the prescribed parameters; and the time frame required to rectify
the deficiencies in the effluent treatment plants. During the course of hearing
on 27.06.2019, the State Pollution Control Board informed this Court that the
Common Effluent Treatment Plant at Sitarganj catered to 90 industrial units
located in Udham singh Nagar; all these 90 industrial units, which generated
industrial effluents, were connected with the common effluent treatment plant
for treatment of waste water; stoppage of the common effluent treatment plant
would require each individual units to commission their own treatment plants,
and to operate it in such a manner that they achieved the discharge standards as
prescribed under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986. The Division
Bench recorded the submission of the State Pollution Control Board that
notices would be issued informing all the 90 industrial units that they had to
commission their own treatment facilities, and operate them in such a manner
that they achieved the standard norms; they would be given two weeks' time to
comply with these requirements, and thereafter action would be taken against
the Common Effluent Treatment Plant for failure to adhere to the prescribed
norms.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                          4</span>
<p id="p_8">8.           The State Pollution Control Board further informed that the
Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility at Gadarpur was also not found
to be functioning properly; and it appeared that the health care facilities, which
continued to generate biomedical waste, did not have a facility for effective
treatment of biomedical waste, which had resulted in severe damage being
caused thereby to the environment.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.           The Division Bench noted that there were two biomedical waste
treatment facilities, one at Gadarpur in Udham Singh Nagar district, and
another in Roorkee in Haridwar District; and if action were to be taken against
the facility at Gadarpur, it may then require the biomedical waste generated in
the entire State to be sent to Roorkee. Time was granted to the State Pollution
Control Board to submit an affidavit in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.          Periodic reports have been filed by the Pollution Control Board
regarding the action taken by them against the non-compliant Red Category
Industries. It would suffice to take note of the contents of the latest affidavit
filed in this regard. The said affidavit dated 17.02.2020 refers to show cause
notices having been issued to 96 non-compliant red category industries; 80 of
them had rectified the deficiencies and, therefore, the proposal to close these
industries was revoked; one of these industries was directed to be closed and,
after they had rectified the deficiency, the order of closure was revoked; 3 of
these polluting industries had themselves closed their units, 11 Red Category
Industries were under process after field verification, and 1 was pending field
verification. With regards the 21 industries, to whom direction for closure was
issued, the affidavit states that, after rectification of the deficiencies so pointed
out, the order of closure was revoked for 20 industries, and the other industry
had closed its unit.
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.          While periodical monitoring of the functioning of these Red
Category Industries is no doubt essential, we see no reason to keep these writ
petitions pending in the files of this Court in view of the assurance of Mr.
Aditya Pratap Singh, learned Standing Counsel for the State Pollution Control
Board, that the Pollution Control Board is regularly monitoring the functioning
of these red category industries; and action would be promptly taken against
the recalcitrant units which failed to adhere to the prescribed norms.
</p>
<p id="p_12">12.          Mr. C.K. Sharma, learned Counsel, appearing on behalf of the
petitioners, would submit that, instead of keeping the writ petitions pending in
the file of this Court, it would suffice if this Court were to grant liberty to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           5</span>
petitioners, in case any violation of the environmental laws by any of these red
category units comes to their notice, to again invoke the jurisdiction of this
Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_13">13.          Granting the petitioners liberty as sought for, and considering the
submission urged, on behalf of the State Pollution Control Board, that the
Board would periodically monitor the functioning of these red category
industries and take action against those who do not adhere to the prescribed
environmental norms, we see no reason to keep the writ petitions pending on
the file of this Court on these issues.
</p>
<p id="p_14">14.          As the waste disposal facility at Gardarpur was not functioning
properly, this Court was of the view that it may be in the best interest of the
State to have a few more such facilities; and, since the cost of establishment of
these facilities is extremely high, the State should explore the possibility of
inviting private players to establish such facilities or to establish them in the
Public Private Partnership mode.
</p>
<p id="p_15">15.          In it affidavit filed before this Court, the State Pollution Control
Board stated that, in the Minutes of the Meeting held on 04.12.2019, consisting
of official of Urban Development, Health and Family Welfare Department and
the Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board, it was decided that Common Effluent
Treatment Plants (CETP) should be installed in industrial areas where the
density was more; it was their opinion that a technical study should be
conducted for the establishment of CETPs at the industrial areas in
Bhagwanpur, Bantakhedi and Kashipur; for installation of the CEPTs in these
areas, an initiative for a subsidized package being extended by the Department
of Industrial Development was proposed to be introduced in order to encourage
investors of local regions to establish and operate such plants; the existing two
facilities were in the plain areas; and the proposal before the Pollution Control
Board was considered for private investors for installation of such facilities at
Narender Nagar in Tehri District and in Almora (hilly areas of the State).
Invitations for expression of interest were also issued, was given wide publicity
in the leading daily newspapers, and was also hosted on the website of the
Board.
</p>
<p id="p_16">16.          In its affidavit dated 17.02.2020, the Regional Officer of the
Pollution Control Board states that 9 firms participated pursuant to the
expression of interest, of which 3 were found to have technically qualified; the
Pollution Control Board had shortlisted a firm namely, "The Just Environment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                               6</span>
(Toxic Links), Delhi"; they were asked to make a presentation on 24.02.2020;
thereafter 30 days' time was required to finalize the modalities; the shortlisted
firm was thereafter required to prepare an inventory of the biomedical waste, in
each of the 13 districts, within 300 days for submission of the final report; and,
based on the report of the firm, the size of the units is required to be finalized.
</p>
<p id="p_17">17.                Mr. Aditya Pratap Singh, learned Standing Counsel for the
Pollution Control Board, states that the shortlisted firm would commence its
exercise of collecting inventory, from the healthcare facilities in all the 13
districts of the State, from the 1st of April, 2020; and, in terms of the expression
of interest, they are required to submit their report within 300 days from
01.04.2020. He would further submit that, since a decision has already been
taken to establish two more waste disposal facilities in Tehri and Almora
districts of Uttarakhand, action would be taken, on receipt of the report of the
shortlisted firm, to decide on the size of the unit required to be established to
cater to the waste generated by these healthcare facilities; and, thereafter, bids
would be invited from those willing to establish such disposal facilities in these
two districts of the State. He assures this Court that necessary action would be
taken, within a prescribed time frame, for establishment of these waste disposal
facilities in the two districts of Tehri and Almora.
</p>
<p id="p_18">18.                As it does appear to us that the State Pollution Control Board has
been taking action against the recalcitrant Red Category Industries in the State,
and since efforts are underway to establish two additional bio-medical waste
disposal facilities in the hilly region of the State, i.e. in Tehri and Almora
districts, we record the assurance of the learned Standing Counsel, appearing
on behalf of the State Pollution Control Board, that prompt action will be taken
by the Pollution Control Board in this regard. All the four writ petitions are
closed giving the petitioners liberty, in case any such need arises in future and
these red category industries are found to have violated the prescribed
environmental norms, to avail their judicial remedies in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_19">19.                All the four writ petitions are disposed of accordingly. No costs.
