                       JUDGMENT

Antony Dominic, J.


1. Issues raised in these Public Interest Litigations

 are intrinsically connected.    Therefore, these cases

 were heard together and are being disposed of by this

 common  judgment,  treating   W.P(C).31081/13  as the

 leading case and referring to the pleadings and

 documents therein, unless otherwise expressly stated

 hereafter.



2.The first respondent is the Cochin Port Trust, a

 major port governed by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_2">Major

 Port Trusts Act</a>, 1963.    In the meeting of the Board

 of Trustees of the Port Trust held on 9.3.2005, as

 per Ext.P1 agenda item, a proposal was placed for

 reclamation of about 8 hectares of land on the

 western side of Bolgatty Island.      The purposes of

 such reclamation were the need for availability of

 sufficient area at Vallarpadam for the development of

 Port   based  Special  Economic  Zone   and  also for

 streamlining of the flow in the area and that the

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                   2




  better         appearance   for  the  shoreline.    Ext.P1(a)

  resolution shows that after detailed discussions, the

  Board of Trustees resolved to approve the proposal

  for implementation of the reclamation project at an

  estimated cost of `3.93 crores.            Accordingly, land

  was reclaimed in 2005.



3. The land thus reclaimed was remaining unutilized and

  by Ext.P3 letter dated 28.10.2009, the Cochin Port

  Trust sought permission of the Government of India

  for long term leasing of the plots of land mentioned

  therein, for a period of 99 years for commercial and

  other        non-port     related activities.     Among  the

  different           plots of  land  that  were  mentioned in

  Ext.P3, one of the plots was the one reclaimed in

  2005 and this was shown as located in Bolgatty

  (Mulavukadu Island) and the area thereof was shown as

  31.05         Acres     (12.5657  hectares).     Ext.P3  was

  considered and by Ext.P4 order dated 4.6.2010, the

  Government of India conveyed its decision permitting

  the Port Trust to lease out the lands for 30 years,

  with option for renewal after 30 years at the then

  prevailing rates.

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                 3




4.    On the strength of the permission thus obtained by

  it, on 23.6.2010, the Cochin Port Trust issued Ext.P5

  notice inviting tenders, inter alia, for leasing of

  10 hectares of land at Bolgatty for 30 years on

  upfront basis, with an option for renewal after 30

  years at the then prevailing scale of rates for a

  maximum         period of  30  years, for  setting  up  of

  hotels/resorts/         Convention  Center/shopping  mall/

  commercial /office Complex, and allied facilities at

  Bolgatty Island near Marina in Ernakulam.



5.In response to Ext.P5, the only bid received was from

  Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A. Ext.R10(a) is the bid submitted

  by him and Ext.P6 is Annexure II thereof.          The bid

  submitted by Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A. was placed for the

  consideration of the Board of Trustees in their

  meeting held on 6.9.2010 and Ext.P7 minutes of the

  meeting show that the Board resolved to approve the

  proposal to accept the single offer of Sri.Yusuff Ali

  M.A. for leasing out the 10 hectares of land at

  Bolgatty for a period of 30 years, with an option for

  renewal for a further period of 30 years.              The

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                   4




  conditions subject to which the resolution was passed

  are also incorporated in the resolution.



6.Ext.P8 is the lease deed executed in pursuance of

  Ext.P7.         However, that lease deed is executed between

  the Board of Trustees of Cochin Port Trust and the

  lessee therein, M/s.Lulu Convention and Exhibition

  Centre Private Ltd., a company incorporated under the

  <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_3">Companies Act</a>, which is the 10th respondent herein.

  Subsequently, Ext.P9 letter was issued by the 10th

  respondent on 6.4.2013 to the Secretary to the Local

  Self Government Department, Government of Kerala for

  obtaining            building permit,  stating  that  their

  proposed           project  consisted of  hotel,  convention

  centre and service apartments and would have a built

  up area of 147198 sq.ft with an anticipated project

  cost of over 400 crores, generating more than 500

  employment opportunities. In this letter, describing

  their project as a large scale developmental one,

  they requested the Secretary to the Government to do

  the needful in the matter.

                                  5




7.The request of the 10th respondent was placed before

  the Cabinet and Ext.P10 is the Note to the Council of

  Ministers.            In this note, the point framed for

  decision was whether special permission may be given

  to the 10th respondent for construction in the land

  having an extent of 10.59 hectares, relaxing the

  zoning provisions of the Structure Plan for Central

  City, Kochi and special town planning schemes subject

  to the condition that the construction should satisfy

  the conditions stipulated in the prevailing Building

  Rules and all other statutory provisions.           Ext.P11

  proceedings of the cabinet meeting held on 24.7.2013

  shows that the proposal as contained in Ext.P10 was

  approved.             On that  basis,  on  27.7.2013,  the

  Government issued Ext.P12 order according special

  permission to the 10th respondent for construction in

  the land, relaxing the zoning provisions of the

  Structure Plan for Central City, Kochi and special

  town planning schemes subject to the condition that

  the       construction     should satisfy  the   conditions

  stipulated in the prevailing Building Rules and all

  other statutory provisions.        It was also ordered that

  further necessary action in the matter would be taken

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                   6




  by the Secretary, Mulavukadu Grama Panchayat, before

  whom, an application for building permit was pending.

  Subsequently, on 11.10.2013, the Mulavukadu Grama

  Panchayat issued Ext.P14 building permit to the 10th

  respondent.



8.It      was      in   the aforesaid background, these  writ

  petitions were filed as public interest litigations

  and in W.P(C).31081/13, the prayers made are to quash

  Ext.P7, the minutes of the meeting of the Board of

  Trustees; Ext.P8, the lease deed executed between the

  Board of Trustees of the Port Trust and the 10th

  respondent,          the Company;  Ext.P12,  the Government

  Order relaxing the zoning provisions and Ext.P14, the

  building           permit issued  by the  Mulavukadu  Grama

  Panchayat.             In  so  far  as  W.P(C).26435/13 is

  concerned, the reliefs include those sought for in

  W.P(C).31081/13 and reference will be made to those

  prayers in the latter part of this judgment.



9.On behalf of the respondents, the maintainability

  of the writ petitions was questioned, contending

  that this Court has already upheld the lease in a

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                 7




  public          interest  litigation  as  per   Ext.R10(b)

  judgment            and that  therefore,  further   public

  interest litigations challenging the grant of lease

  to the 10th respondent is not maintainable.             In

  support of this contention, learned counsel for the

  Cochin Port Trust placed reliance on the Apex Court

  judgment in <a href="/doc/1489340/" id="a_4">Forward Construction Co. v. Prabhat

  Mandal (Regd), Andheri</a> [AIR 1986 SC 391], while

  the learned senior counsel appearing for the 10th

  respondent relied on the judgment in <a href="/doc/348205/" id="a_5">State of

  Karnataka v. All India Manufacturers Organisation</a>

  [(2006) 4 SCC 683].



10. This contention was mainly on the basis of

  Ext.R10(b) judgment in W.P(C).36882/10, which was

  filed        by one Dijo Kappen, Managing Trustee, Centre

  for Consumer Education (Reg.No.497/88), Main Road,

  Pala, Kottayam District.          The prayers in this writ

  petition, which are extracted in Ext.R10(b) reads

  thus:

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                       8




             "i) To call for the records leading to Exhibit P9
             and issue a writ of certiorari or other
             appropriate writ order or direction quashing the
             same.

             ii) To issue a writ of mandamus or any other
             appropriate writ order or direction commanding
             the Port Trust to retender the land in question
             by inviting fresh tenderers desirably a global
             tender process giving publicity in all leading
             National dailies.

             iii) To issue a writ of mandamus declaring that
             the lease granted in favour of the 5th
             respondent is in violation of the provisions of
             Sections 82 &amp; 83 of the Kerala Land Reforms
             Act and therefore the grant is void in law."


11.By Ext.R10(b), the writ petition was dismissed by

  this Court at the admission stage.                   In paragraph 6

  of that judgment, this Court recorded thus:


                     "6. The 3rd respondent is a statutory body.
             It may have its own reasons for deciding to
             lease out the property held by it. The legality
             or the wisdom of the 3rd respondent in taking
             such a decision to lease out its property is not
             the subject matter of challenge in this writ
             petition. The challenge is only to the choice of

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                    9




             the 5th respondent.    Whether the procedure
             followed by the 3rd respondent in choosing the
             5th respondent as the lessee is strictly in
             accordance with the requirement of law is only
             one aspect of the matter which is required to be
             kept in mind in deciding the question whether
             this Court should interfere with the decision of
             the 3rd respondent. Assuming for the sake of
             argument that there is some lacuna in the
             procedure followed in making the choice of the
             5th respondent, the same by itself, in our opinion,
             does not warrant interference. By interfering
             with the decision of the 3rd respondent, in the
             absence of any other prospective bidder who is
             willing to offer an amount higher than what is
             offered by the 5th respondent, this Court would
             only be scuttling the decision of the 3rd
             respondent without any benefit either to the 3rd
             respondent or to the public in general."



12.Law is settled that to proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article

  226</a> of the Constitution of India, the principles of

  section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure providing

  for res judicata are equally applicable.                      As per

  this provision, no court shall try any suit or

  issue          in     which    the     matter       directly     and

  substantially          in   issue    has    been     directly    and

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                   10




  substantially in issue in a former suit between the

  same parties, or between parties under whom they or

  any of them claim, litigating under the same title,

  in a Court competent to try such subsequent suit or

  the suit in which such issue has been substantially

  raised, and has been heard and finally decided by

  such Court.            Explanation IV thereof provides that

  any matter which might and ought to have been made

  ground of defence or attack in such former suit

  shall be deemed to have been a matter directly and

  substantially in issue in such suit.            Explanation

  VI provides that where persons litigate bona fide

  in respect of a public right or of a private right

  claimed in common for themselves and others, all

  persons interested in such right shall, for the

  purposes of <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_7">section 11</a>, be deemed to claim under

  the persons so litigating.



13.It       was       extending the  principles contained in

  section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure that the

  Apex Court in Forward Construction Co. (supra)

  held in paragraphs 19 to 22 thus:

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                       11




             "19. The second question for consideration is
             whether the present writ petition is barred by res
             judicata. This plea has been negatived by the High
             Court for two reasons : (1) that in the earlier writ
             petition the validity of the permission granted
             under R. 4(a)(i) of the Development Control Rules
             was not in issue; and (2) that the earlier writ
             petition filed by Shri Thakkar was not a bona fide
             one inasmuch as he was put up by some disgruntled
             builder, namely M/s. Western Builders.

             20. So far as the first reason is concerned, the
             High Court in our opinion was not right in holding
             that the earlier judgment would not operate as res
             judicata as one of the grounds taken in the
             present petition was conspicuous by its absence in
             the earlier petition. Explanation IV to<a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_8"> S. 11</a>, C.P.C.
             provides that any matter which might and ought to
             have been made ground of defence or attack in
             such former suit shall be deemed to have been a
             matter directly and substantially in issue in such
             suit. An adjudication is conclusive and final not only
             as to the actual matter determined but as to every
             other matter which the parties might and ought to
             have litigated and have had it decided as incidental
             to or essentially connected with the subject-
             matter of the litigation and every matter coming
             within the legitimate purview of the original action
             both in respect of the matters of claim or
             defence. The principle underlying Explanation IV is
             that where the parties have had an opportunity of
             controverting a matter that should be taken to be

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                       12




             the same thing as if the matter had been actually
             controverted and decided. It is true that where a
             matter has been constructively in issue it cannot
             be said to have been actually heard and decided. It
             could only be deemed to have been heard and
             decided.    The   first   reason,   therefore,   has
             absolutely no force.

             21. The second reason given by the High Court,
             however, holds good. Explanation VI to<a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_9"> S. 11</a>
             provides
             "Where persons litigate bona fide in respect of a
             public right or of a private right claimed in common
             for themselves and others, all persons interested
             in such right shall, for the purposes of this section
             be deemed to claim under the persons so
             litigating."
             But it is only when the conditions of Explanation VI
             are satisfied that a decision in the litigation will
             bind all persons interested in the right litigated
             and the onus of proving the want of bona fide in
             respect of the previous litigation is on the party
             seeking to avoid the decision. The words "public
             right" have been added in Explanation VI in view of
             the new<a href="/doc/667720/" id="a_10"> S. 91</a>, C.P.C. and to prevent multiplicity of
             litigation in respect of public right. In view of
             Explanation VI it cannot be disputed that<a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_11"> S. 11</a>
             applies to public interest litigation as well but it
             must be proved that the previous litigation was the
             public interest litigation, not by way of a private
             grievance. It has to be a bona fide litigation in

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                      13




             respect of a right which is common and is agitated
             in common with others.

             22. The High Court in the earlier writ petition had
             recorded a finding that it was not a bona fide
             litigation and that Shri Thakkar, the petitioner in
             that case, had been put up by M/s. Western
             Builders. This finding excludes the application of
            <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_12"> S. 11</a>, C.P.C. in the present case. The possibility of
             litigation to foreclose any further enquiry into a
             matter in which an enquiry is necessary in the
             interest of public cannot be overruled. In view of
             the finding of the High Court that the previous
             writ petition was not a bona fide one, the present
             writ petition would not be barred by S. 11 of the
             C.P.C. and the High Court was justified in so
             holding but not because of the first reason but
             because of the second reason."



14.This         contention was         supported     by    the learned

  senior counsel appearing for the 10th respondent who

  placed reliance on the Apex Court judgment in <a href="/doc/348205/" id="a_13">State

  of Karnataka v. All India Manufacturers Organisation</a>

  [(2006)          4   SCC    683],   where,     the   issue      of res

  judicata in so far as public interest litigations

  are concerned, was considered by the Apex Court in

  detail and it was held thus in paragraphs 32 to 50:

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                        14




             32. Res judicata is a doctrine based on the larger
             public interest and is founded on two grounds: one
             being the maxim nemo debet bis vexari pro una et
             eadem causa (no one ought to be twice vexed for
             one and the same cause) and second, public policy
             that there ought to be an end to the same
             litigation. It is well settled that Section 11 of the
             Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (hereinafter "CPC") is
             not the foundation of the principle of res judicata,
             but merely statutory recognition thereof and
             hence, the section is not to be considered
             exhaustive of the general principle of law. The
             main purpose of the doctrine is that once a matter
             has been determined in a former proceeding, it
             should not be open to parties to reagitate the
             matter again and again. Section 11 CPC recognises
             this principle and forbids a court from trying any
             suit or issue, which is res judicata, recognising
             both "cause of action estoppel" and "issue
             estoppel". There are two issues that we need to
             consider, one, whether the doctrine of res
             judicata, as a matter of principle, can be applied to
             public interest litigations and second, whether the
             issues and findings in Somashekar Reddy [(1999) 1
             KLD 500] constitute res judicata for the present
             litigation.


             33. Explanation VI to <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_14">Section 11</a> states:
             "Explanation VI.--Where persons litigate bona fide
             in respect of a public right or of a private right
             claimed in common for themselves and others, all
             persons interested in such right shall, for the

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                       15




             purposes of this section, be deemed to claim under
             the persons so litigating."


             34. Explanation VI came up for consideration
             before this Court in <a href="/doc/1489340/" id="a_15">Forward Construction Co. v.
             Prabhat Mandal (Regd</a>.) (hereinafter "Forward
             Construction Co."). This Court held that in view of
             Explanation VI, it could not be disputed that
             <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_16">Section 11</a> applies to public interest litigation, as
             long as it is shown that the previous litigation was
             in public interest and not by way of private
             grievance. Further, the previous litigation has to
             be a bona fide litigation in respect of a right which
             is common and is agitated in common with others.


             35. As a matter of fact, in a public interest
             litigation, the petitioner is not agitating his
             individual rights but represents the public at large.
             As long as the litigation is bona fide, a judgment in
             a previous public interest litigation would be a
             judgment in rem. It binds the public at large and
             bars any member of the public from coming
             forward before the court and raising any
             connected issue or an issue, which had been raised
             should have been raised on an earlier occasion by
             way of a public interest litigation. It cannot be
             doubted that the petitioner in Somashekar Reddy
             was acting bona fide. Further, we may note that,
             as a retired Chief Engineer, Somashekar Reddy
             had the special technical expertise to impugn the
             Project on the grounds that he did and so, he
             cannot be dismissed as a busybody. Thus, we are

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                      16




             satisfied in principle that Somashekar Reddy, as a
             public interest litigation, could bar the present
             litigation.


             36. We will presently consider whether the issues
             and     findings in  Somashekar    Reddy    actually
             constitute res judicata for the present litigation.
             Section 11 CPC undoubtedly provides that only
             those      matters   that   were    "directly   and
             substantially in issue" in the previous proceeding
             will constitute res judicata in the subsequent
             proceeding. Explanation III to <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_17">Section 11</a> provides
             that for an issue to be res judicata it should have
             been raised by one party and expressly denied by
             the other:
             "Explanation III.--The matter above referred to
             must in the former suit have been alleged by one
             party and either denied or admitted, expressly or
             impliedly, by the other."


             37. Further, Explanation IV to <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_18">Section 11</a>, states:
             "Explanation IV.--Any matter which might and
             ought to have been made ground of defence or
             attack in such former suit shall be deemed to have
             been a matter directly and substantially in issue in
             such suit."


             38. The spirit behind Explanation IV is brought
             out in the pithy words of Wigram, V.C. in
             <a href="/doc/1961784/" id="a_19">Henderson v. Henderson</a> as follows: (All ER pp. 381
             I-382 A)

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                      17




             "The plea of res judicata applies, except in special
             case (sic), not only to points upon which the court
             was actually required by the parties to form an
             opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every
             point which properly belonged to the subject of
             litigation and which the parties, exercising
             reasonable diligence, might have brought forward
             at the time."


             39. In Greenhalgh v. Mallard [(1947) 2 All ER 255
             (CA)] (hereinafter "Greenhalgh"), Somervell, L.J.
             observed thus:
             "I think that on the authorities to which I will
             refer it would be accurate to say that res judicata
             for this purpose is not confined to the issues
             which the court is actually asked to decide, but
             that it covers issues or facts which are so clearly
             part of the subject-matter of the litigation and so
             clearly could have been raised that it would be an
             abuse of the process of the court to allow a new
             proceeding to be started in respect of them."


             40. The judgment in Greenhalgh was approvingly
             referred to by this Court in <a href="/doc/739415/" id="a_20">State of U.P. v.
             Nawab Hussain</a> [(1977) 2 SCC 806]. Combining all
             these principles, a Constitution Bench of this
             Court in <a href="/doc/485116/" id="a_21">Direct Recruit Class II Engg. Officers'
             Assn. v. State of Maharashtra</a> expounded on the
             principle laid down in Forward Construction Co. by
             holding that:
             "[A]n adjudication is conclusive and final not only

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                      18




             as to the actual matter determined but as to every
             other matter which the parties might and ought to
             have litigated and have had (sic) decided as
             incidental to or essentially connected with (sic)
             subject-matter of the litigation and every matter
             coming into the legitimate purview of the original
             action both in respect of the matters of claim and
             defence. Thus, the principle of constructive res
             judicata underlying Explanation IV of Section 11 of
             the Code of Civil Procedure was applied to writ
             case. We, accordingly hold that the writ case is fit
             to be dismissed on the ground of res judicata."


             41. With these legal principles in mind, the
             question, therefore, arises as to what exactly was
             sought in Somashekar Reddy, how it was decided
             by the High Court in the first round of litigation,
             and what has been sought in the present litigation
             arising at the instance of Mr J.C. Madhuswamy and
             others. In order to show that the issue of excess
             land was "directly and substantially in issue" in
             Somashekar Reddy we will first examine the
             prayers of the parties, the cause of action, the
             averments of parties and the findings of the High
             Court in Somashekar Reddy.


             42. First, learned counsel for the respondents has
             pointedly drawn our attention to the identity of
             the prayers made in the previous public interest
             litigation by Somashekar Reddy as compared to
             the prayers made in the present case of Mr
             Madhuswamy      and   others.   The   prayers    in

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                      19




             Somashekar     Reddy's   petition  were:  (a)  for
             quashing the FWA, and (b) for directing an inquiry
             by the CBI in the matter and to prosecute the
             offenders. In Mr Madhuswamy's petition, the
             prayers were: (a) to direct the CBI to conduct
             inquiries to various acts as enumerated by Items 1
             to 16 (specifically the issue of excess land), and
             (b) for quashing the various agreements, and acts
             done in pursuance of the Project and consequently,
             to denotify the land of all farmers situated away
             from the peripheral road and link road. We are
             therefore, satisfied that the prayers made in
             Somashekar Reddy and in Mr Madhuswamy's writ
             petitions are substantially the same.


             43. Second, the cause of action in both
             Somashekar Reddy and the present cases is the
             FWA, which includes the provisions for acquiring
             20,193 acres of land for the Project (comprising
             13,237 acres of private land and 6956 acres of
             government land). Indeed, it was stated in
             Somashekar Reddy's writ petition that the land
             requirement in Schedule I of the FWA was "highly
             exaggerated" and would illegally create "huge
             profits" for Nandi. Somashekar Reddy thus prayed
             that the FWA be quashed--this prayer was,
             however, specifically rejected. The very same
             FWA that was upheld earlier has now been
             impugned in the present case.


             44. Third, in both Somashekar Reddy and
             Madhuswamy's petitions, the averment was that

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                     20




             excess land than required for the implementation
             of the Project was being acquired by the State
             Government at the behest of Nandi and that the
             Project was nothing but a camouflage to carry out
             a real estate business by Nandi. The High Court
             records the following contention of Somashekar
             Reddy's counsel: (Kant LJ p. 254, para 47)


             "47. The next submission of the counsel for the
             petitioner is that Government of Karnataka though
             ostensible (sic ostensibly) purported to form an
             Express Highway has in reality allowed the 2nd
             respondent to develop the townships as a
             developer by conferring a huge largess (sic
             largesse) by way of giving 20,000 acres of land....
             According to petitioner, the land required for the
             construction of four-lane highway is only 2775
             acres, whereas the remaining land would be
             utilised for the purpose of development of the
             towns thereby permitting Respondent 2 to develop
             townships as a developer and earn huge profits."


             45. The averment of Somashekar Reddy regarding
             excess land came to be considered by the High
             Court which records some of the opposing
             contentions of the respondent State, in the
             following terms:
             "As a mega project like the Expressway involves
             considerable extent of land, answering respondent
             [the State] has agreed to provide the minimum
             extent of land required for the Project partly out
             of the land owned by the State and by acquiring

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                     21




             the balance. The second respondent will not only
             construct the proposed Expressway but also link
             roads, peripheral road, interchanges, service
             roads, toll plazas and maintenance area, etc. in
             addition to the townships."(Kant LJ p. 235, para
             15)
             "It is stated that the project by its very nature
             requires considerable extent of land and that is
             why the respondent has agreed to provide the land
             to the extent available with it and acquire the
             balance and make available the same to the
             replying respondent. There are mutual obligations
             on both the parties under the impugned agreement
             and Respondent 1 is only facilitating the acquisition
             of land for which the replying respondent has to
             pay at the existing market rates." (Kant LJ p. 240,
             para 25)


             46. Crucially, two very striking findings have been
             made by the High Court in Somashekar Reddy as
             follows:
             "So out of 20,193 acres land required for the
             Expressway would be 6999 acres leaving 13,000
             acres for development of townships. Government
             of Karnataka in its written statement has said
             that it has agreed to provide minimum extent of
             land for the Project partly out of the land owned
             by the Government and by acquiring the balance.
             Permission has been given to develop the five
             townships instead of 7, proposed by Respondent 2
             to make the project viable." (Kant LJ p. 256, para
             52)

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                     22




             "46. The submission that the contract was entered
             in a clandestine manner also cannot be accepted....
             Respondents in their statement of objections have
             admitted that this point was raised on the floor of
             the House and the respondent made detailed
             presentation on this subject in the House.... Every
             minute detail was explained including the scientific
             method     adopted   by   the    respondent     for
             identification of the land for the project." (Kant
             LJ p. 254, para 46)


             47. All of these unequivocally show that the issue
             of excess land (and connected issues) was
             specifically  raised    by   the    petitioner    in
             Somashekar Reddy and was also forcefully denied
             by the State. In fact, the decision in Somashekar
             Reddy, went further with the High Court according
             its imprimatur to the land requirements under the
             FWA amounting to 20,193 acres, which in no small
             measure, resulted from the State's successful
             defence that it had provided the "bare minimum of
             land" for the Project calculated by a "scientific
             method". The judgment also contains copious
             references to the issue of land (including the
             acreage), the types of land to be acquired, the
             land requirement for different aspects of the
             Project, the scientific techniques involved in
             identifying the land and road alignment, etc. In
             these circumstances, it cannot be doubted that
             Explanation III to <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_22">Section 11</a> squarely applies. It
             is clear that the issue of excess land under the
             FWA was "directly and substantially in issue" in

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                      23




             Somashekar Reddy and hence, the findings
             recorded therein having reached finality, cannot
             be reopened in this case.


             48.      The  principle  and     philosophy   behind
             Explanation IV, namely, to prevent "the abuse of
             the     process of   the   court"    (as   stated in
             Greenhalgh) through reagitation of settled issues,
             provides yet another ground to reject the
             appellants' contentions. For instance, the High
             Court specifically records (vide para 29) of the
             impugned judgment that:
             "It is common case of the parties that the validity
             of the FWA had earlier been challenged in
             Somashekar Reddy case on all conceivable grounds
             including the one that land in excess of what is
             required for the Project had been acquired by the
             State Government."


             49. In the face of such a finding by the High
             Court, Explanation IV to <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_23">Section 11</a> squarely
             applies as, admittedly, the litigation in Somashekar
             Reddy exhausted all possible challenges to the
             validity of the FWA, including the issue of excess
             land. Merely because the present petitioners draw
             semantic distinctions and claim that the excess
             land not having been identified at the stage of the
             litigation in Somashekar Reddy, the Project should
             be reviewed, the issue does not cease to be res
             judicata or covered by principles analogous
             thereto. If we were to re-examine the issues that
             had been raised/ought to have been raised in

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                     24




             Somashekar Reddy it would simply be an abuse of
             the process of the court, which we cannot allow.


             50. As we have pointed out, the cause of action,
             the issues raised, the prayers made, the relief
             sought in Somashekar Reddy's petition and the
             findings in Somashekar Reddy and the claims and
             arguments    in   the   present   petitions   were
             substantially the same. Therefore, it is not
             possible to accept the contention of the appellants
             before us that the judgment in Somashekar Reddy
             does not operate as res judicata for the questions
             raised in the present petitions."



15.However, the learned counsel appearing for the

  petitioners attempted to distinguish the aforesaid

  judgments by placing reliance on the judgment of

  the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/229223/" id="a_24">V. Purushotham Rao v.                    Union of

  India</a> [(2001) 10 SCC 305], where, in paragraphs 19

  and        20,       the   Apex     Court     has     relaxed    the

  applicability of the principles of res judicata in

  so far as public interest litigations relating to

  issues of grave concern to the general public are

  concerned, by holding thus:

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                      25




             "19. Coming to the second question, Explanation
             IV to Section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code
             postulates that any matter which might and ought
             to have been made ground of defence or attack in
             such former suit shall be deemed to have been a
             matter directly and substantially in issue in such
             suit. Order 2 Rule 2<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_25"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure
             provides that every suit shall include the whole of
             the claim which the plaintiff is entitled to make in
             respect of the cause of action and if he omits to
             sue in respect of, or intentionally relinquishes, any
             portion of his claim, then he shall not afterwards
             sue in respect of the portion, so omitted or
             relinquished. By virtue of Explanation to Section
             141 of the Code of Civil Procedure, since
             proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_26">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
             are excluded from the expression "proceedings",
             therefore, the Civil Procedure Code is not
             required to be followed in a proceeding under
             <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_27">Article 226</a> unless the High Court itself has made
             the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code
             applicable to a proceeding under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_28">Article 226.</a> Then
             again, the principles of <a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_29">Section 11</a> as well as Order
             2 Rule 2, undoubtedly contemplate an adversarial
             system of litigation, where the court adjudicates
             the rights of the parties and determines the
             issues arising in a given case. The public interest
             litigation or a petition filed for public interest
             cannot be held to be an adversarial system of
             adjudication and the petitioner in such case,
             merely brings it to the notice of the court, as to
             how and in what manner the public interest is

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                      26




             being jeopardised by arbitrary and capricious
             action of the authorities. In the case of <a href="/doc/181685796/" id="a_30">Rural
             Litigation and Entitlement Kendra v. State of U.P</a>.
             [1989 Supp (1) SCC 504]which is commonly known
             as Doon Valley case, such a contention had been
             raised, as is apparent from para 14 of the
             judgment viz. the decision of the Court dated 12-
             3-1985 (<a href="/doc/104313664/" id="a_31">Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra v.
             State of U.P</a>. [(1985) 2 SCC 431] was final in
             certain aspects, including the release of A
             category mines outside the city limits of
             Mussoorie from the proceedings and in view of
             such finality it was not open to this Court in the
             same proceedings at a later stage to direct
             differently in regard to what had been decided
             earlier. The Court repelled the same by holding
             that the writ petitions are not inter partes
             disputes and have been raised by way of public
             interest litigation and the controversy before the
             Court is as to whether for social safety and for
             creating a hazardless environment for the people
             to live in, mining in the area should be permitted
             or stopped. The Court hastened to add: (SCC p.
             515, para 16)
             "We may not be taken to have said that for public
             interest litigations, procedural laws do not apply.
             At the same time it has to be remembered that
             every technicality in the procedural law is not
             available as a defence when a matter of grave
             public importance is for consideration before the
             court. Even if it is said that there was a final
             order, in a dispute of this type it would be

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                       27




             difficult to entertain the plea of res judicata."
             Thus even in the selfsame proceedings, the earlier
             order though final, was treated not to create a
             bar inasmuch as the controversy before the Court
             was of grave public interest. The learned counsel
             appearing for the appellants drew our attention to
             the decision of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1489340/" id="a_32">Forward
             Construction Co. v. Prabhat Mandal</a> [(1986) 1 SCC
             100] whereunder the Court did record a conclusion
             that Section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code applied
             to public interest litigation. In our considered
             opinion, therefore, the principle of constructive
             res judicata cannot be made applicable in each and
             every public interest litigation, irrespective of the
             nature of litigation itself and its impact on the
             society and the larger public interest which is
             being served. There cannot be any dispute that in
             competing rights between the public interest and
             individual interest, the public interest would
             override. In Centre for Public Interest Litigation
             case [1995 Supp (3) SCC 382] which had been
             filed in this Court, the prayer that had been made
             was to lay down the guidelines for the discretion
             being exercised in the matter of allotment of gas
             agencies, petroleum dealership and others. It is no
             doubt true that the applicant therein could have
             made a prayer for examining the legality of the
             allotments already made but as the applicant
             states in the writ petition filed in the Delhi High
             Court that he had no knowledge about the persons
             to whom such allotments had been made and in
             fact the Delhi High Court itself on a petition being

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                      28




             filed, called upon the respondents to submit the
             list of such allottees, whereafter notices could be
             issued to the allottees. That apart, when this
             Court     entertained   another   public    interest
             litigation, filed by Common Cause in respect of 15
             discretionary allotments made in favour of 15
             persons, the Court did entertain the same and
             instead of treating the earlier decision to be a bar
             and applying the principle of constructive res
             judicata, the Court relied upon the same and
             cancelled the allotments made in favour of those
             15 persons who had been arrayed as parties to the
             said petition filed under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_33">Article 32.</a> That apart,
             the writ petitions, the judgments of which are the
             subject-matter of challenge in these appeals, had
             been filed in the Delhi High Court and were
             pending when Common Cause case was taken up by
             this Court. This Court initially stayed the
             proceedings and issued notice in the transfer
             petitions but ultimately, vacated the stay order
             and instead of bringing the writ petitions to this
             Court on transfer, directed the Registry of the
             Court to send the petitions along with the
             annexures to the High Court and required the
             High Court to examine the issues involved in the
             writ petitions and go into the validity of the
             allotments of petrol pumps/gas agencies to various
             persons. In view of the aforesaid positive
             direction in para 31 of the judgment of this Court
             in Common Cause case it is difficult for us to
             sustain the plea of bar of constructive res
             judicata, as urged by the counsel, appearing for

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                        29




             the appellants. In this connection, the counsel also
             brought to our notice, observation made in the
             review petition judgment in Common Cause case,
             [(1999) 6 SCC 667] SCC in para 115, which is
             quoted hereinbelow in extenso: (SCC p. 733)
             "115. It is contended that since the allotments
             made by the petitioner till the filing of the writ
             petition in this Court, in spite of a challenge having
             been raised therein, were not set aside and only
             guidelines were settled for future exercise of
             discretionary quota, tacit stamp of judicial
             approval shall be deemed to have been placed on
             the allotments made by the petitioner and
             consequently those allotments could not have been
             reopened on the principle of constructive res
             judicata. Normally, we would have accepted this
             argument, but in this case we cannot go to that
             extent."
             According to the learned counsel, the three-Judge
             Bench accepted the contention of the applicability
             of principle of constructive res judicata and,
             therefore, this Bench being a two-Judge Bench
             must be bound by the said observations or in the
             alternative, may refer the matter to a larger
             Bench. We are not in a position to accept either of
             these submissions. It may be stated at the outset
             that the three-Judge Bench was concerned with
             the review petition that had been filed in relation
             to the order dated 4-11-1996 since reported in
             Common Cause. The learned Judges committed an
             error in the beginning in thinking that the review
             petition filed by Capt. Satish Sharma was in

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                     30




             relation to both the judgments viz. Common Cause
             as well as Common Cause. In the review petition,
             the Court was concerned with the correctness of
             the directions contained in the order dated 4-11-
             1996 to institute criminal prosecution against the
             Minister concerned and levy of penalty as
             exemplary damages to the tune of Rs 50 lakhs. It
             is in that context the Court made the aforesaid
             observations not noticing the fact that in Common
             Cause the Court had earlier directed the High
             Court to dispose of the two writ petitions pending
             in the High Court and decide the legality of the
             order of discretionary allotment made by the
             Minister concerned. It is indeed interesting to
             notice that in para 125 of the judgment of the
             three-Judge Bench, the Court itself had indicated
             that the conduct of the Minister concerned in
             making allotments of petrol outlets was atrocious
             and reflects a wanton exercise of power by the
             Minister. But what the Court wanted to examine
             and ultimately held was that the said action fell
             short of "misfeasance in public office" which is a
             specific tort and the ingredients of that tort
             were not wholly met in the case, so that there was
             no occasion to award exemplary damages. It would
             indeed be a travesty of justice to accept the
             submission of the counsel for the appellants that
             the three-Judge Bench expressed an opinion that
             the principle of constructive res judicata would
             apply to the case in hand, so as to debar the High
             Court from entertaining the writ petitions and
             disposing of them on merits. As we have already

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                      31




             noted, prior to the three-Judge Bench judgment
             of this Court, the selfsame order of the Delhi
             High Court had been assailed in as many as 79
             cases by approaching this Court by way of special
             leave petitions and all those petitions had been
             dismissed.


             20. The extent to which corruption in the
             governing structure has corroded the very core of
             our      democracy, the    notoriety     which    the
             discretionary allotment of petroleum dealership
             and LPG gas agencies had acquired, the earlier
             petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_34">Article 32</a> entertained by this
             Court at the behest of Common Cause, the
             cancellation of 15 of such allotments and finally,
             the express direction therein to the High Court to
             dispose of the pending writ petitions after
             examining the individual cases, it is difficult for us
             to accept the bar of principle of constructive res
             judicata on the ground that the earlier judgment
             in the case of Centre for Public Interest
             Litigation has accorded any tacit approval or the
             subsequent so-called observation made in the
             three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in the
             review petition. We, therefore, unhesitatingly hold
             that the aforesaid contention is devoid of any
             substance."



16.But, as rightly pointed out by the learned senior

  counsel          appearing    for    the    10th    respondent,    the

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                       32




  aforesaid            judgment     of   the    Apex     Court    in V.

  Purushotham Rao (supra) was distinguished by the

  Apex Court in its subsequent judgment in <a href="/doc/1488906/" id="a_35">Moumita

  Poddar v. Indian Oil Corporation Limited</a>                    [(2010) 9

  SCC 291], where, it was held to have been rendered

  in the peculiar facts of the case.                      The relevant

  findings of the Apex Court contained in paragraph

  43 reads thus:


                   "43. In our opinion, the aforesaid judgment in
             V. Purushotham Rao case was rendered under some
             very peculiar and exceptional circumstances. It was
             a case where allotment of retail outlets or
             petroleum products had been made by a Minister in
             violation   of  all  norms   while   exercising  his
             discretionary powers for making the allotments.
             These allotments had been made in the absence of
             any guidelines. The circumstances were such that
             this     Court was    constrained   to   make   the
             observations relied upon by the learned Single
             Judge which are as under: (SCC pp. 334-35, para
             23)
             "23. So far as the fifth question is concerned, it is
             no doubt true that the appellants have invested
             considerable amount in the business and have
             operated it for about eight years but even on
             equitable considerations, we do not find any equity
             in favour of the appellants. The conduct of the

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                      33




             Minister in making the discretionary allotments has
             been found to be atrocious, in the very three-
             Judge Bench decision of this Court and in relation
             to similar allotments made by the said Minister in
             favour of 15 persons, who were respondents in
             Common Cause case. This Court came to hold that
             the allotments of the public property had been
             doled out in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner
             and     the appellants   had   been   held   to    be
             beneficiaries   of   such   arbitrary    orders    of
             allotments. The question of granting the allottees
             relief on an equitable consideration did not arise at
             all, for the same reasons in a case like this, a
             sympathetic consideration on the ground of equity
             would be a case of misplaced sympathy and we
             refrain from granting any relief on any equitable
             consideration. In our view, the appellants do not
             deserve any equitable consideration."
             The above observations make it abundantly clear
             that this Court was dealing with a situation where
             the Minister concerned had bestowed undue favour
             on the appellants in that case. Such is not a
             situation in the present case. Therefore, the
             aforesaid    observations   would    be   of    little
             assistance to the appellant herein."



17.From the above principles laid down by the Apex

  Court in the various judgments that were cited

  before         us,    it   is   obvious     that     the     principles

  contained in section 11 of the Code of Civil

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                       34




  Procedure are equally applicable to public interest

  litigations.            This is all the more so in the light

  of Explanation VI to section 11 of CPC.



18.Having thus seen the law on the subject, we shall

  proceed           to   examine      whether      the    present   writ

  petitions are barred by any of these principles.

  The prayers in W.P(C).26435/13 are the following:


             "i) issue a writ of certiorari, any other appropriate

             Objection Certification to the project proposed by
             the 3rd respondent" and

             xiii) pass such other orders as this Hon'ble Court
             may be pleased to grant on the facts and
             circumstances of the case."



19. Similarly, the prayers in W.P(C).31081/13 are

  the following:

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                     37




             "i) Call for the records in Ext.P1 to P8 and quash

             Ext.P14 by issuing a Writ of Certiorari or any
             other appropriate Writ.

             vi) Pass such other orders that this Hon'ble
             Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and
             circumstances of the case."



20. Admittedly, W.P(C).36882/10 resulting in Ext.R10

  (b) judgment was rendered at a time when Sri.Yusuff

  Ali M.A. was chosen as the lessee and Ext.P19

  letter of allotment was issued to him, describing

  him as the Managing Director of the 10th respondent

  company.            In that writ petition, this Court upheld

  the choice of the 5th respondent therein, viz.,

  Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A. for the grant of lease in

  pursuance of the tenders invited and declined the

  reliefs sought for.              In view of the issues that

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                 38




  were raised before this Court, though we have

  accepted that the principles of res judicata are

  applicable to proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_40">Article 226</a> of the

  Constitution of India, as contended by the learned

  counsel for the Port Trust and the 10th respondent,

  such       application    of  the   said  principle  cannot

  extend beyond Ext.P19 herein.          Therefore, at best,

  the principles of res judicata can curtail the

  litigation only in so far as the choice of the

  lessee and the allotment to Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A.,

  the Managing Director of the 10th respondent as per

  Ext.P19 herein.          These principles cannot be further

  stretched to prevent the petitioners, who are not

  parties to the proceedings resulting in Ext.R10(b)

  judgment, from impugning the grant of lease in

  favour           of   the  10th   respondent,   a   company

  incorporated under the provisions of the Company's

  Act       or      the clearances  that  were   subsequently

  granted by the concerned authorities, including the

  environmental           clearance,   integrated    consent,

  exemption from Town Planning Act or the building

  permit which are also subject matter of challenge

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                   39




  in these writ petitions.             Therefore, we are not

  persuaded to reject these writ petitions in its

  totality, accepting the plea of res judicata raised

  by the learned counsel for the respondents.



21.The first issue raised by the counsel for the

  petitioners was that the Port Trust did not have

  ownership           over  the land leased  out  to  the 10th

  respondent and therefore, it could not have leased

  out the land in question.           According to the learned

  counsel,             Ext.R1(b) dated   21.6.2006    is   the

  notification issued by the Government of India in

  exercise of its powers under the provisions of the

  <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_41">Indian Ports Act</a>, 1908 and the <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_42">Major Port Trusts Act</a>,

  1963, defining the port limits, which is subject to

  existing ownership of the land.         He made reference to

  the provisions in the Kerala Land Assignment Act,

  1960, Kerala Land Conservancy Act, 1957 and the

  Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994 to contend that the

  land reclaimed is Government land.           Counsel for the

  Petitioners also referred us to Ext.P2 possession

  certificate and Ext.P21 extract of the basic tax

  register issued by the Village Officer where the

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                    40




  property in question has been shown as puramboke and

  Government           owned.    He   also contended  that  the

  Mulavukadu Panchayat staked a claim over the land and

  referred to Ext.R5(a) letter dated 5.10.2011 issued

  by the Port Trust, produced along with the counter

  affidavit filed by the Panchayat, denying the claim

  and      asserting       its   ownership over   the  land in

  question.            According to him, the provisions of the

  <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_43">Major        Port     Trusts   Act</a>  only  indicate  that  the

  properties of the Government are vested in the Board

  of Trustees of the Cochin Port Trust and that such

  vesting          is    only   for   the limited   purpose  of

  administration and management and did not amount to

  vesting of ownership and title in the Board of

  Trustees.



22.On the other hand, this contention was strongly

  refuted by the Port Trust.            They referred us to the

  provisions of the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_44">Indian Ports Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_45">Major Port

  Trusts Act</a> falling within entry 27 of list I to

  schedule VII of the Constitution of India and also

  Exts.R1(f) and R1(b) notifications issued by the

  Government           of  India  in  the year  2001  and  2006

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                  41




  respectively, to contend that the leased land is

  within the port limits, and that except those under

  existing ownership, rest of the lands are vested in

  the Board of Trustees and that it includes the land

  reclaimed by the port.           Counsel referred us to the

  provisions of <a href="/doc/1513100/" id="a_46">Article 295 (1)(a)</a> of the Constitution

  of      India        and Ext.R10(f)  agreement between   the

  Government of India and the Port Trust and also

  Ext.R1(g)            and R1(i) settling  ownership  disputes

  between the Government of Kerala and other agencies

  which recognised the ownership of the Cochin Port

  Trust over the land vested in it and also on other

  lands reclaimed by it.           Counsel also submitted that

  so far the Government of Kerala have not staked any

  ownership claim over the lands held by the Port, a

  dispute regarding title to the land could not be gone

  into in a writ proceedings instituted by strangers

  and much less in a Public Interest Litigation. This

  contention of the Cochin Port Trust was supported by

  the Government of Kerala and the senior counsel

  appearing for the 10th respondent.

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                   42




23.The Port of Cochin was in existence even in the pre-

  constitution era and was a part of the State of

  Travancore-Cochin          before  the commencement  of  the

  Constitution of India.             It is said to have been

  formed in 1341, when the heavy floods of that year

  silted up the mouths of the Musiris harbour and the

  surging waters forced a channel past the present

  inlet into the sea. By virtue of <a href="/doc/1513100/" id="a_47">Article 295 (1)(a)</a>

  of the Constitution of India, all property and assets

  which immediately before its commencement were vested

  in      any      Indian   State  corresponding to  a   State

  specified in Part B of the First Schedule shall vest

  in the Union, if the purposes for which such property

  and       assets      were  held   immediately before   such

  commencement will thereafter be purposes of the Union

  relating to any of the matters enumerated in the

  Union List.           There cannot be any dispute that ports

  declared by or under law made by Parliament or

  existing law to be major ports, including their

  delimitation, and the constitution and powers of port

  authorities therein falls under entry 27 of the Union

  list under Schedule VII to the Constitution of India.

  Therefore, as a result of <a href="/doc/1513100/" id="a_48">Article 295(1)(a</a>), all

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                 43




  properties and assets of the Port of Cochin which

  were vested in the State of Travancore-Cochin before

  the commencement of the Constitution, vested in the

  Government of India.          It was accordingly that the

  Port of Cochin was administered as a Department of

  the Government of India and was governed by the

  <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_49">Indian Ports Act</a>.           This position continued till

  29.2.1964 when the <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_50">Major Port Trusts Act</a>, 1963 was

  made applicable to the Port of Cochin.              It was

  thereafter that the Board of Trustees of the Cochin

  Port Trust came into existence.



24.<a href="/doc/1179015/" id="a_51">Section 4</a> of the Indian Ports Act, 1908 conferred

  power on the Central Government to extend or withdraw

  the Act or certain provisions thereof to or from any

  port.        Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1656662/" id="a_52">section 4</a> provided that any

  notification issued under clauses (a) or (b) of

  <a href="/doc/475057/" id="a_53">section 4(1)</a> shall define the limits of the area to

  which it refers.          <a href="/doc/649514/" id="a_54">Section 4(3)</a> also provided that

  limits of the Port defined under sub section (2) may

  include          piers, jetties, landing-places,   wharves,

  quays, docks and other works made on behalf of the

  public for convenience of traffic, for safety of

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                 44




  vessels, or for the improvement, maintenance or good

  Government of the port and its approaches, whether

  within or without high-water-mark, and, subject to

  any rights of private property therein, any portion

  of the shore or bank within fifty yard of high-water-

  mark.            <a href="/doc/1179409/" id="a_55">Section 2(q)</a> of the Major Port Trusts Act

  defines 'Port' as any major port to which the said

  Act applies within such limits as may, from time to

  time, be defined by the Central Government for the

  purposes of the Act by notification in the official

  gazette.             It is  also  provided  that until  a

  notification is so issued within such limits as may

  have been defined by the Central Government under the

  provisions of the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_56">Indian Ports Act</a>.



25.In so far as it is relevant for the purposes of

  these cases, it is sufficient to notice that Ext.R1

  (f) dated 26.2.2001 and Ext.R1(b) dated 21.6.2006 are

  the latest two notifications issued by the Central

  Government in exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/315990/" id="a_57">section 5</a>

  of the Indian Ports Act, which empower the Central

  Government to alter the limits of any port, and

  <a href="/doc/1179409/" id="a_58">section 2(q)</a> of the Major Port Trusts Act.       Clauses 1

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                       45




  to      4     in     Ext.R1(b)    notification     dated    21.6.2006

  defines the northern, southern, western and eastern

  boundaries of the Cochin port and clause 5 thereof

  provides the additional areas which are also included

  within the notified limits of the port.                  In so far as

  it is relevant, clause 5(a) reads thus:


             "5. (a) all land belonging to the Cochin Port Trust
             and any areas reclaimed from the backwaters or
             the sea and that may be reclaimed within the

               on the Edacochin shore in position Latitude 9o 55'
               10'' N, Longitude 76o 17' 30'' E and thence along
               the High Water mark on the Mattancherry shore
               via Cochin Harbour entrance to a point on the
               western shore near Chellanam in position Latitude
               9o 48' 12'' N, Longitude 76o 16' 24'' E and
               thence to a position "B" in the sea 12 nautical
               miles due West in Latitude 9o 48' 12'' N,
               Longitude 76o 04' 36'' E.

          3. The western boundary shall be a straight line
               joining positions "A" and "B" as defined in paras 1
               and 2 above.

          4. The Eastern boundary shall be along the High
               Water mark along the foreshores from a point on
               the southern end of Thevara in position Latitude
               9o 55' 30'' N, Longitude 76o 18' 15'' E to a point
               on Ernakulam foreshore in position Latitude 10o
               00' 44.5'' N, Longitude 76o 16' 24.7'' E and
               thence to a point on the north western boundary
               of Cheranelloore in position Latitude 10o 04' 12''
               N, Longitude 76o 16' 57'' E.

          5. In addition to the above, the following shall also
               be included, namely:-

          (a) all land belonging to the Cochin Port Trust and
               any areas reclaimed from the backwaters or the

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                     48




               sea and that may be reclaimed within the limits
               specified above and accretion becoming within
               these limits;

          (b) all waterways connected to the backwaters
               within these limits;

          (c) all existing Port installations and future
               constructions like wharves, jetties, bridges etc.
               made     for  Port  purposes   and   for   public
               convenience.


27.Reading of the above statutory notification issued

  under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_61">Indian Ports Act</a> and the

  <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_62">Major Port Trusts Act</a> shows that the areas specified

  within the boundaries mentioned in the notifications

  and in addition to the above, the lands already

  reclaimed           and  which   may   be   reclaimed     in  future

  together with accretions thereto mentioned in clause

  5, are the properties vested in the Port Trust.



28. The leased land falls within the limits of the Port

  as notified in Exts.R1(f) and R1(b) and it being

  reclaimed by the Cochin Port Trust is owned by

  itself.               The     contention       raised      by    the

  learned counsel for the petitioners is that the Port

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                  49




  Trust did not have ownership over the land in view of

  the        provisions     contained  in   the  Kerala   Land

  Assignment Act, 1960, Kerala Land Conservancy Act,

  1957 and the Panchayat Raj Act, 1994.            The Kerala

  Land Assignment Act, 1960 provides for assignment of

  Government lands and in <a href="/doc/958497/" id="a_63">section 2</a>, the bed of the sea

  and harbours and creeks below high water mark are

  also included.           In this Act, back-waters and water

  courses are also declared to be Government lands.



29.Similar is the case with Kerala Land Conservancy

  Act, 1957.           In <a href="/doc/240947/" id="a_64">section 3</a>, which defines property of

  the Government, all public roads, bed of the sea and

  the harbours and creeks below high water mark, the

  beds and banks of rivers, back waters and water

  courses are also included. It is also true that

  sections 169 and 218 of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act

  provide         for   vesting  of the  public  roads,  water

  courses          etc  that  are  mentioned  therein  in  the

  Panchayat.           It is with reference to these statutory

  provisions, it was argued before us that the property

  leased out by the Port Trust was not owned by it and

  therefore, it had no right to lease it out also.

                                   50




30.However, we are unable to accept this contention.

  First        of      all, disputes relating  to  title   and

  ownership of immovable properties, it is trite, are

  not matters which are capable of resolution in writ

  petitions, much less in Public Interest Litigations.

  Secondly, the Government of Kerala have not staked

  any ownership claim over the land reclaimed by the

  Port and so long as such a dispute has not been

  raised by the Government, this Court should not

  venture into adjudication of such disputed factual

  controversies at the instance of strangers.        Thirdly,

  from what we have already explained in the earlier

  paragraphs of this judgment, the Cochin Port was a

  part of the State of Travancore-Cochin which came to

  be vested in the Union of India in view of the

  provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1513100/" id="a_65">Article 295(1)(a)</a> of the

  Constitution of India.          It continued as a Department

  of the Government of India and was governed by the

  <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_66">Indian Ports Act</a>, 1908 until the <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_67">Major Port Trusts

  Act</a>, 1963 was extended to the Port of Cochin with

  effect from 29.2.1964.

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                      51




31. On the implementation of the <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_68">Major Port Trusts Act</a>,

  1963,        by     virtue of    the    provisions    contained in

  <a href="/doc/129736/" id="a_69">section          29</a>    of the    said     Act,     the assets  and

  liabilities of the Central Government came to be

  transferred           to  the   board     of    trustees and   this

  included all properties, assets and funds vested in

  the Central Government or any other authority for the

  purposes of the Port immediately before the appointed

  date.



32.The question whether vesting of the properties in

  the Board of Trustees is for the limited purpose of

  administration and management or whether with the

  vesting, the ownership of the properties is vested in

  the      Board       of  Trustees,     is    to   be  decided  with

  reference            to  the    nature      of    the  vesting   as

  contemplated under <a href="/doc/129736/" id="a_70">section 29</a> of the Major Port

  Trusts Act.            <a href="/doc/954543/" id="a_71">Section 29(1)(a)</a> being relevant reads

  thus:


                   "29. Transfer of assets and liabilities of
             Central Government, etc., to Board- (1) As from
             the appointed day in relation to any port-

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                       52




             (a) all property, assets and funds and all rights to
               levy rates vested in the Central Government or,
               as the case may be, any other authority for the
               purposes of the port immediately before such
               day, shall vest in the Board;"


  This provision shows that in relation to any port, as

  from the appointed day, all property, assets and

  funds and all rights to levy rates vested in the

  Central Government for the purposes of the port

  immediately before the appointed day shall vest in

  the Board.



33.The Apex Court had occasion to consider the meaning

  of the word 'vesting' in the context of a similar

  provision           contained     in   section   12(1)(a)      of the

  International Airport Authority Act, 1971 in its

  judgment           in  <a href="/doc/1983849/" id="a_72">Municipal      Commissioner      of    Dum Dum

  Municipality             v.      Indian     Tourism       Development

  Corporation</a> [(1995) 5 SCC 251], where, a claim for

  the benefit of <a href="/doc/1353284/" id="a_73">Article 285</a> was raised to resist the

  demand made by the Municipal Corporation.                      In its

  judgment,           the  Apex    Court    made  reference      to the

  provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1187760/" id="a_74">section 12</a> of the Act and

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                        53




  <a href="/doc/1041425/" id="a_75">section 12(1)(a)</a> alone being relevant, is extracted

  below for reference:



                     "12.(1) Save as otherwise provided in sub-
             section (2), as from such date as the Central
             Government may appoint by notification in the
             Official Gazette in relation to any airport,-
                 (a) all properties and other assets vested in the
                 Central Government for the purposes of the
                 airport and administered by the Director
                 General of Civil Aviation immediately before
                 such day shall vest in the Authority;"



34.Thereafter, the Apex Court examined the various

  provisions of the Act and answered the contention

  against the Authority by holding thus:



             "For all the above reasons, we are of the opinion
             that the International Airports Authority of India
             is a statutory corporation distinct from the
             Central Government and that the properties
             vested in it by <a href="/doc/1187760/" id="a_76">Section 12</a> of the Act cannot be
             said to have been vested in it only for proper
             management.       After the date of vesting, the
             properties so vested are no longer the properties
             of the Union of India for the purpose of and
             within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1353284/" id="a_77">Article 285.</a> The vesting of
             the said properties in the Authority is with the

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                       54




             object of ensuring better management and more
             efficient operation of the airports covered by the
             Act. Indeed that is the object behind the very
             creation of the Authority. But that does not mean
             that it is a case of limited vesting for the purpose
             of better management."



35.Relying on the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_78">Major Port Trusts

  Act</a>, a similar contention was raised by the Board of

  Trustees of the Visakhapatnam Port Trust.                     That was

  considered by the Apex Court in Board of Trustees for

  the      <a href="/doc/1521828/" id="a_79">Visakhapatnam        Port     Trust    v.   State    of  A.P</a>.

  [(1996) 6 SCC 78].            In that judgment, relying on the

  judgment           in  Municipal      Commissioner       of   Dum Dum

  Municipality (supra), the Apex Court negatived the

  claim of the Port Trust holding thus:


             "4. We do not think that this argument has any
             basis. This Court in <a href="/doc/1983849/" id="a_80">Municipal Commr. of Dum Dum
             Municipality   v.  Indian    Tourism   Development
             Corporation</a> (1995) 5 SCC 251, considered the
             same argument in the case of International
             Airport Authority that the vesting of the
             properties was only for the purpose of managing
             those properties and ownership of the properties
             did not vest in the authority. In that case this
             Court was deliberating the provisions of the

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                     55




             <a href="/doc/988937/" id="a_81">International Airports Authority Act</a>, 1971 under
             which International Airport Authority of India
             was constituted. The provisions of that Act are
             pari materia with the <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_82">Major Port Trust Act</a>, 1963
             regarding the constitution, property and contracts
             and supersession. It is not necessary to quote the
             provisions of the <a href="/doc/988937/" id="a_83">International Airports Authority
             Act</a>, 1971 to show that how they are similar to the
             provisions in the <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_84">Major Port Trust Act</a>, 1963.This
             Court negatived the argument that the properties
             vested in the International Airport Authority of
             India     for the  purpose   of  managing   those
             properties and that the ownership of these
             properties continued to be with the Central
             Government. The Court held that the properties
             vest in the International Airport Authority of
             India and it could not be said that the Central
             Government owned the properties. Board in the
             present case is not a department of the Central
             Government rather it has the attributes of a
             company.     It is  distinct  from   the   Central
             Government. It cannot, therefore, claim exemption
             from taxation under <a href="/doc/1353284/" id="a_85">Art. 285</a> of the Constitution."


36.It is therefore obvious that the vesting of the

  assets in the Board of Trustees by virtue of <a href="/doc/954543/" id="a_86">section

  29(1)(a)</a> of the Major Port Trusts Act is not a

  restricted vesting for the purpose of administration

  and management.            Instead, with the vesting of the

  properties in the Board of Trustees, the Government

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                   56




  of India has ceased to have ownership rights over the

  properties so vested and the Port Trust became the

  absolute owner of the property vested in it. In

  addition to this, the land reclaimed by it within the

  port limits that are notified from time to time, the

  last of which are Exts.R1(b) and R1(f), are also

  properties owned by the Port Trust.



37.The       land      leased  out  by  the  Port  to the  10th

  respondent, admittedly, is reclaimed from out of back

  waters, which is within the port limits, notified by

  the Government of Kerala.           Such a plot of land,  on

  the      materials       produced,  certainly  is  under  the

  absolute ownership of the Port Trust and is governed

  by the provisions contained in the <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_87">Major Port Trusts

  Act</a>, 1963 enacted under entry 27 of list I of the VII

  Schedule of the Constitution of India.          In respect of

  such a land, the provisions of the Kerala Land

  Assignment Act, 1960 or the Land Conservancy Act,

  1957 cannot have any application.             Similar is the

  situation with respect to the provisions of the

  Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994,             <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_88">Sections 169</a> and

  <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_89">218</a> of which provide for vesting of the properties

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                  57




  mentioned therein in the panchayats.           In any case,

  the legislative power to these enactments are to be

  traced to entries in list II to the VII Schedule of

  the Constitution of India, whereas the legislative

  power in respect of <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_90">Indian Ports Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1527/" id="a_91">Major Port

  Trusts Act</a> are traceable to entry 27 of list I to VII

  Schedule.            This means  that  acceptance  of   the

  contention raised by the petitioners would even lead

  to a situation of inconsistency between laws made by

  the Parliament and the laws made by the Legislature

  of States as contemplated in <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_92">Article 254</a> of the

  Constitution of India.            We, therefore, reject the

  contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners

  that the Port Trust did not have ownership over the

  property leased out and that the properties are under

  the ownership of the State Government.



38.The second contention raised was that the land in

  question could not have been leased out for the

  purposes mentioned in the tender notice and lease

  deed.         This contention was raised on the basis that

  in Ext.P1, the agenda for the meeting of the Board of

  Trustees            held on  9.3.2005,  the   proposal  for

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                   58




  reclamation was placed on the basis that as per the

  agreement executed by DPI for ICTT, more land has to

  be provided to them at Vallarpadam than earlier

  contemplated          at  the  time of  preparation  of the

  proposal for Special Economic Zone.           It was stated

  that       sufficient     area  will  not  be  available  at

  Vallarpadam and that in order to provide additional

  land area adjacent to Vallarpadam for the future

  development plan of Cochin Port Trust, it is proposed

  to reclaim about 8 hectares of land on the western

  side       of      Bolgatty Island  and  that  the  proposed

  reclamation will also enable streamlining of flow at

  this area and would give a better appearance for the

  shoreline.           It was this proposal which was approved

  by the Board of Trustees vide Ext.P1(a) resolution

  No.64.         It was contended that such a land reclaimed

  for specific purposes, which are mentioned in the

  proposal and the resolution, could not have been

  leased         out    for  setting up  of  hotels/  resorts/

  convention centres /shopping malls/commercial /office

  complexes and allied facilities, mentioned in the

  tender notice.

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                   59




39.It is true that the land in question was reclaimed

  on the basis of the proposal contained in Ext.P1.

  However, it is a fact that till 2010, or even when

  the      lease       was executed,  the land  was  remaining

  unutilized.            Therefore, the Port Trust, by Ext.P3

  letter, sought the permission of the Government of

  India to lease it out on long term basis.              This

  request of the Port Trust was accepted and permission

  sought for was granted by the Government of India

  vide Ext.P4 letter.             It was thereafter that the

  tender notice was published by the Port Trust.          This

  means that the Port Trust had completed all necessary

  formalities before inviting tenders.          Secondly, land

  policy guidelines issued by the Government of India,

  including the one dated 8.3.2004 and Ext.R1(d) dated

  13.1.2011,           permit  leasing out  unutilized  lands.

  Therefore, the fact that land was reclaimed for a

  particular object does not mean that if the stated

  object is not achieved, the land should not be

  profitably utilized by the Port Trust in any other

  manner.

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
                                  60




40.One another issue raised was as to whether the

  project in question could be executed in the property

  leased out by the Cochin Port Trust.                 In this

  context, reference was made to clause 9 of Ext.P19,

  the letter of the Cochin Port Trust allotting the

  land to the 10th respondent, which states that it

  shall be the responsibility of the lessee to obtain

  necessary statutory clearances including that under

  the notification relating to Coastal Regulations Zone

  (CRZ for short).          This provision is also incorporated

  in Ext.R10(a) tender document and the lease deed.

  The statutory clearances that are required are the

  clearances           from   the  Coastal   Zone    Management

  Authority, under the Town Planning Act, the building

  permit under the relevant Building Rules and Consent

  from the Kerala State Pollution Control Board.



41. The main controversy in this context was with

  respect          to   Ext.P12, the  Government  Order  dated

  27.7.2013, granting special permission to the 10th

  respondent relaxing the structure plan for Central

  City, Kochi and the applicable town planning schemes.

</p><p id="p_8">                   2) As per the letter read as 3rd paper above,
             the Chief Town Planner has reported the area falls
             within the 'Structure Plan for Central City, Kochi'
             sanctioned vide G.O.(Ms)No.103/91/LAD dated
             20/3/1991      and   revised   vide    G.O.(Ms)No.
             143/2007/LSGD dated 31/5/2007 and zoned as
             "Water Sheet" and permission can be accorded
             only subject to the provisions of the 'Structure
             Plan'.    It is also reported that the proposal
             submitted by the applicant, is not conformity with
             the zoning regulations of the "Structure Plan for
             Central City of Kochi".
</p>
<p id="p_9">                   3) As advised by the Chief Town Planner, the
             matter was placed before the Special Committee
             constituted under the provisions contained in item
             No.(ix) under clause 4.13 of the Sanctioned
             Structure Plan for Central City of Kochi published
             by      Notification  under   G.O.(MS)     No.143/
             2007/LSGD dated 31.5.2007. The said Committee
             under the chairmanship of the Secretary to
             Government, Local Self Government Department
             met on 18.6.2013 and decided, among other things,
             to request the Government to take up the matter
             at Government level for appropriate decision as the
             proposed project falls in the Water Sheet Use
             Category as per the Sanctioned Structure Plan and
             as such it does not come under the purview of the
             Committee.

</p><p id="p_11">                  4) The Chief Town Planner has also stated that
             the said land is the property of Government of
             India as per <a href="/doc/129736/" id="a_93">section 29</a> of the Major Port Trusts
             Act 1963 and Cochin Port Trust is the custodian.
             Further the Chief Town Planner reports that the
             project cost amounts to Rs.500 crores with direct
             employment around 1500 persons and indirect
             employment to 2500 persons and purpose of
             allotment of the above land is for setting up of
             Hotel/Resort/Convention centre/ Shopping Mall/
             Commercial / Office Complex and allied facilities
             and as per Port Trust this is also a port related
             activity which will enhance the arrival of tourist
             ships and thereby increasing the revenue to the
             port as well as the state at large. Therefore, the
             Chief Town Planner has requested to consider the
             project at Government level.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                 5) As per the letter read as 4th paper above the
             Cochin Port Trust has stated that the total extent
             of land is 10.59 hectare owned by it and leased to
             Shri.M.A.Yusuff Ali for 30 years from 09/2/2011
             with an option for renewal after thirty years for
             setting     up      of    Hotel/resorts/convention
             centre/shopping mall/ commercial /office complex
             and allied facilities through tender process. It is
             also reported that the land was reclaimed by the
             Cochin Port during the year 2005 with the approval
             of Port Trust Board vide its resolution No.64 of
             09/3/2005.

</p><p id="p_14">                    6) Government have examined the matter in
             detail. It is noticed that there is material error in
             the averment of the applicant. The land for the
             proposed    project    lies  in  Mulavukad    Grama
             Panchayath and as such Kerala Municipality Building
             Rules, 1999 is not applicable.          The Kerala
             Panchayath Building Rules 2011 doesn't have
             provision for such a committee.          During the
             sanctioning of the structure plan the said land was
             categorized as "Water Sheet" since the area was
             part of the back waters at that time. The Port
             reclaimed this area in 2005 with permission from
             Government of India. Therefore the area is no
             longer water sheet.      Even though the land was
             reclaimed, the area was not statutorily reassigned
             under any use in the structure plan till date. Since
             the area is reclaimed, it is no longer under 'water
             sheet' category. The area has to be zoned afresh
             in any one of the remaining two categories viz.
             Agriculture use and developed land. This can be
             done only through a variation of the structure plan
             under section 13 of the Town Planning Act 1108 ME
             (IV of 1108) and section 15 of Madras Town
             Planning Act 1920.      The whole process, includes
             statutory time period for publishing draft variation
             plan and review of objections and suggestions of
             general public.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                      7) The proposed project is a large scale
             investment which will attract further investments
             in the region, thereby benefiting the State at
             large, and it is anticipated as one of the landmarks

             project of Kochi.    Moreover, the applicant has
             obtained major clearances from the respective
             departments. Therefore, Government are pleased
             to accord Special permission to the Lulu Convention
             &amp; Exhibition Centre Pvt Ltd for the above
             mentioned construction in the land having an
             extent of 10.59 hectare in survey no.31/3, 31/20
             of Mulavukad Village in Mulavukad Panchayat of
             Ernakulam District relaxing zoning provisions of
             the Structure Plan for Central City, Kochi and
             other town planning schemes subject to the
             condition that the construction should satisfy the
             conditions stipulated in prevailing building rules and
             all other statutory provisions.
</p><p id="p_16">             8) Further necessary action in the matter will be
             taken     by  the   Secretary    Mulavukad      Grama
             Panchayath.

</p><p id="p_18">42.According to the petitioners, as held by a Division

  Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1066044/" id="a_94">Sayeesh Kumar v. State of

  Kerala</a> [2005(4) KLT 1027], the Government have no

  power to grant relaxation from the provisions of the

  Town Planning Scheme, viz., the structure plan for

  Central City, Cochin.                 They also referred us to

  Ext.P13 Government Order which was issued referring

  to      Sayeesh       Kumar     (supra)     and     cancelling   the

  Government Orders granting relaxation from the Town

  Planning Schemes.            It was also stated that Ext.P14

  building permit was issued based on the directions

  contained in Ext.P12 and that the same, having been

  issued without any application of mind and on the

  dictates of the Government, is vitiated.                      In this

  context, reference was also made to the judgment of

  the Apex Court in Joint Action Committee of Air Line

  Pilots' Association of India v. Director General of

  Civil        Aviation     [(2011)     5   SCC     435],    where, in

  paragraphs 26 to 28, it was held thus:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   "26. The contention was raised before the
                High Court that the Circular dated 29-5-2008
                has been issued by the authority having no
                competence, thus cannot be enforced. It is a
                settled legal proposition that the authority
                which has been conferred with the competence
                under the statute alone can pass the order. No
                other person, even a superior authority, can
                interfere with the functioning of the statutory
                authority. In a democratic set-up like ours,
                persons occupying key positions are not supposed
                to mortgage their discretion, volition and
                decision-making authority and be prepared to
                give way to carry out commands having no

                sanctity in law. Thus, if any decision is taken by
                a statutory authority at the behest or on
                suggestion of a person who has no statutory role
                to play, the same would be patently illegal. (<a href="/doc/986468/" id="a_95">Vide

                can pass the order. Even a senior official cannot
                provide for any guideline or direction to the

</p><p id="p_20">43.However, this contention was resisted on behalf of

  the State as well as the 10th respondent       by referring

  us to the provisions of the Town Planning Scheme

  itself.           According to them, there is no illegality

  whatsoever in the issuance of Ext.P12.         A reading of

  Ext.P12 itself shows that as per the structure plan

  for Central City Cochin, the area in question, which

  was reclaimed by the Port Trust way back in 2005, was

  classified as water sheet.           It is also stated in

  Ext.P12 that as a result of the reclamation of the

  land,        though    it  has ceased  to be  water  sheet,

  modification has not so far been effected to the

  structure plan in terms of section 13 of the Town

  Planning Act and that therefore, the structure plan

  remained unamended.           The contention raised by the

  petitioners is that as per the structure plan, so

  long as the area in question is a water sheet, the

  project in question is an impermissible one and that

  in the absence of any power to the Government to

  grant relaxation, Ext.P12 could not have been validly

  issued.

</p><p id="p_22">44.We have considered this submission. By notification

  dated 20.3.1991, the Government have sanctioned the

  structure plan (General Town Planning Scheme) for

  Central City of Cochin under section 12(2) of the

  Town Planning Act, 1108 ME.           This was subsequently

  varied by notification dated 13.4.1999.         The Scheme

  was again varied by notification dated 31.5.2007.        As

  per       clause      4.1 providing   for  the  nature   of

  regulations for the purpose of the Town Planning

  Scheme, a general land utilization pattern consisting

  of water sheet, agricultural use and developed land

  with specified uses have been prescribed for the

  Central City area.         Clause 4.2 deals with pattern of

  land utilization and it also provides that three

  major         categories   of   uses  prescribed  in   land

  utilization pattern are as given in table No.4.1,

  viz., (i) water sheet (ii) agricultural use and (iii)

  developed land.          Table 4.2 provides the prescribed

  uses in different categories of land.         In so far as

  this case is concerned, it is only relevant to state

  that after the tables, clause 4.13 providing for

  Other        Special   Provisions  have been  incorporated.

  This clause starts with the provision providing that

</p><p id="p_30">45.Before us, Government did not dispute that before

  its reclamation, the area in question was a part of

  the back waters and that the said part of the back

  waters formed part of the water sheet as per the Town

  Planing Scheme.            However, in truth and reality, with

  its reclamation in 2005, at least that part of the

  area which is reclaimed has ceased to be a water

  sheet.          Though, following the reclamation, the Town

  Planning Scheme has not been modified in terms of

  section 13 of the Town Planning Act and as a result,

  the area still continues in the scheme as water

  sheet, in truth and reality, it is not a water sheet.

  It cannot also be disputed that if the scheme is

  modified as per section 13 of the Town Planning Act,

  the area should fall within either of the remaining

  two      categories       of  uses prescribed in  the  land

  utilization pattern as per table 4.1 of the scheme,

  viz., agricultural use or developed land. The project

  in question is in an area of more than 10 hectares.

  The investment is in excess of Rs.50 crores and the

  direct employment projected is not less than 500.

  The project has also been recommended by a committee

  consisting of the officers mentioned in clause 4.13

</p><p id="p_31">  (ix).        In other words, the project satisfies all the

  conditions specified in clause (ix) (supra).



</p><p id="p_32">46.This means that irrespective of whether the land

  falls        in     agricultural use or  developed land, a

  project of the nature specified in clause 4.13 (ix)

  is permissible in both categories.           This therefore

  shows that at best, in this case, the Government can

  only be accused of a technical lapse or defect in

  permitting           the    project without   awaiting  for

  modification of the scheme, taking into account the

  reclamation of the land in 2005.          In view of the fact

  that       even      if  the  scheme is  modified,  the  uses

  prescribed           in  respect of  the  land  can  only  be

  agricultural use and developed land and that clause

  4.13(ix) permits implementation of the project in

  question in both the categories of lands, we feel

  that the fact that the Government has permitted the

  project without awaiting for a formal modification of

  the Town Planning Scheme need not be and should not

  be a good ground for invalidating the permission

  granted.            While saying so, we are not unmindful of

  the fact that in Ext.P12, it has been stated that a

  relaxation has been granted from the provisions of

  the Town Planning Act.           It is also true that as held

  by this Court in Sayeesh Kumar (supra) and as is

  evident from Ext.P13 Government Order, the Government

  have no power to grant relaxation from the Town

  Planning Scheme.           However, despite what is stated in

  Ext.P12, in effect, since the order in question

  cannot be construed as one relaxing the Town Planning

  Scheme, we are not inclined to find fault with

  Ext.P12          as   sought  for   in  the  writ  petitions.

  Therefore, this contention raised by the learned

  interfere with Ext.P12.

  subsequent           amendment, subject  to  the   conditions

  specified           therein.   In  sum  and   substance, the

  contention raised by the counsel for the petitioner

  was that if the 10th respondent had made true and

  correct declarations in the application submitted by

  it, the authority to consider the said application

  would have been the authority constituted by the

  Central Government under the EIA notification 2006

  and therefore, Ext.P3 order passed by the SEIAA,

  Kerala is without jurisdiction.

  10th     respondent              had   declared          that        'No     critically

  polluted area located within 15 km. Radius'.                                     Counsel

  also made reference to the concluding statement in

  Ext.P21 in the form of an undertaking furnished by

  the 10th respondent that the data and information

  given in the application and enclosures are true to

  the best of their knowledge and belief and that they

  were aware that in case any part of the date and

  will be treated as Category A if located in full or

  provisions of the EIA notification, the contention

  raised by the counsel for the petitioners was two

  fold.         First was that though the project as offered

  by the 10th respondent falls under Category B, by

  virtue of its close proximity to the protected Bird

  Sanctuary           and the critically  polluted industrial

  areas, the project should fall within Category A and

  that in respect of category A projects, as per clause

  2 of the EIA notification, the clearance required is

  that of the Central Government in the Ministry of

  Environment and Forests.           Secondly, the contention

  raised is that the 10th respondent had made deliberate

  concealment or submission of false or misleading

  information or data, attracting clause 8(vi) of the

  EIA       notification,     requiring  rejection of  their

  about 60 m. (areal distance) to the project site

  has been mentioned.            Under Column 11, they have

  stated that there is no critically polluted area

  located within 15 kms radius.          By producing Ext.P26

  Google map, the contention raised is that Eloor-

  Edayar Industrial Centre is situated within 8 kms

  from the project site and Ambala Mogal Industrial

  Cluster is situated within 10.5 kms distance from

  the project site.          Firstly, Ext.P26 cannot be taken

  as a conclusive proof of the areal or road distance

  between the two places.           Secondly, in Ext.P21, all

  that has been stated is that there is no critically

  polluted area located within 15 kms radius.             The

  petitioner           does not have   a  case  that  if  the

  distance is measured by road, the total distance to

  the areas in question would be less than 15 kms.

  There is also no material before this Court to

  conclude           that the statements   made  by  the 10th

  respondent in Ext.P21 was a deliberate concealment

  or submission of false or misleading information,

  which alone would attract clause 8(vi) of the EIA

  before us to hold that if the distance as claimed

  by the petitioner was mentioned in the application,

  that        would     have  made   any  difference in   the

  attended by those persons themselves.              Learned

  counsel pointed out that Ext.P17, the minutes of

  the 53rd meeting of the KCZMA shows that apart from

  the Chairman, Secretary and the Chairman of the

  Kerala State Pollution Control Board, the other

  participants of the meeting are not those who are

  mentioned in Ext.P18 notification.           Reference was

  the notification dated 21.7.2008, quorum for the

  senior officers in the State Government and having

  several responsibilities, have been empowered to

  depute their nominees to attend the meetings of the

  KCZMA.              Therefore,  if  the  nominees of   these

  officials            participate in   the meetings  of   the

  Authority, such meetings cannot be held to be

  invalid.            The petitioners do not have a case that

  the      participants       in  the  meetings  mentioned  in

  Exts.P17 and P19 are not nominees of the officers

  who are members of the KCZMA.            If that be so, the

  contention that the meeting has been attended by

  unauthorised persons and that for determining the

  quorum those participants should be excluded is

  only to be rejected and we do so.

  Environmental           Protection  Act  nor  in  the  Rules

  prescription of quorum for the meeting of the

  prescribing 2/3rd quorum mentioned in paragraph 8 of

  W.P(C).26435/13, is not incorporated in Ext.P18,

  the notification constituting the KCZMA and which

  superceded            the  earlier     notification.        Even

  otherwise, that does not mean that a meeting to be

  validly conducted, every member of the authority

  should         be    present.     According    to    us,  if the

  regulations which govern the KCZMA do not prescribe

  a quorum, the number of members who usually act in

  conducting the business of the KCZMA should be

  taken as constituting the quorum.                This view that

  we have taken is found in Re Tavistock Iron Works

  Co.,        Lyster's      Case    [(1876)    L.R.    4   Eq.233].

  Referring to this judgment, in Shackleton on the

  Law and Practice of Meetings, 7th Edition, it has

  been stated thus:

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">                     "Where the articles of association of a

             number who usually act in conducting the
             business of the company will constitute a
             quorum."

  held on 27.12.2012 was confirmed by the KCZMA only

  in its meeting held on 15.4.2013 as per Ext.P19.

  It is also true that the decision as reflected in

  Ext.P17 was forwarded to the State Environment

  Impact Assessment Authority on 29.1.2013 as per

  Ext.P16.             It is on this basis that the counsel

  contended that the minutes should not have been

  forwarded before its confirmation.          Though, going

  by the sequence of events, it is factually correct

  that the decision taken in the 53rd meeting of the

  KCZMA held on 27.12.2012 was forwarded to SEIAA

  much before its confirmation, learned counsel could

  not point out any legal infirmity in such a course

  of action adopted by the Authority.         We also do not

  find any irregularity on the part of the KCZMA,

  particularly when the minutes of the 53rd meeting

  were confirmed by the Authority in its subsequent

  meeting held on 15.4.2013.          However, we hasten to

  add that our conclusion could have been different,

  if the Authority had at least modified the minutes

  at the time when it was confirmed.

  seen,         though     a No   Development   Zone     has been

  prescribed within CRZ-III, areas falling within any

  notified port limits stands excluded from the Non

  Development Zone.           Admittedly, the area leased out

  to the 10th respondent is within the notified port

  limits.          Therefore, subject to the clearances that

  are required to be obtained in terms of the CRZ

  notification, 2011 and from the other statutory

  authorities,            a project     involving   construction

  activity,            like the   one   proposed   by    the 10th

  respondent, is a permissible activity within the

  CRZ-III.

</p><p id="p_127">74.The judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/387191/" id="a_119">Ratheesh v. State

  of Kerala</a> [2013 (3) KLT 840] which was confirmed by

  the Apex Court in Vaamika Island (Green Lagoon

  Resort) v. Union of India [2013 (3) KLT 677 (SC)]

  was        a     case    where   construction  activity   was

  undertaken in Vettilla Thuruthu Island which was

  classified in the Coastal Zone Management Plan

  prepared by the Kerala Coastal Zone Management

  Authority as 'Filtration Pond' and consequently,

  under CRZ-I.              It was seeking to challenge the

  classification of the property in the Coastal Zone

  Management Plan, the writ petition was filed.            This

  court and the Apex Court upheld the classification

  made        by       the  Kerala   Coastal  Zone   Management

  Authority and on that basis, held the construction

  made illegal.            It is true that in the judgment of

  the Apex Court, the importance of the Vembanadu

  lake has been taken note of and the need to

  preserve            it  for   future  generations  has   been

  highlighted.            However, having regard to the factual

  difference between the case dealt with in the

  consideration, where the land falls in CRZ-III, we

  are unable to place reliance on the reasoning

  contained            in  these   judgments  and   find   any

  illegality on the part of the authorities.               For

  that reason itself, we do not think it necessary to

  deal with the other judgments referred to earlier

  in any greater detail.

<p id="p_128">

</p><p id="p_129">75.One contention which was seriously urged by the

  counsel for the petitioners was that Ext.R10(a)

  tender was submitted by Sri.Yousuff Ali M.A. and

  that though this was the tender which was finally

  accepted by the Port Trust, the lease was granted

  to the 10th respondent, a company incorporated under

  the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_120">Companies Act</a>.           It was also his contention that

  there is serious irregularity in the evaluation of

  nor the 10th respondent satisfied the eligibility

  conditions specified in the tender notification.

  as per clause 10, the tender documents are non-

  transferable and that the tenderers must obtain the

  Tender Documents in their own name and submit their

  tenders directly.                Reference was also made to the

  minimum eligibility criteria prescribed in clause

  4.0 of the Instructions to Tenderers, which reads

  thus:

</p><p id="p_132">77. Learned counsel then referred us to clause             5.1

  (C)(d)(vii), which states that the tenderer should

  not submit their offer with any conditions/counter

  conditions anywhere in the tender documents and

  that the conditional tenders, if any, shall be

  summarily rejected.           Reference was then made to the

  General Conditions of Contract, in which, as per

  clause 1 (b), 'tenderer' has been defined as the

  person or persons, firm, corporation, consortium or

  company who submits the tender for the subject

  area.          Clause 7 deals with award of lease which

  provides that lease will be awarded to the tenderer

  whose tender has been declared as highest upfront

  premium and accepted by the Port.           In clause 10, it

  is      also        prescribed that  the  Port  Trust   will

  promptly             notify  the  successful   tenderer   by

  facsimile, confirmed by registered letter that its

  tender has been accepted.           In clause 12 which deals

  with execution of lease deed, it is also provided

  that successful tenderer shall execute lease deed

  agreement in the format at Annexure -I within 120

  days from the date of taking over of the premises

  and that all the costs and expenses for executing

  of lease agreement shall be borne by the successful

  tenderer.            In clause 5 of the Special Conditions

  to be satisfied by the Bidders, it is provided that

  the lessee shall obtain all statutory clearances as

  may be required as per law from the concerned

  department before execution/ commissioning of the

  project.             Clause 7 therein provides that proper

  environmental/ Pollution control safe guards as per

  law       must       be  incorporated  in  the design   and

  implementation of the project.
</p>
<p id="p_133">

</p><p id="p_134">78.All the aforesaid conditions of the tenders were

  pressed into service to impress upon us that the

  tender was submitted by Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A. and

  that even at the time when the tender was submitted

  or on the last date prescribed for opening of the

  tender on 27.7.2010, the 10th respondent company to

  which        the     lease  was  granted was  not  even  in

  existence in as much as the same was incorporated

  only on 5.10.2010.           This, according to the learned

  counsel,           is  a  major  irregularity which  should

  invalidate the lease. Another contention urged in

  this context was that neither the tenderer nor the

  10th respondent satisfied the eligibility criteria

  prescribed by the Port in the tender.                  We shall now

  examine the soundness of this contention.



</p><p id="p_135">79.It is apposite in this context to mention the

  limitations of an authority under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_121">Article 12</a> of the

  Constitution of India, which has been pithly put by

  the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1736797/" id="a_122">New Horizons Limited v. Union of

             the matter of entering into a contract, the
             State does not stand on the same footing as a
             private person who is free to enter into a
             contract with any person he likes. The State, in
             exercise of its various functions, is governed by
             the mandate of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_123">Article 14</a> of the Constitution
             which excludes arbitrariness in State action and
             requires the State to act fairly and reasonably.

             the discretion in the matter of selection of the
             person for award of the contract has to be
             exercised keeping in view the public interest
             involved in such selection. The decisions of this
             Court, therefore, insist that while dealing with
             the public, whether by way of giving jobs or
             entering into contracts or issuing quotas or
             licences or granting other forms of largesse, the
             Government cannot act arbitrarily at its sweet
             will and like a private individual, deal with any
             person it pleases, but its action must be in
             conformity with the standards or norms which
             are not arbitrary, irrational or irrelevant. It is,
             however, recognised that certain measure of
             "free play in the joints" is necessary for an
             administrative    body     functioning    in    an
             administrative sphere. [<a href="/doc/1281050/" id="a_124">See Ramana Dayaram

  Trust did not evaluate the tender received by it

  from Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A.              applying the tender

  conditions set by itself and to a pointed question

  put to the counsel for the Cochin Port Trust, the

  disappointing answer was that having regard to the

  fact that the bid received was the sole tender and

  having regard to the offer received, the Port

  accepted the tender.          In our view, the Port Trust

  appear to have compromised its tender conditions

  in its anxiety to accept the tender submitted by

  Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A. and this amounts to changing

  the rules of the game after the game has begun,

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">                "12. . . . . . . The High Court had taken the view
                that if a term of the tender having been deleted
                after the players entered into the arena it is
                like changing the rules of the game after it had
                began and, therefore, if the Government or the
                Municipal Corporation was free to alter the
                conditions fresh process of tender was the only
                alternative permissible. Therefore, we find that
                the course adopted by the High Court in the
                circumstances is justified because by reason of
                deletion of a particular condition the wider net
                will be permissible and a larger participation or
                more attractive bids could be offered."

<p id="p_149">86.However, the lease that was granted by the Port

  Trust has already been upheld by this court in

  Ext.R10(b)           judgment        in   W.P.(C)36882/10.         That

  judgment has attained finality.                    Therefore, in the

  light of the principles contained in Section 11 of

  the CPC and the principles laid down by the Apex

  Court,          the     issues      raised     by   the    petitioners

  questioning the grant of lease, cannot be reopened

  in these proceedings.

</p><p id="p_151">87.Yet another argument raised by the counsel for

  the petitioners was that though the tender in

  question was submitted by Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A.,

  lease was granted to the 10th respondent, a company

  incorporated under the Company's Act long after the

  submission and even the opening of the tender.            As

  we      have       already  mentioned,  the  last  date  for

  submission of the tender was 27.7.2010 and the 10th

  respondent           company   was  incorporated   only   on

  5.10.2010.            According to the learned counsel, if

  the        tender      was    submitted   by  a   particular

  individual or an entity, even if the tender is

  accepted, award of the tender could have been only

  to      the      tenderer   and  nobody  else.    Therefore,

  according to him, award of tender to the 10th

  respondent cannot be sustained.            In this context,

  reference was made not only to the tender document

  but also to Ext.P7, the resolution of the board of

  trustees           resolving  to  approve  the  proposal  to

  accept         offer    of  Sri.Yusuff  Ali  M.A.  and  this

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">                     "3. Based on the above factual aspects,
             question arises as to whether the demand of
             transfer fee is justifiable. It is true that the
             2nd petitioner had participated in the tender in
             his personal capacity.     But in the proforma
             submitted along with the tender he had
             specifically noted that implementation of the
             proposed project will be by a Company which will
             be incorporated with the 2nd petitioner as its
             Chief Promoter. All subsequent communications
             reveal that, even before awarding the tender
             the      2nd petitioner had  informed   the   1st
             respondent that such a Company was already
             incorporated and Company is going to implement
             the project.       At no point of time the 1st
             respondent had rejected or refused any of
             those communications nor they have denied
             acceptance of the 1st petitioner Company for
             implementation of the project.      Ext.P4 is a
             crucial document which indicate the allotment of
             lease on the basis of the tender.         It is
             mentioned therein that the lease is allotted to
             the 2nd petitioner in his capacity as Managing
             Director     of   the  1st petitioner  Company.</blockquote><p id="p_170">

             name of the 1st petitioner Company. Receipt for

             acceptance of money was also issued in the name
             of the 1st petitioner Company.            The 1st
             respondent      had   communicated    with   other
             authorities about awarding of the lease in favour
             of the 1st petitioner Company. Under the above
             mentioned circumstances prima facie, the 1st
             respondent is estopped from taking any stand
             that the tender was awarded only in favour of
             the 2nd petitioner in his personal capacity or that
             the payment of upfront premium was accepted
             from the 2nd petitioner in his personal capacity.

</p><p id="p_172">                   4. But, contention has been raised on behalf
             of the 1st respondent to the effect that if there
             is a transfer of the lessee at any point of time
             after acceptance of the tender, the same will
             amount to a transfer of ease as contemplated
             under the Land Policy Guidelines for major Ports
             formulated by the Government of India. A copy
             of the said Policy is produced as Ext.P12. Among
             various guidelines it is prescribed therein that,
             in case of lease granted on up front basis
             transfer     can  be   allowed  subject    to the
             transferee agreeing to pay revised lease rent as
             prevalent at the time of transfer, subject to
             revision from time to time in the light of the
             provisions    contained   in  the   original lease
             agreement. It provides that fee equal to 50%
             of the difference between the current up front
             premium and the original premium calculated for
             the balance lease period is to be collected as

             transfer fee. Learned Senior counsel appearing
             for the respondents contended that when the
             tender submitted by the 2nd petitioner was
             accepted a lease has been created or rather, a
             lease has came into existence. Therefore if the
             lease deed has to be executed in favour of the
             1st petitioner Company, it has to be treated as a
             transfer.        With     respect    to   various
             communications received from the 2nd petitioner,
             it is contended that no estoppel can be
             attributed against the respondents on the basis
             of such letters, because law insist for collection
             of such transfer fee.     Of course, it is to be
             accepted that there cannot be any estoppel
             against Statute. But it is pertinent to note that
             the 1st respondent had repeatedly indicated in
             various documents that the lease is created in
             favour of the 1st petitioner Company. Learned
             Senior      counsel    contended     that     the
             communications issued by the 2nd petitioner,
             prior to acceptance of the tender, will only
             indicate that he was making requests to issue all
             communications in the address as Managing
             Director of the 1st petitioner Company. But as
             already observed, Ext.P4 letter of allotment,
             Ext.P5 advise bill, Ext.P13 receipt acknowledging
             payment and Ext.P16 letter etc. will clearly
             indicate that the 1st respondent had on
             unequivocal terms mentioned that the lease is
             made in favour of the 1st petitioner.

WPC.26435/13 &amp; 31081/13
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">                                      139</span>




</p><p id="p_173">                       5. Even assuming that there was no
             acceptance of the 1st petitioner Company as
             Lessee from the side of the 2nd respondent and
             that there cannot be any estoppel against law, it
             is to be examined whether there is any transfer
             coming within the policy guidelines formulated
             by the Government of India. Ext.P12 indicate
             collection of transfer fee only with respect to
             transfer of lessee after creation of the lease.
             Crucial question is as to when the lease is coming
             into existence. Learned senior counsel on behalf
             of the respondents contended that the lease can
             be construed as created at the time when the
             tender was accepted.       But Sri.Suresh Kumar,
             learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of
             the petitioners pointed out that a lease can be
             created     only  by   virtue  of   a  registered
             instrument as provided under Section 107 of the
             Transfer of Properties Act, 1882. Per contra,
             learned     Senior   counsel   for   respondents
             contended that the parties will be at liberty to
             enter upon a lease and to ratify the action by
             execution of a registered instrument.      But as
             observed above, even if a view is adopted to the
             effect that the lease had came into existence
             even prior to execution and registration of the
             lease deed, there are clear admissions trough
             various documents from the side of the 1st
             respondent that the lease is created in favour
             of the 1st petitioner.

             respondents are estopped from adopting a stand

  that the judgment shows that the Port Trust did not

  bring to the notice of this Court several important

  factual          and    legal aspects such as   Ext.R10(b)

  Division Bench judgment of this Court in W.P(C).

  36882/10, where, the award of lease to Sri.Yusuff

  Ali      M.A.        was challenged by a  public  interest

  litigant, in which, after hearing the Port Trust,

  this Court specifically found in paragraph 3 of the

  judgment that respondent No.5 (Yusuff Ali M.A.) is

  the lessee chosen by the Port Trust by a process of

  inviting tenders from interested parties.          It was

  also found in paragraph 5 that the highest offer

  made was by Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A. and that the

  petitioner            therein was  not in a  position   to

  identify any person who was willing to offer an

  amount higher than what was offered by him.             In

  paragraph 6, it was also stated that the challenge

  in that writ petition was only to the choice of the

  5th respondent, Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A.         Finally, this

  absence of any other prospective bidder who is

  willing to offer an amount higher than what was

  offered by Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A., this Court would

  only be scuttling the decision of the Port without

  any benefit either to the Port or to the Public in

  general.            In other words, the fact that the lessee

  chosen by the Port Trust was Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A.

  has been found by a Division Bench of this Court in

  a judgment rendered after hearing the Port Trust.

  Ext.P19 allotting the land, the Port Trust has not

  recognised anybody other than Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A.

  as the lessee.            Similarly, the fact that somebody

  else has made payment of the amounts due from

  Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A. does not recognise the payee as

  rupees annually, chose not to pursue the matter

  further.           This, to our mind, is a serious lapse and

  misfeasance on the part of the Port Trust and is a

</p><p id="p_181">94. In this connection, learned senior counsel for

  the 10th respondent sought to support the contention

  of      the        Port  Trust  contending   that  the  10th

  respondent            is   a   company   incorporated   with

  Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A. as the Chief Promoter and that

  therefore,           there  is  no  transfer  of  lease   as

  contended by the counsel for the petitioners.           This

  contention           was  sought  to  be  substantiated   by

  relying on the principles laid down Apex Court

  judgment in <a href="/doc/1736797/" id="a_129">New Horizons Limited v. Union of India</a>

  [(1995) 1 SCC 478].           That was a case where awarding

  tender to NHL was impugned on the basis that it did

  not satisfy the experience criteria.            However, it

  was found that NHL was a joint venture company of

  certain          other   companies  and  that  those   joint

  venture partners had the prescribed experience.

  Taking into account that fact, the Apex Court held

  that while assessing the experience of NHL, the

  experience gained by the joint venture partners

  also can be reckoned.               This principle has been laid

  down by the Apex Court in paragraphs 23 to 26 thus:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">                 "23. Even if it be assumed that the requirement
             regarding   experience      as  set  out   in  the
             advertisement dated 22-4-1993 inviting tenders is
             a condition about eligibility for consideration of
             the tender, though we find no basis for the same,
             the said requirement regarding experience cannot
             be construed to mean that the said experience
             should be of the tenderer in his name only. It is
             possible to visualise a situation where a person
             having past experience has entered into a
             partnership and the tender has been submitted in
             the name of the partnership firm which may not
             have any past experience in its own name. That
             does not mean that the earlier experience of one
             of the partners of the firm cannot be taken into
             consideration. Similarly, a company incorporated
             under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_130">Companies Act</a> having past experience
             may undergo reorganisation as a result of merger
             or amalgamation with another company which may
             have no such past experience and the tender is
             submitted in the name of the reorganised company.</blockquote><p id="p_182">
</p><p id="p_183">             It could not be the purport of the requirement

             about experience that the experience of the
             company which has merged into the reorganised
             company cannot be taken into consideration
             because the tender has not been submitted in its
             name and has been submitted in the name of the
             reorganised   company    which   does   not  have
             experience in its name. Conversely there may be a
             split in a company and persons looking after a
             particular field of the business of the company
             form a new company after leaving it. The new
             company, though having persons with experience in
             the field, has no experience in its name while the
             original company having experience in its name
             lacks persons with experience. The requirement
             regarding experience does not mean that the offer
             of the original company must be considered
             because it has experience in its name though it
             does not have experienced persons with it and
             ignore the offer of the new company because it
             does not have experience in its name though it has
             persons having experience in the field. While
             considering the requirement regarding experience
             it has to be borne in mind that the said
             requirement is contained in a document inviting
             offers for a commercial transaction. The terms
             and conditions of such a document have to be
             construed from the standpoint of a prudent
             businessman. When a businessman enters into a
             contract    whereunder   some   work   is  to  be
             performed he seeks to assure himself about the
             credentials of the person who is to be entrusted
             with     the performance   of   the   work.  Such

             credentials are to be examined from a commercial
             point of view which means that if the contract is
             to be entered with a company he will look into the
             background of the company and the persons who
             are in control of the same and their capacity to
             execute the work. He would go not by the name of
             the company but by the persons behind the
             company.    While   keeping  in   view  the   past
             experience he would also take note of the present
             state of affairs and the equipment and resources
             at the disposal of the company. The same has to be
             the approach of the authorities while considering a
             tender received in response to the advertisement
             issued on 22-4-1993. This would require that first
             the terms of the offer must be examined and if
             they are found satisfactory the next step would
             be to consider the credentials of the tenderer and
             his ability to perform the work to be entrusted.
             For judging the credentials past experience will
             have to be considered along with the present state
             of equipment and resources available with the
             tenderer. Past experience may not be of much help
             if the machinery and equipment is outdated.
             Conversely lack of experience may be made good
             by improved technology and better equipment. The
             advertisement dated 22-4-1993 when read with
             the notice for inviting tenders dated 26-4-1993
             does not preclude adoption of this course of
             action. If the Tender Evaluation Committee had
             adopted this approach and had examined the
             tender of NHL in this perspective it would have
             found that NHL, being a joint venture, has access

             to the benefit of the resources and strength of
             its parent/owning companies as well as to the
             experience in database management, sales and
             publishing of its parent group companies because
             after reorganisation of the Company in 1992 60%
             of the share capital of NHL is owned by Indian
             group of companies namely, TPI, LMI, WML, etc.
             and Mr Aroon Purie and 40% of the share capital is
             owned by IIPL a wholly-owned subsidiary of
             Singapore Telecom which was established in 1967
             and is having long experience in publishing the
             Singapore telephone directory with yellow pages
             and other directories. Moreover in the tender it
             was specifically stated that IIPL will be providing
             its    unique integrated   directory   management
             system along with the expertise of its managers
             and that the managers will be actively involved in
             the project both out of Singapore and resident in
             India.

<p id="p_184">             24. The expression "joint venture" is more
             frequently used in the United States. It connotes
             a legal entity in the nature of a partnership
             engaged in the joint undertaking of a particular
             transaction for mutual profit or an association of
             persons or companies jointly undertaking some
             commercial enterprise wherein all contribute
             assets and share risks. It requires a community of

             losses. (Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edn., p. 839)
             According to Words and Phrases, Permanent Edn.,
             a joint venture is an association of two or more
             persons to carry out a single business enterprise
             for profit (p. 117, Vol. 23). A joint venture can
             take the form of a corporation wherein two or
             more persons or companies may join together. A
             joint venture corporation has been defined as a
             corporation which has joined with other individuals
             or corporations within the corporate framework in
             some specific undertaking commonly found in oil,
             chemicals, electronic, atomic fields. (Black's Law
             Dictionary, 6th Edn., p. 342) Joint venture
             companies are now being increasingly formed in
             relation to projects requiring inflow of foreign
             capital   or technical  expertise   in  the   fast
             developing countries in East Asia, viz., Japan,
             South Korea, Taiwan, China, etc. [See Jacques
             Buhart : Joint Ventures in East Asia -- Legal
             Issues (1991).] There has been similar growth of
             joint ventures in our country wherein foreign
             companies join with Indian counterparts and
             contribute towards capital and technical know-how
             for the success of the venture. The High Court
             has taken note of this connotation of the
             expression "joint venture". But the High Court has
             held that NHL is not a joint venture and that
             there is only a certain amount of equity
             participation by a foreign company in it. We are
             unable to agree with the said view of the High
             Court.

</p><p id="p_186">             25. As noticed earlier, in its tender NHL had
             stated that it is a joint venture company
             established by TPI, LMI and WML and IIPL
             wherein TPI, LMI and WML and other companies in
             the same group as well as Mr Aroon Purie own 60%
             shares and IIPL owns 40% shares. It was also
             stated that the joint venture has received
             approval of the Government of India and is
             currently in operation and that the promoter will
             increase      their      capital/contribution     to
             commensurate with the project need and that the
             company has been established as an information
             and database management company with expertise
             in database processing, publishing, sales/marketing
             and the dissemination of related information. In
             the tender it is also stated that as a joint venture
             in the true sense of the phrase, the company will
             have access to expertise in database management,
             sales and publishing of its parent group companies.
             It would thus appear that the Indian group of
             companies (TPI, LMI and WML) and the Singapore-
             based company (IIPL) have pooled together their
             resources in the sense that TPI, LMI and WML
             have      made   available  their  equipment    and
             organisation at various places in the country while
             IIPL has made available its wide experience in the
             field as well as the expertise of its managerial
             staff. All the constituents of NHL have thus
             contributed to the resources of the Company
             (NHL). This shows that NHL is an association of
             companies     jointly  undertaking   a   commercial
             enterprise wherein they will all contribute assets

             and will share risks and have a community of
             interest. We are, therefore, of the view that NHL
             has been constituted as a joint venture by the
             group     of Indian  companies    and   IIPL,  the
             Singapore-based company and it would not be
             correct to say that IIPL which has a substantial
             stake in the success of the venture, having 40% of
             shareholding, is a mere shareholder in NHL.

</p><p id="p_187">             26. Once it is held that NHL is a joint venture, as
             claimed by it in the tender, the experience of its

             well as IIPL had to be taken into consideration if
             the Tender Evaluation Committee had adopted the

  prescribed in the notice inviting tenders, the

  experience of the constituents of NHL could be

  taken into consideration.                 In other words, this

  judgment only laid down the principle that while

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">                                  151</span>




  reckoning            the experience   of  a  joint   venture

  undertaking, the experience of its joint venture

  partners could also be taken into account.           We have

  already seen that the tender in these cases was

  submitted by Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A. in his individual

  capacity.             The  conditions  of  the  tender,  the

  details of which have already been referred to in

  the earlier part of this judgment, would show that

  the        tenderer      was   required   to   satisfy   the

  eligibility criteria consisting of both experience

  and financial turn over.            Though the tenderer was

  Sri.Yusuff            Ali  M.A.,   the   experience   record

  contained in Schedule B of Ext.R10(a) shows the

  names of three companies, viz., Lulu International

  Convention Centre Private Ltd., Lulu International

  Shopping Mall Private Ltd., and Lulu Flight Kitchen

  Private          Ltd.     There  is  nothing  on  record  to

  indicate           that  these  concerns  mentioned  in  the

  experience record submitted by the tenderer are in

  any way connected to the tenderer Sri.Yusuff Ali

  M.A. or the 10th respondent herein.

</p><p id="p_190">96.Similar is the case with financial data submitted

  along with Ext.R10(a) vide Schedule C thereof.       The

  financial data shown is that of EMKE Group UAE

  Operations and Lulu Convention Centre Private Ltd.

  As in the case of experience record, here also,

  there is nothing connecting the concerns mentioned

  in the financial data with either the tenderer or

  the 10th respondent.       In other words, unlike in the

  case of New Horizons Limited (supra), along with

  the tender document, the tenderer had not submitted

  any document connecting him or the 10th respondent

  with the firms mentioned in the experience record

  and financial data.         If that be so, the principle

  laid       down by     the Apex Court  in New   Horizons

  Limited (supra) that while reckoning the experience

  of a joint venture undertaking, the experience of

  its constituents could also be taken into account

  cannot have any application.        For that reason, we

  are unable to apply the principles laid down by the

  Apex Court in New Horizons Limited (supra) nor the

  Andra Pradesh High Court judgment in [131 Company

  Case 135] relied on by the learned senior counsel

  for the petitioner.           Despite all this, this Court

  has       to      respect the  conclusions   in  Ext.R10(c)

  judgment in W.P(C).9346/11 and therefore, we leave

  the matter at that.
</p>
<p id="p_191">

</p><p id="p_192">97.In spite of all these, since this Court has

  pronounced           a  judgment  concluding    that  there

  occurred no transfer of lease from Sri.Yusuff Ali

  M.A. to the 10th respondent, which has attained

  finality, for reasons of propriety, we are bound to

  respect that          conclusion.  Consequently, we decline

  to accept the case of the petitioners that the

  tenderer was Sri.Yusuff Ali M.A. and therefore, the

  lease could not have been granted to the 10th

  respondent.

  The upshot of the above discussion is that the writ

  petitions are only to be dismissed and we do so.
