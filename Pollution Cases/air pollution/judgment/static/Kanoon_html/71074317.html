</p><p id="p_10">            The point in controversy in the present case is only to the

effect that whether the petitioner got     the Environment Clearance

Certificate before starting the work or thereafter.

</p><p id="p_11">            In the present case, notification was issued by the

Ministry of Environment and Forests dated 14.9.2006, whereby the

company was required to get the prior          Environment Clearance

Certificate before starting its business. Admittedly, the petitioner was

granted the clearance certificate by        the Government of India,

Ministry of Environment and Forests vide letter dated 4.10.2007

(Annexure P-7).
</p>
<p id="p_12">            A perusal of the complaint (Annexure P-1) reveals that

the complaint was filed against the petitioner and others on the

allegation that the petitioner had started new construction project

without obtaining any prior Environment Clearance Certificate from

the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The complaint has been

filed in November, 2008, whereas, the clearance certificate has been

issued to the petitioner on 4.10.2007. In the complaint it has not

been mentioned that as to when the construction project was started

by the company. A perusal of the complaint also reveals that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> Criminal Misc. No.M-26803 of 2010                       9</span>

allegations levelled therein are vague as it has not been stated

therein as to how the offence under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_20">Section 15</a> of the Act had been

committed by the petitioner-company. The petitioner has applied for

'No Objection Certificate' after the receipt of clearance certificate

along with the requisite fee of ` 35,000/- on 30.7.2008 (Annexure P-

</p><p id="p_13">8). In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the company had

started its work before the issuance of the Environment Clearance

Certificate. On the day the complaint was filed, the petitioner-

company was already having the Environment Clearance Certificate.

In these circumstances, the continuation of the criminal proceedings

against the petitioner would be nothing but an abuse of process of

law.

<p id="p_14">           Accordingly, the present petition is allowed. Complaint

No.57 dated 6.11.2008 (Annexure P-1) under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_21">Section 15</a> of the Act,

as well as summoning order dated 21.11.2008 (Annexure P-5), and

all the subsequent proceedings arising therefrom, are quashed.
