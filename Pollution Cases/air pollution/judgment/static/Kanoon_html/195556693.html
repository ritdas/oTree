                                          JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">              This         writ    petition         is    filed    by    the      petitioner

       seeking to quash Ext.P5 order dated 15.12.2017 passed by

       the 1st respondent, i.e., the Deputy Forest Conservator

       and Wild Life Warden, Sulthan Bathery, Wayanad District,

       declining No Objection Certificate (NOC) to the stock

       yard sought to be opened and maintained by the petitioner

       for stocking building stones.                         Material facts for the

       disposal of the writ petition are as follows:

</p><p id="p_2">              2.      Petitioner           is   conducting         a    Crusher    Unit    in

       Wayanad District.                  The raw material i.e., the granite

       stones       were          not     readily        available,      and      therefore,

       petitioner            has        taken        necessary          permission        for

       transporting Granite stones from the State of Karnataka.

       According to the petitioner, permissions were granted by

       the concerned departments for purchase of granites from

       the State of Karnataka.                  The stones have to be stocked in

       a    convenient            place    so    that      in     accordance      with    the

       requirements, the same can be transported to the Crusher

       Unit.         Thereupon,           petitioner       has    entered      into   Ext.P1

       agreement with one T.P. Sivanandan on 08.06.2016, and on

       the basis of the agreement executed, petitioner made an

       application for storage of building granite stones in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> W.P.(C) No.41812 of 2017                           3</span>

       Form-A       before         the     2nd    respondent     i.e.,       the     District

       Geologist, evident from Ext.P2.
</p>
<p id="p_3">              3.      Thereafter,                petitioner     requested          the     2nd

       respondent to conduct a site inspection and on the basis

       of the site inspection, the Geologist found that the

       western side of the property under lease is abutting the

       forest land.               According to the petitioner, though it is

       abutting        the        forest    land,      there    is    a    well-demarcated

       compound wall separating the property from the forest

       land.          Thereupon,           2nd     respondent        has    issued    Ext.P3

       communication               dated         02.08.2017,     requesting          the   1st

       respondent to clarify whether he has any objection in

       granting permission for storing the building stones.                                The

       1st respondent, according to the petitioner, thereupon

       directed the petitioner to file an affidavit undertaking

       that he is willing to indemnify the forest department

       against any losses and risk caused due to the storage of

       stones.             Accordingly,          petitioner     has       submitted   Ext.P4

       affidavit.            Anyhow, after keeping the matter for a few

       months,              1st      respondent           has         issued          Ext.P5,

       declining the permission sought for by the 2nd respondent.

       The case put forth by the petitioner is that, based on

       the directions issued by the Ministry of Environment and

       Forest, the surroundings of the Forest has to be declared
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> W.P.(C) No.41812 of 2017                        4</span>

       as    Eco-Sensitive           Zone.          However,    the     1st   respondent

       admits that the State of Kerala has not so far notified

       the Eco-Sensitive Zone.                  Therefore, the directions issued

       by     the     Ministry        of     Environment       and    Forest        has   no

       application in the instant case.                    Further, the        reasoning

       that as per the judgment of the Supreme Court, every

       project       within      the    radius      of    10   Kms.    has     to    obtain

       permission from the National Board of Wild Life cannot

       also be sustained, since the buffer zone of 10 Kms. is

       not so far identified by the State of Kerala.                          Therefore,

       according to the petitioner, Ext.P5 cannot be sustained

       under law.
</p>
<p id="p_4">              4.      A    statement       is    filed    by   the    1st     respondent,

       refuting the claims and demands raised by the petitioner.

       Among other contentions, it is stated that, on verifying

       the facts in the field, 2nd respondent came to know that

       the proposed site for the mineral sales depot is having a

       boundary sharing with forest and protected area.                              As per

       Ext.P3 letter, the 2nd respondent asked for NOC from the

       1st    respondent,            considering         the   existing        laws       and

       guidelines          in    place       and    verifying         the     facts,      1st

       respondent has not issued NOC.                     It is pointed out that,

       as per Sec.2(ix), (x) &amp; (xvi) of the Kerala Minerals

       (Prevention              of     Illegal           Mining,       Storage            and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> W.P.(C) No.41812 of 2017                        5</span>

       Transportation) Rules, 2015 [hereinafter referred to as

       'the Rules, 2015'], the holder of a dealer's licence will

       be able to store mineral products including minerals in

       any raw form such as rock aggregates, chips, rock dust

       etc.         Therefore,          issuing     a     dealer's        licence      to    the

       petitioner will enable him to store the mineral products

       in the boundary of Muthanga Wildlife Range, which is a

       part of Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary.                         The Wayanad Wildlife

       Sanctuary           is     a    Protected        Area       as     per     <a href="/doc/1781078/" id="a_1">Wild      Life

       (Protection)             Act</a>,    1972,    and      storing        of    such    mineral

       products in the boundary of Wildlife Sanctuary will add

       to make pollution with respect to sound, air and water in

       the forest area.
</p>
<p id="p_5">              5.      It is further submitted that, National Parks,

       Sanctuaries and Conservation Reserves are notified under

       the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, as dedicated areas,

       rich in, and representing the unique bio-diversity of a

       place,       and     such       protected       areas   are        considered        very

       important           for    conservation          of   bio-diversity            and    for

       ensuring the healthy populations of its floral and faunal

       components, for the present and future generations alike.

       Other       contentions          are     also    raised          relying     upon     the

       Ecologically              Fragile      Zones       under         Sec.3(v)      of     the

       <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment              (Protection)        Act</a>      and        Rule    5     of     the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> W.P.(C) No.41812 of 2017                      6</span>

       Environment         (Protection)       Rules.           Based     on    this,         Eco-

       Sensitive Zones around National Parks and Sanctuaries are

       created for the purpose of some kind of "Shock Absorber"

       for the Protected Areas.               Therefore, according to the                     1st

       respondent,           the   stand      adopted          in    Ext.P5       is     fully

       justified.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              6.      That apart, it is pointed out that, as per Sec.3

       of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the Central

       Government is empowered to take all measures that are

       necessary for protecting and improving the quality of the

       environment         and     to   protect         and    control       environmental

       pollution.          In order to attain the said objective, the

       Central Government is at liberty to restrict areas in

       which any industries, operations or process or class of

       industries, operations or process shall not be carried

       out or shall be carried out subject to certain safeguards

       under       Sec.3(2)(v)      of   Act,          1986.        Based    on    the       said

       perspective, guidelines were issued for declaring Eco-

       Sensitive Zones around protected areas, and therefore,

       storage of building granite stones near to the Wildlife

       Sanctuary can well be restricted as it falls within the

       Eco-Sensitive Zone Regulations.
</p>
<p id="p_7">              7.      That    apart,     it       is    stated       that,    if       NOC    is

       provided to operate the stock yard, this will add to more
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> W.P.(C) No.41812 of 2017                     7</span>

       of     machineries          such    as,     heavy    vehicles,      Tippers,

       Tractors, JCB etc. without any control in the vicinity of

       the Wildlife Sanctuary, which will add the pollution by

       means of noise, dust etc.                 Considering all these aspects

       only, the Forest Department has rejected the NOC sought

       for.      The Forest Department is not having any objection

       in     having       such    activities      beyond    10   Kms.    from     the

       boundary of the Wildlife Sanctuary.
</p>
<p id="p_8">              8.      A reply affidavit is filed by the petitioner,

       reiterating the stand adopted in the writ petition, and

       stating that no Eco-Sensitive Zone is notified by the

       State Government from the National Parks and Wildlife

       Sanctuaries,          and     therefore,     the     restriction     imposed

       without any Rules enunciated by the Central or State

       Government,         the     1st   respondent   is    not   at     liberty   to

       decline NOC on the said ground.                 The judgments rendered

       by the apex court in '<a href="/doc/180993556/" id="a_3">Goa Foundation v. Union of India

       and Others</a>' [2014 KHC 3163] and the Division Bench of

       this Court in 'State of Kerala and Others v. J &amp; J

       ILR 2016 (1) Ker. 518 : 2016 (2) KLT SN 76] are relied

       upon to substantiate the said contentions advanced by the

       petitioner.

       that,       petitioner        has      sought    permission          from     the    2nd

       respondent to open up a stock yard on the basis of Ext.P1

       lease       deed       executed     by   the    petitioner          with    one     T.P.

       Sanctuary, a communication was sent by the 2 nd respondent

       to     the       1st      respondent,        evident        from     Ext.P3       dated

       02.08.2017.            According to the petitioner, it was on the

       basis of the directions issued by the 1 st respondent,

       petitioner has submitted Ext.P4 affidavit, undertaking to

       indemnify           against      any   losses    and        risks    in    the    above

       matter.             However,      petitioner          has    not     produced        any

       documents before this Court to establish that Ext.P4 was

       filed on the basis of any directions issued by the 1 st

       respondent.            That apart, it is an admitted fact that the

       property in question is bordering a reserved forest.

</p><p id="p_12">              11. The          contention       advanced      by    the     petitioner       is

       that,       so      far    the    buffer       zone     is     not    declared       in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> W.P.(C) No.41812 of 2017                       9</span>

       accordance with the directives issued in the order of the

       Supreme Court in '<a href="/doc/180993556/" id="a_4">Goa Foundation v. Union of India and

       Others</a>'       [(2011)        15   SCC       791]   and    therefore,       the   1st

       respondent is not at liberty to decline NOC on the basis

       of the buffer zone so directed to be formulated by the

       respective State Governments.                      It is also pointed out

       that the said question was considered by a Division Bench

       of this Court in 'J &amp; J Minerals Private Limited and

       Others' (supra). However, therein the question considered

       was in respect of a mineral water plant situated within

       the     Buffer       Zone    of   Silent      Valley      Park       vis-a-vis   the

       environmental              clearance,        and    held        that,      industry

       concerned           with    mineralized       water      is    not    required   to

       obtain         environmental            clearance             certificate,       and

       therefore, notification declaring the area around Silent

       Valley Park as a Buffer Zone cannot be relied on to

       interdict operation of industry carrying on production of

       mineral water.

<p id="p_13">              12. Petitioner has relied upon the judgment of the

       Karnataka High Court in 'Vijayanagar Educational Trust

       (M/s.)       v.      Karnataka     State       Pollution         Control     Board,

       Bangalore' [2002 KHC 3482 : AIR 2002 Kar. 123], wherein

       the question with respect to establishment of a Medical

       College located on the banks of 'Kumudavathi river', and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> W.P.(C) No.41812 of 2017                     10</span>

       the location being sensitive as                   river joins a reservoir,

       was under consideration.                  There, the Karnataka High Court

       held      that       the    area    was     not    declared     sensitive      by

       publication           of     notification         by    State     or      Central

       Government, as required under Rule 5 of the Environment

       (Protection)          Rules,       1986    read    along   with     the      other

       provisions          of     the   Water     (Prevention     and    <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control       of

       Act</a>, 1986.           Therefore, according to the petitioner, the

       1st respondent is not having the power to declare a Buffer

       Zone without a notification being issued in accordance

       with the provisions of the Environmental Laws pointed out

       above.

<p id="p_14">              13. Learned          counsel       for    the   petitioner      has    also

       invited my attention to the classification of industries

       for consent management under the categories Red, Orange &amp;

       Green, as per Schedule-VIII of Rules 3(2) and 12 of the

       Rules, 1986 and has produced before me and pointed out

       that the stone crusher unit comes under the "Orange"

       category.           Therefore, according to the petitioner, Ext.P5

       order passed by the 1st respondent suffers from the vice

       of arbitrariness and illegality, liable to be interfered

       with by this Court.

       Pleader pointed out that, going by the pleadings of the

       petitioner itself, it is evident that the property in

       question            covered by Ext.P1 lease deed is situated just

       outside the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, and therefore,

       even without declaration of 10 Kms. Buffer Zone, it is

       evident that the petitioner will definitely come under

       the said distance prescribed by the apex court in 'Goa

       Foundation case' (supra).                  That apart, it is pointed out

       that,      in       the   judgment    of    the   Supreme   Court   in   'Goa

       Foundation            case'    (supra),       the    Supreme    Court     has

       considered the question with respect to non-issuance of

       notification,             vis-a-vis        disability   to     create     any

       prohibition for operation of any industry was considered.

       Learned         Special       Government      Pleader   has    invited     my

       attention to paragraph 41 of the said judgment, which

       read thus:

       of the opinion that the activities that are proposed can

       cause serious disadvantage to the flora and fauna and the

       wildlife, the Forest authorities are duty bound to take

       into consideration such aspects, and if it is found that,

       it can cause serious repercussions to the wildlife, then,

       they are at liberty to decline NOC.                  Learned Special

       Government Pleader also pointed out that, in accordance

       creatures.            The provisions of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_13">Environment (Protection)

       Act</a>, as well as the Rules, 1986 are also relied upon to

       contend and canvass that the stock yard proposed by the

       petitioner can cause serious havoc to the wildlife of

       Muthanga        Wildlife           Zone,     a    part       of    Wayanad    Wild    Life

       Sanctuary.
</p>
<p id="p_19">              16. I        have         considered       the       rival    submissions      made

       across the Bar and perused the pleadings and documents on

       record.
</p>
<p id="p_20">              17. The contention made above would make it clear

       that, there is no dispute with respect to the property

       covered by Ext.P1, having a boundary with the Wayanad

       Wildlife        Sanctuary,           i.e.,       the    Muthanga       Wildlife      Zone.

       The Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary is well known for its bio-

       diversity, flora and fauna and wildlife existence, in

       abundance.            Petitioner is not having a case that the

       property covered under Ext.P1 is outside the 10 Kms.

       Buffer       Zone,       since       it    is     an    admitted       fact    that   the

       property        has      a       boundary    with       the       Wildlife    Sanctuary.

       Petitioner is not entitled even to contend that since the

       10 Kms. Buffer Zone is not identified, the 1 st respondent

       cannot deny NOC to the petitioner.                                 The distance of 10

       Kms. outside the various area will come into play only

       when     there      is       a    dispute        as    to    the    existence    of   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> W.P.(C) No.41812 of 2017                        14</span>

       property away from the wildlife border.                             Here, in this

       case, no such case is projected by the petitioner.                             It is

       also an admitted fact that the stocking yard is for the

       purpose        of         stocking       building      stones       brought      from

       Karnataka           and    remove    the      same    from    the    yard   to   the

       Crusher site, as and when it is required.                           Therefore, one

       can clearly visualise the sound and dust that can emanate

       from the continuous activities that are taking place,

       which will disturb the wild life and the dust emanates

       from the said activity will pollute the air and water

       also, which will materially affect the existence of the

       flora and fauna as well as the water resources available

       in     the      forest           area,     causing      serious       damage      and

       irreparable injuries to the wildlife and bio-diversity as

       such.
</p>
<p id="p_21">              18. The importance of Buffer Zone that is put forth

       by the apex court in 'Goa Foundation case' (supra), is

       with the intention of protecting the bio-diversity, flora

       and fauna and the wildlife.                          Any serious disturbance

       emanating from an industrial activity can disturb the

       wildlife and there is every likelihood that animals may

       move out from the said area, encroaching into the other

       regions       so      as    to    affect      the    normal     human    life    and

       activities also.                 The animals and the environment are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13"> W.P.(C) No.41812 of 2017                    15</span>

       entitled        to       be    protected,    within       their     territorial

       region, which is an obligation cast upon the State under

       <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_14">Article 51A(g)</a> of the Constitution of India.                        So much so

       is the obligation under <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_15">Article 48A</a> encompassing a duty

       on the State to make endeavour to protect and improve the

       environment and safeguard forests and wild life of the

       country.            Therefore,     irrespective      of    any     notification

       declaring any eco-sensitive zone, the State is destined

       to protect the environment and the wild life.                            Moreover,

       the citizens are entitled to enjoy the nature in its

       purest form and such enjoyment is integral part of the

       fundamental rights guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_16">Article 21</a> of the

       Constitution              of     India.           Therefore,         reasonable

       restrictions             imposed    on      the    civil        rights     of   an

       individual, to protect larger interest of the community

       guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution of India

       cannot be said totally irrelevant, arbitrary, illegal or

       unfair.

<p id="p_22">              19. This cluster of factual and legal circumstances

       lead     me    to    a    safe   conclusion       that,    if    permission     is

       granted to undertake the activity, as is sought for by

       the petitioner, it will materially affect the ecological

       balance available in the area, and also interferes with

       the natural environment as it exists today.                              Added to

       submission that petitioner is entitled to transport the

       product from Karnataka State.                Therefore, the reasons

       assigned        in   Ext.P5   cannot   be   said   to   be   illegal   and
