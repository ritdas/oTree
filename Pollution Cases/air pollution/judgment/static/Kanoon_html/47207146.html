            HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIJAY BISHNOI
                        Judgment / Order
11/09/2017

     These writ petitions are filed by the petitioners being

aggrieved with the order/direction dated 04.07.2017 issued by the

Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board whereby it has observed

that the stone cutting units run by the petitioner-firms are

operating without obtaining the Consent to Establish and Consent

to Operate under the provisions of Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, therefore, a direction was issued to close

down the industrial activities carried out by the petitioner-firms.

It is further mentioned in the impugned order that if the Consent

to Establish and Consent to Operate is not obtained by the

petitioner-firms, water and electricity supply of the petitioner-

firms can be disconnected by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control

Board.
</p><p id="p_33">                                  (4 of 5)
                                                             [ CW-8770/2017]



     It is noticed that after passing of the impugned order the

petitioner-firms have applied to the State Pollution Control Board

for granting Consent to Establish and Consent to Operate for their

stone cutting units under the provisions of Water (Prevention &amp;

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. During the pendency of these writ

petitions the State Pollution Control Board has granted Consent to

Establish and Consent to Operate the petitioner-firms under

<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_3">Section 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_4">26</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 vide orders dated 10.08.2017 and 12.08.2017.

</p><p id="p_34">     In view of the above facts and circumstances of the case,

learned counsels for the petitioners have prayed that they may be

permitted to withdraw these writ petitions.

</p><p id="p_35">     At this stage, an application has been preferred on behalf of

the applicant-Mahendra Bohra pointing out that the State Pollution

Control Board has committed several irregularities in granting

Consent to Establish and Consent to Operate to the petitioner-

firms and prayed that he may be impleaded as party in this writ

petition to bring out certain important facts in the knowledge of

this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_36">     Learned counsel appearing for the State Pollution Control

Board-Mr. Manish Sisodia has informed this Court that the

applicant-Mr. Mahendra Bohra has already approached National

Green   Tribunal   complaining    the       illegal   operation   of   mining

activities and stone cutting units/ stone crushing units in the

Fidusar, Chaupar area of Soor Sagar, District Jodhpur and in that

petition National Green Tribunal, Delhi has already issued notice to
                                       (5 of 5)
                                                                  [ CW-8770/2017]



the State Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_37">        Looking to the facts that the applicant-Mr. Mahendra Bohra

has already approached the National Green Tribunal against illegal

operation of stone cutting/ stone crushing units of the Fidusar,

Chopar area of Soor Sagar, Distict Jodhpur, I am not inclined to

entertain this application of the applicant in these writ petitions,

the same is therefore, dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_38">        The writ petitions are allowed to be withdrawn, consequently,

dismissed as withdrawn.
</p>
<p id="p_39">        It is made clear that the Rajasthan State Pollution Control

Board shall ensure that the petitioner firms, to which Consent to

Establish and Consent to Operate is granted under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_6">Section 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_7">26</a>

of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 vide

order     dated      10.08.2017     and      12.08.2017,        are   necessarily

complying with the conditions mentioned in the orders dated

10.08.2017 &amp; 12.08.2017.            If the State Pollution Control Board

found that the petitioner firms and other units to which Consent to

Establish and Consent to Operate is granted are not complying

with the conditions, then immediate action be taken against those

units.
</p>
<p id="p_40">        However, the applicant-Mr. Mahendra Bohra is free to

challenge the Consent to Establish and Consent to Operate

granted        to   the   petitioner-firms       or   other   firms   before        the

appropriate authority in accordance with law.
