 ORAL ORDER (PER A.S.OKA,J)

               As per the administrative order passed by the Hon'ble 

 Chief Justice by exercising powers under Rule 7 of the Bombay 

 High   Court   Appellate   Side   Rules,   1960,   these   two   petitions 

 have   been   placed   for   disposal   before   this   Bench   and 

 accordingly,   as   per   the   directions   of   the   Hon'ble   the   Chief 

 Justice issued on 27th August 2017, these petitions were listed 

 before this Bench on 28th  August 2017.   On 29th  August 2017 

 and   today,   we   have   heard   the   submissions   of   the   learned 

 Counsel appearing for the parties.  
</p>

<p id="p_3"> 2.            The challenge in these two petitions is to the validity 

 of   the   notification   dated   10th  August   2017.   By   the   said 

 notification,   the   Noise   Pollution   (Regulation   and   Control) 

 Amendment   Rules,   2017   (hereinafter   referred   to   as   the 

 "impugned Rules") were brought into force by which the Noise 

 Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000 (for short, "the 

 Principal Rules") have been amended.  Considering the various 

 contentions raised across the bar, we find that many important 

 questions   arise   which   are   required   to   be   finally   decided. 
</p>

 Hence,   we   issue   Rule.   The   concerned   Respondents   waive 

 service.  Issue notice to the learned Attorney General of India, 

 returnable on 6th  October 2017, when these petitions will be 

 fixed before this Bench for fixing a date for hearing.
</p>

<p id="p_5">      3. We have heard the learned Counsel representing the rival 

          parties at considerable length on the question of grant of 

          interim   reliefs.     Civil   Application   (Stamp)   No.2472   of 

          2015   has   been   taken   out   by   the   applicants   for 

          intervention   in   P.I.L   No.24110   of   2017.     The   learned 

          Counsel   appearing   for   the   applicants   submitted   that 

          instead of  filing a separate  petition for  challenging  the 

          impugned Rules, the applicants be ordered to be added 

          as respondents.  No party has  challenged the locus of the 

          applicants to make such an application.  Accordingly, we 

          allow the application in terms of prayer clause (a) and 

          direct   the   petitioners   in   P.I.L   to   carry   out   amendment 

          within a period of one week from the date on which this 

          order is uploaded.</p><pre id="pre_2">

 canvassed across the Bar, we must indicate the nature of the

 effect   from   14th  February   2000.     For   framing   the   Principal 
 Rules, a power has been exercised by the Central Government

 unamended Principal Rules and the Schedule read thus:

</pre><p id="p_30">               comprises of an area within the distance of 100 meters around
               hospitals, educational institutions, and Courts. As educational
               institutions, hospitals and courts have been defined in Rule 2, for
               applicability of Sub-Rule (5) of Rule 3, it is not necessary to have
               a specific declaration issued in respect of the silence zone around
               hospitals, educational institutions and Courts. As it is clear from
               clause 3 of the Schedule, only in the event any other area or
               additional area (over and above 100 meters) is to be declared as a
               silence zone, a specific declaration will be necessary. On plain
               reading of Sub-Rule (5) of Rule 3, a silence zone means an area of
               100 meters on all sides of precincts of educational institutions,
               hospitals, religious places and courts and not the area within the
               precincts of the said institutions.

               Pollution Rules, using loud-speaker or public address system is an
               offence and therefore, a permission under Sub-Rule (1) of Rule 5
               to use loud-speaker or public address system in the open spaces in
               silence zone cannot be granted. Apart from prohibition on grant of
               license to use loud-speakers or public address systems in silence
               zones, in except in completely covered and enclosed places in silence
               zone, there is a complete ban on beating a drum or tom-tom or on
               blowing a horn, either musical or pressure, or trumpet or beats or
               sounds any instrument playing of any music, using any sound

               prohibition provided therein is applicable to the open spaces in the
               silence zone. In view of the clause (iv) of Rule 6, there is a complete
               ban on blasting of sound on firecrackers in silence zone. There is a
               complete ban on bursting sound emitting crackers between 10.00 pm

 said order. On the said Review Petition, it was held thus:

<blockquote id="blockquote_54">      "7. So far as the first point is concerned, in our opinion, direction issued by
      us on 25-9-2003 is clear. Prima facie, it appears to us that the provisions of
      the Rules would apply to 'an area comprising not less than hundred
      metres around' hospitals, educational institutions, courts, religious
      places or any other area which is declared as such by the competent
      authority. In our view, this would be in consonance with the phraseology
      used in clause (i) of Rule 6 which totally prohibits playing of 'any music' or
      using of 'any sound amplifiers'. Had it been the intention of the rule-
      making authority, it would not have used the expression 'an area
      comprising not less than 100 metres around' hospitals, educational
      institutions, court, religious places, etc. Moreover, such interpretation
      would also permit activities within those institutions in accordance
      with law.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_55">      8. At the same time, however, the apprehension voiced by the learned
      counsel for the petitioners has also been taken care of. It cannot be
      considered that with regard to such organisations, institutions, etc. there is
      neither any standard nor limit whatsoever. In respect of such institutions
      also, the general provisions laid down in Rule 5 which place restriction on the
      use of loudspeaker/public address system would apply."</blockquote>

 State Government. In the said decision, the Apex Court held in 
 paragraphs 10, 21 and 26 as under  :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_58">        "10.          Mr. S. Ganesh, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf
        of the appellant, drawing our attention to the relevant Rules, would
        contend that as no silence zone has been notified in terms of the
        statutory rules, the High Court committed a serious error in passing the
        impugned judgment. It was urged that, in any event, an exemption should
        be granted in respect of Rang Bhavan having regard to the fact that it is not
        possible to hold a musical event at any other place in the city of Mumbai at
        such cheap rates. The State of Maharashtra, the learned Senior Counsel
        pointed out, has also been supporting the cause of the appellant."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_59">        21.           Contention that the State Government has not declared the said
        zone as a silence zone, in our opinion, is besides the point. The High Court,
        while passing its interim order dated 25-9-2003, did not state that
        silence zone was required to be declared, but passed the order of
        restraint in respect of silence zone, as "defined and discussed in the
        Rules". The parties thereto and particularly the State of Maharashtra
        understood the said order in that light.

 by the impugned Rules, the law laid down by the Apex Court in 
 case of  Noise Pollution (V), IN RE3  will have to be borne in 
 mind.   In paragraph Nos.10 and 11 of the said decision, the 
 Apex Court has held thus: 
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_62">               "10.            <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_10">Article 21</a> of the Constitution guarantees life and
               personal liberty to all persons. It is well settled by repeated
               pronouncements of this Court as also the High Courts that the right to
               life enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_11">Article 21</a> is not of mere survival or existence. It
               guarantees a right of persons to life with human dignity. Therein are
               included, all the aspects of life which go to make a person's life
               meaningful, complete and worth living. Human life has its charm and
               there is no reason why life should not be enjoyed along with all
               permissible pleasures. Anyone who wishes to live in peace, comfort
               and quiet within his house has a right to prevent noise as
               pollutant reaching him. None can claim a right to create noise
               even in his own premises which would travel beyond his precincts
               and cause nuisance to neighbours or others. Any noise which has
               the effect of materially interfering with the ordinary comforts of
               life judged by the standard of a reasonable man is nuisance. How
               and when a nuisance created by noise becomes actionable has to
               be answered by reference to its degree and the surrounding
               circumstances, the place and the time.

               Undoubtedly, the freedom of speech and right to expression are
               fundamental rights but the rights are not absolute. Nobody can claim a
               fundamental right to create noise by amplifying the sound of his
               speech with the help of loudspeakers. While one has a right to
               speech, others have a right to listen or decline to listen. Nobody
               can be compelled to listen and nobody can claim that he has a
               right to make his voice trespass into the ears or mind of others.</blockquote>

               In paragraph Nos.15 to 18, the Apex Court held thus:
              " II. Noise as nuisance and health hazard
</p><p id="p_42">              15.              Noise is more than just a nuisance. It constitutes a real
              and present danger to people's health. Day and night, at home, at work,
              and at play, noise can produce serious physical and psychological
              stress. No one is immune to this stress. Though we seem to adjust to
              noise by ignoring it, the ear, in fact, never closes and the body still
              responds -- sometimes with extreme tension, as to a strange sound in
              the night.

              stimulates brain activities, removes boredom and fatigue, but its
              excessiveness may prove detrimental to living things. Research has
              proved that a loud noise during peak marketing hours creates
              tiredness, irritation and impairs brain activities so as to reduce
              thinking and working abilities. Noise pollution was previously
              confined to a few special areas like the factory or the mill, but
              today it engulfs every nook and corner of the globe, reaching its
              peak in urban areas. Industries, automobiles, rail engines,
              aeroplanes, radios, loudspeakers, tape recorders, lottery ticket
              sellers, hawkers, pop singers, etc., are the main ear contaminators
              of the city area and its marketplace. The regular rattling of engines
              and intermittent blowing of horns emanating from the caravan of
              automobiles do not allow us to have any respite from irritant noise
              even in suburban zones [ Ranbir Singh, Noise Pollution: Environment
              and the Law, as printed in Indian Bar Review, Vol. 23 (3 &amp; 4), 1996,
              p. 86.] .
</p><p id="p_45">              17.              In the modern day noise has become one of the major
              pollutants and it has serious effects on human health. Effects of noise
              depend upon the sound's pitch, its frequency and time pattern and
              length of exposure. Noise has both auditory and non-auditory effects
              depending upon the intensity and the duration of the noise level. [ P.S.
              Jaswal and Nistha Jaswal -- Environmental Law, Second Edn., p.

              health. It may even lead to madness in people.
</p><p id="p_47">              18.              However, noises, which are melodious, whether natural or
              man-made, cannot always be considered as factors leading to
              pollution.
</p><p id="p_48">              19.              Noise can disturb our work, rest, sleep, and
              communication. It can damage our hearing and evoke other
              psychological, and possibly pathological reactions. However,
              because of the complexity, variability and the interaction of noise
              with other environmental factors, the adverse health effects of
              noise do not lend themselves to a straightforward analysis

 and 
               (e)             The   Apex   Court   recognized   the   noise   as   a 
 pollutant   which   pollutes   the   environment.     In   the   same 
</pre><p id="p_56"> decision, the Apex Court accepted that noise is a major health 
 hazard. The Apex Court has set out eight instances of adverse 
 impact  of  noise  on  the health of human  beings including its 
 impact even on the unborn.
</p>

<p id="p_57"> 10.           The   argument   advanced   on   behalf   of   Central 
 Government and State Government is that the very basis of the 
 Judgment of this Court in the case of Dr. Mahesh Bedekar is 
 taken   away  by   the  impugned Rules  and now  in   view of  the 
 amendment to Rule 3 of the Principal Rules and the deletion of 
 clause 3 from the Schedule, no area which is falling within a 
 distance of 100 meters from educational institutions, hospitals 
 and Courts in the State of Maharashtra is a silence zone.  The 
 contention is that   now by virtue of the impugned Rules, only 
 the State Government can declare an area as a silence zone and 
 in fact, the State Government has not exercised the power of 
 declaring any area in the State as a silence zone till today. In 
 short, the submission is that in view of the impugned Rules, 
 now no area in the State is a silence zone.

<p id="p_61"> 12.           From   the   side   of   petitioners   and   intervenors,   our 
 attention   has  been invited to the  impugned Rules which  are 
 promulgated in the form of impugned notification dated 10 th 
 August   2017.     It   is   contended   that   on   the   plain   reading   of 
 recitals of the impugned Rules, it is crystal clear that Central 
 Government has purported to exercise the power under Rule 5 
 of   1986   Rules   which   is   a   power   to   impose   prohibition   or 
 restrictions on the location of an industry or carrying on the 
 processes and operations in an area.   It is submitted that the 
 object   of   the   impugned   Rules   appears   to   be   to   impose   the 
 restrictions and prohibition as contemplated by Sub-Rule 1 of 
 Rule 5 of 1986 Rules. While doing so, major amendments have 
 been made to Rule 3 of the Principal Rules and to the Schedule 
 of   the   Principal   Rules.     The   submission   is   that   the   purpose 
 sought to be achieved by the impugned Rules is very clear from 
 the first five recitals. It is of imposing restrictions or prohibition 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                      ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:23 :::</span>
</p><p id="p_62">                                       - 23 -        PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17


 as   contemplated   by   Rule   5   of   1986   Rules.     But   the 
 amendments, which are made by the impugned Rules to the 
 Principal   Rules,   have  no  nexus  with  the   object   sought   to  be 
 achieved   under   Rule   5   of   the   1986   Rules.     Secondly,   it   is 
 pointed  out   that  from   the   recitals,  it  is  apparent  that  power 
 under Sub-Rule 1 of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules is exercised by taking 
 recourse   to   the   Rule   making   power   under   1986   Act   and   in 
 particular <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_21">Sections 3</a>, <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_22">6</a> and <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_23">25</a>.  The submission of the learned 
 Counsel appearing for the petitioners is that though second last 
 recital in the impugned Rules refers to Sub-Rule 4 of Rule 5 of 
 1986 Rules which confers a power on the Central Government 
 to dispense with requirement of publishing a prior notice under 
 Sub-Rule 3 of Rule 5 and inviting objections and suggestions, 
 there   is   no   recital   that   any   such   power   of     dispensing   with 
 requirement of Rule 3 has been exercised under the Sub-Rule 4 
 of Rule 5.  It is thus contended that the impugned Rules violate 
 fundamental rights under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_24">Article 21</a> and the <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_25">Article 14</a> of the 
 Constitution   of   India   as   the   same     suffer   from   arbitrariness. 
 Our attention is also invited to the proviso added to Sub-Rule 5 
 of Rule 3.  The contention is that proviso refers to a notification 
 issued in accordance with Sub-Rule 2 of Rule 3 though Sub- 
 Rule   5   contemplates   a   declaration   of     silence   zone   for   the 
 purpose of the Principal  Rules.  It is pointed out that Sub-Rule 
 2 of Rule 3, which is referred in proviso added to Sub-Rule 5 
 refers  to categorization  of an area into industrial, residential 
 and silence zones.  It is contended that the proviso to Sub-Rule

 (5) which refers to Sub-Rule 2 of Rule 3 uses the word 'notified' 
 though Sub-Rule 2 of Rule 3 talks about categorization and not 
 a notification.   The submission is that the conjoint reading of 
 Sub-Rule 5 of Rule 3 along with the proviso would show that as 
 area   falling   within   the   distance   of   100   meters   around   the 
 hospitals,   educational   institutions   and   Courts   is   already 
 declared as silence zone under the unamended Principal Rules, 
 the  said areas  will continue to be  so even after coming  into 
 force of the impugned Rules. The proviso added by way of the 
 impugned   Rules   will   apply   only   if   some   other   area   is   to   be 
 declared as a silence zone.  The contention is that as the object 
 of  the   Principal   Rules and 1986 Act  is to save  citizens from 
 noise pollution, such classification which is made does not have 
 any intelligible differentia and does not establish any rational 
 nexus   with   the   object   sought   to   be   achieved.     Therefore,   it 
 violates <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_26">Article 14</a> of Constitution of India.
</p>

<p id="p_64"> 13.           It is urged that the impugned Rules also violate the 
 fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_27">Article 21</a> of the Constitution 
 of India.   Our attention was invited to the decision of Larger 
 Bench of the Apex Court consisting of 9 Hon'ble Judges in the 
 case of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.), and <a href="/doc/91938676/" id="a_28">Anr vs Union of India and

 restricted meaning is given to the procedure established by law, 
 as  the  requirement of clause  (a)  of Sub-Rule  3 of Rule  5 of 
 1986 Rules of prior publication of Rules for inviting objections 
 and suggestions from the citizens has not been followed, the 
 procedure   established   by   law   has   not   been   followed.     It   is 
 submitted that if interpretation of the State Government that 
 no silence zone   is in existence after coming into force of the 
 impugned Rules is accepted, it amounts to violation of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_31">Article 
 21</a> of the Constitution of India.   One of the contentions raised 
 by Mr. Anturkar without prejudice to   his contention that the 
 impugned   Rules   are   unconstitutional,   is   that   in   view   of   the 
 stand   taken   by   the   State  Government,   there   is   a   vacuum 
 created in the sense that there is no silence zone in existence. 
 His contention is that as held by the Apex Court in case of Lalit 
 Kumar Modi versus Board of Control for Cricket in India and 
 Others5, the Court always has a power to ensure that directions 
 are issued so that the vacuum does not remain.  He also relied 
 upon  a decision of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/42287/" id="a_32">Shaikh Yusuf Bhai 
 Chawala and others vs. State of Maharashtra and others</a> 6. 
 He urged that power to fill in the gap or the vacuum has been 
 exercised by this Court under Section 151 of the Code of Civil 
 Procedure 1908 in the case of <a href="/doc/72156/" id="a_33">Sangeeta Balkrishna Kadam v.

</pre><p id="p_66"> 14.           The intervenors have also made detailed submissions. 
 The main submission is that the impugned Rules do not affect 
 the findings recorded in the decision of this Court in the case of 
 Dr.   Mahesh   Bedekar   on   the   existence   of   silence   zones.   The 
 impugned Rules do not affect the position of law which was on 
 10th  August 2017 and it does not affect what is held by this 
 Court in Clause (xii) of  the judgment in the case of Dr. Mahesh 
 Bedekar.   Without prejudice to the said contention, he urged 
 that the impugned Rules are unconstitutional being contrary to 
 the provisions of 1986 Act and 1986 Rules. He urged that it is a 
 colourable exercise of powers.   Secondly, it is submitted that 
 the impugned Rules are violative of fundamental rights of the 
 citizens under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_34">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.  He urged 
 that   the   impugned   Rules   lead   to   manifest   absurdity,   absurd 
 inconvenience and anomaly. He invited the   attention of the 
 Court   to   the   fact   that   there   is   a   non-compliance   with   the 
 requirements  of  clause  (a)   of  Sub-Rule  3 of  Rule   5 of  1986 
 Rules.     The   submission   is   that     the   requirement   of   prior 
 publication under clause (a) of Sub-Rule 3 of Rule 5 of 1986 
 Rules has not been dispensed with and in any event it can be 
 dispensed   with   only   when   it   appears   to   the   Central 
 Government that it is necessary in public interest to do so.  The 
 submission   is   that   instead   of   imposing   restrictions   and 
 prohibition, by the impugned Rules, the prohibition is sought to 
 be taken away and therefore, the proposed amendment is not 
 at all in public interest.   The submission is that the exercise of

 the Rule making power is  far from being in public interest. The 
 action of doing away with silence zones is the violation of the 
 rights under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_35">Article 21.</a> The submission is that impugned Rules 
 offend fundamental right to live peacefully and free from noise 
 pollution.  The submission is that the amendment brought out 
 is manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable.   Another submission 
 of   the   intervenors   is   that   the   amendment   made   by   the 
 impugned Rules will have to be read in such a manner which 
 would advance the scheme and purpose of the Principal Rules 
 and not to defeat the same and lead to absurdity.  Reliance was 
 placed on the decision of the Apex Court in case of  Mandal 
 Revenue   Office   Versus   Goundla   Venkaiah   and   Another 8  . 
 Reliance is also placed on another decision of the Apex Court in 
 case of H.S. Vankani and Others versus State of Gujarat and 
 Other9.     The submission is that the amended Rules will have 
 to   be   interpreted   in   a   manner   so   as   to   do   justice   to  all   the 
 parties   and   a   construction   of   the   provisions   leading   to 
 confusion   and   absurdity   must   be   avoided.     In   that   behalf, 
 reliance   was   placed   on   the   decision   of  State   of   Madhya 
 Pradesh   Versus   Narmada   Bachao   Andolan   and   Another 10. 
 The learned counsel for the intervenors pointed out that on the 
 basis   of   the   notification   dated   21st  April   2009   issued   by   the 
 State   Government,   the   power   to   declare   silence   zones   was

 purportedly delegated to the local authorities.  It is contended 
 that the Mumbai Municipal Corporation had demarcated and 
 identified 1537 silence zones in the city of Mumbai which fact 
 was confirmed by the Affidavit dated 7th May 2009 filed by the 
 State Government in P.I.L No.85 of 2007 in which the State 
 Government affirmed that the power to declare silence zones 
 has been delegated to the local bodies.   He submitted that in 
 any event, the said silence zones which have been identified on 
 the basis of the authority conferred by the State Government 
 are not affected by the impugned Rules.  He relied upon some 
 other   decisions   to   which   we   have   made   a   reference   in   the 
 subsequent part of this order.

 impugned Rules are ultra-vires the provisions of 1986 Act and

 per the decision of this Court in the case of Dr. Mahesh Bedekar 
 which is confirmed by the Apex Court, the area falling within 
 the distance of 100 meters surrounding hospitals, educational 
 institutions, Courts and religious places has been held to be a 
 silence   zone   and   therefore,   the   modification   made   to   the 
 Principal   Rules   by  the   Impugned  Rules   on  10th  August  2017 
 will apply prospectively.  The submission is that the the  silence 
 zones in existence as of 10 th August 2017 will continue to exist

<p id="p_71"> 16.           The  learned Additional  Solicitor  General of India at 
 the outset stated that there is no specific order passed under 
 Sub-Rule   4   of   Rule   5   of   1986   Rules   by   which   the   Central 
 Government has dispensed with the requirement of prior notice 
 under clause (a) of Sub-Rule 3 of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules.   He 
 tendered   across   the   bar   a   letter   dated   1 st  September   2017 
 addressed to him by Dr. Shruti Rai Bhardwaj, Joint Director in 
 the   Ministry   of   Environment,   Forest   and   Climate   Change, 
 Government of India.   The said letter is taken on record and 
 marked   as   "L-1"   for   identification.     He   submitted   that   there 
 may be material on record to show that the issue of dispensing 
 with requirement of publication of prior notice was discussed 
 and that material can be placed on record by filing an affidavit-
 in-reply.  However, on a specific query made by the Court, he 
 stated   that   there   is   no   such   express   order   passed   by   any 
 authority under Sub-Rule 4 of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules. Relying on 
 the various decisions of the Apex Court, including the decision 
 in   Special   Reference   No.1   of   199111,   he   submitted   that   the 
 legislature can always change the basis on which a decision is 
 given   by   the   Court.     He   submitted   that   relying   upon   the 
 decision in case of <a href="/doc/629881/" id="a_37">State of Himachal Pradesh and Others v.

 with   the   prayer   for   stay   of   the   impugned   Rules,   he   placed 
 reliance on a decision of the Apex Court in case of Health for 
 Millions Vs. Union of India (UOI) and Ors 13.   He submitted 
 that   the   law   is   very   well   settled   that   there   is   always   a 
 presumption   in   favour   of   the   constitutional   validity   of   any 
 legislation.  He submitted that in view of this presumption, the 
 Court should be slow in granting any such interim relief.   He 
 submitted   that   the   Court   should   be   extremely   slow   while 
 passing an order of stay in such cases.  He submitted that when 
 a legislation is challenged on the ground violation of the the 
 fundamental   rights   under     <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_38">Article   14</a>   of   the   Constitution   of 
 India, a specific allegation must be made in that behalf in the 
 petition.     He   relied   upon   the   decision   of   the   Apex   Court 
 through  <a href="/doc/1548644/" id="a_39">Shri  V.S.   Rice   &amp;   Oil   Mills   vs.   State   of   Andhra 
 Pradesh</a>.  Turning  to  the   impugned  Rules,  he  submitted  that 
 though first five recitals of the Rules refer to Rule 5 of 1986 
 Rules, the last recital shows that the power is exercised under 
 <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_40">Sections 3</a>, <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_41">6</a>  and <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_42">25</a> of 1986 Act  read with Rule  5 of 1986

 silence zones could have been always made by taking recourse 
 to   the   general   Rule   making   power   under   <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_43">Section   25</a>   of   the 
 1986 Act.  He submitted that though recitals may have referred 
 to Rule 5 of 1986 Rules, the exercise of rule making power is 
 not confined to Rule 5, but it is a composite exercise of   power 
 of making rules both <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_44">Sections 3</a>, <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_45">6</a>, and <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_46">25</a> of the 1986 Act and

 Apex Court in case of <a href="/doc/1316639/" id="a_47">Peerless General Finance and Investment 
 vs Reserve Bank of India15</a>  and submitted that the question to 
 be decided by the Court is whether there existed a power to 
 legislate and therefore, the Court cannot go by recitals in the 
 Rules.     He   submitted   that   though   the   recitals   may   not 
 specifically   refer   to   actual   action   of   dispensing   with   the 
 requirement of a publication under clause (a) of Sub-Rule 3 of 
 Rule 5 of 1986 Rules, there is a material on record in the form 
 of minutes to show that the issue was discussed.  Though there 
 is   no   specific   order   of   the   authority   empowered   to   take   a 
 decision after recording a satisfaction that it is in public interest 
 to dispense with prior publication under clause (a) of Sub-Rule 
 3 of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules,  he submitted that for exercising the 
 rule making power under 1986 Act, there is no requirement of 
 prior publication.  He also relied on the observations made by 
 the  Apex  Court   in  case  of  H.S. Vankani  and Others versus 
 State   of   Gujarat   and   Other  (   supra).     He   submitted   that 
 considering the very wide definitions of Court and hospital in 
 the   Principal   Rules,   the   provisions   regarding   silence   zone   as 
 interpreted by this Court were leading to unreasonable results. 
 He pointed out that if the Rules as existed in relation to silence 
 zones   were   implemented,     considering   the   wide   definitions 
 therein, very few areas in the city of Mumbai will not be silence 
 zones.  He submitted that the Court has to avoid a construction

 of an enactment that leads to an unworkable, inconsistent and 
 impracticable results.   He submitted that if this Court accepts 
 interpretation   that   notwithstanding   the   impugned   Rules,   the 
 directions issued in the P.I.L stand, it will create unworkable 
 and inconsistent situation.  He submitted that the Rules cannot 
 be interpreted in this fashion.   He submitted that it is for the 
 State Government to categorize and notify an area as silence 
 zone and only because the State has not declared any area as a 
 silence   zone   in   the  entire   State, the  impugned Rules  do  not 
 become invalid.  While submitting that he is not disputing the 
 powers of the Court to issue appropriate directions where there 
 is a vacuum,  he submitted that in the present case, the exercise 
 of   such   power   is   not   warranted   at   all.     The   basis   of   this 
 judgment is taken away by the impugned Rules.

 terms   of   notification   dated   21st  April   2009   will   be   taken   as 
 guiding factor.   However, on a query made by this Court, he 
 stated that it is not possible for him to make a statement that 
 the silence zones notified on the basis of notification dated 21 st 
 April 2009 will be treated as silence zones.  He reiterated that 
 the silence zones declared as per the said notification will be 
 taken as guidelines, but the same will not be treated as silence 
 zones.  He relied upon the decisions relied upon by the learned 
 Additional   Solicitor   General   of   India.     In   addition,   he   urged 
 that a legislation can be always retrospective.  He relied upon a 
 decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/811897/" id="a_48">Utkal Contractors and 
 Joinary (P) Limited and others vs State of Orissa</a> 16 in support of 
 his submissions.   He submitted that the impugned Rules  have 
 been brought on the statute book to ensure that the operation 
 of the provisions regarding silence zone in the Principal Rules 
 do not lead to absurd results.  He reiterated  the stand that in 
 view   of   the   impugned   Rules,   now   no   area   in   the   State   is   a 
 silence zone.

 Additional Solicitor General of India on the power of this Court 
 to   grant stay of operation of  statutory provisions.  He relied 
 upon a decision of the Apex Court in the case of  Health for 
 Millions   Vs.   Union   of   India   (UOI)   and   Ors   (supra).    He 
 relied upon paragraphs 13 and 14 of the said decision which 
 read thus:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_64">               "13.            We have considered the respective arguments and
               submissions and carefully perused the record. Since the matter is
               pending adjudication before the High Court, we do not want to
               express any opinion on the merits and demerits of the writ petitioner's
               challenge to the constitutional validity of the 2003 Act and the 2004
               Rules as amended in 2005 but have no hesitation in holding that the
               High Court was not at all justified in passing the impugned orders
               ignoring the well-settled proposition of law that in matters involving
               challenge to the constitutionality of any legislation enacted by the
               legislature and the rules framed thereunder the courts should be
               extremely loath to pass an interim order. At the time of final
               adjudication, the court can strike down the statute if it is found to be
               ultra vires the Constitution. Likewise, the rules can be quashed if
               the same are found to be unconstitutional or ultra vires the
               provisions of the Act. However, the operation of the statutory
               provisions cannot be stultified by granting an interim order
               except when the court is fully convinced that the particular
               enactment or the rules are ex facie unconstitutional and the
               factors, like balance of convenience, irreparable injury and public
               interest are in favour of passing an interim order."

               "30.            Before we conclude there is another matter which we
               must advert to. It has been brought to our notice that <a href="/doc/941778/" id="a_51">Section 45-S</a> of
               the Act has been challenged in various High Courts and a few of them
               have granted the stay of provisions of <a href="/doc/941778/" id="a_52">Section 45-S</a>. When
               considering an application for staying the operation of a piece of
               legislation, and that too pertaining to economic reform or change,
               then the courts must bear in mind that unless the provision is
               manifestly unjust or glaringly unconstitutional, the courts must
               show judicial restraint in staying the applicability of the same.
               Merely because a statute comes up for examination and some
               arguable point is raised, which persuades the courts to consider the
               controversy, the legislative will should not normally be put under
               suspension pending such consideration. It is now well settled that
               there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutional validity
               of any legislation, unless the same is set aside after final hearing and,
               therefore, the tendency to grant stay of legislation relating to
               economic reform, at the interim stage, cannot be understood. The
               system of checks and balances has to be utilised in a balanced manner
               with the primary objective of accelerating economic growth rather
               than suspending its growth by doubting its constitutional efficacy at
               the threshold itself.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_67">               31.             While the courts should not abrogate (sic abdicate)
               their duty of granting interim injunctions where necessary,
               equally important is the need to ensure that the judicial discretion
               does    not     abrogate   from   the   function    of   weighing     the
               overwhelming public interest in favour of the continuing
               operation of a fiscal statute or a piece of economic reform
               legislation, till on a mature consideration at the final hearing, it is
               found to be unconstitutional. It is, therefore, necessary to sound a
               word of caution against intervening at the interlocutory stage in
               matters of economic reforms and fiscal statutes."

            simple and easy. But where the contention is that the inconsistency or

               may further be questioned on the ground that it is contrary to
               some other statute. That is because subordinate legislation must
               yield to plenary legislation . It may also be questioned on the

 recital refers to the manner in which notice is to be issued. The 
 third   recital   refers   to   grant   of   an   opportunity   of  filing   of 
 objections on the basis of the notice within the time specified 
 therein.  The fourth recital refers to clause (d) of the Sub-Rule 
 3 of Rule 5 which provides that the Central Government shall 
 within a period of 120 days from the date of publication of the 
 notification in the official gazette, consider all such objections 
 received against the Notification and within 545 days specified 
 from such publication, impose such prohibitions or restrictions 
 on   location   of   industries   and   carrying   on   any   process   or 
 operations in any area.  What is material is  fifth recital which 
 shows that the Central Government intended to rely upon Sub-
 Rule   (4)   of   Rule   5   of   the   1986   Rules.     It   provides   that, 
 whenever   it   appears  to   the  Central  Government   that  it  is  in 
 public interest to do so, it may dispense with the requirement 
 of publication of a notice under clause (a) of sub-rule (3) of 
 rule 5 of 1986 Rules.  However, there is  no recital that such a 
 power   was   in   fact   exercised   by   the   Central   Government. 
 Admittedly,   there   was   no   prior   publication   of   the   impugned 
 Rules.  The last recital shows that the Central Government for 
 exercising   the   powers  under Rule  5 of  the  1986 Rules, took 
 recourse to the Rule making power under the 1986 Act.  Thus, 
 first  five  recitals,  on its plain reading, in no uncertain terms 
 indicate that the Central Government intended to exercise its 
 power under the Rule 5 of 1986 Rules of imposing prohibition 
 and restrictions on the location of an industry or the carrying

 on   the   processes   and   operations   in   a   particular   area.     The 
 recitals   show   that   the   Central   Government   was   intending   to 
 impose such prohibition and restrictions.  The use of the words 
 "Now, therefore, ..." in the last recital shows that for imposing 
 the prohibition or restrictions as provided in Rule 5 of 1986

 provision of 1986 Act empowering the Central Government to 
 frame Rules.

 enumerated   in   Sub-rule   (1)   after   following   the   procedure 
 under sub-Rule (3). It is provided in clause (a) of the Sub-Rule 
 (3) of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules that   whenever it appears to the 
 Central Government that it is expedient to impose prohibition 
 or restrictions on the locations of an industry or the carrying on 
 of processes and operations in an area, it may by a notification 
 in the Official Gazette and in such other manner as the Central 
 government may deem necessary from time to time, give notice 
 of   its   intention   to   do   so.     Contents   of   the   notice   have   been 
 specified   in   clause   (b)   of   Sub-rule   (3).     Clause   (c)   thereof 
 contains   the   requirement   of   calling   for   filing   of   objections 
 against   the   proposed   imposition   and   prohibition   and 
 restrictions   within  a  period  of  60  days  from  the   date  of  the 
 publication   in   the   official   gazette.     Clause   (d)   mandates   the 
 Central   Government   to   consider   all   the   objections   within   a 
 period of 120 days and it confers the power to impose such 
 prohibition or restrictions within specified 365 days from the 
 date of the publication of the notification in official Gazzette. 
 In the present case,  it is explicitly clear that by the impugned 
 Rules, the Central Government purported to exercise the power 
 of imposing prohibition  or restrictions under Rule 5 of 1986 
 Rules by taking recourse to the Rule making power under 1985 
 Act.   The   decision   of   the   Apex   Court   in   the   case   of 
 Peerless(supra)   will   have   no   application   to   this   case   as   the 
 Apex Court was not dealing with the rule making power.

</p><p id="p_93"> 28.           The provisions of clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Sub-rule 
 (3)  of   Rule   5   of 1986 Rules  are  mandatory  in  nature, in  as 
 much   as,   whenever   it   is   intended   to   impose   prohibition   or 
 restrictions as contemplated by Rule 5, the Central Government 
 is under a mandate   to notify its intention to do so in official 
 gazette and in such other manner as it may deem fit.   Only 
 when the Central Government is satisfied that it is in public 
 interest to do so, it may dispense with the requirement of prior 
 publication of notice under clause (a) of Sub-Rule 3.  As noted 
 earlier,     the   learned   Additional   Solicitor   General   of   India 
 candidly   stated   that   in   this   case,   there   is   no   specific   order 
 passed by any authority of the Central Government dispensing 
 with the requirement of notice by exercising power under  Sub-
 rule 4 of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules.  He tendered on record a copy 
 of   the   communication   dated   1st  September   2017   (L-1   for 
 identification) issued by the Joint Director in the Ministry of 
 Environment,   Forest   and   Climate   Change,   Government   of 
 India.  The contents of the letter show that there is no specific 
 decision taken by the Central Government to the effect that it is 
 in public interest to dispense with the requirement of a notice 
 under clause (a) of Sub-Rule (3).  In fact, the admitted position 
 which is revealed from the statement of the learned Additional 
 Solicitor   General   of   India   is   that   there   is   no   specific   order 
 passed by any competent authority recording its satisfaction  in 
 terms sub-rule (4) of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules.  Thus, there was a 
 mandatory   requirement   of   prior   publication   permitting   the

 members of  the  public  to submit  objections and suggestions, 
 but the same has not been complied with in this case.   Thus, 
 the exercise is ex-facie illegal being contrary to Sub-Rule (3) of 
 Rule 5 of the 1986 Rules. 
</p>

<p id="p_95"> 29.       We may note here that if the interpretation put by the 
 State   Government   as   well   as   Central   Government   to   the 
 impugned Rules is correct, the effect of the amendment will be 
 that   as   of   today,   no   silence   zone   exists   in   the   State   of 
 Maharashtra   as   the   State   Government   has   not   declared   any 
 area as a silence zone acting upon the impugned Rules. Thus, 
 the     use   of   loud-speakers   and   other   prohibited   activities   as 
 specified   in   Rule   6   of   the   Principal   Rules   can   be   permitted 
 within   a  distance  of 100 meters from  Courts,  Hospitals,  and 
 schools/colleges. If such permissions are granted, the same will 
 violate fundamental rights under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_58">Article 21</a> of the Constitution 
 of India as spelt out in the decision of the Apex Court in case of 
 Noise Pollution (V), IN RE ( supra). Thus, even assuming that 
 there was an exercise of powers under Sub-Rule (4) of Rule 5 
 of 1986  of  dispensing with prior  publication  under Sub-Rule 
 (3)   thereof,   the   said   exercise   of   powers   is   ex-facie   against 
 Public   interest   especially   when   the   case   of   both   the 
 Governments is that the silence zones under the unamended 
 Principal Rules in terms of the decision of this Court in the case 
 of Dr. Mahesh Bedekar now no longer exist.  In view of the fact 
 that   the   right   to   lead   a  noise  pollution   free  life   is  a  part  of

 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_59">Article   21</a>,   the   impugned   Rules   which   purport   to   abolish   all 
 existing silence zones cannot be said to have been framed in 
 public interest. Surely, dispensing with the requirement of prior 
 publication is not at all in public interest.
</p>

<p id="p_97">      30. We   may   note  one  more  factual  aspect  here.   As  noted 

          earlier, even the Principal Rules show that the same were 
          enacted under Clause (ii) of Sub-Section 2 of Section 3, 
          Sub-<a href="/doc/122461477/" id="a_60">Section 1</a> and Clause (b) of Sub-Section 2 of Section 
          6 and <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_61">Section 25</a> of the 1986 Act  read with Rule 5 of 
          1986   Rules.   Since   Rule   5   of   1986   Rules   was   invoked, 
          prior publication of the Principal Rules was made by the 
          Central Government in accordance with clause (a) of sub-
          Rule (3) of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules.  In fact, whenever the 
          Principal Rules were modified, such prior publication was 
          made by the Central Government. In fact, while making 
          all the subsequent amendments thereto, apart from other 
          provisions,   even   Rule   5   of   1986   Rules   was   invoked. 
          Perhaps in case of only one amendment made in the year 
          2000, the requirement of prior publication was dispensed 
          with.     We   may   note   here   that   learned   Government 
          Pleader placed on record the notification dated 10th June 
          2006 amending the notification dated 19 th February 1991 
          regarding Coastal Zone Regulations. As the modification 
          was   done   by   invoking   Rule   5   of   1986   Rules,     the

          under Sub-Rule (4) of Rule 5 was specifically invoked as 
          there is a recital in  that the Central Government is of the 
          opinion that it is in public interest to dispense with the 
          said requirement of notice under clause (a) of Sub-Rule 
          (3) of rule 5 of the 1986 Rules.  As stated earlier, in the 
          impugned   Rules,   there   is   no   recital   that   the   Central 
          Government   is   of   the   opinion   that   it   is   in   the   public 
          interest to dispense with the requirement of notice under 
          Sub-Rule   (3)   of   Rule   5   of   the   1986   Rules.     The    fifth 
          recital in the impugned Rules merely refers to the power 
          which is conferred under Sub-Rule (4) of Rule 5 of 1986 
          Rules without recording that the said power was in fact 
          exercised.   Had   the   prior   publication   been   made,   the 
          citizens   could   have   pointed   out   the   ill   effects   of   the 
          proposed amendments and the fact that the same violate 
          their fundamental rights under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_62">Article 21.</a> In fact in the 
          light of the rights guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_63">Article 21</a>, no one is 
          entitled to use loud-speaker as a matter of right. From 
          the   submissions   made   across   the   Bar   on   behalf   of   the 
          State Government it appears to us that the State is under 
          a misconception that in certain cases, by not allowing the 
          use of loud-speakers within a distance of 100 meters from 
          a Hospital, School/college or Court, as the case may be, 
          rights of handful of citizens will be affected.

 Recitals   in   the   impugned   Rules   show   that   the   power   of 
 imposing   restrictions   and   prohibition   under   Sub-Rule   (1)   of 
 Rule 5 was sought to be invoked by taking recourse to the rule 
 making powers under 1986 Act.  Thus, the object of impugned 
 Rules seems to be to impose restrictions as contemplated under 
 Sub-Rule   (1)   of   Rule   5   of   1986   Rules.     We   have   noted   the 
 contents of the impugned Rules which do not impose any such 
 restrictions or prohibition contemplated by Sub-Rule 1 of Rule 
 5   of   1986   Rules   and   on   the   contrary,   the   impugned   Rules 
 purport   to   amend     the   provisions   in   the   Principal   Rules 
 regarding   the   silence   zones.   The   impugned   Rules   intend   to 
 remove the prohibition or relax the same which existed in the 
 Principal   Rules.       Thus,   there   is   no   nexus   between   the 
 impugned Rules and the object   sought to be achieved under 
 Rule 5 of 1986 Rules.

<p id="p_101"> 32.                 At this stage, we may make a useful to a recent 
 decision of Bench of the Apex Court   in case of Justice A.N.

 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_64">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India while examining whether 
 right of privacy is a part of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_65">Article 21.</a>  In paragraph 165 of the

               the scope of the challenge is not confined only to whether the
               procedure for the deprivation of life or personal liberty is fair,
               just and reasonable. Substantive challenges to the validity of laws
               encroaching upon the right to life or personal liberty has been
               considered and dealt with in varying contexts, such as the death
               penalty (Bachan Singh) and mandatory death sentence (Mithu),
               among other cases. A person cannot be deprived of life or personal
               liberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law.
               <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_67">Article 14</a>, as a guarantee against arbitrariness, infuses the entirety of

               arbitrariness and the protection of life and personal liberty
               operates in a multi-faceted plane. First, it ensures that the
               procedure for deprivation must be fair, just and reasonable.
               Second, <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_69">Article 14</a> impacts both the procedure and the expression
               "law". A law within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_70">Article 21</a> must be consistent
               with the norms of fairness which originate in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_71">Article 14.</a> As a
               matter of principle, once <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_72">Article 14</a> has a connect with <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_73">Article 21</a>,

 relation to noise.  The impugned Rules purport to withdraw or

<p id="p_102"> 34.           We have made a reference to the decision of the Apex 
 Court in case of  <a href="/doc/1736771/" id="a_76">Farhd K. Wadia v. Union of India</a> which is 
 extensively   considered   by   the   Division   Bench   of   this   Court 
 while deciding the case of Dr. Bedekar.  We have also referred 
 to an interim order of 25th September 2003 which operated till 
 16th  August   2016   when   Dr.   Bedekar's   case   was   decided. 
 Thereafter, what is held in clause (xii) of paragraph 93 of the 
 said Judgment is operative. Thus, the silence zones which were 
 in existence at least for 14 years are sought to be taken away 
 by the impugned Rules in a manifestly arbitrary manner.   We 
 may note here that clause (xii) of paragraph 93 of   the said 
 judgment which is upheld by the Apex  Court holds that silence 
 zone comprises of an area within the distance of 100 meters 
 around the hospitals, educational institutions and Courts and it 
 is  not   necessary   for   the  State  to  declare  any  such   area  as  a 
 silence zone.  Thus, from the year 2003, the view taken by the 
 Court is that the area falling within the distance of 100 meters 
 around the hospitals, educational institutions and Courts will 
 be considered as a silence zone though it was not specifically 
 declared to be so by the State Government.  In fact, on the very 
 issue,   a   Special   Leave   Petition   was   preferred   by   the   State 
 Government   for   challenging   what   is   held   in   clause   (xii)   of 
 paragraph 93 of the  Judgment in Dr.Bedekar case which was 
 summarily dismissed.  At this stage, we are not recording any

 final opinion on the question whether the directions in clause 
</p><p id="p_104"> (xii) of paragraph 93 of the said Judgment as regards silence 
 zones   continue   to   operate   notwithstanding   the   impugned 
 Rules. But, suffice it to say that for considerably long time (at 
 least   from   25th            September   2003),   the   judicial 
 decisions/direction holding that the silence zone comprises of 
 an area within the distance of 100 meters around the hospitals, 
 educational institutions and Courts  operated with full force till 
 10th August 2017.  Now, the contention of State of Maharashtra 
 as   well   as   Central   Government   is   that   no   silence   zone   is   in 
 existence from the date of the impugned Rules.   If that is the 
 interpretation   put   by   the   State   Government   to   the   amended 
 Rules, ex-facie, the amended Rules will violate the fundamental 
 rights  of  the   citizens under  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_77">Article  21</a> of  the  Constitution  of 
 India.  As observed and held  earlier, the impugned Rules will 
 not stand the test of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_78">Article 14</a>   for two reasons.   The first is 
 that there is no nexus between the impugned Rules and object 
 sought   to   be   achieved   by   the   impugned   Rules   framed   in 
 exercise of powers under Rule 5 of 1986 Rules.  Secondly, the 
 exercise of power is manifestly unreasonable and arbitrary as 
 there is no prior publication made as required by clause (a) of 
 Sub-Rule 3 of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules.
</p>

<p id="p_105"> 35.           If the   interpretation put by the Central Government 
 as well as state Government is taken into consideration, it is 
 now possible  to  grant a permission to use a loud-speaker or

 sound     amplifier   even   at   a  distance   of   5  to   10  meters   from 
 hospitals,   Courts,   or   schools/colleges.   The   refusal   to   grant 
 permission to use a loud-speaker for preventing noise pollution 
 does   not   offend     fundamental   rights   of   any   individual. 
 Moreover, the restrictions imposed by Rule 6 of the Principal 
 Rules do not apply within the precincts of Courts, Hospitals, 
 schools etc as held in Dr. Bedekar's case. Thus, a loud-speaker 
 can be used in a function held in open courtyard of this Court 
 or   on   a   ground   situated   within   the   precincts   of   a 
 school/college. Moreover, it has been held that restrictions do 
 not apply to enclosed premises in silence zones in which loud-
 speakers can be used after obtaining permission. 
</p>

<p id="p_107"> 36.           Therefore, we are of the considered view that there is 
 a very strong prima facie case to hold that the impugned rules 
 are   unconstitutional.   In   fact   the   Rules   are   ex-facie 
 unconstitutional.   As we have   held that the impugned Rules 
 will violate fundamental rights guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_79">Article 21</a> of 
 the Constitution of India,   this is a case where there will be 
 irreparable injury to the citizens especially in the light of the 
 law laid down by the Apex Court that a right to live in noise 
 pollution free atmosphere is guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_80">Article 21</a> of the 
 Constitution. Noise is a major health hazard on various aspects 
 set   out   in   its   decision.     It   follows   that   even   the   factors   of 
 balance   of   convenience   and     public   interest   are   strongly   in 
 favour of passing an interim order. No one can claim that his

 rights are affected in any manner if he is denied a permission 
 to   use   loud-speaker   within   a   close   distance   from 
 Hospitals/clinics,   schools/colleges   or   Courts.   It   in   public 
 interest   that   such   permissions   should   not   be   granted.   By 
 denying such permission, rights under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_81">Article 19</a> or 25 are not 
 at all infringed. Use of loud-speakers for celebrating a religious 
 festival is not an essential part of any religion.

<p id="p_109"> 37            Even   if   an   interim   order   is   passed,   the   position 
 regarding silence zones which existed if not from the date on

 September 2003, will continue to exist. We propose to hear the
