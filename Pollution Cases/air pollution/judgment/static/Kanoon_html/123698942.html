PER HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE M. KARPAGA VINAYAGAM,
CHAIRPERSON


1. JSW Energy Limited is the Appellant herein.

2. The Appellant filed a petition before the Maharashtra
    Commission claiming the cost of installation of Flue
    Gas De-sulphurisation (FGD) system to be included
    in the Project Cost as per Power Purchase
    Agreement dated 23.2.2008.        However, the said
    claim was rejected by the State Commission through
    the order dated 25.5.2011.

3. Aggrieved by this, the Appellant has filed this
    Appeal.

4. The short facts are as follows:-

         i) The Appellant is a generating company.




                                              Page 2 of 51
                                    Appeal No.105 of 2011

ii)    The          Maharashtra        State       Electricity
Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) is
the Distribution Licensee, the 1st Respondent.

iii)   The      Maharashtra           State       Regulatory
Commission is the 2nd Respondent.

iv)    The Appellant envisaged to set up a
generating Station at Ratnagiri after identifying
the land required and obtaining the requisite
permissions and approvals.

v)     The Appellant applied for Environmental
clearance for the power project from the
Ministry       of         Environment        and       Forest,
Government of India.

vi)    Accordingly, the Ministry, Government of
India granted the Environmental clearance to
the Appellant on 17.5.2007.                      In the said
approval,      the        Government        of    India   had
imposed various conditions subject to which
the Environmental clearance was granted.

vii)   The clearance stipulated that adequate
space shall be provided by the Appellant for
installation         of      the     Flue        Gas      De-
sulphurisation(FGD) system for removal of


                                                 Page 3 of 51
                                  Appeal No.105 of 2011

sulphur di-oxide, if required at later stage.
Accordingly, the adequate space was provided
for the installation of the FGD system.

viii)   In   the    year    2007,      the     Distribution
Licensee       (R-1) initiated competitive bidding
process      for   procurement         of    electricity    in
accordance with the guidelines issued by the
Government of India under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_1">section 63</a> of the
Electricity Act, 2003. From 21.2.2008 onwards,
the Appellant and others submitted the bids for
the sale of electricity to the Distribution
Licensee on the terms and conditions of the
bidding documents.               After observing the
required     procedures,         the    Appellant          was
selected as a successful bidder. Thereafter, on
the basis of selection of the Appellant as the
successful bidder to supply 300 MW of
electricity to the Distribution Licensee(R-1) both
the parties have entered into the Power
Purchase Agreement on 23.2.2008.                   The bid
documents          and     the      Power        Purchase
Agreement provided that in case of change in
law after 7 days prior to the bid deadline, i.e.
14.2.2008, any financial impact on account of



                                              Page 4 of 51
                                  Appeal No.105 of 2011

such       change        in     law    needed         to   be
compensated.

ix)    The Ministry of Environment and Forest
sent    a      letter,     at    the      final    stage    of
commissioning            the    Project     on     16.4.2010
imposing a condition that FGD system shall be
installed before the commissioning of the
Project.       The Appellant sent a reply to the
Ministry on 22.4.2010 for cancellation of such
imposition of condition mainly on the ground
that the requirement of the FGD was not
established yet and that the commissioning of
the Project would get delayed further on
account of condition now imposed for installing
FGD prior to commissioning of the Project. On
the basis of the representation made by the
Appellant, the Ministry by the letter dated
28.6.2010 required the Appellant to install the
FGD within a period of 23 months and
conveyed its Environmental clearance for the
Project subject to the compliance of the
safeguards and conditions mentioned in the
said letter.




                                                  Page 5 of 51
                            Appeal No.105 of 2011

x)    In pursuance of the said letter sent by the
Government,       the      Appellant         incurred
expenditure     for     installation    of     FGD.
Thereupon, the Appellant sent a letter to the
Distribution   Licensee(R-1)       on     27.7.2010
intimating that the mandate had been imposed
by the Government of India dated 16.4.2010
and as such there was a change in law as per
clause 13 of Power Purchase Agreement and
accordingly, the Company incurred expenditure
for installation of FGD which claimed to be
included in the cost. In reply to the said letter,
the Distribution Licensee(R1) sent a letter
dated 11.8.2010 rejecting the claim of the
Appellant contending that it was the obligation
of the Appellant to maintain all required
consents for the Power Project and as such
there was no change in law in terms of clause
13 of Power Purchase Agreement.

xi)   On receipt of the refusal of this claim, the
Appellant issued notice to the Distribution
Licensee on 20.8.2010 for resolution of the
dispute arose between the parties.               The
Appellant further stated in the letter that
notwithstanding the disputes that have arisen

                                        Page 6 of 51
                                Appeal No.105 of 2011

between the parties, the Appellant will continue
to perform its obligations by supplying power
under the Power Purchase Agreement without
prejudice to its claim.

xii)     Thereupon,      the    meeting      was        held
between the parties.           It was decided in the
meeting that the parties shall proceed for
resolution of the dispute by way of adjudication
by the State Commission.

xiii)    In pursuance of the said decision, the
Appellant filed a petition in petition No.99 of
2010      on    14.12.2010         before    the        State
Commission for adjudication of dispute that has
arisen      between       parties        regarding        the
application of Clause 13 of the Power Purchase
Agreement on account of imposition of the
condition      of   installation    of    FGD      by     the
Appellant.

xiv)     The State Commission after hearing the
parties by the impugned order dated 25.5.2011
dismissed the petition filed by the Appellant
and rejected its claim on the ground that even
under the initial Environmental clearance dated
17.5.2007, it was mandated for the installation

                                            Page 7 of 51
                                          Appeal No.105 of 2011

        of the FGD and that the cost thereof ought to
        have been included in the total cost.

        xv)     Having aggrieved over this order, the
        Appellant has filed this Appeal.

5. Assailing the order impugned, the learned Counsel
  for   the     Appellant     has        made    the   following
  submissions:-

        i) The State Commission held in the impugned
        order that there was no change in law in terms
        of clause 13 of Power Purchase Agreement
        entered     into     between      the    Appellant   and
        Distribution Licensee (R-1) since the condition
        of    installation    of   FGD      imposed     by   the
        Government of India by the communication
        dated 16.4.2010 had already been imposed in
        the Environmental clearance dated 17.5.2007.
        This finding is wrong because there was no
        statutory     direction     in     the   Environmental
        clearance dated 17.5.2007 mandating the
        installation of the FGD and this mandate was
        issued only on 16.4.2010 and as such it
        squarely falls within the definition of "Change in
        Law" as per the PPA.



                                                    Page 8 of 51
                           Appeal No.105 of 2011

ii)    The stipulation regarding FGD in the
Environmental clearance dated 17.5.2007 was
that the installation be done, only if required, in
future. Thus, the installation of FGD as on the
cut off date was not a mandate or certainty.
This means that the installation of FGD may
not be necessary at all at this stage.
Therefore, there was no reason for the
Appellant to consider at that stage that the cost
of FGD should be included in the Project Cost.

iii)   The State Commission held that there
was an obligation on the part of the Appellant
for    maintaining    a    separate    fund     for
implementation       of    the     Environmental
protection measures in the form of FGD to
include FGD cost in the Project Cost.         This
finding is wrong. At the time when the bid was
submitted and when the Power Purchase
Agreement was signed, the cost of FGD did
not form part of the Environmental protection
measures as it was not directed to be incurred
by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, as
per the Environmental clearance.




                                      Page 9 of 51
                                 Appeal No.105 of 2011

iv)       The initial Environmental clearance dated
17.5.2007 did not mandate the installation of
FGD by the Appellant at its Power Station.
The only condition as applicable then was the
sufficient space needed to be provided by the
Appellant, and the installation of FGD if
required at the time in future. Therefore, the
cost to be considered by the Appellant at such
a point of time was only for the space to be
kept aside.       There was no mandate for the
installation of the FGD at that time.          Under
those circumstances, the State Commission
can not hold that the Appellant was under an
obligation to install the FGD and its cost was to
be included in the Project cost at that stage
itself.

v)        The Appellant at the time of submission
of the bids had disclosed all the relevant
events with regard to its activities. Further, the
Appellant has acted in terms of PPA. In any
event, there was no order in the pending
litigation     affecting   in     any   manner,   the
implementation of the Project and as such it
did not in any manner affect the claim of the
Appellant. As such, the non disclosure of the

                                        Page 10 of 51
                                     Appeal No.105 of 2011

        pending litigation is irrelevant to the issue in
        question.

6. On these grounds, the Appellant seeks to set aside
   the impugned order dated 25.5.2011 and to hold
   that the imposing the mandate of installation of FGD
   amounts to 'change in law' under clause 13 of the
   PPA and consequently the Distribution Licensee is
   liable to pay compensation to the Appellant for the
   adverse financial impact for installation of FGD on
   account of "Change in Law.

7. In reply to the above submissions, the learned
   Counsel for the Respondent-1, the Distribution
   Licensee has made the following submissions:-

        i)    The     Appellant     is   totally   wrong    in
        contending     that   the    requirement     in    the
        Environmental clearance dated 17.5.2007 was
        required to be carried out only in future and
        therefore, the mandate that the FGD must be
        installed issued by the Government would
        amount to change in law. Careful perusal of
        the Environmental Clearance would show that
        the argument advanced by the Appellant has
        no   basis.      As   a     matter    of   fact,   the
        Environmental Clearance puts the conditions

                                               Page 11 of 51
                             Appeal No.105 of 2011

that a detailed study with reference to the
impact of the Project was to be undertaken
and additional safeguards should be provided
by identifying the separate space for the
installation of FGD and not only that, it
required    that    separate     funds    should     be
allocated for such measures which were to be
included in the Project cost.              Therefore,
nothing     prevented      the     Appellant        from
implementing these measures and claiming
the same in the Project cost even at the first
instance.

ii)   In    terms    of   the    conditions    in    the
Environmental Clearance, the Appellant was
under bounden duty to include the FGD cost in
the Project cost which the Appellant had failed
to do. The Environmental clearance would
specifically mandate that the space provision
shall be made for installation of FGD, if
required, at a later stage and it further
mandated that separate allocation of funds for
the Environmental protection measures must
be made and that the same must be included
in the Project cost. Admittedly, the funds were
not allocated at that time even though it was

                                         Page 12 of 51
                          Appeal No.105 of 2011

mandated that the funds were to be allocated
at that stage itself, which shall be included in
the Project cost.     Therefore, it can not be
contended that there was a change in law.

iii)   RFQ and RFP and draft PPA were
circulated to the bidders in October 2007 itself.
As per the bid documents, the Appellant had to
disclose at the bid stage itself, the litigation
pending against it but actually there was
litigation pending at that stage as against the
Appellant both before the Appellate Forum and
the High Court.       However, this was not
disclosed. As a result of the non-disclosure of
the pending litigation by the Appellant, the
Distribution Licensee was unable to consider
the possible effects of the pending litigation
and in good faith it considered the bid of the
Appellant on the merits of the particulars
disclosed by the Appellant. The factum of the
non-disclosure   by    the   Appellant   of   the
pendency of the legal litigation related to the
Environmental clearance is fatal to the claim of
the Appellant.




                                   Page 13 of 51
                               Appeal No.105 of 2011

iv)   In the event the Appellant had disclosed
to the Distribution Licensee, the pending
litigation    in    respect        of   Environmental
clearance, the Distribution Licensee would not
have considered the bid of the Appellant or in
the alternative the Distribution Licensee would
have included adequate conditions in the PPA
itself regarding the possible outcome of the
pending      litigation.      In    that    event,   the
Distribution licensee could have analysed the
impact of the adverse order on the tariff
proposed by the Appellant and would have
made provisions accordingly.            As a result of
the non- disclosure, the Distribution Licensee
was prevented to consider the actual outcome
of the pending litigation. On the other hand,
the Appellant misled the Distribution Licensee
to consider the bid of the Appellant on the
merits of the limited particulars disclosed by
the Appellant in the submissions for the bid.
Therefore, the Appellant is estopped from
contending that there was a change in law as
provided in the PPA and also from claiming the
benefits of the said provision.

                                  Appeal No.105 of 2011

8. In the light of the rival contentions, the following
   questions would arise for consideration:-

         a)   Whether there was any change in law
         in accordance with the clause 13 read with
         other clauses of the Power Purchase
         Agreement in its entirety in the good faith
         and circumstances of the case?

         b)   Whether      in    the    Environmental
         clearance dated 17.5.2007 or at any time
         prior to the bid deadline namely 14.2.2008,
         was there any mandate           requiring the
         installation of FGD by the Appellant and
         allocation of funds as part of the Project
         cost for the installation of FGD?

         c)   Whether non-disclosure of pending
         litigation by the Appellant at the time of
         submission of bid documents would be
         fatal to the claim of the Appellant on the
         strength of subsequent notification issued
         by the Ministry dated 16.4.2010?

9. Before dealing with these questions, it would be
   better to refer to the relevant chronological events




                                           Page 15 of 51
                                 Appeal No.105 of 2011

which would disclose the actual background of the
case, which are given below:-

     i)    The Ministry of Power, Government of
     India notified tariff based competitive bidding
     guidelines for Distribution Licensees to ensure
     procurement of power in transparent and
     competitive manner. These guidelines were
     issued   on    19.01.2005.      Thereupon,    on
     14.9.2006, the Central Government issued
     notification relating to requirement of prior
     Environmental clearance. On the basis of this
     notification, the Ministry of Environment and
     Forest issued a circular in terms of the
     notification    dated      14.9.2006     inviting
     applications from the applicants who are
     interested in putting up thermal power plants to
     grant prior Environmental clearance.

     ii)   The Appellant, seeking for the prior
     Environmental clearance, sent a proposal to
     the Ministry on 06.11.2006.       On receipt of
     several applications, the expert appraisal
     committee was constituted by the Ministry of
     Environment and Forest.




                                        Page 16 of 51
                              Appeal No.105 of 2011

iii)   Ultimately on 17.5.2007, the Ministry of
Environment and Forest issued Environmental
clearance to the Appellant for the Power
Project, subject to the implementation of the
various terms and conditions.

iv)    There were several conditions provided
in     the    Environmental     Clearance     dated
17.5.2007.       We shall quote the relevant
conditions contained in the Environmental
clearance which are given below:-

       (iii) Space provision shall be made for
       installation    of     FGD     of   requisite
       efficiency     of    removal   of   SO2,   if
       required at later stage.

       (xx)    Separate      funds     should     be
       allocated      for    implementation       of
       Environmental protection measures
       along with item wise break up. These
       cost should be included as part of the
       project cost. The funds earmarked for
       the environment protection measures
       should not be diverted for other
       purposes and year wise expenditure
       should be reported to the Ministry.

                                       Page 17 of 51
                              Appeal No.105 of 2011

v)     Through these conditions, the Appellant
had been communicated that the Appellant
may be required to install FGD of required
capacity at a later stage and called upon the
Appellant to provide the space for installation
of FGD of requisite efficiency as well as to
allocate funds for implementation of those
Environmental protection measures and the
cost should be included as part of the Project
cost. It also provided that the Appellant should
not divert the said funds for any other purpose.

vi)    As against the Environmental clearance
issued in favour of the Appellant, one other
party claiming himself aggrieved, filed an
Appeal      before   the    National   Environment
Appellate      authority    challenging   the   said
Environmental Clearance on 27.7.2007. The
same was pending.

vii)   At that stage, in October, 2007, the
Distribution     Licensee     (MSEDCL)      initiated
competitive bidding process for procurement of
power. With reference to this, 14.2.2008 was
decided as the cut-off-date for application for
change in law being 7 days prior to the bidding


                                       Page 18 of 51
                                Appeal No.105 of 2011

deadline.      As on the cut-off-date, the prior
Environmental clearance received by the
Appellant stipulated that the cost relating to the
implementation         of      the     Environmental
protection measures should be included as
part of the Project cost. On 21.02.2008, the
Appellant had submitted the bid for supply of
300 MW of power, in terms of the competitive
bidding process initiated by the Distribution
Licensee. In March, 2008 bidding evaluation
was completed.          At the end of technical
evaluation; 10 bidders including the Appellant
were selected. All technical bids were opened
on 20.8.2008. At that stage on 12.9.2008, the
Appeal       filed   against     the   Environmental
clearance was dismissed by the Appellate
Authority.

viii)   As against this order passed on the
Appeal, a writ petition was filed by the
aggrieved party before the High Court, New
Delhi on 18.9.2009.         The High Court while
disposing the writ petition directed the Expert
Appraisal Committee to re-examine the issue
and to file the report and that the issue of
provision of FGD be decided. On 11.01.2010

                                        Page 19 of 51
                         Appeal No.105 of 2011

Expert Appraisal Committee conducted a
meeting. There also, it was decided regarding
the requirement of installing FGD at a later
stage.

ix)   Since   the   Appellant   became     the
successful bidder, Power Purchase Agreement
was entered into between the Distribution
Licensee, Respondent-1 and the Appellant for
supply of 300 MW to the Distribution Licensee
on 23.02.2010. Subsequently, the Ministry of
Environment and Forest sent a letter to the
Appellant on 16.4.2010 directing the Appellant
that the FGD system shall be installed before
commissioning the Project.

x)    Though the Appellant sent a request
through a letter dated 22.4.2010 praying for
withdrawal of the condition of establishing FGD
before commissioning the plant, the Ministry
refused to withdraw the said direction but
directed the Appellant to install FGD within a
period of 23 months.

xi)   Only thereafter, the Appellant gave all
these details to the Distribution Licensee
through its letter dated 11.8.2010 about the

                                 Page 20 of 51
                             Appeal No.105 of 2011

pendency of the litigation, the committee's
report and the letter sent to the Ministry of
Environment and Forest and claimed the
financial benefits due to "Change in Law".
However,      on     11.8.2010,    the    Distribution
Licensee rejected the claim of the Appellant.

xii)    On this basis, the Appellant raised the
dispute for resolution. The meeting was held
between the parties to explore the possibility of
amicable settlement as contemplated in the
Power Purchase Agreement but the same did
not get materialised.

xiii)   Therefore, the Appellant filed Petition
No.99 of 2010 before the State Commission on
14.12.2010.        The Appellant has prayed the
State Commission in the petition to adjudicate
upon the dispute between the Appellant and
Distribution Licensee or in the alternative refer
the dispute to adjudication through arbitration.

xiv) The State Commission after hearing the
parties, by the order dated 25.5.2011 rejected
the petition filed by the Appellant on the
ground that the initial Environmental clearance
dated      17.5.2007      itself   mandated       the

                                         Page 21 of 51
                                   Appeal No.105 of 2011

         installation of the FGD and cost incurred for
         the said installation ought to have been
         included in the total cost by the Appellant and
         as such the same is not a "Change in law".

         xv)    Aggrieved by this order, this Appeal has
         been filed by the Appellant mainly on the
         ground that there was no statutory direction in
         the Environmental clearance mandating the
         installation of FGD prior to the direction of the
         Ministry   of   Environment   and    Forest   i.e.
         16.4.2010 and as such, it squarely falls within
         the definition of 'Change in Law under the
         PPA entered into between the Appellant and
         the Distribution Licensee.

10. Bearing these facts in our mind, let us now refer to
   the discussion and the finding referred to in the
   impugned order by the State Commission while
   rejecting the claim of the Appellant:

          "Having heard the parties and after
          considering the materials placed on
          record, the Commission has following
          observations:
               (i)    The Petitioner states that as per
                <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_2">Article 13.1.1</a> of the PPA dated 23rd
                February 2010, it is entitled to claim
                financial benefits due to change in

                                             Page 22 of 51
                   Appeal No.105 of 2011

law of that of the condition to install
FGD imposed under a letter dated
16th April 2010 of the MoEF issued to
the Petitioner imposing the following
as " "additional conditions" under
paragraph 2(i) in the said letter which
is extracted as follows:
"Flue Gas Desulphurisation System
(FGD) shall be installed      before
commissioning of the project and
action in this regard shall be
submitted within three months to the
Ministry".
ii) On account of the "additional
conditions", the Petitioner has
sought to claim Rs.150 Crore as an
increase in the project cost(one
fourth of total projected cost of 600
Crore of FGD plant) subsequent to
signing of the PPA and which is
stated to have a significant cost
impact on the contracted capacity of
300 MW to be supplied to the
Respondent.

iii) it is necessary therefore to
examine <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_3">Article 13.1.1</a> of the PPA
dated 23rd February 2010 as follows:-

     "Change in Law" means the
     occurrence of any of the
     following events after the date,



                          Page 23 of 51
                  Appeal No.105 of 2011

    which is seven (7) days, prior, to
    the Bid Deadline:



    i)   the enactment, bringing
    into       effect,     adoption,
    promulgation,        amendment,
    modification or repeal, of any
    Law or (ii) a change in the
    interpretation of any Law by a
    Competent      Court   of    law,
    tribunal of Indian Governmental
    Instrumentally provided such
    Court of law, tribunal on Indian
    Governmental Instrumentality is
    final authority under law for
    such interpretation but shall not
    include(i) any change in any
    withholding tax on income or
    dividends distributed to the
    shareholders of the Seller, or (ii)
    change in respect of UI Charges
    or frequency intervals by an
    Appropriate Commission.
(iv) As    per    the    Environmental
Clearance dated 17.5.2007, the
direction was given to keep the space
for installation of the FGD if required
and also for allocation of separate
funds for that purpose.      The letter
dated 16.4.2010 issued by the GOI
MoEF binds the Petitioner to install
the FGD before commissioning of the
project.    The Petitioner contended
that this subsequent imposition of


                          Page 24 of 51
                  Appeal No.105 of 2011

the condition is a change in law. As
per the above quoted provision of
change in law, the contention of the
petitioner is nowhere sustained in
the definition. Furthermore, as per
the Clause 5.4. of the PPA the Seller
i.e.   the    Petitioner    shall    be
responsible for obtaining all consents
required for developing, financing,
constructing,       operating      and
maintenance of the project, the
Petitioner shall also be responsible
for obtaining/maintaining/renewing
the Initial Consents and for fulfilling
all conditions specified therein.
(v) As per Clause 3.1.2.i of the PPA,
the Petitioner shall have received the
initial Consents as mentioned in
Schedule I either unconditionally or
subject to conditions which do not
materially prejudice its rights or the
performance of its obligations under
the Agreement. Schedule I include
the Clearance of State Pollution
Control Board/MoEF.         All these
clauses of the PPA cast the burden
on the Petitioner and further the
condition (xx) in the Environmental
Clearance protection measures and
that this cost should be included as
part of the project cost and not
diverted for any other purpose. Even
though the Petitioner stated that he
has not included the cost of the FGD
in the bid and now claiming for
enhancing the capital cost and tariff,

                          Page 25 of 51
                                  Appeal No.105 of 2011

               this claim is untenable. This claim of
               the Petitioner shows that, the
               Petitioner    has   disregarded    the
               directions of the MoEF.
               (vi) The Petitioner has made positive
               assertion/warranties in consonance
               with Condition 2.5. of Schedule 9
               that no litigation was pending or
               threatened against the Petitioner. By
               such positive assertion the Petitioner
               suppressed the pendency of litigation
               regarding Environmental Clearance.
               While the Commission records the
               above contention of Respondents and
               notes that the Petitioner has not
               disputed the same, this matter can
               not be taken up in the present
               proceedings of the Petitioner.
               In view of the above, the present
               Petition is hereby dismissed."
11. The crux of the findings given in the impugned order
   are as follows:-

         i)    According to the generating company, it
         is entitled to claim financial benefits due to
         "Change in Law" with regard to the condition in
         FGD imposed under letter dated 16.4.2010 by
         the Government directing the Company to
         impose the additional condition to the effect
         that the company shall install FGD before
         commissioning the Project. On account of the

                                          Page 26 of 51
                              Appeal No.105 of 2011

additional conditions, the generating company
sought     claim    of    Rs.150   crores    incurred
subsequent to signing the PPA as the said
additional conditions would amount to change
in law under clause 13.1.1 of the PPA.

ii)    According to the Generating Company,
as per the Environmental clearance dated
17.5.2007, direction was given to keep the
space for installation of FGD, if required, in
future, but the letter subsequently issued by
the Government on 16.4.2010 only binds the
generating company to install the FGD before
the commissioning the Project and therefore,
the subsequent imposition of condition is a
change in law.           This contention cannot be
accepted as it would not satisfy the definition
of the term 'Change in Law' as contained in
clause 13 of the PPA.

iii)   As per the clause 5.4. of the PPA, the
generating company namely Seller shall be
responsible for obtaining all the Consents
required      for         developing,       financing,
constructing, operating and maintenance of the
Project. This clause further provides that the


                                        Page 27 of 51
                          Appeal No.105 of 2011

generating company shall be responsible for
obtaining and renewing the initial consents and
other financial conditions specified there.

iv)   As per the clause 3.1.2 of the PPA, the
generating company shall receive all the initial
consents either unconditionally or subject to
some conditions which do not prejudice its
right or the performance of its obligations. All
these clauses of the PPA cast burden on the
generating company for obtaining all the
consents unconditionally or subject to some
conditions. Further, the condition (xx) in the
Environmental    clearance    dated    17.5.2007
mandates the generating company not only to
keep the space but also to allocate a separate
fund for implementation of the Environmental
protection measures and that this cost should
included as part of the Project cost which
should not be diverted for any other purpose.

v)    Even though, the generating company
has provided space for FGD, it has not
allocated the separate funds and not included
in the cost of the FGD in the bid. Even then,
the generating company is now claiming for


                                   Page 28 of 51
                            Appeal No.105 of 2011

enhancing the capital cost of the FGD which
has been spent subsequent to the PPA. Thus,
it is clear that the generating company has
disregarded the direction of the Ministry who
issued Environmental clearance.       Therefore,
this claim is untenable.

vi)   The Distribution Licensee has pointed
out that at the time of the submission of the bid
documents some litigation was pending with
reference to the Environmental clearance but
the same was not disclosed to the Distribution
Licensee while the bid documents have been
submitted and this shows that the generating
company has suppressed the pendency of the
litigation   regarding      the   Environmental
clearance in the bid documents. Even though
the Distribution Licensee raised this contention
on the point of non disclosure and the
Commission also recorded their contentions on
the impugned order, the Generating Company
has not disputed this.      However, this issue
cannot be decided in the present proceedings
of the generating company and it can be
decided later in the appropriate proceedings.

                                   Appeal No.105 of 2011

12. On these reasonings, the claim of the Appellant is
   rejected.

13. The Appellant, in this Appeal has raised two issues
   (1) Change in Law and (2) The effect of non-
   disclosure of pending litigation.

14. With reference to the 2nd issue relating to non-
   disclosure of pending litigation, we do not propose to
   deal with the said issue as the State Commission
   has held that the said issue can be decided later in
   the appropriate proceedings. In the absence of any
   findings with regard to the said issue by the State
   Commission, we do not want to go into the merits of
   that issue though the said issue has been
   elaborately argued by both the parties before this
   Tribunal.   That apart, the non-disclosure of the
   pending litigation will not be a relevant issue for
   considering the main issue which has been raised
   as the First Issue with regard to 'change in law'.
   Therefore, we deem it appropriate to go into the
   First issue regarding the change in law in detail.

15. The case of the Appellant in a nutshell is that the
   requirement as referred to in the Environmental
   Clearance dated 17.5.2007 was required to be
   carried out only in future and not at that stage, and

                                            Page 30 of 51
                                      Appeal No.105 of 2011

   that therefore, the direction for enforcement of the
   said condition by the Government of India by the
   letter dated 16.4.2010 amounts to change in law as
   per the PPA executed between the Appellant and
   the Distribution Licensee and consequently, the
   Appellant is entitled to claim the financial benefits of
   the said change in law. Thus, the Appellant relies
   upon     two   documents     namely       Environmental
   Clearance dated 17.5.2007 and the letter of Ministry
   of Forest dated 16.4.2010 in the light of the Clause
   providing for change in law in the PPA.

16. The    relevant   extract   of     the   Environmental
   clearance granted to the Appellant by the letter
   dated 17.5.2007 are as under:

          "3. The proposal has been considered in

</p>
<p id="p_8">18. It is true that in the Environmental clearance dated
   17.5.2007 in Para-(iii), the Appellant was directed to
   install the FGD at a later stage if required. However,
   it was to be noted that there is not only reference
   relating to identification of the space in the
   Environmental     Clearance     but    it     specifically
   mandated under Para (xx) that the Appellant should
   allocate separate funds for implementation of the
   Environmental protection measures and cost of the
   same should be included as part of the project cost.
   It further provided the funds earmarked for the same
   should not be diverted for any other purpose.

</p><p id="p_10">19. According to the Appellant, when the Environmental
   clearance was issued in favour of the Appellant, the
   FGD was not foreseen at that stage. As indicated
   above,    the    Environmental     clearance    dated
   17.5.2007 of course,     provided for installation of
   FGD at a later stage but it clearly mandated that the
   cost of the Environmental protection measures must
   be allocated and the said funds allocated, have to
   be included in the project cost and the same should
   not be diverted for any other purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_11">20. According to the Appellant, under Clause 13.1.1 of
   the PPA it is entitled to claim financial benefits due
   to change in law as the additional condition was
   imposed only through the letter dated 16.4.2010
   sent by the Ministry of Environment and Forest by
   directing the Appellant that     the FGD was to be
   installed before commissioning the project and this
   additional condition was not provided in the
   Environmental Clearance dated 17.5.2007 and that
   on account of the additional condition, the Appellant
   had incurred a sum of Rs.150 Crores as an increase
   in the project cost.

<p id="p_12">21. Therefore, in view of the above contention urged by
   the Appellant, it would be appropriate to refer to

   at later stage and also to allocate separate funds for
   that purpose which should not be diverted for any
   other purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_22">24. On going through the letter dated 16.4.2010 issued
   by the Ministry, it is evident that the Appellant is
   bound to install the FGD before commissioning of
   the project.         According to the Appellant, the
   subsequent imposition of the condition is a change
   in law.     To interpretate this clause in order to
   understand the real meaning of the term "Change in
   Law", we have to refer to the other clauses.
</p>
<p id="p_23">25. As per clause 5.4 of the PPA, the Appellant shall be
   responsible for obtaining consents required for
   developing, financing, constructing, operating and
   maintenance of the project.         Not only that, the
   Appellant    shall     be   responsible   for   obtaining,
   maintaining and renewing the initial consents and
   also for fulfilling all conditions specified therein.
   Clause 5.4 of the PPA is quoted below:

</blockquote><p id="p_25">27. That apart, the clause xx of the Environmental
   clearance dated 17.5.2007 has mandated the
   Appellant a separate fund for implementation of the
   Environmental protection measures.           It also
   provided a condition that this cost, namely separate
   funds should be included as part of the project cost
   and not diverted for any other purpose. Clause xx of

         expenditure should be reported to the

</blockquote><p id="p_26">28. Under these circumstances, the question would
   arise like this: "whether the Appellant can now
   claim for enhancement of the capital cost in the
   absence of the allocation of separate funds for
   installing FGD which is to be included as part of
   the project cost ?".
</p>
<p id="p_27">29. On a careful perusal and on a combined reading of
   relevant clauses of the PPA, the Environmental
   Clearance dated 17.5.2007 and the letter issued by
   the Central Government on 16.4.2010, it is clear that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                          Page 39 of 51</span>
                                   Appeal No.105 of 2011

   there is no change in law as contemplated by the
   PPA.
</p>
<p id="p_28">30. As mentioned above, Environmental clearance
   dated 17.5.2007 provided for installation of the FGD
   at a later stage and further mandated that separate
   funds must be allocated for installation of the said
   FGD as well as for making such Environmental
   protection measures which are to be included in the
   project cost. Admittedly, this has not been complied
   with by the Appellant after getting the Environmental
   clearance. The letter dated 16.4.2010 issued by the
   Central      Government     merely     confirms    the
   requirement of installation of the FGD intimated
   earlier. It merely informs the Appellant the stage of
   installation.   Therefore, there was no 'Change in
   Law' which has been occasioned as claimed by the
   Appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_29">31. The contention of the Appellant regarding the status
   of it Environmental clearance and the connected
   claim of change in law has also to be appreciated in
   view of the observations made by Delhi High Court
   in   the   order   dates   16.9.2009   regarding   the
   Environmental clearance as under:

report submitted by KKVD it would take
about four years of detailed study to
effectively evaluate the impact of the

existing material, in form of assessment
studies conducted by EQMS India Pvt.
Ltd., and predictions on the level of
pollutants made by MPCB and Central
Pollution Control Board, Delhi, had stated
that it was likely that there would not be
any adverse impact on horticulture, mango
plantations or marine life, subject to the
condition that the respondent no.3 strictly
maintained       adherence       to    their
commitments. The so called report
submitted by KKVD is extremely guarded
and cautious. It was not based on their
data and studies. It was not conclusive and
does not give approval but qualified
statements were made. Further KKVD in
clear terms had stated that any final
assessment would require a detailed study
for a period of four years to evaluate the
impact on mango plantations and the
marine life/fisheries. This was noted by the
expert committee themselves in their
minutes dated 12-14th March, 2007 quoted

</p><p id="p_32">32. The observation of Delhi High Court particularly at
    paragraph-21 quoted above, clarifies the status of
    requirement of the installation of the FGD in the
    project. The High Court has clearly stated that what
    the expert appraisal committee considered in its
    earlier meeting dated 14.3.2007 was only a
    preliminary report which was extremely guarded.

<p id="p_34">34. This observation of the Delhi High Court read along
    with the mandate that the funds were to be
    separately allocated for the same which was to be
    included in the project cost clearly mandates that the
    situation as projected by the Appellant does not fall
    within "Change of Law". It is in this light that the
    Environmental clearance granted on 17.5.2007 has
    to be seen.

<p id="p_35">35. As mentioned above, the condition No (iii) would
    mandate that the space provision shall be made for
    installation of FGD at a later stage. The Para (xx)


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                             Page 43 of 51</span>
                                    Appeal No.105 of 2011

   would also provide that separate funds would be
   allocated for implementation of these conditions and
   the said funds should be included as a part of the
   project cost. Therefore, the specific direction given
   to   the   Appellant   even    in   the   Environmental
   clearance would reveal that the Appellant was duty
   bound to include the fund allocation in the project
   cost. Admittedly, this was not done.
</p>
<p id="p_36">36. The Appellant now seeks to rely only upon the
   condition that the space provision for FGD is made if
   required in future. But the Appellant, in fact has not
   taken note of the remaining conditions as to the fund
   allocation and inclusion of the same in the project
   cost.
</p>
<p id="p_37">37. According to the Appellant, FGD fund is not required
   to be included in the project cost. There is no merit
   in this substance.
</p>
<p id="p_38">38. Let us again refer to the conditions in the
   Environmental clearance dated 17.5.2007:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">           "(ii) the detailed study regarding the impact of
           the project, if any, on Alphanso mango and
           marine fisheries as recommended in the
           report of Dr. B.S. Konkan Krishi Vidyapith
           shall be undertaken. Based on the same,
           additional safeguard measures as may be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                              Page 44 of 51</span>
                                   Appeal No.105 of 2011

          required will be taken by the proponent with
          prior approval of the Ministry of Environment
          and Forests. A copy of the report will be
          submitted to the Ministry. The cost towards
          undertaking the study and implementation
          of safeguard measures if any, will be borne
          by the project.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">          (iii) Space provision shall be made for
          installation of FGD of requisite efficiency
          of removal of SO2, if required at later
          stage.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">          ...................
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">          (xx) Separate funds should be allocated
          for implementation of Environmental
          protection measures along with item wise
          break up. These cost should be included
          as part of the project cost. The funds
          earmarked for the environment protection
          measures should not be diverted for other
          purposes and year wise expenditure should
          be reported to the Ministry".
</blockquote><p id="p_39">39. So, the reading of the conditions in entirety referred
    to in the Environmental clearance would make it
    clear that there was a mandate with regard to the
    requirement of earmarking of funds for FGD as well.
    The study to be carried out was specific to the case
    of the Appellant's plant as it is recorded that the
    study is to be carried out in terms and the
    recommendations in the report of KKVD. This has
    been referred to in the order of the Delhi High Court


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                            Page 45 of 51</span>
                                  Appeal No.105 of 2011

   while reference was made to the minutes of the 42nd
   Meeting of the Expert Appraise Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_40">40. The contention of the Appellant to the effect that
   Environmental    clearance    did   not   require     the
   installation of FGD is to be accepted, then the said
   Environmental clearance would have categorically
   stated that FGD is not required and in that event,
   the directions for such specific funds allocation
   would not have been issued.
</p>
<p id="p_41">41. On the other hand, as mentioned above, there is a
   specific requirement regarding space as well as
   separate fund allocation.
</p>
<p id="p_42">42. This can be viewed from yet another angle.
   Admittedly, the Appellant was declared as a
   successful bidder after competitive bidding process.
   As indicated above, the Environmental clearance
   dated 17.5.2007 contemplated installation of FGD at
   a later stage with inclusion of cost for all
   Environmental measures in the project cost.         If the
   claim of the Appellant is to be accepted, then it
   would defeat the sanctity of the competitive bidding
   process.   Not only that, the other bidders who had
   participated in the bidding would also be pre-
   judicially affected.   In fact, the Appellant after

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                             Page 46 of 51</span>
                                         Appeal No.105 of 2011

    ignoring the relevant conditions referred to in the
    Environmental clearance relating to the inclusion of
    project cost has allegedly submitted the bids without
    FGD cost, getting into the zone of consideration in
    the bidding process having been bidder L-3 and
    thereafter revising the project cost. Due to this, the
    entire bidding process and the interest of other
    bidders get vitiated.
</p>
<p id="p_43">43. Even the mandate contained in Clause 13 of the
    PPA relating to the change in law clearly stipulates
    that the change in law can be taken into
    consideration only in respect of occurrence of
    events after the cut-off date which is 7 days prior to
    the dead line.     In the present case, the cut-off date
    is 14.2.2008.    In a Regulatory regime, the sanctity
    of the PPA and the representation and warranties
    made    by   the     parties   in    entering   into   such
    agreements have to be given due consideration.
    The claim of the Appellant cannot be permitted to
    vitiate the bidding process and to pre-judicially affect
    other bidders.
</p>
<p id="p_44">44. The case of the Appellant is that it was not required
    to install FGD system till the execution of the PPA




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                Page 47 of 51</span>
                                     Appeal No.105 of 2011

    and also it was not required to allot separate funds.
    This is misconceived.
</p>
<p id="p_45">45. As indicated above, Clause 4.1.1 (a) of the PPA,
    read with Schedule-I, clearly casts the responsibility
    on the Appellant to obtain all requisite, consents and
    approvals. Clause 13 relating to change in law of
    the PPA has to be read along with Clause 2.5 of the
    Schedule 9 of the PPA which relates to the
    representation and warranties.      Therefore, Clause
    13 cannot be read in isolation. The change in law
    contemplated U/S 13 of the PPA is seven (7) days
    prior to the bid dead line in this case i.e. 14.2.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_46">46. It is a settled law that the terms of a contract have
    to be read as a whole and cannot be read in
    isolation. There is no change as sought to be
    claimed by the Appellant. The mere intimation of
    the stage for installation of FGD is not a change in
    law or interpretation of law.      We find that prior
    Environmental clearance granted was conditional
    and that the entire bid of the Appellant was on the
    basis of the representation of the Appellant is
    indicative of the fact that the FGD was required to
    be installed by the Appellant and the Appellant was
    well aware of the same.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                              Page 48 of 51</span>
<p id="p_47">                                    Appeal No.105 of 2011

</p><p id="p_48">47. The Appellant's argument is that very purpose of
   Clause 13 of the PPA was to ensure that the lowest
   tariff is produced in the competitive bidding process
   based on the legal requirements as on the bid
   deadline and any future changes in law would be
   adjusted in the tariff. This argument has no basis.
</p>
<p id="p_49">48. According to the Distribution Licensee (R-1), fixing
   of the price is vital aspect in the bidding process but
   the requirement to disclose the material facts is
   more vital so as to enable the tenderer to disclose
   the most sustainable price offer as well.
</p>
<p id="p_50">49. There is one more document which is in support of
   the Respondent. The minutes of the 62nd Meeting
   dated 12.1.2010 will make it evident that the
   Environmental clearance was conditional and the
   requirement to install FGD was not done away with.
   As a matter of fact, this condition was made
   unambiguous from the subsequent letter from the
   Ministry of Environment and Forest dated 16.4.2010.
   In this letter, the Ministry has directed that subject to
   implementation of the condition of the Environmental
   clearance, the FGD shall be installed.              This
   condition was expressly stipulated in the letter dated
   16.4.2010, relating to the conditions mentioned in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                             Page 49 of 51</span>
                                 Appeal No.105 of 2011

   both the clearance granted on 17.5.2007 as well as
   in the minutes of the 62nd Meeting of the Expert
   Appraisal Committee. Hence there is no merit in the
   claim of the Appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_51">50. Summary of Our Findings

</p><p id="p_52">   (i)      The    Environmental   Clearance    dated
   17.5.2007 provided for installation of the FGD at
   a later stage. It further mandated that separate
   funds must be allotted for installation of the said
   FGD, which are to be included in the project
   cost.    Admittedly, these conditions have not
   been complied with by the Appellant after
   getting the Environmental Clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_53">   (ii)    On a careful perusal of the relevant clause
   of the PPA, the Environmental Clearance dated
   17.5.2007 and the letter issued by the Central
   Government on 16.4.2010, it is clear that there is
   no "Change in Law" as contemplated by the
   PPA. In fact, the letter dated 16.4.2010 issued by
   the Central Government merely confirms the
   requirement of installation of the FGD intimated
   through the letter dated 17.5.2007.      It merely
   informs the Appellant the state of the installation
   of the FGD. Therefore, there is no "Change in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                         Page 50 of 51</span>

    law"   as   claimed    by   the   Appellant.      The
    reasonings given in the impugned order for
    rejecting the claim of the Appellant are perfectly
    valid in law.
</p>
<p id="p_54">51. In view of the above findings, we find that there is no
    merit in the Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_55">52. Consequently, the Appeal is dismissed as devoid of
    merits. However, there is no order as to costs.</p><pre id="pre_2">
