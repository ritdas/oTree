<p id="p_1">T.S.Thakur, C.J. (Oral)

             The grievance of the petitioner in this petition filed in public

interest is that the brick kiln established by respondent No. 3 violates the

siting guidelines for such kilns and that emission from the kilns are beyond

the permissible limits under the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_2">             Insofar as the first limb of the grievance made by the petitioner
 CWP No.5118 of 2007                                               [2]

is concerned, it is not in dispute that the unit was a pre-existing unit as on

the date the guidelines were issued. There was therefore no question of the

said unit being subjected to the rigors of any such siting guidelines. In the

case of existing units all that is      required is that   the stack emissions

standards shall be 500 Mg/mm3. This is evident from the following passage

appearing in the said guidelines:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                      " 2.2.3. The guidelines for sitting of the Brick Kilns,

                      Cement Plants/Grinding Units as prescribed by the

                      Board are as under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             The following siting guidelines have been framed by the Board

             for setting up of Brick Kilns, Cement Plants/Grinding units:-

</blockquote><pre id="pre_2">              Sr. No.                Distance from                  Distance
             i)          Municipal Corporation Limits             5 Km
             ii)         Class A Town &amp; Cities Limits             2 Km
             Iii)        Other Town and Cities Limits             1 Km
             iv)         Village Lal Dora/Phirni                  500 Mts.
             v.          Wild Life Sanctuary/Zoo                  500 Mts.
             vi.         National Highway                         500 Mts.
             Vii.        State Highway/Scheduled Road             300 Mts.
             Viii.       Residential Area (15 pucca houses)       300 Mts.

                         Monuments


             .        Emission Standards for Brick Kiln

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                      S.P.M. (Mg/Nm3)                       750</span>


             .        The existing units not meeting the prescribed siting

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                      guidelines will meet a stack emission standard of 500
                      mg/Nm3."(emphasis supplied)

             The only question then is           whether the Stack Emission
 CWP No.5118 of 2007                                            [2]

standards of 500 Mg/mm3 are being violated by the brick kiln established

by the respondent. We had in that regard directed the Punjab Pollution

Control Board by our order dated 16.9.2008 to take samples and report

whether the stack emissions were within the permissible limits for a brick

kiln established within the prohibited distance under the siting guidelines.

</blockquote><p id="p_3">Learned counsel for the Punjab Pollution Control Board in compliance with

the said directions has placed on record a status report, according to which

as against the upper limit 500 Mg/NM3, the SPM at the brick kiln in

question has been recorded as 416 Mg/NM3 at 12% Carbon dioxide. This is

according to Punjab Pollution Control Board within the permissible limits.

In that view, therefore, the brick kiln does not appear to us to be violating

the stack emission standards stipulated for such kilns. There is no merit in

this petition which fails and is hereby dismissed but in the circumstances

without any order as to costs.
