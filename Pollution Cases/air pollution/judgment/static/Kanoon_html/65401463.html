PER GEORGE MATHAN, JUDICIAL MEMBER

           These five appeals are filed by the assessee against the

consolidated order of the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals)-17,

Chennai     in ITA No.94,95/16-17, 167/15-16 &amp; 96/16-17                 dated

27.12.2017 for the assessment years 2009-10 to 2012-13.
</p><p id="p_2">                                   :- 2 -:       ITA Nos.738 to 742/Chny/2018



</p><p id="p_3">2.        Shri R.Vijayaraghavan represented on behalf of the Assessee,

and Shri AR.V.Sreenivasan represented on behalf of the Revenue.

</p><p id="p_4">3.        Since the issues raised in all these appeals of assessee are

interconnected, these appeals are heard together and dispose of by

this common order.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.        It was submitted by the ld.AR that the assessee is a Board

constituted u/s.4 of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1974. It was a submission that the assessee is a Board of the

State Government, which collects fees from the various industrial units

coming under the provisions of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. The assessee also receives grants from the

Central Pollution Control Board for application towards specific purpose

as set out by the Board. The whole income of assessee is applied

towards the object of the Board for public utility purposes and the

surplus amounts are held in the form of bank deposit for future

application towards the objects of the Board. It was submitted that till

01.04.2003, the income of assessee was totally exempt u/s.10(20) of

the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_3">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961 (in short 'the Act'). The assessee had made

an application dated 23.08.2004 for grant of exemption u/s.10(23)(iv)

of the act in Form 56 along with copies of the audited accounts for the

preceding last three years. It was a submission that the assessee was

to get the registration, but no notification u/s.10(23)(iv) of the act was
                                   :- 3 -:       ITA Nos.738 to 742/Chny/2018



issued for granting exemption under the Act.          Consequently, the

assessment order pertaining to relevant assessment years was passed

by issue of notice u/s.147 of the Act and the receipt of the assessee

was treated as taxable. The assessee had made an application to the

CBDT, which came to be disposed off on 10.03.2017 and subsequently

on 27.12.2018, the assessee had filed a Writ Petition (W.P) No.6281 of

2019 before the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court and the same was

pending for disposal. It was a submission that the issue of grant of

exemption by issuing of necessary notification granting the assessee

exemption u/s.10(23)(iv) of the act was pending before the Hon'ble

Jurisdictional High Court. It was a prayer that the assessee had no

objection, if the issues in the appeals of the assessee may be restored

to the file of Assessing Officer for re-adjudication after the decision of

the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court in W.P No.6281 of 2019.

</p><p id="p_6">5.        In reply, the ld.DR submitted that he had no objection, if the

issues in these appeals were restored to the file of Assessing Officer

for re-adjudication after the decision of the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High

Court in respect of W.P No.6281 of 2019.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">6.        We have heard the rival contentions and perused the

material available on record. As it is noticed that the W.P No.6281 of

2019 wherein the assessee has sought exemption u/s.10(23)(iv) of the
                                      :- 4 -:           ITA Nos.738 to 742/Chny/2018



   act, is still pending before the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court, and as

   it is noticed that the decision of the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court

   in W.P referred to supra filed by the assessee, would have direct

   bearing in the outcome of the grant of exemption in the assessee's

   case, in the interest of natural justice, the issues in the appeals of the

   assessee    are   restored   to   the   file   of   Assessing     Officer   for

   re-adjudication after considering the directions issued by the Hon'ble

   Jurisdictional High Court in the W.P filed by the assessee


</p><p id="p_9">   7.         In the result, all the five appeals filed by the assessee for

   assessment years 2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2011-12 &amp; 2012-13 are

   partly allowed for statistical purposes.
