Rule is not required to be issued to them.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.     By the present petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India, the petitioner has challenged the order dated
5.12.2014 passed in Appeal No.83 of 2014 preferred by the petitioner
against the order dated 24.9.2014 passed by respondent No.3-
District Development Officer suspending the petitioner from the office
of the Sarpanch in exercise of the powers under Section 59 of the
Gujarat Panchayat Act, 1993 ('the Act').
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.     The case of the petitioner is that one Somabhai Rajabhai
Rathod since established an Unit of grinding bones just at the
distance 200 to 300 meters from the residential area of the village,
the petitioner as a Sarpanch wrote to the Pollution Board on
26.11.2013 and to other authorities on behalf of the people of the
village who suffered lot of hardships and unbearable smell coming
out on account of grinding bones. On such application made by the
petitioner, site inspection of such Unit was carried out by the officer
of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and having found substance in
the grievance raised by the petitioner, it was assured by the Board to
take   needful action. It is further case of the petitioner that since
immediate action was not taken, the matter was pursued as drinking
water for the people of the village started getting polluted and it was
thereafter, the Board     passed oder under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_2">Section 31</a> of the       Air
Pollution (Prevention and <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_3">Control) Act</a>,1981 dated 3.1.2014          for
closure of the manufacturing process, wherein it is found recorded
that the Unit was established without obtaining prior permission of
the Board and such Unit was run by removing dead animals from the
gaucher land. It is further case of the petitioner that the petitioner
filed written complaint dated 17.2.2014 against owner of the Unit Mr.

Somabhai Rathod with Rajula Police Station so as to see that
manufacturing activity of crushing bones may not spread diseases in
the village. However, grievances raised by the petitioner and the
villagers were not liked by owner of the Unit Shri Somabhai Rathod
and his son and he then started threatening the petitioner and other
persons for which the petitioner gave one more complaint on
17.2.2014. It is also averred in the petition that on the basis of the
order made by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, the electricity
company was instructed to disconnect the electric connection of the
Unit. Thereafter, the electric connection of the Unit was discontinued
pursuant to the order dated 26.2.2014 made by the Board. But, on
account of such actions, said Shri Somabhai Rathod issued notice
dated 20.3.2014 to the petitioner stating that he was holding licence
for running the Unit and as per the Rules and Regulations, he was
running the Unit but he was being unnecessarily harassed as he
belonged to Scheduled Tribe community and that removal of a person
belonging to Scheduled tribe from his land or taking away of his
rights would amount to an offence of atrocity and if the petitioner did
not withdraw the complaint made against him, he would take
necessary legal actions under the Atrocity Act against the petitioner.
As per the case of the petitioner, it is thereafter said Shri Somabhai
Rathod lodged the complaint on 26.5.2014 against the petitioner and
other three persons under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_4">Sections 323</a>, <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_5">324</a>, <a href="/doc/764237/" id="a_6">394</a>, <a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_7">504</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_8">506(2)</a> and
<a href="/doc/112749/" id="a_9">114</a> of the Indian Penal Code, <a href="/doc/42436223/" id="a_10">Sections 3</a>,<a href="/doc/75231395/" id="a_11">5</a>,<a href="/doc/195629998/" id="a_12">10</a>,<a href="/doc/42436223/" id="a_13">3(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/75231395/" id="a_14">5</a> of the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocity) Act and Section
135 of the Gujarat Police Act, alleging assault and snatching away of
golden chain from his neck and hurling dis-respective words
(derogatory words). Based on such complaint, action of suspending
the petitioner under <a href="/doc/50707649/" id="a_15">Section 59</a> of the Act was taken against the
petitioner by respondent No.3, which was challenged by the
petitioner by way of appeal before the respondent No.2 and having

failed in the appeal, the petitioner has filed the present petition.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.     Learned advocate Ms. Bela Prajapati appearing for the
petitioner submitted that respondent Nos.3 and 2 have committed
serious error in simply considering the FIR lodged by Shri Somabhai
Patel and ignoring other vital facts presented by the petitioner for
taking action under <a href="/doc/50707649/" id="a_16">Section 59</a> of the Act. Ms. Prajapati submitted
that though on the basis of a pending criminal complaint, action
under <a href="/doc/50707649/" id="a_17">Section 59</a> of the Act could be taken, but such is not an
absolute rule, especially when relevant factors which might tilt the
balance in favour of the petitioner are emerging for consideration by
the competent authority. Ms. Prajapati submitted that in a given case,
contents of the complaint may project that it is a case of moral
turpitude, but if the conduct of the informant in lodging the complaint
appears to be not bonafide based on some material placed before
the competent authority, then the competent authority has got
discretion not to pass order under <a href="/doc/50707649/" id="a_18">Section 59</a> of the Act. Ms. Prajapati
submitted that here is a case where the petitioner acted for well
being of the people of the village and it was on his action of pursuing
the concerned authorities of Pollution Board, the Pollution Board
passed order for closure of the Unit of the informant and based on
such   order,    even     electric   connection     of   the   informant   was
disconnected which led the informant to issue notice for filing
complaint under the Atrocity Act and thereafter, the complaint under
the Atrocity Act and for other offences was lodged which would
show that lodging of the FIR was pre-decided when notice was issued
and though the offences as alleged in the FIR had never taken place,
the FIR was lodged. Ms. Prajapati submitted that veracity of the
contents of the FIR       could be tested before the competent Court,
however respondent Nos.2 and 3 should have been mindful to the
facts presented by the petitioner before taking action under <a href="/doc/50707649/" id="a_19">Section
59</a> of the Act. Ms. Prajapati submitted that in the facts of the case,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     Page 4 of 10</span>
         C/SCA/2393/2015                                 JUDGMENT




suspension of the petitioner from the office of Sarpanch was not
warranted and therefore, this is a fit case where this Court should
exercise its extraordinary power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_20">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
of India to quash and set aside the impugned orders.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.    As against the above arguments, learned advocate Mr.
Chaniyara for respondent No.3 submitted that contents of the FIR
would clearly reveal that the acts alleged to have been committed by
the petitioner amounted to moral turpitude and therefore, respondent
No.3 was justified in suspending the petitioner from the office of
Sarpanch relying on the FIR. Mr. Chaniyara submitted that along with
the offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_21"> the Indian Penal Code</a>, offences under the Atrocity
Act are also alleged and considering such offences under the Atrocity
Act, the respondent No.3 has rightly come to the conclusion that the
petitioner while holding the office of Sarpanch indulged into the acts
constituting moral turpitude. Mr. Chaniyara submitted that simply
because the petitioner as Sarpanch had taken up some causes for the
village people by addressing representations to the concerned
authorities for closure of the Unit of the informant on the ground that
manufacturing activities were causing pollution in the village, it could
not be said that the impugned order of suspending him was not
independent action and unless contrary is proved, the competent
authority is presumed to have considered all other aspects of the
matter, including filing of the complaint by him against the informant-
Mr. Somabhai Rathod. Mr. Chaniyara submitted that the petitioner
since holding the office of Sarpanch, is found to have acted in a way
not befitting his position as Sarpanch, it could not be said that
respondent No.3 exceeded his power while passing the impugned
order. Mr. Chaniyara submitted that the Appellate Authority has well
considered the material on record and committed no error in
concurring with the view taken by the respondent No.3.

</p><p id="p_7">6.    Learned Assistant Government Pleader Mr. Raval appearing for
respondent Nos.1 and 2 while adopting the arguments of learned
advocate Mr. Chaniyara submitted that the Appellate Authority has
considered the contents of the FIR and other material and found that
the petitioner has        indulged into the acts of moral turpitude and
therefore, the Appellate Authority has rightly dismissed the appeal of
the petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_8">7.    Having heard learned advocates for the parties, it appears that
based on the FIR          registered as C.R. No.I-47 of 2014 lodged with
Rajula Police Station for the offences 323, 324, 394, 504, 506(2) and
114<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_22"> of the Indian Penal Code</a>, <a href="/doc/42436223/" id="a_23">Sections 3</a>,<a href="/doc/75231395/" id="a_24">5</a>,<a href="/doc/195629998/" id="a_25">10</a>,<a href="/doc/42436223/" id="a_26">3(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/75231395/" id="a_27">5</a> of the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocity) Act and Section
135 of the Gujarat Police Act on 26.5.2014, action under <a href="/doc/50707649/" id="a_28">Section 59</a> of
the   Act   was      initiated   against      the   petitioner.   In   ordinary
circumstances, only the nature of offences alleged would be relevant
to decide whether alleged acts would amount to moral turpitude so
as to call for action of suspension under <a href="/doc/50707649/" id="a_29">Section 59</a> of the Act.
However, when there are other circumstances, notice of which if
could be taken from the materials available, which may require
consideration to decide whether the action of suspension under
<a href="/doc/50707649/" id="a_30">Section 59</a> of the Act is warranted, the competent authority may be
obliged to consider such other circumstances before taking action
under <a href="/doc/50707649/" id="a_31">Section 59</a> of the Act. The alleged offences under the Atrocity
Act may amount to moral turpitude but even then without going into
the veracity or otherwise of the allegations in the complaint, the
competent authority is under obligation to consider other relevant
factors presented by the person facing action of suspension. The
petitioner in his reply to the show cause notice has well presented
such relevant aspects for consideration by the competent authority.
The petitioner has pointed out that he had moved Gujarat Pollution

Control Board, as a result of which the Unit of the informant was
closed on finding that the Unit was causing pollution and the electric
connection of the Unit was also disconnected. The petitioner has also
stated that he was threatened of dire consequences by the informant,
for which he represented before various authorities to take necessary
action and filed complaint only thereafter, the petitioner was issued
legal notice by informant for filing criminal complaint under the
Atrocity Act. The Court finds that such facts stated in the reply are
supported by the documents presented by the petitioner. However,
on perusal of the impugned order dated 24.9.2014 passed by the
respondent No.3, it appears that though action taken by the
petitioner as a Sarpanch for closure of the Unit run by the informant
and the complaint filed by the petitioner has been taken note of,
however such facts are not given much importance on the ground
that the petitioner remained in custody between 29.5.2015 and
4.6.2014 and the offences alleged are of moral turpitude. It appears
that further fact which has weighed with respondent No.3 is of filing
the charge-sheet in connection with the FIR lodged by the informant.
</p>

<p id="p_9">8.     The Court finds from Annexure-A, which is a communication
addressed by the petitioner as back as on 26.11.2013 as a Sarpanch
of the Village with signatures of various other persons to Mamlatdar
and other authorities, including respondent No.3, bringing to the
notice of the concerned authority that only at the distance of 200 to
300 kilometers from the residential area of the village, the informant
was running an Unit for crushing bones of dead animals by bringing
dead animals from various other villages and requesting vide this
very   communication      to   relieve   the    village   people   from   the
harassment caused by dogs which used to gather at the place of Unit
of the informant where dead animals were brought. It appears that
in response to such application, site inspection was made by the
officers of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and thereafter, the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 Page 7 of 10</span>
            C/SCA/2393/2015                                            JUDGMENT




petitioner was informed vide letter dated 17.12.2013 that what was
stated by the petitioner in his communication had substance and the
petitioner was assured of taking further action by the head office of
the Board. The petitioner then sent one more communication dated
23.12.2013 at Annexure-C which appears to have been singed by not
less than 50 to 60 villagers bringing to the notice of the concerned
authorities about the nuisance being created by bad smell coming
out from the Units of the informant and requesting to take immediate
action in the matter. It appears that thereafter the Pollution Board
passed order under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_32">Section 31A</a> of the Air Pollution (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_33">Control)     Act</a>,1981        at   Annexure-E,        ordering   the    informant     to
immediately close down the manufacturing activities in the Unit and
also to close captive power plant if was in operation for such activity
and to stop using electricity supplied by the electricity company till
further order was made and to remove dead animals from the
gaucher land of the village. By the said order, the informant was put
to notice that if directions issued in the order were not complied with,
necessary complaint               under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_34">Section 37</a> of the               Air Pollution
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_35">Control) Act</a> would be filed against responsible
person. It appears that thereafter, the petitioner filed one complaint
before Police Inspector, Rajula Police Station against the informant
and other responsible persons associated with the Unit alleging that
since the petitioner had taken up cause by approaching the Board
and had taken other actions against the Unit, the petitioner and
village    people were being threatened to do away with their lives,
copy of such complaint filed on 17.2.2014 is at Annexure-I. Copy of
such complaint appears to have been sent to the high ranking
officers, including          DIG of   Junagadh Range and the Collector. It
appears that the petitioner was informed by the Pollution Board vide
letter dated 26.2.2014 about the action of sealing the Unit taken by
the Collector and disconnection of the electric supply                           by the

Electricity Company. What is more relevant is the notice dated
20.3.2014 issued by the informant to the petitioner at Annexure-O
stating that the informant was holding the Unit in the name of
'Ramdev Bone Mill', which he was running under the licence and as
per the rules and regulations and further stating that since he being
the person from the Scheduled Tribe, he was targeted by making ill-
founded allegations against him. In this very notice, it is stated that
any act of taking away his land or interfering with his rights would
amount to the offence of atrocity and the petitioner was asked to
withdraw the complaint made by him within 10 days failing which the
petitioner was threatened of taking legal action under the Atrocity
Act. It is thereafter, the petitioner addressed one complaint dated
4.4.2014 to the Police Inspector about the threat administered to him
and requested to give him protection. The petitioner also addressed
representation dated 12.5.2014 to the Collector apprehending
happening of unavoidable incident in the village if no proper action
was taken. It was then the FIR was lodged by the informant on
26.5.2014, i.e. almost after a period of two months from the date of
issuance of notice by him to the petitioner. In the FIR, the petitioner
and other three persons are alleged to have assaulted, insulted and
humiliated the informant by derogatory words. If the matter is
examined in light of the facts emerging from the material on record,
the Court finds that it is not a case where action under <a href="/doc/50707649/" id="a_36">Section 59</a> of
the Act was warranted simply on the basis of the FIR lodged by the
informant. When there are no other allegations against the petitioner
and when it clearly appears that the petitioner pursued his actions for
closure of the Unit of the informant, which was     allegedly causing
pollution and nuisance in the village, the competent authority ought
not to have been oblivious about such pursuits of the petitioner. In
such view of the matter, the impugned orders are required to be
quashed and set aside.

</p><p id="p_11">9.      It appears that pending the petition, process for election was
sought to be undertaken by the Election Officer for the office of
Sarpanch. The petitioner, therefore, moved Civil Application seeking
restraint order against the Election officer and for adding the Election
Commissioner and Election officer as party respondents                     to this
petition. The Court finds that by order dated 1.5.2015, notification
dated 27.4.2015 declaring the election was stayed, that is how the
election for the office of Sarpanch was not held. For the above-said
limited purpose, the Election Commissioner and Election officer were
joined and therefore, as stated above, for the purpose of examining
the main issue in the matter, they are formal parties.

Impugned order dated 5.12.2014 passed in Appeal No.83 of 2014 by
the     respondent      No.2   and   order      dated   24.9.2014     passed   by
respondent No.3- District Development Officer are quashed and set
aside. Rule is made absolute accordingly.
