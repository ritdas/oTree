taken by the plaintiff from the Tahsildar, Bangalore North Taluk,

Bangalore, on 29.10.1993, and possession of other areas of land in

the said survey number, was also delivered to the KSRTC and

Revenue    Department      of   Government     of    Karnataka.   One

Ramachandra, S/o. Late Hanumanthappa had filed Public Interest

Litigation (PIL) in respect of the suit schedule land before the

Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in W.P.No.24185/1997 (GM-PIL).

After hearing the matter, said Writ Petition was disposed of on

23.02.2001 issuing the directions and as per directions issued in the

said Writ Petition, the Principal Secretary to the Department of

Revenue called a meeting on 10.04.2001 and it was resolved in the

meeting that the KSRTC should retain an extent of 3.00 acres of

land, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (plaintiff) should retain

an extent of 2.00 acres of land and Revenue Department should

retain 3 acres 1 gunta of land. The area measuring 4.00 acres of

land so contributed by the plaintiff and the other two authorities

described in the schedule to be handed over to the Karnataka State

Pollution Control Board (plaintiff) for developing the park / garden.

However, the right and title of the said park / garden should be with

the Government of Karnataka.               Accordingly, as per Government

Order dated 14.05.2001, the plaintiff authorities contributed the land

for developing the said park by drawing a detailed plan and

possession was also given to the plaintiff. The matter was

deliberated in the office of Chief Engineer of the defendants in the

presence of Ministers of the Government of Karnataka and the

concerned members of the defendants. The Chief Engineer of the

defendants as per direction of 2nd defendant, by his letter dated

18.10.2011, with reference to the direction of the Hon'ble High

Court of Karnataka about the Writ Petition as referred to, informed

the plaintiff-Board to develop the park / garden in the suit schedule

property. Thus, the things stood as stated above, the officials of

defendants came to the suit schedule land where the plaintiff was

developing the park / garden and obstructed the work undertaken

by the plaintiff, high-handed and illegally in the 3rd week of

December 2011 and blocked the North-Eastern main entrance / gate

of the plaintiff to the building constructed by it on the retained land

of   the   plaintiff   wherein   the        Regional   Office   and   Central

Environmental Laboratory was established in the year 2007.               The

defendants started putting up the footpath, around the schedule

property obstructing the main entrance of the plaintiff, which affects

the plaintiff's access to the building through the existing narrow

entrance. The plaintiff has laid 11 K.V. cable underneath the said

North-Eastern approach road which was blocked by the defendants

and its officers and it has made difficult to attend the repairs and

periodical maintenance work.      The officers have also blocked the

right round corridor road left by the plaintiff for the purpose of

attending any fire mishap.      Thus, the defendants' officers have

committed illegalities having no manner of right, title and interest

over the suit schedule property, thereby created the hurdle in

developmental work undertaken for the purpose of park / garden in

the suit schedule property. There was urgency in the matter, hence

the application is filed separately seeking dispensation of notice

under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">section 482</a>(1-A) of KMC Act, stating the cause of action arose

in the 3rd week of December 2011, as the defendants and their

officials tried to enter the suit schedule property and trying to

disturb the work undertaken by the plaintiff and hence the plaintiff

has constrained to file the suit. Accordingly, it is prayed to decree it.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.    On issuance of suit summons to the defendants after

registering the case, they appeared through their counsel and

written statement has been filed for defendants No.1 &amp; 2 through

Head of the Legal Cell, BBMP, Bangalore.        The contents of the

written statement, are hereby narrated in brief that the suit for bare

injunction is not maintainable, as it is without seeking declaratory

and mandatory injunction relief and the suit is not maintainable

either in law or on facts and it is misconceived and there is no cause

of action to file the suit and it has become in fructuous and denied

on the material allegations pleaded in the plaint.       The matters

pleaded in plaint para Nos.2 to 4 do not require specific denial as

they are matters of record and it has culminated in an order passed

in W.P.No.24185/1997 passed by the Hon'ble High Court of

Karnataka. 4 acres of land reserved for developing the park and as

per direction of Hon'ble Minister and Local Corporator, spot

inspection was made on 24.05.2011 and direction issued to the

BBMP to form a forest-cum-park. Accordingly, BBMP took up the

development work by levelling the area, sanctioning the estimate

and issuing work order on 08.11.2011 in favour of the Karnataka
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  8              O.S.No.713/2012</span>



Rural   Infrastructure   Development   Ltd.,   Mahadevanagar,    for

providing pathway to small forest and cost was estimated for Rs.55

lakhs and another work order dated 11.08.2011 for construction of

compound wall to small forest-cum-park estimating it for Rs.45 lakhs

and specifying the date of commencement by 10.11.2011 and

completion should be on 09.02.2011 / 11.02.2012. Accordingly, the

work was undertaken and completed in all respects much before

presenting the suit in January 2012. The building of plaintiff was

located abutting to the South portion of suit property Sy.No.120,

measuring 4 acres. The building of the plaintiff has two separate

access roads 25 feet each in width i.e., 7th 'A' Main &amp; 7th 'B' Main

Road, which are joining Thimmaiah Road, situated to the East of

schedule property. But the plaintiff demanding additional road from

North-Eastern side to connect the North-Eastern side of the said

property. BBMP has developed park / forest and hence the suit of

the plaintiff, is not maintainable. Apart from this, it has provided

maximum space in the layout or in the process the additional stretch

demanded by the plaintiff, is already developed by BBMP as a

portion of park-cum-forest.   The development by BBMP regarding
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   9              O.S.No.713/2012</span>



the park / forest is in the larger interest of public and provided

separate area for children to play and planted mixed variety of fruit

bearing trees and other trees, which has widely appreciated by all.

The deviation against the layout plan providing for the link road as

demanded by the plaintiff, make the area congest and reducing the

space and removal of already grown saplings from the park-cum-

forest. Hence granting of permanent injunction to result in injustice

to the public at large and affect the environmental disturbance and

create hazardous condition. The defendants have undertaken the

developmental work and completed it in the month of January 2012.

There is no cause of action to file the suit. Hence, it is prayed as

such to dismiss it with exemplary costs.

contributed by the plaintiff and the other two authorities described in

the schedule to be handed over to the Karnataka State Pollution

Control Board (plaintiff) for developing the park/garden. However,

the right and title of the said park/garden should be with the

Government of Karnataka.      Accordingly, as per Government Order

dated 14.05.2001, the plaintiff authorities contributed the land for

developing the said park by drawing a detailed plan and possession

was also given to the plaintiff. The matter was deliberated in the

office of Chief Engineer of the defendants in the presence of

Ministers of the Government of Karnataka and the concerned

members of the defendants. The Chief Engineer of the defendants

as per direction of 2nd defendant, by his letter dated 18.10.2011, with

WP. No.24185/1997 and Government order No.RD 109 LGB 92 (P)

dated 14-5-2001. The detailed plan was drawn and the possession

was given by the said two departments to the plaintiff and thus the

suit property measuring 4 acres of land was to be developed as per

direction and order of the government and that, after the

deliberations Chief Engineer of the defendants who was directed by

the defendant No.2, has informed the plaintiff by his letter dated 18-

10-2011, that the plaintiff board has to carry out the said work of

this defendant and deposed by DW1 that, as per direction of Hon'ble

Minister and Local Corporator, spot inspection was made on

24.05.2011 and direction issued to the BBMP to form a forest-cum-

park; Accordingly, BBMP took up the development work by levelling

the area, sanctioning the estimate and issuing work order on

08.11.2011, in favour of the           Karnataka Rural Infrastructure

completed in all respects much prior to filing of this suit in the month

of January 2012. D.W.1 has further stated reiterating the contents of

injunction to restrain the defendants from interfering with the

plaintiff's work undertaken in the property shown in schedule to the

plaint for the alleged purpose. The plaintiff has claimed the right to

sue accrued. But this suit is only against the statutory authority

established under Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act.(in short

taken as KMC Act) i.e. BBMP represented by its authorities -

defendants. It is also with out impleading the necessary parties, who

have alleged to be created such right to develop the park, by

granting lands infavour of plaintiff and other two government

departments, under impugned government order. Because the

plaintiff has stated that the ownership shall be with the government.

These defendants at the most, representing the government have to

act as per the direction and order of the government which are in

pursuance of the direction issued in the said W.P. Whether the work

of or alleged obstruction is justifiable or otherwise are the matters to

be decided as against the alleged right of the plaintiff to develop the

garden.

<p id="p_17">      15.   The specific grievance of the plaintiff is that, the

defendants are blocking the access to official building of the plaintiff

by admitting that defendants have undertaken the development of

the park. The plaintiff has tried to make out the cause of action that,

the things stood as stated above, the officials of defendants came to

the suit schedule land, where the plaintiff was developing the

park/garden and obstructed the work undertaken by the plaintiff, in

the 3rd week of December 2011, with high-handedness and it was

illegal. They blocked the North-Eastern main entrance/gate of the

plaintiff's building constructed by it, on the retained land, wherein the

Regional   Office   and   Central    Environmental    Laboratory   were

established, in the year 2007. The defendants started putting up the

footpath, around the schedule property obstructing the main

entrance of the plaintiff, which affects the plaintiff's access to the

building through the existing narrow entrance. The plaintiff has laid

11 K.V. cable underneath the said North-Eastern approach road

which was blocked by the defendants and its officers. It has made

difficult to attend the repairs and periodical maintenance work. The

officers have also blocked the right to use the 'round corridor road'

left by the plaintiff for the purpose of attending any fire mishap.

Thus, the defendants' officers have committed illegal acts having no

manner of right, title and interest over the suit schedule property,

thereby created the hurdle in developmental work undertaken for the

purpose of park / garden in the suit schedule property. What was

that work undertaken by the plaintiff has not been made it clear and

that the materials to prove the same are also not placed on record by

the plaintiff except the version of PW1, whose evidence without any

material documents dose not support the plaintiff's case to believe

that, the alleged work of the plaintiff was going on with due process

and it has right to resist the entry of the defendants into the suit

property. Ex. P1 to 3 and 8 are of the year 1992 and 1993 and Ex.P5

dated 14-5-2001 is immediately after the order passed in WP. No.

24185/1997 (dte. 23-2-2001). Ex. P. 6 the detailed plan was valid

from 13-5-2003 up to 12-5-2005. Ex.P. 7 is the letter of Advocate

General representing the State Government, dated 23-2-2001

directing the representatives of said three departments within two

months etc. to take steps regarding said direction. Ex. P.9 is copy of

resolution in that regard. Ex. P 10 to 12 are the recent notices and

endorsement prior to filing of the suit, and they are pertaining to

taking legal action. Thus non of these documents are showing any

work undertaken by the plaintiff under what authority when the

sanction plain was valid up to 2005 i.e. for a period of only two years.

No pleading and no proof of the same. If such process was

undertaken by the plaintiff Board it ought to have placed the relevant

and authenticated materials. But not done and only inference that

can be drawn is that the plaintiff has no such authority or such power

might be withdrawn. So suppression of the materials is fatal to the

plaintiff's case to believe the case that it has right and was proceeded

to do the alleged work on the suit property and hence the

defendants' entry thereupon was illegal. On this count it is failure of

the plaintiff to prove the alleged right and it has under taken the

work with due process. Over all reading it is main grievance of the

plaintiff is that the defendants have undertaken illegal activities on

the suit property and blocking the passage to the official building

area i.e. the entrance gate abutting to the building.

</p><p id="p_18">      16.   Per contra, it is contended by the defendants deposed

separate access roads 25 feet each in width i.e., 7th 'A' Main &amp; 7th 'B'

Main Road, which are joining Thimmaiah Road, situated to the East

of schedule property;        but the plaintiff was demanding additional

road from North-Eastern side to connect the North-Eastern side of

the said property; BBMP has developed park-cum-forest already and

hence the suit of the plaintiff, is not maintainable; and that apart

from this, it has provided maximum space in the layout or in the

process the additional stretch demanded by the plaintiff. That it is

already developed by BBMP as a portion of park-cum-forest, which is

in the larger interest of public; and that, it has provided separate

area for children to play and planted mixed variety of fruit bearing

trees and other trees, which has widely appreciated by all.                The

action     and     process   of   the        government,    which   were   for

implementation of scheme of the park/garden, are not challenged as

illegal.   But the plaintiff it is basing only on the said plan and

government orders which were prevailing only up to 2001-2002 and

the plan upto 1005. So, the defendants' case has to be evaluated

whether they are justified in resisting the suit or not.

</p><p id="p_19">         17.     It is specifically argued by the learned counsel for the

defendants referring their defence put for the through DW.1 that, the

demanded by the plaintiff, make the area congest and reducing the

space and removal of already grown saplings from the park-cum-

forest; Hence granting of permanent injunction would result in failure

of justice and it affects to the public at large. So also it affects the

environmental condition and creates disturbance and hazardous

condition. The defendants have undertaken the developmental work

and completed it in the month of January 2012. Thus, the plaintiff

has contended that the plaintiff was undertaking the development of

park/garden and in the IIIrd week of December 2011. But the

defendant came to the schedule property and obstructed it, i.e. the

defendants virtually started to put up foot path around the schedule

property, obstructed the entrance of retained property. When the

plan was for two years upto 2005, then how could be the plaintiff do

the alleged work without due sanction plan approved by the

competent authority i.e. BBMP Bangalore. So the plaintiff shall fail in

proving the alleged right to develop the park.

      wholesale diversion of the land for the purpose other than the

interest and representations made by the learned counsel for the

apart the specific extent of area for the purpose of developing it into

representatives of the three authorities namely, Pollution Control
Board, KSRTC and the revenue Department as well as the Bangalore

directed to meet within two months from the date of receipt of this
order and explore the project i.e. park development process. Thus,
there is no any specific right pressed upon infavour of the plaintiff to
develop the park. But it is also duty casted upon the defendants the
direct authorities. It is the joint venture of said five government and
statutory authorities. Therefore, it is the bounden duty of the
plaintiff, other departments and the defendants to see that the said

2 acres of land out of 4 acres given to the plaintiff-Board and each

one acre of land out of granted extent of land to KSRTC and revenue

department in view of the government order dated 14.5.2001.            But

now as on 28.11.2011 after lapse of 10 years the plaintiff came with

the grievance by submitting complaint to the Police Commissioner

(Ex.P.10) requesting to take legal action against the B.B.M.P. as it

has been encroaching upon the land measuring 2 acres, preserved

for plaintiff-Board, for formation of park. Thus, it is contended that

encroaching upon the area of 2 acres of plaintiff's property preserved

for park.    After Ex.P.10 this suit was filed. It does not sustain,

and the orders passed by the government and the proceedings

thereunder, those were taken place in the presence of then the

</p><p id="p_31">   23.       In the complaint submitted to the Commissioner of

Police prior to filing of the suit Ex.P.10 and the complaint submitted

to the PI of Basaveshwararanagar as per Ex.P.11 the only grievance

revealed that the defendants are forming the park in the preserved

areas measuring 2 acres. The plaintiff-Board is not claiming the

alleged right to develop the park in pursuance of the government

order and the directions issued in the W.P., i.e. to the extent of the

area measuring 4 acres jointly reserved lands allotted to three

departments. It is not the case of the plaintiff-Board that the work

undertaken by the defendant is in contravention of the alleged right

given to the plaintiff-Board, but under the complaint what is claimed

is only the alleged right over 2 acres of land. But in this connection,

how the plaintiff-Board has got such exclusive right to form the park

only over 2 acres of land etc, is defective and it has also not proved

which of the right accrued to it.      The government order and the

directions issued under Ex.P.4 there is no specification pertaining to

the alleged road to be left for the use of concerned persons of

plaintiff-Board, as PW.1 has contended that because of installing of

gate and formation of the park by the B.B.M.P., it has created hurdle

to have access to the building constructed in the area preserved for

said purpose. No documents are produced by the plaintiff that it has

right to develop the park and it was still existing to enforce it, even

after laps of date of sanction plan.
</p>
<p id="p_32">   24.       Therefore,   from   these   documents and       the   plaint

averments, it is clear that no such right has been given to the plaintiff

either by the government or under the direction as per Ex.P.4. It

seems that the plaintiff has failed to implement the scheme/work

entrusted to it as per undertaking to do the said work by the

authorized person of plaintiff Board and such work to it to be

commenced and complete it as per the proceedings and orders of the

government. Therefore the State government has taken steps and

entrusted the work to the defendants-B.B.M.P. which is the ultimate

and authorized wing of the government, through which the forest

cum park has been formed with due process of law. The plaintiff has

not at all challenged the action taken and the order passed by the

State government before the appropriate forum with due process of

law. Without doing so, the plaintiff straight away approached the

Civil Court only against the authority who has entrusted with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                   31              O.S.No.713/2012</span>



work to implement the scheme, i.e. B.B.M.P. without impleading the

necessary parties, who are alleged to be affected     the alleged right

of the plaintiff. Apart from this, any of the documents referred to by

the plaintiff does not confer any exclusive right to develop the park.

</p><p id="p_33">   25.       With reference to the compliance under Sec. 482 of KMC

Act learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that, there was urgency in

the matter, hence the application is filed separately seeking

dispensation of notice under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">section 482</a>(1-A) of KMC Act, stating the

cause of action arose in the 3rd week of December 2011, as the

defendants and their officials tried to enter the suit schedule property

and trying to disturb the work undertaken by the plaintiff. But in view

of non production of materials it is held that plaintiff has not proved

the alleged right to undertake the development of Park. It has not

challenged   the   subsequent    orders   and    proceedings    of   the

government entrusting the work to BBMP Bangalore, this suit for

mere injunction against the defendants do not indicate that there

was emergency to get any interim order by dispensing the statutory

notice. So the suit filed with out such notice, is held to be

noncompliance of the statutory notice and suit is not maintainable.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                    32              O.S.No.713/2012</span>



</p><p id="p_34">   26.        No doubt the order under Ex.P.4 is prevailing, but it has

made it clear how the plaintiff does not get and alleged right against

the defendants. It is only direction to implement the scheme to

protect the environment and to protect the interest of the public at

large to have a healthy environment in the locality by having such

Park-cum-forest to be developed on the government land preserved

for it. It is within the jurisdiction and purview of the powers of the

government. So the plaintiff cannot claim the direction issued to the

competent authority of the government to proceed with the same,

as of right. It is not enforceable right against the defendants before

this civil court.   Thus, the plaintiff has utterly failed to prove the

lawful possession over the suit schedule property, since it has

claimed the alleged right over the property preserved for developing

it as a park. Hence, when the plaintiff has not proved the lawful

possession, and alleged right to develop the park/garden, then

question of interference of defendants does not arise. However it

has not proved the obstruction with cogent evidence.           So, the

plaintiff is not entitled for any relief as prayed for. Therefore, Issue

Nos.1 to 3 are answer in negative.
