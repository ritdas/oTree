<p id="p_1">       The prayers in the above Writ Petition (Civil) are as follows:

              interfere with the functioning of the unit of the Petitioner, in the
              interest of justice
       iv.    to grant such other reliefs as are just and proper in the nature of
              this case."</blockquote><p id="p_2">



</p><p id="p_3">       2.     Heard Sri.Georgekutty Mathew, learned counsel

appearing for the petitioner and Sri.T.Naveen, learned Standing

Counsel for the Kerala State Pollution Control Board appearing

for R-1. In the nature of the order proposed to be passed in this

petition, notice to R-2 (Vazhayoor Grama Panchayat) will stand

dispensed with.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       3.     The case of the petitioner is that, he is running a wood

works unit within the limits of the 2nd respondent Panchayat on
 W.P.(C) No. 15188 of 2020

the basis of Ext.P-1 registration issued by the Industries

Department, Ext.P-2 Trade License issued by the 2 nd respondent

Grama Panchayat and Ext.P-4 statutory consent issued by the

1st respondent Environmental Engineer, State Pollution Control

Board. That, Ext.P-2 Trade License was valid till last year

and thereafter, despite application submitted for renewal of

trade license as acknowledged in Ext.P-3 receipt dated 3.2.2020,

the 2nd respondent Secretary of Grama Panchayat has not taken

any decision to refuse said license or to grant it, in the result that

the petitioner has already secured the benefit of deemed license

going by the mandatory provisions contained in Section 236(3) of

the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994. Further that, the validity

period of Ext.P-4 statutory consent has also expired, and therefore

the petitioner has submitted application for renewal of Ext.P-4

consent before the 1st respondent Environmental Engineer, State

Pollution Control Board, and the said application has been

acknowledged as per Ext.P-5 receipt dated 28.5.2020. While so, on

the basis that a third party has given certain complaints against the

functioning of the petitioner's unit, and since inspection cannot be

immediately conducted presumably on account of COVID-19

pandemic issues, the 1st respondent Environmental Engineer, State

Pollution Control Board has issued Ext.P-6 letter dated 21.7.2020

instructing the 2nd respondent Secretary of Grama Panchayat to not

to permit the petitioner to conduct the unit till the finalization

of said proceedings.        That, on the basis of Ext.P-6 letter the

2nd respondent has issued Ext.P-7 stop memo dated 22.7.2020

directing the petitioner to stop the unit in view of the abovesaid

aspects. The petitioner would urge that both the decision as per

Exts.P-6 &amp; P-7 have been rendered by R-1 &amp; R-2 respectively

without affording any opportunity of being heard to the petitioner,

and when the petitioner's applications for renewal are pending

before both the respondents as can be seen Exts.P-3 &amp; P-5 receipts.

</p><p id="p_7">      4.     After hearing both sides this Court is of the considered

view that the impugned proceedings are liable for interdiction

solely on the ground of blatant violation of elementary principles of

natural justice and fairness, inasmuch as the petitioner has not

been afforded any reasonable opportunity of being heard before

the order in the nature of Ext.P-6 was passed by the 1 st respondent

inspite of the mandatorty provisions contained in Section 21(4) of
 W.P.(C) No. 15188 of 2020

envisages prior opportunity of being heard in such cases. So also,

Ext.P-7 stop memo has been consequently issued solely on the

basis of Ext.P-6 directives and that too, without hearing the

petitioner. Accordingly, the following directions and orders are

passed:
</p>
<p id="p_9">   1. The impugned Exts.P-6 &amp; P-7 will stand quashed and
      interdicted, and the petitioner may temporarily continue the

      Control Board, will take up the matters in relation to the
      application dated 28.5.2020 submitted by the petitioner for
      renewal of Ext.P-4 consent (which has been acknowledged in
      Ext.P-5 receipt) as also the matters relating to the complaints
      against the petitioner's unit referred to in Ext.P-6, and may
      ensure that an inspection is conducted with prior notice to
      the petitioner and the objector, and thereafter copies of
      inspection report should also be given to the petitioner and
      the objector. Thereafter, the 1st respondent Environmental
      Engineer, State Pollution Control Board, will afford
      reasonable opportunity of being heard to both the petitioner

      objections raised by the objector etc, without much delay
      preferably within a period of 5 weeks from the date of receipt

      so issued by the 1st respondent shall be given to both the
      petitioner, the objector as well as the 2 nd respondent

</p><p id="p_13">   3. Thereafter, the 2nd respondent Secretary of Grama Panchayat
      should afford reasonable opportunity of being heard to the

      Ext.P-2 license (as acknowledged in Ext.P-3 receipt) without
