, the trees and plants are drying up and the agricultural land

has become barren. It is also alleged that due to that reason the

fishery industry has also been closed and even the normal life

of the human beings and animals is also being affected due to

Cholera and other serious diseases dangerous to life.

</p><p id="p_9">        After filing of the aforesaid complaint petition, the

water of public spring or reservoir and making the atmosphere

noxious to health by the court of Judicial Magistrate, First

of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_19">Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_20">Section 15</a> of the Environment         (Protection) Act,

1986, provides the penalty for the offence for contravention of

the provisions of the Act and the Rules made or orders or

directions given thereunder and <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_21">Section 19</a> of the said Act bars

or officer as authorized.
</p>
<p id="p_16">         7.   Since there are special enactments viz., <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_26">The

Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, for protection of

environment, and The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_27">Control of

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, by the Law (Justice)
