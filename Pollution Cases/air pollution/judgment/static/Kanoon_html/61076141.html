                       M. CR. C. No. 8801 / 2015
03/05/2016
      Mr. S. K. Vyas, learned senior counsel appearing with Mr. Rishi
Tiwari, Advocate, learned counsel for the petitioner.
      Mrs. Preeti Waghmare, learned counsel for the respondent -</pre>
<p id="p_1">Board.
</p><p id="p_2">      Learned senior counsel for the applicant has straightway drawn
attention of this Court towards the judgment delivered by this Court in
the case of Arun Mathur and another Vs. M.P. Pollution Control Board
(Cr. Rev. No. 472 / 2004, decided on 14/8/2007) and his contention is
that in similar circumstances as there was no sanction u/S. 197 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the proceedings were quashed by
this Court. In the aforesaid case, the prosecution was under the
provision of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Pollution Control Act</a>, 1986. Reliance has also been placed
upon the judgment delivered by the Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court in
the case of Punjab State Board for Prevention and Control of Water
Pollution Vs. Raghunath (Cr. Rev. No. 181 / 1990, decided on
10/8/2000). In the aforesaid case also the accused persons were
discharged for want of sanction u/S. 197 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973. Reliance has also been placed upon the judgment
delivered by this Court in the case of Rambabu Jakhenia Vs.
Purshottam reported in 2007 (2) MPLJ 261; Kailash Chandra Vs. M.
P. Pollution Control Board reported in 2010 (2) MPJR 226; and lastly,
upon the judgment delivered by the apex Court in the case of
Omprakash Vs. State of Jharkhand (Cr. A. No. 1491 / 2012, decided
on 26/9/2012) wherein the apex Court has held that ground of sanction
can be taken at the initial stage also.
</p><p id="p_3">      On the other hand, Mrs. Preeti Waghmare, learned counsel for

</p><p id="p_5">     the respondent - Board has placed reliance upon the judgment
     delivered by this Court in the case of Manish Singh and another Vs. M.
     P. Pollution Control Board (M.CR.C.No. 271/2006, decided on
     22/9/2008) and her contention is that this Court has dismissed the
     petition preferred by Mr. Manish Singh who was Commissioner,
     Municipal Corporation, Bhopal in identical circumstances.
</p><p id="p_6">              This Court has carefully gone through the judgment delivered in
     the case of Manish Singh (supra). The aforesaid judgment nowhere
     deals with the point of sanction and, therefore, the judgment relied
     upon by the learned counsel for the respondent is distinguishable on
     facts.
</p><p id="p_7">              Keeping in view the aforesaid, this Court is of the considered
     opinion that learned senior counsel for the applicant has been able to
     make out a prima faice case for grant of interim relief.
</p><p id="p_8">              Resultantly, all further proceedings in respect of Complaint No.
     13672/2015 pending before the Court of CJM, Indore shall remain
     stayed till the next date of hearing.
</p><p id="p_9">              The present petition is admitted for final hearing.
              List for hearing in due course.
</p><p id="p_10">              Certified copy, as per Rules.
