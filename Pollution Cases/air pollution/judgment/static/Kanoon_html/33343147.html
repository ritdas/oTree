RSA-4143-2019

</p><p id="p_8">1.          This is a regular second appeal that has been filed by the

appellant-plaintiff (henceforth called 'the appellant') seeking to challenge

the judgment and decree dated 27.03.2019 passed by the first Appellate

Court whereby, the appeal filed by the appellant against the judgment and

decree dated 22.11.2018 passed by the lower court dismissing his suit, has

been dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">2.          Briefly, the facts of the case are the appellant herein filed a civil

suit for the relief of declaration to the effect that Letter No.2758 dated

11.06.2015 issued by the respondents-defendants (henceforth called 'the

respondents') to the appellant under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">Section 31-A</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp;

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 is wrong, illegal, null and void and is liable

to be withdrawn, vide which the appellant was directed to shift his

workshop from the present location to some other suitable site and to close

its operation within three months and further to the effect that respondents

have no right to stop the working of the appellant over the suit property

marked as ABCD situated in village Tajpur, Tehsil and District, Rupnagar

in any manner. The appellant also sought consequential relief of permanent

injunction restraining the respondents and their authorized officials to make

any type of interference into the working of the appellant in his workshop

and further restraining the respondents from implementing the letter

No.2758 dated 11.06.2015 in any manner.            It was submitted that the

appellant was running a workshop for last many years in the suit property,

which was earlier run by his father, for preparing small agricultural

implements without interruption of any person, inside the building. It was

alleged that the respondents are trying to stop the functioning of the

appellant vide letter no.2758 dated 11.06.2015 issued to the appellant. It

was claimed that the said letter is wrong and illegal and there is no violation

on the part of the appellant of any provision of the Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_10">3.          Upon notice, the respondents appeared and filed their written

statement, by raising preliminary objections. It was submitted that the

appellant is operating the workshop without obtaining NOC, which is

mandatory under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. It

was alleged that the activity carried out by the appellant is a source of noise

and air pollution for nearby residents. The workshop of the appellant was

visited by the officer of the Board on 27.08.2014 to verify the complaint

which was received from the residents of the village.          It was further

submitted that the workshop of the appellant was again visited and

thereafter, visit report was prepared, but the owner of the workshop refused

to sign the report. Consequently, notice under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_5">Section 31-A</a> of the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 was issued to the appellant

along with an opportunity of personal hearing on 30.12.2014, which was

postponed to 02.01.2015.       The proceedings of personal hearing were

conveyed to the appellant. Thereafter, the appellant appeared before the

Board and on hearing his pleas, order was passed and directions were issued

to him to shift his workshop, but the appellant did not take any step to shift

the workshop.     It was submitted that the directions issued vide letter

no.2758 dated 11.06.2015 are legal and maintainable.

framed and evidence was led by both the parties. On appreciating the

evidence, the lower court dismissed the suit of the appellant. Even the

appeal filed by the appellant before the first Appellate Court stood

dismissed. Now both the judgments and decrees of the courts below have

been assailed by the appellant in this regular second appeal.

</p><p id="p_12">5.               Learned counsel for the appellant argues that the courts below

have erred in not taking into consideration that even if there was a bar under

<a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_7">Section 46</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, still

the civil court can also have jurisdiction to decide as to whether the proper

procedure was followed while passing an order under any statute by the

authority concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_13">6.               I have heard counsel for the appellant and have gone through

the case file.
</p>
<p id="p_14">7.               The lower court dismissed the suit of the appellant while

observing that there is nothing brought on record by the appellant as to what

procedural lapse has occurred, which has caused any failure of justice. It

was further observed that the procedure for challenging the orders passed

under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 has been

provided under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_10">Section 31</a> of the said Act and the jurisdiction of the civil

court is barred under this Special Law as per <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_11">Section 46</a> of the Act. The

findings recorded by the lower court were affirmed in appeal by the first

Appellate Court.
</p>
<p id="p_15">8.               In the instant case, the appellant is challenging the letter

No.2758 dated 11.06.2015 issued by the respondents under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_12">Section 31-A</a> of

Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a> whereby, the appellant had

been directed to shift his workshop from the present location to some other

suitable site and to close its operation within three months from the date of

said notice.      During his cross-examination, the appellant had made the

following admissions:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 (i)     that there is furnace in this work place and there is
                 residential area surrounding the same and his own house is
                 also there.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                 (ii)    that there is one chimney in the workshop, which is 3
                 feet high and when they work, noise is generated.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                 (iii)   that in their workshop one electric motor for using
                 hammer is installed and with their work, smoke and noise
                 pollution occurs and loud noise is produced.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                 (iv)    that the officials of the Board inspected the spot on
                 27.08.2014 and checked his workshop with their equipments
                 to measure noise and air pollution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                 (v)     that the officials of the Board again visited his
                 workshop for checking purposes and checked the noise and
                 air pollution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                 (vi)    that the officials of the Board asked him to sign the
                 report, but he refused to sign the same.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">               The above admissions made by the appellant, during his cross-
</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">examination, clearly substantiated the fact that his workshop is situated in

the residential area of the village and it caused air and noise pollution. It

further established on record that after checking the workshop of the

appellant by the officials of the respondents, the letter in question was

issued directing the appellant to shift his workshop from the present

location. <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_14">Section 31</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1981 provides the procedure for challenging the orders passed under the

said Act, which has not been followed in the instant case. Further, <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_16">Section



                                  5</a> of 6
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">               ::: Downloaded on - 07-10-2019 05:09:45 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> RSA-4143-2019                                                                 -6-</span>



46 of the Act clearly bars the jurisdiction of the civil suit in entertaining any

suit or proceedings in respect of any matter, which an Appellate Authority

constituted under this Act is empowered. So far as the contention raised by

counsel for the appellant that even where the jurisdiction of the civil court is

barred by any special statute, then also the civil court has jurisdiction to

check the proceedings under the special statute on the ground of procedural

lapse and principles of natural justice, the same is not tenable, because there

is nothing established on record, which supports this contention of counsel

for the appellant. During the course of arguments, counsel for the appellant

failed to point out anything wrong in the findings returned by the courts

below.
</p>
<p id="p_17">9.            In view of the above, this court finds no illegality or perversity

in the concurrent findings so recorded by both the courts below. As such, no

question of law requiring determination arises in this regular second appeal

filed by the appellant-plaintiff, which has no merit.
