                          This Writ Petition is filed as a Public Interest Litigation by

                 the petitioner who is an Advocate by profession for issuing a Writ of

                 Mandamus directing the respondents 2, 4, 8, 12 and 13 to abandon

                 the construction of the Coal Jetty at 2 x 660 MW Udangudi Super

                 Critical Thermal Power Project in Udangudi Village, Thiruchendur

                 Taluk, Thoothukudi District.

</p><p id="p_3">                          2.The petitioner states that the 13th respondent is a joint

                 venture company of respondents 8 &amp; 9, namely, TANGEDCO and

                 Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited. After signing a memorandum of

                 understanding, the respondents 8 and 9 stated to have planned for

                 establishment of 2 X 800 MW Super Critical Technology Power

                 Plant in 2007 at the estimated cost of Rs.9,083 Crores. It is stated

                 by the petitioner that the petitioner approached the first respondent

                 namely the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change

                 and obtained information that the joint venture company has

                 obtained an environmental clearance by projecting its requirement

                 with 30% domestic coal and 70% imported coal (from Indonesia).

                 The petitioner further states that when public hearing was

                 conducted way back in 07.02.2009 M/s.TANGEDCO announced a

                 public hearing that an annual requirement of coal for the 13 th

                 respondent is 6.74 million tonne and that about 30% of coal will be

                 imported and 70% of coal would be procured from Indian Coal

                 Fields. It is admitted even by the petitioner that the 8 th respondent

                 has announced that the required coal for the project would be

                 brought by forming a coal jetty on deep sea and conveyed through

                 pipe conveyor and that it is going to be made in such a way that the

                 construction of coal jetty will not affect fishing activities.

</p><p id="p_4">                           3.The grievance of the petitioner for filing this present Writ

                 Petition is that the fishermen community in Tiruchendur Taluk fears

                 that their moving boats may hit in the piles and foundation of the

                 coal jetty in case of unexpected heavy winds.             The further

                 apprehension is that the construction of coal jetty in the proposed

                 area will damage marine ecology. The petitioner further states that

                 the fishermen from nearby hamlets will be affected by the concrete

                 structures and the pollution that may be caused while handling coal

                 at the coal jetty.   It is also stated that fishermen of the locality

                 conducted lots of demonstrations against the construction of coal

                 jetty and several cases have been registered against the protesters

                 who have raised their voices against the upcoming coal jetty for the

                 proposed plant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                           4.The petitioner has listed many ecological, environmental

                 and socio-economic problems by allowing the coal jetty to be

                 constructed for the 13th respondent. The petitioner has produced

                 several materials about 4 x 660 MW Udangudi Super Critical

                 Thermal Power Plant and the proceedings of first respondent

                 regarding environmental clearance obtained for the project and the

                 consent order by the pollution control board that was issued to the

                 Udangudi Power Corporation Limited both under Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water

                 Act</a>s.    From the materials produced by the petitioner before this
http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                   6</span>

                 Court, this Court is unable to find any adverse impacts affecting the

                 livelihood of the fishermen community or the public on account of

                 the construction of coal jetty very near to the project site.    The

                 petitioner himself has admitted the fact that clearance have been

                 obtained from the first respondent showing the construction of coal

                 jetty in future.   The Government has spent enormous amount

                 towards implementation of the project purely in public interest.

                 The coal is the major component and it is the only raw material for

                 production of electric energy from thermal power stations.       The

                 constructions of coal jetty very near the plant is an important

                 aspect.   The alternative suggested by the petitioner that the coal

                 can be transported from port through road does not appear to be

                 wise and the petitioner who is not an expert is not competent to

                 advise the Government on policy matters.          The power plant

                 established by the 13th respondent is very important for the State

                 and the viability of the project is also important. The petitioner is

                 only a practising advocate and not an expert to come with

                 suggestions merely for the convenience of fishermen community or

                 other sections of public. In the entire affidavit, the petitioner has

                 not whispered any statutory violations or regulations.    No public

                 interest litigation can be entertained by mere asking.     It is well

                 settled that the petitioner in a pro bono publico is expected to do

                 some search before coming to Court. Except the lengthy affidavit

                 filed by the petitioner containing informations that can be gathered

                 through internet and other source, no possible injury particularly

                 legal injury to any section of public is established by materials

                 worth relying.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">                          5.The petitioner has come forward with this litigation in a

                 casual and cavalier fashion without having any expert knowledge.

                 Unless the petitioner inspires the confidence of this Court and there

                 are sufficient materials to show the bona fides of the petitioner, this

                 Court cannot entertain every public interest litigation contrary to

                 the principles and guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

                 The petitioner has earlier filed a Writ Petition in W.P.(MD)No.24738

                 of 2018 for issuing a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus calling for

                 the records of the 1st Respondent in respect of the Environmental

                 and Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance for establishing

                 Captive Coal Jetty in No.F.No.11-48/2009-IA.III dated 06.06.2011

                 the construction of coal jetty. Though the petitioner has produced

                 the earlier orders of this Court, the petitioner has not explained

                 why this Writ Petition was filed for similar relief after getting liberty

                 from this Court to approach the National Green Tribunal.            This

                 Court having regard to the facts narrated in the affidavit and the

                 materials produced before this Court is of the view that the Writ

                 motivated for extraneous reasons. Hence, the same is liable to be

                 dismissed and accordingly dismissed. No costs. Consequently, the

                 connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
