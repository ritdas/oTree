CAV JUDGEMNT
 

 


 


	This appeal is preferred by the
original plaintiffs under section 100 of Code of Civil Procedure,
1908.  It seeks to challenge judgment and order dated 19th
June, 2013 of learned IInd Additional District Judge, Bharuch, passed
in Regular Civil Appeal No. 45 of 2013.  The first appellate court
confirmed the judgment and order of the trial court dated 15th
April, 2012 passed below Exh. 17 application allowing the said
application, and thereby rejecting the plaint under Order XI, Rule
7(d) of the Code.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_10">2.1	The controversy relates to the
question whether bar of jurisdiction of the civil court envisaged
under <a href="/doc/115054998/" id="a_1">section 29</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, was
attracted in respect of the suit of the plaintiffs, and whether
therefore, the exercise of powers by the courts under Order VII, Rule
7(d) of the Code was justified in law..  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_11">2.	In the memorandum of appeal, the
appellants pleaded the following questions, proposing them to be the
substantial questions of law arising in the appeal. 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_12"> (A)	Whether
the suit of the appellants is barred by National Green Tribunal NGT
Act 2010.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_13">	(B)	Whether
the averment in suit that  discharge of chemical mixed 	water
through canal that may cause damage to human  is 	sufficient 	to
exclude the jurisdiction of the Civil Court though in suit no 	order
under any of Act shown in schedule I of BGT Act 2010 is 	challenged.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_14">	(C)	Whether
<a href="/doc/184387008/" id="a_2">section 2(1)</a> m and 14 of NGT Act 2010 have any 	application 	to the
Civil Suit of Appellants.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_15">	(D)	The
preventing the company from laying pipeline to drain 	discharged
	water could be said to be substantial question of environment.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_16">	(E)	Whether
the suit against public nuisance can be said to be 	barred 	under NGT
Act, 2010.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_17">	(F)	Whether
the trial court can see the pleading other than the suit and
	document of defendants while deciding the application under order 7
	rule 11.
</p> 


<p id="p_18">	(G)	Whether
the trial court can go beyond the pleading while deciding the
	application which is not labeled as to under which provision of law
it is 	preferred.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_19">	(H)	Whether
the impugned order of trail court as well as judgment and 	decree of
Appellant and decree of Appellate court is legal. 
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_20">3.	The facts and the subject-matter of
the suit instituted by the plaintiffs may be appropriately stated at
the outset. The original plaintiffs instituted Regular Civil Suit No.
138 of 2012 before the court of Principal Civil Judge, Jambusar.  The
suit was for the relief of declaration and permanent injunction. The
two defendants impleaded in the suit were the companies carrying on 
industrial activities and operations. It was the case of the
plaintiffs that they were the owners of the agricultural lands. It
was stated that after their agricultural fields, a water way was
passing for exit of rainy water and thereafter a canal for effluent
discharge was constructed.  Thereafter, there was a road adjoining. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_21">3.1	It was stated that the said area
was declared as Special Economic Zone.  It was the case that the
defendant companies were engaged in manufacturing of pesticides by
use of chemicals.  The factories were situated in the said Special
Economic Zone (SEZ) known as Sterling Economic Zone. It was
plaintiffs  case that the defendants were required to obtain
necessary permission from Gujarat Pollution Control Board before
establishing their factories, that they were required to create
necessary intra-structural facilities to counter the menace of air
and water pollution.  It was alleged that the defendant had not taken
any such permission from the Board. It was stated that even if any
such permission was given, the same was without compliance of law,
because no public hearing was conducted.  Therefore, it was not
binding to the plaintiffs.  It was
further stated that the land of the plaintiff, other lands situated
in the vicinity and the lands of agriculturists in the nearby
villages were acquired by the State Government for the purpose of
Effluent Channel Project Ltd. (ECPL).  It was stated further
that in the land other than the acquired lands belonging to the
plaintiffs and the adjoining fields, a pakka drainage was
constructed.  In the acquired land, ECPL had constructed canal for
the discharge of effluent.  It was stated that the said effluent
discharge cannal was constructed before 32 years and it was broken at
several places rendering it unfit for flowing the effluent discharge
of the industries. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_22">3.2	It was further stated that due to
the fact that the effluent discharge channel was broken and open at
several places, the rainy water was getting mixed with the industrial
effluent and the waste water flown therein, and ultimately to the
agricultural fields where the crops were grown.  It was the case that
there was a likelihood of getting the crop burnt and a damaged and
endangering the lives of the human beings in the ultimate analysis.
It was the further case that though the defendants were not
authorised to discharge chemical filled dirty water in their own way,
yet they were acting in collusion and had constructed canal upto the
place called Uber.  It was also alleged that the Chimney was placed
by defendant No.2 company without adhering to the norms imposed by
the Board. The plaintiffs alleged  that the act of placing illegal
pipelines on part of the defendant was injurious to the health of the
villagers and inhabitants residing there.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_23">3.3	On the basis of above pleadings,
relief in the suit were prayed for.  The plaintiffs prayed for relief
declaration and permanent injunction to remove the canal put up on
the North side of the existing canal till the pipeline on the North
of the Uber canal.  It was further prayed for by the plaintiffs that
the pipeline constructed by the defendant upto the canal at Uber, on
the North, was not legal and the plaintiffs were entitled to get the
same removed.  It was prayed to declare that the conduct of the
defendants in placing the pipe lines was illegal.  It was prayed that
the act on part of the defendants was against GPCB norms and
resulting into damage to the living creatures, livestock and the
human health. A direction was prayed for removal of the pipeline
placed on the North of the canal at Uber on the ground of possible
damage to the environment, crops and living creatures.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_24">3.4	In the above suit, defendant No.1
moved an application below Exh. 17 and contended that no cause of
action was disclosed in the plaint for the plaintiffs to institute
the suit and to claim any relief. The trail court while dealing with
the said application took view that the plaint was liable to be
rejected on the ground of jurisdiction.  The trial court exercising
powers under Order VII Rule 11(d)
of the Code, held by
order dated 15.04.2013 that in view of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_3">National
Green Tribunal Act</a>,2010  (hereinafter referred to as  the NGT Act 
for sake of brevity), the bar contained therein to the jurisdiction
of civil court would get attracted and the plaint was liable to be
rejected for want of jurisdiction. Against the said order, the
original plaintiffs preferred Regular Civil Appeal before the
District Court which was also dismissed. Both the courts below took
view that the civil court had no jurisdiction to try the suit and the
suit was not maintainable in view of the provisions of the NGT Act.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_25">4.	Learned advocate Mr. M. M. Saiyed
submitted that the bar of jurisdiction of the civil court would apply
only in respect of the disputes which are required to be settled
under the NGT Act by the Tribunal.  He submitted that though section
29 of the NGT Act enacts bar to the civil courts jurisdiction, the
said bar would be applicable in the context of Sec. 14 of the Act,
and in respect of the disputes of the kind and nature contemplated
therein. He submitted that under section 14 of the NGT Act, the
Tribunal has the jurisdiction over the cases where a  substantial
question relating to environment  is involved.  According to him
case of the plaintiffs in the suit was not one wherein any
substantial question relating to environment was involved. He then
submitted that phrase  substantial question relating to
environment  was defined in <a href="/doc/159334064/" id="a_4">section 2(m)</a>.   It was the submission
of learned advocate that in order to make a substantial question
relating to the environment, the issues relating direct violation of
the statutes mentioned in the Schedule to the NGT Act must be
arising. He wanted to emphasise that the subject matter of the suit
and the prayer did not involve the question contemplated under
<a href="/doc/159334064/" id="a_5">section 2(m)</a>.
</p> 


 


 
	 
		  


<p id="p_26">		On the other hand, learned advocate
		Mr. H. M. Parikh for the respondent Nos. 1 &amp; 2 submitted by
		taking the court through the averments in the plaint and the suit
		prayers, that the subject matter directly involved the rights and
		obligations relating to  environmental issues, which were the
		disputes to be settled by the Tribunal for which, the civil court s
		jurisdiction was ousted under section 29 of the NGT Act.   Learned
		advocate for the respondent relied on decision in <a href="/doc/1436850/" id="a_6">Bhopal Gas
		Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors</a>.
		[AIR 2012 SC 308] .  He also relied on Bombay High Court
		decision in Gadbad s/o Bhavdu Sonne vs. Ramrao s/o Bhavdu Sonne
		being Reference Case No. 1/11 decided on 17.01.2013.
</p>	

 


 


 


<p id="p_27">4.2	In Gadbad (Supra), the
question before the Bombay High Court whether the civil court can
regularise encroachment over the forest land by declaration of the
ownership in contravention and avoiding bar created by <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_7">Section 2</a> of
Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and whether the civil suit was
maintainable to protect encroachment over the forest land in
contravention of the provisions of the said act.  It was in that
light the Bombay High Court considered the applicability of section
14 of the NGT Act.  It observed that with coming into force of
<a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_8">section 14</a> in the NGT Act, the civil court s jurisdiction over the
civil cases/suites involving substantial question relating to
environmental (including enforcement of any legal right to
environmental) and arising out of implementation of enactments
specified in schedule I to the NGT Act is taken over by the Tribunal
by virtue of <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_9">section 14</a> of the said Act. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_28">5.	This court carefully examined the
contentions canvassed by learned counsels for the parties in the
context of the controversy coming out from the suit of the
plaintiffs. The NGT Act was enacted by the Parliament to provide for
an establishment of the National Green Tribunal for effective and
expeditious disposal of civil cases relating to environment
protection including enforcement of any legal right relating to
environment. The statement of objects and reasons while enacting the
law provided that the law was framed to cope up with increased
pressure on the natural resources and environment and the hike in the
related litigation.  The NGT Act was designed to provide quick
redress and remedy relating to the rights of environment which are
encompassed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_10">Article 21</a> and to provide restorative relief to the
victims. <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_11">The Act</a> came into force with effect from 18th
October, 2010.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_29">5.1	The relevant statutory provisions
in the NGT Act may be usefully visited with.  Environment  is
defined in <a href="/doc/187339837/" id="a_12">section 2(c)</a> to include to be mentioned <a href="/doc/50331181/" id="a_13">Section 3</a> of the
Act provides for establishment of the National Green Tribunal,
whereas <a href="/doc/72091533/" id="a_14">section 4</a> deals with composition of the Tribunal. Chapter III
provides for jurisdiction, powers and proceedings of the Tribunal. 
<a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_15">Section 14</a> is about the dispute to be settled by the Tribunal,  and
<a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_16">section 15</a> speaks of relief, compensation and restitution. The
Tribunal has appellate jurisdiction  as provided under <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_17">section 16</a>.
<a href="/doc/115054998/" id="a_18">Section 29</a> occurring in Chapter-V provides bar of jurisdiction of
civil court.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_30">5.2	<a href="/doc/115054998/" id="a_19">Section 29</a> reads as under :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_31"> 29.	Bar
of jurisdiction.- 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_32">(1)	With
effect from the date of establishment of the Tribunal under this

<p id="p_33">(2)	No

any 	question relating to any claim for granting any relief or

<p id="p_34">5.3	As per sub section (2) of <a href="/doc/115054998/" id="a_20">section
29</a> above  civil court is divested of jurisdiction in respect of the
disputes and to entertain any question which may be adjudicated upon
by the National Green Tribunal. <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_21">Section 14</a> of the Act which provides
for dispute to be settled by the Tribunal is thus, 

 


 


 


</p><p id="p_35"> 14.	Tribunal
to settle disputes.-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_36"> (1)	The
Tribunal shall have the jurisdiction over all civil cases where 	a
	substantial question relating to environment (including 	enforcement
of any legal right relating to environment), is 	involved 	and such
question arises out of the implementation of the 	enactments
specified in Schedule I.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_37">(2)	The
Tribunal shall hear the disputes arising from the questions 	referred
to in sub-section (1) and settle such disputes and pass 	order
thereon. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_38">(3)	No
application for adjudication of dispute under this section shall 	be
	entertained by the Tribunal unless it is made within a period of six

<p id="p_39">	Provided
that Tribunal may, if it is satisfied that the applicant was
prevented by sufficient cause from filing the application within the
said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not
exceeding sixty days.
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_40">5.4	Thus the Tribunal s jurisdiction
extends to cases where substantial questions relating to environment
including enforcement of any legal right relating to environment
arise. Again the expression  substantial question relating to
environment  is defined in the definition section.  <a href="/doc/159334064/" id="a_22">Section 2(m)</a>
defining the term reads thus.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_41"> 2(m)	 substantial

<p id="p_54">(4)	The
Tribunal may, having regard to the damage to public health, 	property
and environment, divide the compensation or relief payable 	under
separate heads specified in Schedule II so as to provide

</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_69">5.7	The
plain reading of section14 above shows that the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal is extended to settle the disputes in all civil cases where
substantial question relating to environment arises and the
jurisdiction shall be exercised by it on such questions including in
respect of enforcement of any legal right relating to the
environment.  The bracketed group of words  including enforcement
of any legal right relating to environment  makes the area disputes
to be settled by the Tribunal more inclusive and encompassing. The
scope and ambit of jurisdiction of the Tribunal is widened. 
Enforcement of legal right relating to
environment will have an intake of various kinds of disputes.
Further, it would be seen on a closer reading of the definition in
<a href="/doc/159334064/" id="a_32">section 2(m)</a> that it has two clauses.  The categories in sub clauses
(A), (B), (C) of clause (i) are in respect of direct violation of
specific statutory environmental obligation by a person. Clause (ii)
is also an instance of substantial question relating to environment.
Under clause (ii),  the environmental consequence which relates to
specific activity or a point source of pollution will also fall
within compass of the term of  substantial question relating to
environment  . 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_70">6.	The
subject matter and the controversy raised in the suit may be
recapitulated even at the cost of some repetition. It was a suit
instituted against two industrial companies engaged in the
manufacturing of pesticides. As already noted, the prayer was for
declaration that the pipe line laid by the defendant companies at a
particular place would endanger the living creatures and human health
in light of the norms set up by the Pollution Control Board.  In
other words, the norms set up by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board
under the Pollution laws and the regulations were directly in the
lime light.  In considering the prayer of the plaintiffs, those laws
would have to be necessarily gone into. It would have been required
to be adjudicated whether the statutes and the statutory regulations
relating to pollution and the environmental maintenance were
violated.  The averments in the plaint, more particularly in para-5
and 6 read with the averments in para-9 brought out in no uncertain
terms that in the questions raised by the plaintiff, questions
relating to the enforcement of legal rights relating to the
environment were ingrained. In the process of adjudication of the
suit arising, the statutes amongst the legislation mentioned in the
Schedule would have their play. The entire premise of the grievance
was that the defendant companies had not obtained permission from the
Gujarat Pollution Control Board.  It was the case that the canal
constructed for discharge of effluent was unfit for carrying the
effluent discharge and because of its breakage, the crops in the
fields was open to serious
damage.  It was alleged that it would also have harmful effect on the
public life and public health. The grievance was also raised with
regard to placing of chimney by stating that it was against the norms
prescribed to be observed at
the time of establishing the industries. In other words, the
essential substance of the suit subject matter, the grievance raised
and the prayers made unfailingly attracted the statutory provisions
of the Acts mentioned in the Schedule to the Act.  The subject matter
raised substantial questions relating to environment as defined under
<a href="/doc/159334064/" id="a_33">section 2(m)</a> and contemplated under <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_34">section 14</a> of the Act. The Trial
of the suit was to be necessarily for enforcement of legal right
relating to environment. 
</p>
 

	
 


<p id="p_71">6.1	From the nature of the suit and
the subject matter controversy raised herein, which is highlighted
hereinabove, it can hardly be denied that the averments in the suit
and the prayers of the plaintiffs do raise the disputes which are
required to be settled by the Tribunal under <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_35">section 14</a> of the Act. 
The contention of the learned advocate for the appellants that under
<a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_36">section 14</a> the jurisdiction of the Tribunal would attract in respect
of  a substantial question relating to the environment  and such
question or questions do not arise in the plaintiffs suit is not
tenable.  An attentive reading of <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_37">section 14</a> was to show that the
Tribunal is assigned jurisdiction by the legislature for all the
civil cases where (i) a substantial question relating to environment
is involved, and, as stated in the bracketed portion (ii) including
enforcement of any legal right relating to environment. The words
 including enforcement any legal right  occurring in <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_38">section 14</a>
imports a wider area for the Tribunal.  Therefore, any civil case
which relate to enforcement of any legal right would become a dispute
under <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_39">section 14</a> and which shall have to be dealt with and decided by
the Tribunal alone.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_72">6.2	Learned advocate for the
appellants laid emphasis on the group of words in the said section
 &amp;. and such  question arises out of implementation of enactments
specified in Schedule I  to contend on that basis that the suit
does not bring out any question relating to implementation of the
enactments in question.  This argument is wholly misconceived.  As
already seen, the suit and the suit prayers are about the grievance
in relation to the environmental damage to the crop in the
agricultural fields, live stock and injury to health of the people. 
These damage and injuries are apprehended, as the averments in the
plaint clearly suggest, because of laying of pipeline in particular
manner leading to improper management in discharge of industrial
effluent and dirty water, which come out because of the industrial
operations carried out by the defendant companies engaged in
manufacturing of pesticides and using chemicals for that purpose. The
schedule I to the Act is connected to <a href="/doc/174072768/" id="a_40">sections 14(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/177298014/" id="a_41">15(1)</a>,.
17(1)(a),. 17(2), 19(4)(j) and <a href="/doc/114478429/" id="a_42">section 34(1)</a> of the Act. The statutes
mentioned in the schedule are (1) The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_43">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974; (2) The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_44">Control of
Pollution) Cess Act</a>, 1977; (3) <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_45">The Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980;
(4) The Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_46">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981; (5) <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_47">The
Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986; (6) <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_48">The Public Liability
Insurance Act</a>, 1991; and (7) <a href="/doc/548841/" id="a_49">The Biological Diversity Act</a>, 2002. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_73">6.3	It is quite conceivable that in
the compass of the grievance made and reliefs claimed by the
plaintiffs in their suit, questions regarding implementation of the
provisions of The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_50">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1974, The Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_51">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and the
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_52">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 would arise and addition to other
laws.  The suit prayer is directed against the Pollution Control
Board which is a statutory body entrusted with implementation of all
the environmental laws including the Scheduled statutes. The kind of
relief which the Tribunal could grant as per <a href="/doc/77055124/" id="a_53">Section 15</a> of the Act
also buttresses the reasoning adopted and view taken herein.  The
relief to be granted by the Tribunal include relief of compensation,
restitution of property damaged and restitution of environment.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_74">6.4	In making out an argument that
substantial question relating to environment includes solely an
instance involving direct violation of specific statutory law,
learned advocate overlooked clause (ii) in the definition section. 
As per the definition in Sec. 2(m),  substantial question relating
to environment , includes also an instance where, as contemplated
in clause (ii), the environmental consequences relate to a specific
activity or the point of source of pollution.  The  specific
activity  or  point source of pollution  having consequences on
the environment is thus an instance of  substantial question
relating to environment .  It will cover the subject matter
controversy in the suit.  Therefore, it is bereft of any substance to
contend that the  substantial question relating to environment 
is not arising in the subject matter of the suit instituted. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_75">6.5	In order to judge whether the
plaint is liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11(d), the
criteria is, as is well settled, that from the reading of averments
of the plaint, it must come out that they do not disclose the
jurisdiction for the court, and that the court has no jurisdiction to
try the suit.  In other words, the absence of jurisdiction of civil
court is capable of being made out on the face of reading of the
averments in the plaint. The said requirement stands undoubtedly
satisfied when the plaint of the plaintiff's is read and considered.
The courts below, therefore, committed no error in invoking powers
under said provisions to reject the plaint on the ground of court
having no jurisdiction to try the suit in view of the provisions of
the NGT Act.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_76">7.	For all aforesaid considerations,
it gives no room to contend that the subject matter of suit does not
raise the questions to be decided by Tribunal and consequently the
bar on the jurisdiction of the civil court would not apply. The civil
court had no jurisdiction to try the plaintiffs  suit in view of
<a href="/doc/182774752/" id="a_54">section 29(2)</a> read with <a href="/doc/59603002/" id="a_55">section 14(1)</a> of the act. The compass and
nature of the controversy and grievance in the suit did raise
substantial question relating to environment within the ambit of Sec.
2(m) and one falling under Sec. 14 of the NGT Act.  Therefore, the
order of the trial court below Exh. 17 which was confirmed by the
first appellate court holding that the plaint was liable to be
rejected under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the Code was eminently proper
and justified is law.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_77">8.	In the circumstances, no
substantial question of law arises in the Appeal. 
</p>
 


                   

 


<p id="p_78">9.	The present appeal therefore,
stands dismissed summarily.
