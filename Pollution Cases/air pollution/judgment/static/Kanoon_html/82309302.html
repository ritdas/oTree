</p><p id="p_2">1.     The serious deterioration of air quality in the Capital and the National
Capital Region (NCR) is a matter of grave public concern and the steps
taken to improve air quality by various agencies, the subject matter of
continuous oversight by this Court in this public interest litigation. During
the course of these proceedings it is established that one contributory major
component to air pollution in Delhi during the months of October and March
each year is the burning of agricultural waste, including plant
residue/stubble while harvesting the Kharif and Rabi crops ("stubble
burning"). The statistics made available and presented by the Pollution
Control Board reveals that every ton of dry residue burnt generates 0.747 kg




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) Nos.1346/2015 &amp; 2115/2015                           Page 2 of 7</span>
 of PM 10 and 0.672 kg of PM 2.5 particulates of which are disbursed in the
air.
</p><p id="p_3">2.     The affidavits filed by the States, disclose that14 million tons of
paddy straw is burnt in the state of Punjab alone. The other States provided
relative figures separately. The emission of particulate matter from this
stubble burning is beyond any acceptable human endurance, or „danger‟
levels. The figures regarding particulate matter emissions for Haryana are
equally large.
</p><p id="p_4">3.     With a view to ensure elimination of the practice ofstubble-burning,
this Court had called upon the NCR States and the State of Punjab to furnish
information relevant to this issue on affidavits. The States and the Union of
India have since filed their respective affidavits. The steps taken, briefly are
summarized below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       a)      Notifications under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of
       Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 were issued by the individual State banning the
       burning of agricultural waste - Punjab notification dated 22.10.2013,
       Haryana notification dated 16.09.2003 etc.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       b)      The States have set up Special Committees to prevent, monitor
       and control the burning of agricultural residue. District Collectors
       have been empowered to initiate proceedings - including penal
       proceedings against defaulters.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       c)      The States, notably Rajasthan are in the process of setting up
       remote sensing systems to locate sites where such residue is burnt.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       d)      In November, 2014, the Government of India formulated the
       National Policy for Management of Crop Residue, 2014. On August,
       2017, a draft Action Plan for Biomass Management was prepared by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) Nos.1346/2015 &amp; 2115/2015                            Page 3 of 7</span>
        the MoEF in consultation with the Confederation of Indian Industry
       and the NitiAayog. The Union MoEF has formed a Committee on
       17.08.2017.
</blockquote><p id="p_5">4.     This Court, on 18.07.2017, by its order issued the following directions
to the concerned States and Union:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "10. The Court hereby requires the Union Secretaries, Ministry
       of Environment, Forest and Climate Change; Science and
       Technology and of Agriculture &amp; Farmer's Welfare to explore
       the possibility of creating a fund for innovation in farming
       techniques in co-ordination with such educational or technical
       institutions (IITs, etc) as are feasible (and practicable) in this
       regard, to innovate and develop the most environment friendly
       practices, which are also energy efficient and suited to use by
       farmers. The three Secretaries shall hold a meeting in this
       regard within three weeks. The Central Government may, if
       necessary, create a fund and a Task Force comprised of
       appropriate personnel in this regard. A report of the meeting
       and proposals discussed indicating the way forward and the
       views of the Central Government in this regard, shall be filed
       along with an affidavit [enclosing minutes of the meeting (s)] a
       week before the next date of hearing."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">5.     The Court had, on 18 September, 2017, heard the parties. The State of
Rajasthan had indicated in its affidavit that extensive farmer education and
training programmes and sessions had been undertaken to sensitize against
the ills of farm residue burning and that it had mooted a proposal for a pilot
project with the Central Government, to track such incidents through remote
sensing. That proposal appears to be pending consideration. The Union‟s
counsel had indicated that a committee on the lines suggested by the court
had been constituted which had met and discussed the issue.
</p><p id="p_7">6.     Considering the facts on record and the submission of the parties, and
given that the Kharif crop is to be harvested, there is strong likelihood that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C) Nos.1346/2015 &amp; 2115/2015                            Page 4 of 7</span>
 the burning of agricultural residue will be resorted to, inthis season as well.
The effects of such practice can again be traumatic for most people and
catastrophic for some.
</p><p id="p_8">7.     In order to prevent and minimize burning of agriculture waste, it is
directed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       1) All the States shall implement the respective notifications and
           directions issued by them under the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Air Pollution Act</a> banning the
           burning of crop residue/paddy straw strictly, in letter and in spirit.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       2) Reports       of the prosecutions          launched/implementations for
           preventing burning of agricultural waste will be filed in this Court
           every week w.e.f. 01.10.2017.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       3) The State Governments are to issue directions/orders to all the
           companies/plants including biomass plants, cement plants and
           power generation plants and public undertakings involved in the
           manufacturing of boards and rough paper, to discharge their
           corporate social responsibility by collecting the crop residue from
           the fields of farmers by providing them with money as
           consideration       for   lifting   the     agricultural       residue.   The
           implementation of the aforesaid directions/order would not entail
           any cost or financial dependence of the States on the Central
           Government to prevent stubble burning and consequential severe
           air pollution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">       4) The authorities of each State will strictly implement the Graded
           Response Action Plan issued under the Notification dated
           12.01.2017.
</blockquote>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C) Nos.1346/2015 &amp; 2115/2015                                     Page 5 of 7</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">        5) The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change will
           obtain weekly reports from the Special Committees established by
           each of these States on the steps taken in the concerned States to
           prevent burning of agricultural waste/stubble.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">       6) The Union of India will monitor the sites where agricultural waste
           is found to have been burnt by satellite tracking for
           monitoring/study of weather, i.e. update Satellite Imagery in terms
           of inputs from the Centre/Government/MoEF and Climate change.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">       7) It has been mentioned that in Punjab - specifically the District
           Collector, Sagrur; District Collector, Patiala; District Collector,
           Karnal; Chief Secretary, Punjab; Chief Secretary, NCT of Delhi;
           District Collector, Muzaffarnagar; Managing Director, NTPC;
           Secretary (S&amp;T) and Joint Secretary (MoNRE) will share their
           inputs and experiences on biomass management in their respective
           districts and sectors.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">       8) This initiative which is being followed in these districts can be
           immediately replicated in other districts in the other States.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">       9) The states concerned, especially those having locales where smog
           formation is most likely, are to inform members of the public, the
           protective measures to be taken by them to safeguard their health.
           These measures include, but are not confined to weather,
           smog/smoke forecasts, wherever particulate matter is likely to
           concentrate highest, any day, or during any part of any day, to
           appraise the populace and general public through electronic mass
           media appeals and broadcasts, the other preventive measures to be
           taken, such as availability of gas masks, etc, when the

            concentration levels are alarmingly high, making available such
           protective gear, in advance to those public personnel who are
           likely to be vulnerable, such as police, watch and ward staff,
           workers exposed to the elements, etc.
</blockquote><p id="p_9">8.     These preventive measures are to be given effect to forthwith. All the
States, the Govt. of NCT of Delhi and the Union of India, shall file brief
affidavits disclosing the measures taken to comply with the above order,
before the next date of hearing.
</p><p id="p_10">9.     The GNCTD; Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change;
local bodies of Delhi - SDMC/NDMC/EDMC/NDMC/DCB and the
National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) shall file the latest status
report through separate affidavits with respect to the latest position, having
regard to the previous orders, with respect to the enhancement of capacity of
waste-to-energy power plants; the provision for fresh site to accommodate
waste disposal through landfills etc. and the steps taken so far with respect
to solid waste management and disposal.
