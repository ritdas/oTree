                      the said property(ies). Apart from the petitioner-Units, there are more than 13

                      other stone crushers, and the same are being operated with the consent of the

                      respondent-TNPCB. The petitioner-stone crushing industries are coming under

                      the "Orange Category" industries as per the norms prescribed by the Tamil Nadu

                      2008 and in 2008, the respondent-TNPCB issued a closure notice stating that the

                      year and thereafter, it was periodically renewed once in two years and last such

                      renewal of consent was given to the petitioner-Units on the following dates:

                      satisfying that the conditions attached to the consent orders are being complied

                      crushing activities undertaken by the petitioner-Units. While so, sometime in the

                      year 2015, the Border Security Force (BSF) was allotted 28 acres of land

                      adjacent to the petitioner-Units by the Government of Tami Nadu to have their

                      training camp, residential quarters, etc. Though the BSF had taken possession of

                      the land, as on date, they had put up only semi-permanent structure in the said

                      28 acres of land, and as on date, no activity is taking place in the land allotted to

                      the BSF.

<p id="p_14">                            5. The petitioners were under the bona-fide belief that running the stone

                      crushing units by them will not be hampered due to the establishment of the

                      training camp by BSF adjacent to their Units. The cluster of Units have put up a

                      temporary structure on the side where the BSF was allotted lands by raising 20

                      feet wall to avoid any dust emission, apart from existing air pollution control

                      measures adopted by the Units. It seems that the BSF had given a complaint to

                      the second respondent in the month of April 2019 stating that the stone crushing

                      units situated at Keerapakkam Village are causing serious air pollution, based on

                      which, the respondent-Board officials inspected the premises of the Units on

                      23.04.2019. Immediately on 26.04.2019, the second respondent issued cyclo-

</p>
<p id="p_15">                             (i) The Units have not provided water sprinklers of adequate capacity to

                      control the dust emission from the bunker, jaw crushers, vibrating screen,

                      conveyor and stone powder storage silo.

<p id="p_16">                             (ii) The Units have not maintained the MS hood enclosures to the jaw

                      crushers and vibrating screens and the same were in damaged condition.

</p><p id="p_17">                             (iii) The Units have not developed adequate green belt all around the

                      premises for suppression of dust emission.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                             (iv) The Units have not provided telescope chutes at the product

                      unloading conveyor or to prevent dust release into the atmosphere during free

                      having all pollution control measures and running the Units for the past several

                      years, all of a sudden the second respondent had observed that the petitioner-

                      Units had violated the consent conditions by not adopting the pollution control

                      measures.

                      improving all pollution control measures, if required and submit the same on or

                      before 31.07.2019. While so, on 30.06.2019, one M/s.G.S.Blue Metal, which is

                      running the Unit from the year 2008 with valid consent and which has also

                      applied for renewal of consent after its expiry, was directed to be closed by the

                      respondent-TNPCB on the ground that they do not have valid consent and also

                      pointed out the deficiencies with regard to the pollution control measures.

                      Hence, the petitioner-Units apprehend that even though they are running the

                      Units with valid consent and had installed air pollution control measures, the

                      second respondent may pass order of closure in haste and mechanically by
