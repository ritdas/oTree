A.      Introduction


1       The Union of India in the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate

</pre><p id="p_2">Change1 moved these proceedings, seeking a direction that the Minutes of the

fortieth meeting of the Expert Appraisal Committee2 dated 23 April 2019 be taken

on the record so that the embargo imposed by this Court on the Environmental

Clearance3 for a greenfield airport at Mopa Goa can be lifted. This follows upon

the judgment dated 23 April 2019 which was rendered on a challenge addressed

to this Court against a decision of the National Green Tribunal 4 upholding the EC,

subject to compliance with certain conditions. By the judgment of this Court,

reported as Hanuman Laxman Aroskar v Union of India5, the process leading

up to the grant of an EC on 28 October 2015 was held to be flawed. The

directions that were imposed by the Court were formulated in the following terms:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                “175. …

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                (i) The EAC shall revisit the recommendations made by it for
                the grant of an EC, including the conditions which it has
                formulated, having regard to the specific concerns which have
                been highlighted in this judgment;

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                (ii) The EAC shall carry out the exercise under (i) above
                within a period of one month of the receipt of a certified copy
                of this order;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                (iii) Until the EAC carries out the fresh exercise as directed
                above, the EC granted by the MoEFCC on 28 October 2015
                shall remain suspended;</blockquote><p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">                (iv) Upon reconsidering the matter in terms of the present
                directions, the EAC, if it allows the construction to proceed

             systems noticed in this judgment. The EAC would be at liberty
             to lay down appropriate conditions concerning air, water,
             noise, land, biological and socio-economic environment;

</p><p id="p_5">             (v) The EAC shall have due regard to the             assurance
             furnished by the concessionaire to this Court that   it is willing
             to adopt and implement necessary safeguards          bearing in
             mind international best practices governing           greenfield
             airports;

<p id="p_6">             (vi) We grant liberty to the State of Goa as the project

             report of the EAC before this Court in the form of a
             Miscellaneous Application so as to facilitate the passing of
             appropriate orders in the proceedings; and

</p><p id="p_7">             (vii) No other Court or Tribunal shall entertain any challenge
             to the report that is to be submitted before this Court by the
             EAC in compliance with the present order.”




Pending the completion of the process mandated in the above terms, this Court

suspended the EC which had been granted on 28 October 2015.


The directions issued by this Court required the EAC:


</p><p id="p_8">   (i)    To revisit its recommendations for the grant of the EC including the

          conditions which it had imposed; and

</p><p id="p_9">   (ii)   To impose, in the event that it allowed the construction of the airport to

          proceed additional conditions to adequately protect the concerns

          governing the terrestrial eco-systems noticed in the judgment, besides

          formulating conditions pertaining to air, water, noise, land, biological

          and socio-economic environment. While doing so, the EAC was under

          a mandate to take into consideration the specific concerns which were

          highlighted in the judgment.

2          The basis of the directions that were issued by this Court was formulated

in the penultimate paragraph of the judgment which reads thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                   “174.Bearing in view the necessity to maintain a balance
                   between the need for an airport and environmental concerns,
                   we are of the view that it would be appropriate if the EAC is
                   directed to revisit the conditions subject to which it granted its
                   EC on the basis of the specific concerns which have been
                   highlighted in this judgment. Such an exercise primarily is for
                   the EAC to carry out in its expert decision making capacity.
                   The EAC is entrusted with that function as an expert body.
                   The role of judicial review is to ensure that the rule of law is
                   observed. Hence, we propose by the directions which we will
                   issue under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_1">Article 142</a> of the Constitution, to direct the EAC
                   to revisit the conditions for the grant of an EC. While doing
                   so, it would be open to the EAC to have due regard to the
                   conditions which were incorporated in the order of the NGT
                   and to suitably modulate those conditions in pursuance of the
                   liberty which we have preserved to it. To facilitate an
                   expeditious decision, we propose to direct the EAC to carry
                   out this exercise in a prescribed time schedule during which
                   period, the EC shall remain suspended. We propose to direct
                   that after the EAC has formulated its views, they shall be
                   placed before this Court in a Miscellaneous Application in the
                   present proceedings, so as to enable the Court to pass final
                   orders. The Miscellaneous Application may be filed either by
                   the State of Goa as the project proponent or by the MoEFCC.</blockquote><p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">                   We clarify that no other Court or Tribunal shall entertain any
                   challenge to the ultimate decision of the EAC and final orders
                   thereon shall be passed by this Court in the present
                   proceedings.”




3          Essentially, the concerns which were highlighted in the judgment of this

Court related to the need to preserve the biodiversity of the Western Ghats.

These concerns have been the subject of a seminal exercise carried out in 2013

by a High Level Working Group6 on the Western Ghats chaired by Dr K

Kasturirangan7. The report of the HLWG has been dwelt upon in the earlier

judgment and continues to be a focal point of the continuing debate in the present

case. The HLWG was constituted under the auspices of the MoEF-CC. Its report

dated 15 April 2013 is a valuable contribution to the preservation of biodiversity in

the pristine environment of the Western Ghats.




4         The judgment of this Court emphasized the failure of the State of Goa, as

the project proponent, to provide complete information on the existence of

reserved forests including those which fall within a 15 km radial distance of the

proposed airport at Mopa. Underlying the serious deficiency in the disclosure of

information by the project proponent, this Court noted its concerns on certain

specific aspects. These included primarily:


</p><p id="p_13">(i)       Preservation of forests, including reserved forests;


</p><p id="p_14">(ii)      Existence of Ecologically Sensitive Areas8 with their attendant features

          such as flora, fauna and environmental quality in terms of water, soil, noise

          and climatic variations;
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">(iii)     Impact of the proposed construction on the flow of water in natural water

          channels; and

</p><p id="p_17">(iv)      Socio-economic and environmental concerns which were raised in the

          course of public consultations.</p><pre id="pre_3">

B.    Appraisal by the EAC


5     Following the judgment of this Court, the project proponent furnished

</pre><p id="p_18">supplementary information to the EAC which revealed certain significant

environmental features. The disclosure is extracted below:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">             “a) There are seven reserved forests within 15 km. of the
             proposed Airport in the Goa region (under Section-20) and six

             Toposheet &amp; Forest Department, Sawantwadi Division)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">             c) There are four rivers in Goa viz. Terekhol river, Kalna river,
             Chapora river, Moide river and one river viz. Tilari river in
             Maharashtra (source: Survey of India Toposheet).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">             d) There are few patches of mangroves observed near Moide

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">             e) Western Ghat Mountain range falls within the study area.

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">             f) There are two wetlands, of which one i.e. Anjuna reservoir

</p><p id="p_20">             g) There are no coastal areas and declared biospheres in the
             vicinity of the proposed airport site.”




6     The EAC tabulated the details of forest areas which fell within a radial

distance of 15 kms of the proposed airport and within the territories of the States

of Goa and Maharashtra. The forested areas were found to be situated in three

talukas in the State of Goa (Bicholim, Pernem and Bardez) and in three talukas in

the State of Maharashtra (Sawantwadi, Dodamarg and Vengurla). In Pernem

taluka, the information set out in the minutes of the EAC dated 23 April 2019

demonstrate the existence of reserved forests inter alia in Mopa.




7         While reviewing the Environmental Impact Assessment9, the EAC

observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">               “As per Forest Policy, 1988 of Government of India, required
               forest cover is 33%. Whereas, India average is 21.54%,
               Goa‟s forest cover as per India‟s state of forest report 2017 is
               60.21%. There would be impact on forest due to felling of
               trees but eventually the forest cover will improve with a 1:10
               compensatory afforestation program to be undertaken over a
               period of 5 years by the concessionaire, Goa State
               Biodiversity Board and Directorate of Civil Aviation. The
               enhanced forest cover would lead to healthy biodiversity.
               Further impacts on water, air, soil and noise environment will
               be minimal considering the felling of trees over a large area
               and compensatory afforestation plan as approved.

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">               It is noted that the airport site is not fragmenting the forest
               area thus not restricting and affecting the movement of fauna.
               The Airport plateau has villages on one side and forest cover

8          On the existence of ESAs, the EAC noted that the EIA report had only

indicated that Pernem taluka, where the project is to come up, has not been

earmarked as an ESA in the Kasturirangan Committee report. The EAC, in its

minutes dated 23 April 2019, took note of the fact that based on the

Kasturirangan Committee report, the MoEF-CC published a draft notification on 3

October 2018 indicating proposed ESAs in the Western Ghats according to

which, ten villages in Sawantwadi taluka of Sindhudurg district in Maharashtra

are comprised in the ESAs of the Western Ghats. Apart from the ESAs within the

State of Maharashtra, the EAC noted the existence of an additional eighteen

species of mammals and fourteen bird species in the study area on the basis of

data collected from the Zoological Survey of India10. Reviewing the EIA with

reference to the existence of ten ESAs within a radial distance of 10 Kms in the

State of Maharashtra, the EAC noted in its minutes dated 23 April 2019:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                “EAC noted that all the 10 ESA areas within 10 kms in the
                State of Maharashtra are beyond 4 kilometers from the
                project boundary, the nearest one being at a distance of 4.1
                kms (Village Galel). As per Airport guidance manual
                maximum impact on the air and noise environment will be
                there till the aircraft gains a height of 1000 ft. Emissions from
                aircraft below 1,000 ft. above the ground will be there typically
                around 3 km from departure or, for arrivals, around 6 km from
                touchdown. The altitude of 1000 ft in landing and takeoff is
                achieved within the project site. Considering that all the ESAs
                are far away from the project, the impact on air and noise
                environment is expected to be minimal. With regard to soil
                environment, impact will be mostly on the airport site self. As
                regards water environment, as the water flow from the airport
                site will feed the water bodies in the State of Goa, no impact
                is envisaged on the ESA areas.”

9     The EAC also deliberated on the likely impact of the construction and

operation of an airport on the flora, fauna and hydrological systems in the ESAs

as well as in regard to climatic variations. The EAC categorized them in the

Dealing with these features and the impact upon them of the proposed project,

the EAC observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">             “The EAC noted that a total of 385 species of plants, 36
             medicinal plant, 86 species of birds, 33 butterfly species, 5
             species of amphibians, 18 species of reptiles, 35 fish species,
             28 number of mammal species were identified in the study
             area based on primary and secondary source of data. The
             proposed project has minimal intervention and impact on the
             surrounding ecosystem. There are mitigation measures
             already prescribed in EC conditions so as to minimize the
             impact on Biodiversity-Flora &amp; Fauna, Hydrological Systems.</blockquote><p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">             This will help enabling the process for sustainable
             development that benefit both environment and local
             livelihoods. With regards to climatic variations, the EAC felt
             that additional initiatives such as Green Infrastructure
             Development program, adoption of low emission intensive
             technologies, renewable energy program, and Airport Carbon
             Accreditation need to be adopted to reduce the impact on
             Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and thereby climate
             change.”



10    The next set of concerns that were dealt with by the EAC related to the

impact of the proposed project on natural channels for the drainage of water. This

Court had noted in its earlier judgment that the Mopa plateau is at a height of 155




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                             11</span>
                                                                                     PART B


metres above Mean Sea Level11 and water from the plateau flows down to the

rivers in the State of Goa. The laterite plateau is an important source of drainage

by providing natural channels for water. The deficiency which was seen by this

Court was that the impact of a greenfield airport on the closing of natural

channels which feed water bodies had not been scientifically mapped or studied

and adequately addressed.
</p>
<p id="p_29">
11         In reviewing the EIA on this aspect, the EAC in its minutes dated 23 April

2019 observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">                 “If natural water channels that feed the local water bodies are
                 not protected then there will be water deficiency in the
                 villages for agriculture, fishing etc. Further, there will be
                 impact on the ground water levels in the villages. EAC while
                 granting EC for the project had detailed deliberation on this
                 aspect so as to ensure that natural water channels feeding
                 the water bodies are not blocked. The EAC reviewed the
                 entire gamut of natural/artificial drainage and the storm water
                 drainage pattern. As per the supplementary information
                 provided now, the airport site, by virtue of being located on a
                 plateau and the laterite soil surface, would naturally facilitate
                 the flow of storm water and other artificial drainage. The
                 proponent has designed for appropriate drainage channels in
                 such a manner that the water flow from project site is
                 channelized suitably into the natural water channels feeding
                 the water bodies down slope. All due precautions, however,
                 need to be exercised during the construction phase so as to
                 ensure that construction material/debris does not, in any
                 manner, block/obstruct the natural water channels or springs.</blockquote><p id="p_30">

</p><p id="p_31">                 The EAC deliberated on the current state of the project
                 construction and noted that in the ensuing monsoon season
                 the earth piled up at the project site due to excavation may
                 drift to the natural water channels which may ultimately reach
                 the water bodies in the villages. This is a matter of grave
                 environmental concern which needs to be addressed by the
                 project proponent immediately by development of
                 embankment structures around the excavated earth so that
                 piled up earth doesn‟t drift to the natural water channels and
                 the run-off from the site does not pollute or contaminate the

            construction/operation phase of the project.”




12    As regards the concerns which were raised in the course of public

consultations, the EAC dealt with environmental concerns which included:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">            “rain water harvesting, STP and solid waste management
            plan, impact on flora and fauna, soil quality and its impact,
            storm water management, impact on ground water, socio
            cultural impact, dust pollution during construction activity,
            employment opportunities to the local people, compensation
            to the affected land owners”



The EAC has opined that these have been adequately addressed.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_32">13    Finally, after analyzing the responses submitted before it, the EAC

summed up its analysis thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">            “1. The EAC observed that the earlier Form-1 did not give
            proper disclosure in respect of the details of forests on the
            land and nearby wet land as well as on the water bodies. The
            EAC took into account the supplementary report that has
            been submitted which takes into account the deficiency of
            disclosure and the same thing has been complied with in the
            supplementary report. In addition, it is also noticed that the
            mitigation measures in respect of the depletion of forest cover
            on the project land and water bodies have been taken into
            account. As against 54,176 trees, which have been felled on
            the project site based on earlier approvals given by
            competent authority, the project proponent is proposing to
            plant 5,50,000 trees (50,000 trees at the project site, 2,50,000
            trees in the nearby villages supervised by the Biodiversity
            Board and 2,50,000 trees under the supervision of DGCA.
            This is 1:10 times the number of trees affected as against the
            standard requirement of 1:3 times number of trees to be
            planted. The overall supervision of this compliance within the
            time frame of 5 years would be vested with DGCA. DGCA,
            however, needs to constitute a local monitoring committee for
            periodic monitoring of this vital exercise.

</p><p id="p_34">2. The EAC noted that neither the project site nor the villages
in area under study (primary data source) falls in any Eco-
Sensitive Zone (ESZ). The 10 villages in Maharashtra side fall
in ESA not ESZ and where the impacts of the project would
be minimal. The EAC also observed that the villages in
vicinity of the project in the Goa and Maharashtra region are
not located in very close proximity. The nearest village is
about 4.1 km from the boundary of the project. The EAC also
observed that beyond the runway of 3.75 km, the flight
operation generally found at an altitude of about 1000 feet
and thus there would not be any adverse impact on flora and
fauna in the surrounding area of the airport.

</p><p id="p_35">3. The EAC observed that a certificate from Chief Wildlife
Warden (CWLW) of State through State Government be
obtained confirming that none of the area of the project falls in
the notified Eco-sensitive Zone (ESZ) in the State of Goa and
no activity prohibited in the Ecosensitive zone will be taken up
be taken by the project proponent.
</p>
<p id="p_36">4. The EAC further observed that as per the supplementary
report and the proposal of the water bodies with respect to
observation regarding plateau effect of the land and also
laterite surface and the springs, streams and water courses in
the project land have been taken into account and
appropriate drainage channels have been designed to take
care of the water flows into the nearest water courses/rivers,
etc.
</p>
<p id="p_37">5. Appropriate storm water drainage channeling has been
taken into account not only for the pre-monsoon season but
also for monsoon and heavy rainfall. The drainage plan
should have ratification by the concerned water resources
department of Goa. It should be ensured that sustainable
water flow in the various channels of watershed in the plateau
is maintained. For the present, base level data on flow of
water should be collected and used for future monitoring.

</p><p id="p_38">6. The EAC observed that in respect of the fauna, the primary
data has been collected from one of the nearest village and
the secondary data has been collected from ZSI. In respect of
the observation of sighting a leopard by villager, the
authorities have indicated that they do not have any definitive
information on the same and this need to be
verified/authenticated.
</p>
<p id="p_39">7. It is a well-established fact of silvicultural science and
practice that no plantation can replace the natural forest. The
kind of biodiversity in any natural forest is almost impossible
to be replaced by any kind of plantation activity which at best
can be a mix of various monocultures. We are still far away in

                   our knowledge of replicating the creation of natural forest.
                   Therefore, to this extent, the EAC does not agree with the
                   assessment of project proponent that after cutting of trees
                   and planting of 1:10 trees, richer biodiversity the forest would
                   be created. However, 1:10 plantation activity under expert
                   guidance can to some extent compensate the loss of natural
                   forest.
</p>
<p id="p_40">                   8. With respect to the various points raised in the public
                   hearing, the EAC observed that the supplementary report has
                   made available point-wise clarifications on the various
                   concerns on the public hearing. However, Hon‟ble court
                   shortlisted 14 items of concern in the public hearing.
                   Solution/management plan to all these need to be clearly
                   spelt out in the EMP and implemented in letter and spirit.”




14           Accordingly, the EAC has recommended the grant of an EC to the project

with additional environmental safeguards and conditions, over and above those

which were stipulated in (i) the EC dated 28 October 2015; and (ii) the order of

the NGT dated 21 August 2018. The conditions which have been imposed by the

C.      Genesis of the proposed airport


17      Before we deal with the principle challenges addressed before the Court

on behalf of the original appellant represented by Ms Anitha Shenoy, learned

Senior Counsel, it would be worthwhile to set out briefly the genesis of the

proposed airport at Mopa Goa. Mr K K Venugopal, learned Attorney General for

India emphasized the following features of the project:


</p><p id="p_53">(i)     The construction of an airport at Mopa Goa has been on the drawing board

        for nearly two decades;
</p>
<p id="p_54">(ii)    The site at Mopa was chosen among three options after due examination

        by experts;
</p>
<p id="p_55">(iii)   The existing airport at Dabolim is a defence establishment which is closed

        to area traffic between 8:30am to 1:30pm daily;

</p><p id="p_56">(iv)    The existing airport at Dabolim was intended to serve four million

        passengers annually while the existing passenger traffic is about 7.5

        million annually;
</p>
<p id="p_57">(v)     The passenger traffic at Goa is expected to rise in the upcoming financial

        years to the following extent:
</p>
<pre id="pre_6">         FY 21        FY 22              FY 23             FY 24              FY 25

(vi)       Due to capacity constraints, international charter flights are not granted

</pre><p id="p_58">           parking facilities at night at Dabolim; and

</p><p id="p_59">(vii)      The proposed greenfield airport will have a capacity to handle 4.4 million

           passengers in Phase–I, 13 million passengers in Phase–II and 30 million

           passengers in Phase–III annually.
</p>
<p id="p_60">
18         The project area of the proposed Mopa airport is spread over 2,131 acres.

Terms of Reference12 were issued on 1 June 2011 and were extended on 19

June 2013 and 29 May 2015. The process for land acquisition was initiated

around 2008. The Request for Qualification13 for the Mopa airport was issued on

3 October 2014. The EC was granted on 28 October 2015. The concession

agreement was executed on 8 November 2016. The airport is required by the

terms of the agreement to be operational within thirty-six months from 4

September 2017. According to the concessionaire, as on 18 January 2019,

approximately 14.06 per cent of the project work had been completed. Pursuant

to the orders for the removal of trees, 54,176 trees were felled and 500 trees

were earmarked for transplantation. Ten trees of local species are to be replanted

for every tree which has been felled. 20,000 saplings have been re-planted. The

concessionaire has placed on record the following financial features of the

project:

D.    The present challenge


19    The essence of the controversy in the present case is whether the

concerns which were highlighted in the earlier judgment of this Court dated 29

March 2019, have been adequately addressed and remedied.


20    Ms Anitha Shenoy, learned Senior Counsel appeared on behalf of the

appellant submitted that by the judgment of this Court dated 29 March 2019, the

EAC was directed to revisit the EC granted to the project and to decide whether

or not the project should be approved. Ms Shenoy prefaced her submissions with

two preliminary points:
</p>
<p id="p_68">
</p><p id="p_69">(i)   The composition of the EAC (Infrastructure-2) which has thirteen members

      does not qualify it as an expert body. None of the members had expertise

      on ornithology or on terrestrial eco-system. The EAC is chaired by a former

      Director of the Council for Social Development with retired officers of the

      State and Central Pollution Control Boards. One of the members has an

      architectural background, another in chemical engineering while one of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                            21</span>
                                                                                    PART D


               members is a Professor of Law. The minutes do not disclose whether the

               EAC sought the opinion of a subject specialist or specialized institution;

               and


</p><p id="p_70">(ii)           There is a conflict of interest on the part of the EIA consultant who had

               prepared the EIA report. As on the date of EAC meeting, Engineers India

               Limited14 was the EIA consultant as well as an independent engineer on

               the project. The EAC minutes recorded that the project proponent and EIL

               made a detailed presentation on the observations of this Court with

               comments and responses. EIL was defending its actions as an EIA

               consultant while at the same time being an independent engineer for the

               construction of the airport. This involves a conflict of interest.


Apart from addressing the above preliminary points, Ms Shenoy has urged

submissions focusing upon the following specific areas:


</p><pre id="pre_10">       (i)        Forests;

       (ii)       Western Ghats;

       (iii)      Ecologically Sensitive Areas; and

       (iv)       Absence of avi-faunal study.



21             Based on the submissions on the above four facets, Ms Shenoy has dwelt

</pre><p id="p_71">upon mitigation measures suggested by the EAC and the need to factor in the

objections which were addressed during the process of public consultation. Ms

Shenoy urged that the EAC minutes are virtually a facsimile of the presentation

submitted by the concessionaire and that the EAC has failed to fulfill its remit of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">14</span>
     EIL

                                                                           PART D


revisiting the EC as mandated by the order of this Court. The submissions which

were addressed under each of the four heads noted above are catalogued below:


</p><p id="p_72">(i)   Forests

      In the supplementary information contained in updated Form 1, the project

      proponent had disclosed a list of thirty-five proposed reserved forests

      around the project site. However, there has been no collection of primary

      data through remote sensing or ground truthing as required by the Airport

      Guidance Manual. No impact study was carried out of the proposed project

      on the newly disclosed forests. The EAC has merely recorded the fact that

      the Western Ghats fall within the study area without undertaking a study of

      the likely impact of the construction of the airport. The MoEF-CC, in its

      affidavit before this Court, however sought to contend that the Western

      Ghats are far away from the project and the impact due to the operation of

      the airport would be minimal. Though there are ten villages in the taluka of

      Sawantwadi in Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra located in the ESAs of

      the Western Ghats, no study has been conducted of their vulnerability. The

      HLWG recorded that Tiger and Elephant corridors mostly fall in the ESAs

      of the Western Ghats. Thus, the EAC has arrived at a conclusion that there

      will be no impact on the ESAs without knowing why an ESA is proposed to

      be notified and without carrying out an impact assessment. The EAC has

      equated the issue of tree felling at the project site with the issue of the

      impact on the 42 forests surrounding the site. However, in its summing up,

      the EAC has acknowledged that compensatory forestation can never

      replace a natural forest.</p><pre id="pre_11">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                       23</span>
                                                                                  PART D


(ii)    Impact on Western Ghats

</pre><p id="p_73">        The EAC has only adverted to the fact that the Western Ghats fall within

        the study area. While accepting the presence of this critical ecological

        biodiversity hotspot, the EAC has not directed any study on the impact nor

        has it adverted to the likely impact of the activity. The critical significance of

        the Western Ghats has been emphasized in the HLWG report. Absent a

        study by the EAC, the recommendations are flawed.

</p><p id="p_74">(iii)   Ecologically Sensitive Areas

        The EAC has noted that ten villages in the taluka of Sawantwadi in

        Sindhudurg district are located in the ESA of the Western Ghats. The EAC

        ought to have determined what makes each ESA ecologically sensitive

        and to study the reasons for their vulnerabilities. The EAC has not

        endeavored to find the specific vulnerability of each ESA and has recorded

        its satisfaction with a generic explanation.

</p><p id="p_75">(iv)    Flora and Fauna

        The collection of primary and secondary data of flora and fauna in the EIA

        report was perfunctory. Areas which are used by protected, important or

        sensitive species of flora or fauna for breeding, foraging, nesting, resting,

        over-wintering or migration were not considered by the project proponent.

        The EAC merely included a number of additional species, citing a

        publication of the ZSI as the source, as supplied by the project proponent.

        Species found near the Maharashtra – Goa border as well as those found

        throughout India in forested areas show at least 1172 species. On the

        other hand, the list of species submitted by the project proponent does not

                                                                              PART D


        have a single Scheduled I species despite the fact that there are 42 dense

        forests around the project area. Important species such as the Indian

        elephant, royal Bengal tiger and leopard have been excluded. The EAC did

        not direct the carrying out of an avi-faunal study, in violation of the

        directions of this Court, the only reference being to bird strikes.



22      As regards the mitigation measures proposed by the EAC, Ms Shenoy

submitted that the Airport Guidance Manual requires a rigorous study of the

impacts of a proposed airport project on the biological environment and the

measures required to address these impacts. Information relating to the state of

the environment in the 15 km. radius was submitted before the EAC without there

being any primary or secondary data collection. The EAC however came to the

conclusion that the impact would be minimal. The additional environmental

safeguards proposed by the EAC have no bearing on the peculiar conditions of

the proposed airport at Mopa. Ms Shenoy ultimately urged that no effective

mitigating measures can be implemented unless:


</p><p id="p_76">(i)     Authentic information about flora, fauna and natural features in the study

        area exists;
</p>
<p id="p_77">
</p><p id="p_78">(ii)    A scientific objective and independent assessment of the likely impact of

        the proposed project is made; and


</p><p id="p_79">(iii)   A specific finding is arrived at by the EAC on whether the damage and

        impact can be mitigated.</p><pre id="pre_12">

24       The EAC has a vital role in conducting the appraisal of proposed projects

in terms of their environmental impact and consequences. The EAC is intended

to be an expert body. The members of the EAC are expected to bring to the

deliberations of the body their knowledge and domain expertise. The composition

of the EAC as noted above indicates that it comprises of experts with a scientific

background as well as persons having domain knowledge on matters pertaining

to the environment. Among the members of the EAC were persons who had a

background of service in the State and Central Pollution Control Boards, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                          26</span>
                                                                          PART D


Indian Forest Service, MoEF-CC and the National Institute of Ocean Technology.

The constitution of the Committee cannot be faulted on the ground that as a

body, the EAC lacked domain expertise. As a Committee which deals with

infrastructure projects, the body as constituted also comprises of persons with

relevant background and experience. Ultimately, the legitimacy of the decision

which has been arrived at by the EAC will be assessed during the course of the

judgment. At this stage, we are not inclined to accept a generalized challenge on

the ground that the members of the EAC lacked domain expertise.


25    It is necessary to emphasis two facets: First, under clause 4(vii) of the

order dated 7 January 2019 constituting the EAC, the chairperson is empowered

to co-opt an expert as a member for a particular meeting of the Committee.

Infrastructure projects which the EAC is called upon to assess and appraise do

not fall into one specific mould. Hence, the EAC should engage with the enabling

provision which has been made in clause 4(vii) to co-opt experts. The exercise of

this enabling discretion will facilitate the work of the EAC by allowing for the

benefit of the knowledge and expertise of an expert in a particular subject area

being made available to it. The failure to co-opt an expert does not, as a

consequence, lead to the invalidation of the exercise conducted by the EAC. But

the desirability of co-opting experts needs to be underscored so as to bring a

diversity of experience in the work of the EAC. Second, the composition of the

EAC is dominated in a large measure by retired officials drawn from the Pollution

Control Boards in the Centre and State and from former officials of the MoEF-CC.

In the composition of the EAC, the Union Government should travel beyond

former officials of the Pollution Control Boards and Ministries. Without

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                       27</span>
                                                                             PART D


disparaging their credentials or their experience, it is nonetheless desirable that

the members of the EAC should comprise of a cross section of persons drawn

from different specialties having a bearing on environmental protection. Where

the EAC has to deal with infrastructure projects, it is of course necessary to

include persons who are familiar with the need for a balanced growth of

infrastructure consistent with environmental protection.


26    We strongly commend to the Union Government the need to ensure in the

composition of the EAC the inclusion of persons with specialized knowledge of

diverse disciplines in relation to environmental protection. Having commended

such an exercise to the Union government, we would leave the matter there. As

we have observed earlier, the challenge to the minutes of the 23 April 2019 must

be addressed on merits, there being no reasonable basis for this Court to

conclude that the EAC lacked the expertise to make its recommendations.


D.2   Conflict of interest


27    The second preliminary point that was urged by Ms Shenoy was of a

conflict of interest in the role and position of EIL as an EIA consultant as well as

an independent engineer for the project. The Attorney General for India in his

written note of submissions on behalf of the State of Goa has submitted that EIL

was appointed as a consultant for preparing the EIA report in 2012. The

assignment of EIL concluded upon the issuance of an EC by MoEF-CC on 28

October 2015. Thereafter, the Government of Goa floated a tender for the

appointment of an independent engineer to supervise the work of construction in

2017. EIL secured the bid and came on board as an independent engineer in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                        28</span>

December 2017. After the judgment of this Court dated 29 March 2019 by which

the EAC was directed to revisit the EC conditions, the Government of Goa sought

the assistance of EIL which was the author of the EIA report in presenting its

case before the EAC. Hence, from the facts which have been set-forth before the

Court by the learned Attorney General, it becomes clear that EIL was appointed

as an independent engineer for the project only after the EC had been granted on

28 October 2015 and in a competitive tendering process. The role of the

independent engineer is to supervise the construction of the airport in accordance

with the ICAO standards. Certification and licensing of the airport is in the domain

of the Director General of Civil Aviation15 of the Government of India. Compliance

with environmental conditions contained in the EC is monitored by the regional

office of the MoEF-CC at Bengaluru. Moreover, there is merit in the submission

which was urged by Ms ANS Nadkarni, learned Additional Solicitor General

appearing for the MoEF-CC that the decision in regard to the grant of an EC rests

with MoEF-CC. The fact that EIL whose services were engaged as an EIA

consultant was subsequently appointed as an independent engineer after the

initial grant of an EC will not result in the invalidation of the EC.

conserve, protect and rejuvenate the ecology in the Western Ghats. The HLWG,

with the aid of the National Remote Sensing Centre16 developed a scientific and

objective methodology for identifying ESAs in the Western Ghats. In doing so, the

HLWG bore in mind diverse parameters including forest and vegetation types,

natural and cultural landscapes, forest fragmentation, biological richness, village

boundaries, population density, protected areas, wildlife corridors and world

heritage sites among other considerations. Ten ESAs falling within the study area

have been disclosed in the report along with mitigation measures. It was urged

that upon detailed discussion, it was found that the impact on these ESAs, as a

result of the project, would be minimal. The area where the project site is located,

it was urged, has not been identified as an ESA. The nearest village identified in

the State of Maharashtra – Galel – is at an aerial distance of 4.1 km from the

boundary of the project site. Mr Nadkarni rebutted the contention that the project

would impinge upon wildlife corridors. The nearest identified corridor, it was

submitted, is on the boundary of the States of Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra

which is far away from the project site.

Chapter III of the report analyses the impact of climate change on the ecology of

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">             “HLWG, in the absence of geologically and gemorphologically
             sound criteria in demarcating WG, decided to adopt the
             criteria followed by the Western Ghats Development
             Programme of Planning Commission which defined WG in
             terms of geology conceptually, but has taken altitude as the
             criterion for identification of talukas/blocks under Western
             Ghats Development Programme of Planning Commission as
             recommended by High Level Committee, because the Ghats
             are usually 760-915 m high. All those talukas/blocks at 600 m

             criterion has geological connotation – that at 600 m on the

31      Adverting to the biodiversity of the Western Ghats, the report notes:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_47">              “The Western Ghats has unique taxonomic hierarchies,
              remnant ecosystems and strong endemic associations. The

        1000 feet above ground will extend typically around 3 km from departure

        or, in the case of arrivals 6 km from touchdown. Since the airport site is at

38     The criticism that the EAC has conflated the issue of the felling of trees

submissions placed before this Court by Mr ANS Nadkarni, learned Additional

Solicitor General appearing for MoEF-CC. It has been submitted that:

<p id="p_100">(ii)   The EAC took due cognizance of the presence of forest land and also

        and does not restrict the movement of fauna. The airport site is

        predominantly a plateau and the forest cover is not contiguous to it. With a

        boundary wall surrounding the airport, there is no possibility of animals

        being endangered by entry into the project site;

        Besides this, another 2,50,000 trees are to be planted and monitored by

        the DGCA. The EAC has mandated the plantation of native species and

        fruit bearing saplings to enable residents depending on agriculture to

        derive economic benefits while at the same time preserving the biological

        environment to birds.

39      MoEF-CC has also responded to the criticism against the approach

adopted by the EAC in regard to avi-faunal studies and data. According to the

submission, the project proponent presented data drawn from the ZSI and other

sources. It has been submitted that the appellant while referring to the fauna

species from ZSI data has referred to “external distribution” in most cases.

However, ZSI data categorically mentions the “sighting area/localities” where

specific species have been actually sighted; all these locations are notably far

away from the project site. Moreover, as an example, it has been submitted that

the appellant in adverting to the sighting of leopards in Goa and Maharashtra did

not limit the submissions to the study area but to the entire territory of the States

of Maharashtra and Goa. ZSI studies on the fauna of Maharashtra records

leopard sightings in places like the Melghat Tiger Reserve, Tadoba-Andhari Tiger

Reserve, Pench National Park, Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Bhimashankar

Wildlife Sanctuary, and the Phansad Wildlife Sanctuary among others. None of

these sites fall within the study area. Similarly, the ZSI publication on fauna of

Goa records sightings of leopards in places like Molem National Park, Cotigao

Wildlife Sanctuary and Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary, not of which fall within the

study area. Moreover, in the Wildlife Institute of India17 report (2010), the

presence of tigers has been recorded in Molem Wildlife Sanctuary and in the

forests of Ponda and Sanguen Tehsil which are not within a 10 km radius of

proposed Mopa airport. Relevant data drawn from the WII and the Wildlife Trust

of India (2017) on the presence of tigers and elephants has been relied upon.


40         The submission which has been urged on behalf of MoEF-CC is that the

distance of the ESA/ESZ is a prime factor in determining the likely impact of the

project activities on the environment. On examination by the EAC, it has been

found that neither the project site nor the villages under the study area fall in any

ESZ. Moreover, of the 10 ESA villages in Maharashtra falling within a 10 km.

radius of the project site, the nearest village (Galel) is about 4.1 kms from the

boundary of the project and is located in the northern direction. The runway of the

proposed airport has an east-west orientation. Beyond the runway of 3.75 km.,

flight operations at an altitude of about 1000 feet would have a minimally adverse

impact on the flora and fauna surrounding the airport. Moreover, the common

faunal species would primarily be restricted to the forest areas. The proposed

airport site is not home to any of these species. It was, in this context that the

EAC has observed that the project site does not fragment any forest area. The

mitigation measures proposed in the EC conditions as well as the NGT directions

stipulate measures for minimizing the impact on biodiversity. The project

proponent would be bound to follow DGCA and ICAO aircraft strike hazard

management guidelines including the setting up of an Airfield Environment

Management Committee. Moreover, it has been submitted that EIL had stated

the migration status of various species of birds in the EIA report. This information

was updated with regard to the migratory status of additional fauna found in the

study area in supplementary Form 1. However, no set routes of flyways were

observed near the airport site. DGCA has published the National Aviation Safety

Plan 2018-2020 emphasizing avi-faunal and wildlife management in airports.

MoEF-CC has annexed to its submissions, DGCA circulars/directions on the

following aspects which would have to be implemented by the concessionaire:

41    In regard to the concerns which emerged during the course of the public

consultation, it has been submitted by MoEF-CC that the updated report

submitted by the project proponent took into account these concerns which

primarily are comprised within two categories (environment and livelihood). The

project proponent made a detailed presentation before the EAC on these

concerns and the action plans were discussed in the EAC meeting. The EAC has

stipulated the implementation of the environment management plan for

addressing the concerns which were raised during the course of the public

hearing. According to the Airport Guidance Manual, the concerns of the public

which were expressed during public consultation must be addressed by the

applicant either through an updated EIA and EMP or through a supplementary

report. The project proponent has done so through updated information.


42    During the course of the judgment which was rendered by this Court on 29

March 2019, certain flaws were noticed in the process leading up to the grant of

an EC on 28 October 2015. The project proponent had not complied with its

obligation to make a full disclosure of information on material aspects of the

environment in Form 1 as an intrinsic part of the EIA process. This Court

specifically recorded its concerns on vital aspects which had not been adequately

addressed by the EAC. Having noticed the flaws in the process and the

deficiencies in the decision making process of the EAC, the Court directed the

EAC to revisit the recommendations made by it for the grant of an EC including

the conditions which it had formulated, having regard to the specific concerns

which were highlighted in the judgment. Thereafter if the EAC were to allow the

construction to proceed, it was directed to impose additional conditions to protect

the terrestrial eco-systems. The EAC was under a specific mandate to lay down

conditions pertaining to air, water, noise, land and the biological and socio-

economic environment. During the course of this judgment, we have traced the

process as it evolved before the EAC following the earlier directions of this Court.

The net result of the process is that the concessionaire has been subjected to a

slew of mitigatory conditions: 53 in the original EC, 16 at the behest of NGT and

40 imposed by the EAC in the second round. On a reading of the process leading

upto the present proceeding, it cannot be said that the EAC has, in its appraisal

process, ignored the concerns which were highlighted by this Court. Ms Anitha

Shenoy, learned Senior Counsel, as we have noted earlier, focursed her

submissions on four areas namely (i) Forests; (ii) ESAs; (iii) Western Ghats; and

</p><p id="p_111">(iv) Flora and Fauna. The EAC has adequately addressed these concerns and

laid down additional conditions to ensure the adequate protection of the

environment.

<p id="p_112">
43    The Airport Guidance Manual published by MoEF in February 2010

contains significant points for guidance having a bearing on the controversy

which has been raised in the present case. In relation to the study area, the

Manual states:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_50">             “Primary data through measurements and field surveys; and
             secondary data from secondary sources are to be collected in
             the study area within 10 km radius from Aerodrome
             Reference Point (ARP). Primary data should cover one
             season other than monsoon and secondary data is to cover
             one full year. The basis for selection of these criteria is that
             the aircraft gains a height of 1000ft in this area below which
             noise and air pollution are generated maximum during its take
             off stage. Secondary data should be collected within 15 km
             aerial distance for the parameters as specifically mentioned at

             should be furnished. Similarly the proposed locations of
             monitoring stations of water, air, soil and noise etc should be
             shown on the study area map.”




The study area in other words, comprises of a radial distance of 10 kms. from the

Aerodrome Reference Point. The Manual indicates that the basis for selection of

the criteria is that an aircraft gains a height of 1000 feet in this area and the

maximum impact of noise and air pollution is generated during the takeoff stage.

<p id="p_113">The Aircraft Guidance Manual also states that:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_51">             “Aircraft engines produce emissions that are similar to other
             emissions resulting from any oil based fuel combustion.</blockquote><p id="p_114">
</p><p id="p_115">             These, like any exhaust emissions, can affect local air quality
             at ground level. It is emissions from aircraft below 1,000ft,
             above the ground (typically around 3km from departure or, for
             arrivals, around 6km from touchdown) that are chiefly
             involved in influencing local air quality.”



This is again emphasized in the following extract:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_52">             “Ambient Air Quality (AAQ) is important for the airport
             projects. The significance of aviation's impact on air quality
             will vary depending on many other factors such as,
             background pollution levels, other sources of pollution,
             weather and proximity of residential areas.

                  The local air quality relevant emissions attributed to aircraft
                  operations at airports are oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon
                  monoxide (CO), Unburnt hydrocarbons (NMHC and VOCs),
                  sulphur dioxide(SO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5).

                   Aircraft engines, auxiliary power units, apron vehicles, de-
                  icing, and apron spillages of fuel and chemicals emit these
                  pollutants. Local factors influence          the   significance of
                  individual emissions for each airport, but often NOx is by far
                  the most abundant and is considered the most significant
                  pollutant from an air quality stand point.

                  considering the mobile source of emission such as aircraft.”




44        A comprehensive process has been followed by the EAC bearing in mind

the requirements of the Airport Guidance Manual. The EAC took note of the

presence of reserved forests and of ESAs in the Western Ghats and deliberated

on the impact of the construction and operation of the proposed airport on flora or

fauna, hydrological systems and climatic variations. The process which has been

adopted by the EAC and its ultimate conclusions must be scrutinized, in the

course of judicial review, in the context of the limitations which are attached to the

court conducting a merits based review. In Lafarge Umiam Mining Private

Limited v Union of India,18 an application was made under the 1994 EIA

notification for the grant of an EC to a proposed limestone mining project at

Nongtrai Village, East Khasi Hills District Meghalaya. EC was granted for the

project in 2001. A three judge Bench of this Court rejected the challenge and

upheld the grant of the EC for the proposed project. Chief Justice S H Kapadia,

speaking for the Court, formulated the standard of judicial review which must be

applied in cases relating to the environment in the following terms:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_54">             “In the circumstances, barring exceptions, decisions relating
             to utilisation of natural resources have to be tested on the
             anvil of the well-recognised principles of judicial review. Have
             all the relevant factors been taken into account? Have any
             extraneous factors influenced the decision? Is the decision
             strictly in accordance with the legislative policy underlying the
             law (if any) that governs the field? Is the decision consistent
             with the principles of sustainable development in the sense
             that has the decision-maker taken into account the said
             principle and, on the basis of relevant considerations, arrived
             at a balanced decision? Thus, the Court should review the
             decision-making process to ensure that the decision of MoEF
             is fair and fully informed, based on the correct principles, and
             free from any bias or restraint.”



The EAC has accounted for the relevant factors outlined by this Court in its

previous judgment in the assessment leading to the grant of the EC.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_118">45    The evaluation of merits is a matter which primarily rests with an expert

authority. The court can certainly supervise procedural compliance and ensure

that all necessary inputs which are required to be factored into the decision-

making process have been duly borne in mind. Once this has been done, the

court must be circumspect in micro-managing the decision-making process by

the EAC by substituting its own opinion for that of the EAC. Undoubtedly, no

process can be perfect or free from studied criticism. Ms Anitha Shenoy, learned

Senior Counsel has attempted to perform such an exercise when she submitted

that the collection of primary faunal data from a nearby village and secondary

data from ZSI sources was not an adequate means of dealing with the concerns

expressed by this Court. In assessing these criticisms, we must equally be

cognizant of the fact that by the judgment of this Court dated 29 March 2019, the

EAC was required to carry out the exercise within a period of one month from the

receipt of the order of this Court. The Court did not quash the EC but directed

that   it      should    remain     under    suspension      until   the   EAC   revisited   its

recommendations in the light of the concerns which were expressed by this

Court. Having assessed the process which took place following the judgment of

this Court and the outcome, it would be difficult for this Court to hold that it fails to

meet the standards which the court applies in the course of judicial review in

environmental matters.

II.   Conditions imposed by the NGT in its order dated 21 August 2018
         A. AIR ENVIRONMENT

</p><p id="p_174">         1.        Total Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM),
         Respirable Particulate Matter (RPM) during construction
         phase and un-burnet and Hydro Carbons (HC), Lead (Pb),
         CO2, SO2, CO2, SOOT and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)
         during operation phase are going to be major pollutants in
         this kind of project, Besides, fugitive emissions of Volatile
         Organic Compounds (VOC) during fuel handling can be
         another issue for ambient air environment. The provision
         of only 6 (six) Air Quality Monitoring Stations is
         inadequate as sampling duration has been given as „twice
         a week, 4 weeks in a season as per CPCB standards for
         NAAQM, 1994. It would be appropriate if the Project
         Proponent establishes real time online continuous Air
         Quality Monitoring Station also which is connected to
         CPCB server and capable of monitoring all relevant and
         critical parameters and mitigation measures taken.
</p><p id="p_175">         2.        Although all parameters w.r.t. ambient air
         parameters have been found to be within limits for all 6
         (six) locations monitored, we feel for the purpose of
         giving/depicting holistic picture with regard to ambient air
         in the area, at least 3 (three) more locations falling in the
         State of Maharashtra be also monitored and documented.

         B. WATER ENVIRONMENT
</p><p id="p_176">         1.       Only two number of Rain Water Harvesting pits
         have been provided which we feel are not adequate and
         there is a need to place other pits at such locations as to
         capture all the excess drainage for water-recharge.
</p><p id="p_177">         2.      More frequent Water Quality Monitoring i.e.once
         every month may be carried out by Project Proponent at
         bore wells and STP discharge plants instead of 4 (four)
         times in a year as proposed.

</p><p id="p_179">         1.       It has been proposed that ambient noise levels
         shall be monitored around the premises of airport, near
         DG sets and at main entrance/boundary of airport once a
         week at 7 (seven) locations which we feel are inadequate.
         Besides these, continuous monitoring of occupational
         noise exposure limits in such industrial environments
         would be appropriate with audible or visual alarm output
         capability.

within limits at 9 (nine) locations monitored, we feel for the
purpose of giving/depicting holistic picture with regard to
ambient noise levels in the area, at least 3 (three) more
locations falling in the State of Maharashtra be also
monitored and documented.
</p>
<p id="p_183">D. LAND ENVIRONMENT
</p><p id="p_184">1.       There is a potential for impact on soil quality due
to project related spills and leaks of fuel and chemicals
and uncontrolled disposal of wastes and waste water.
Adequate care be taken to avoid spills and leaks of
hazardous substances and all project related wastes.
Littering on sites and beyond the sites needs to be
adequately prevented and controlled.

<p id="p_186">3. Soil conservation and stabilization measures needs to
be undertaken by deploying both mechanical and bio-
engineering methods.

locations in the same vicinity by using appropriate
mechanical devices which are available these days.

</p><p id="p_189">2. Efforts be made to plant indigenous species which are
tall in size rather than small saplings.

<p id="p_190">3.       Concerns have been raised by appellants with
regard to plant species „Dipcadi concanense‟ which has
been claimed to be a threatened plant. This claim of the
appellants have been negated by the respondent by
producing a documentation of Botanical Survey of India,
Western Regional Centre, Pune, Maharashtra titled as „A

47       We have also taken note of the assurance which has been tendered on

behalf of the concessionaire that it will adopt a Zero Carbon Programme both in

the construction and operational phases of the airport. We accept the undertaking

of the concessionaire and issue a direction for compliance.




48       The earlier judgment of this Court highlighted numerous deficiencies by the

project proponent leading to the grant of the EC. This Court highlighted numerous

concerns including the preservation of forests, the existence of ESAs with their

attendant features and the impact of the proposed project on natural water

channels. The Court also noted the abject failure of the project proponent to

provide complete information on the existence of reserved forests. In the

proceedings that followed the judgment of this Court, the project proponent

sought to remedy its failure by taking into account additional information on

significant aspects of the environment. In the process leading to the grant of the

EC as well as the lifting of its suspension by this Court, numerous mitigatory

conditions have been imposed on the project proponent. We deem it appropriate

to ensure the oversight of the project by a specialized body to ensure compliance

with the directions cumulatively issued by this Court. We direct the National

Environmental Engineering Research Institute19 to be appointed to oversee

compliance with the directions cumulatively issued by this Court. The project

proponent shall bear the costs, expenses and fees of NEERI.
