                 Writ Petition No. 15401 / 2011
1.3.2013:
       Shri Subodh Kathar, learned counsel for the petitioner.
       Shri Sanjeev Kumar Singh, learned Panel Lawyer for
respondent Nos.1, 2, 4, 5 &amp; 6.</pre>
<p id="p_1">       Shri Pushpendra Kaurav, leaned Additional Advocate
General with Shri Kamlesh Dwivedi, learned counsel for
respondent No.3.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       Petitioner has established a Rice Mill in Ward No.8
Majholi, Tehsil and District Jabalpur. Petitioner claims to be a
proprietor of said rice mill running in the name and style of
M/s. Jati Rice Mill. Challenging the impugned order passed by
the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Sihora, District Jabalpur,
respondent No.6, directing the petitioner to close the rice mill
and is prohibiting the petitioner from carrying out the activities
of rice mill, this writ petition has been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.     It is stated on behalf of the petitioner that the action has
been taken behind his back without hearing him, without notice
to him. It is averred that respondent No.7 has filed a Public
Interest Litigation before this Court being W.P. No.4649/2010
(PIL) and vide order Annexure P-1 dated 10.5.2010, the writ
petition was disposed of with a direction to the Collector
Jabalpur to consider and decide the representation of
respondent No.7 and if required take steps for cancelling of
license after hearing all concerned and conducting enquiry.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                  2</span>


<p id="p_4">Inter alia contending that without conducting any enquiry,
without hearing him, the license has been cancelled, the writ
petition was filed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.    The Pollution control Board, Regional Director, is also
impleaded as respondent No.3 and Shri Pushpendra Kaurav,
Additional Advocate General, assisted by Shri Kamlesh
Dwivedi, learned counsel appears for the said respondent and
has filed detailed reply. From the reply filed by respondent
No.3 it is seen that for the purpose of establishing of rice mill
certain circulars and provisions with regard to Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 are applicable.
It is pointed out by Shri Kamlesh Dwivedi that before
establishment of the Rice Mill petitioner did not get approval
and sanction of the Pollution Control Board and, therefore, on
complaint received, the rice-mill of the petitioner was
investigated and it was found that it is creating pollution in the
area in question wherein school and other residential houses are
situated and, therefore, after issuing notice to petitioner
impugned action is taken. It is also stated that the petitioner has
remedy of filing appeal under the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_3">Green Tribunal Act</a>.
Accordingly, on such consideration respondent No.3 objects to
the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.    Shri Subodh Kathar, learned counsel submits that even
the Pollution Control Board did not heard the petitioner and did
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                  3</span>


not gave adequate time or opportunity to the petitioner to make
good the defects, if any, and review the same instead cancel the
license.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.    Having heard learned counsel for the parties and taking
note of averments made by respondent No.3 in the return it is
clear that for establishing and running rice mill in question
certain statutory provisions with regard to provisions of Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 are to be
applied. The statutory provisions contemplate establishment of
rice mill in a manner that it does not create pollution either of
the air in the surrounding area or water and, therefore, rice mill
has to be established after due approval and sanction of the
Pollution Control Board. In this case the rice mill is established
without due approval and sanction of the said Board and,
therefore, it is not proper for this Court to grant permission to
the petitioner to carry out functioning of rice mill in the absence
of proper compliance being made with regard to <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Prevention of
Pollution Control Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.    However, as petitioner has already established rice mill,
interest of justice requires that opportunity should be granted to
him to make good the default, if any, in the matter of
complying with the statutory requirement with regard to air and
water pollution.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                               4</span>


<p id="p_9">7.     Keeping in view the aforesaid, it is directed that on
petitioner's filing an appropriate application in accordance to
statutory requirement before respondent No.3 and on his
complying with such other requirement as is contemplated
under law, his claim for grant of sanction for establishing and
running the present rice mill shall be considered by respondent
No.3 and the decision taken with regard to grant of permission
or otherwise, within a period of three months from the date of
receipt of certified copy of this order along with other
particulars.
</p>
<p id="p_10">8.     If on such enquiry conducted under the statutory
provisions respondent No.3 is convinced that permission can be
granted, petitioner can run the rice mill after necessary
permission has been granted, else respondent No.3 shall be at
liberty to pass an appropriate speaking order.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.     With the aforesaid this petition is allowed and disposed
of.
</p>
<p id="p_12">       Certified copy as per rules.
</p><p id="p_13">                                       (Rajendra Menon)
