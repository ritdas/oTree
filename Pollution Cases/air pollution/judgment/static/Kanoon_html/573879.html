</pre><p id="p_1">Hon.Arun Tandon,J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      Repeatedly the Additional Advocate General on the instructions of the
officers, has been informing the Court that because of acute shortage of water at
Narora Barrage adequate quantity of water is not being released so as to ensure
that the river down stream till Allahabad has reasonable quantity and quality of
water. The Court is sorry to note that the state respondents have deliberately not
disclosed that the main stream of river Ganges enters into the State of Uttar
Pradesh in the district of Bijnore; the water is diverted by canals even before it
reaches Narora Barrage. The result is that the main stream at Allahabad has
been rendered a mere 'Nala'. We have been informed that the water level at the
canals is near the danger mark. We feel that a serious issue has arisen as to
upto what extent the State can draw water from the main and normal stream of
river Ganges to feed the canals. The issues are:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             (a) Can the State draw unlimited quantity of water from a river
             even to the extent of rendering its main stream a dry zone?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             (b) Can the State because of drawl of water from upper portion
             of river Ganges render its quantity or quality of water completely
             unfit for human use even for bathing purposes?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             (c) Can the natural resources like river Ganges be permitted to
             be completely destroyed by drawing unlimited quantity of water
             for irrigation purposes?</blockquote>

<p id="p_3">      Let a personal affidavit by the Chief Secretary of the State be filed
explaining the stand of the State on the said three legal issues. He will also
indicate as to how the level of the water is recorded in various districts after
examining the Irrigation Manual of the State of U.P. and what is the minimum
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                     2</span>

quantity of water required to maintain the main stream of river Ganges
downstream.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       The Chief Secretary shall also file a plan depicting the main stream of the
river Ganges as it flows through the State of Uttar Pradesh, the number of canals
constructed thereon and the total quantity of water drawn from the main stream
for various canals.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       In the matter of shifting of tanneries, the Additional Advocate General
submitted that State has now changed its plan and wants to permit reopening of
the tanneries at Kanpur. He stated that the STP of 36 MLD, which has been
established, would be exclusively earmarked for the treatment of the discharge
from the tanneries. The stand so taken is contrary to what was stated in earlier
affidavits of the State.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       At present the total discharge of dirty water in Kanpur is 409 MLD and the
treating capacity of STPs at Kanpur is only 106 MLD, yet the State wants to
suggest that STP of 36 MLD shall be exclusively used for the purposes of
treatment of discharge from tanneries meaning thereby Kanpur Nagar will
continue to discharge 303 MLD untreated sewage water in the river Ganges.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       As early as on 23rd January, 2006 a Division Bench of this Court passed
following order:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">              "We, therefore, direct the Chief Secretary of the State of Uttar
              Pradesh to file a detailed counter affidavit disclosing the steps
              taken and also the proposed steps to be taken by the State
              Government for permanent solution. The Member Secretary of
              the U.P. State Pollution Control Board shall also file an affidavit
              on behalf of respondent no.5 giving details regarding steps
              taken by the U.P. State Pollution Control Board for prevention
              and control of pollution in holy river Ganga."</blockquote>

<p id="p_8">       We cannot approve of the scheme as suggested for opening of the
tanneries by the State Government. The Chief Secretary of the State of U.P. must
ensure immediate shifting of the tanneries and the STP at Kanpur shall be
utilised for treatment of the sewage water as is being done till date.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       The Chief Secretary must also visit the city of Allahabad himself for
overseeing the laying of the sewer lines as well as the state of the roads, which
have been dug for laying down the sewer to be connected with the new STP to
be established. The Court has been informed today by the Additional Advocate
General that the work of repairing of the roads after sewer pipeline is laid by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                    3</span>

contractor is to be done by the Nagar Nigam and the Public Works Department.
Learned counsel for the Nagar Nigam submits that the roads cannot be repaired
as rainy season is forthcoming and the repairing shall be done only after the
rains when dug out mud settles down.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       The contention so raised does not appeal to us. The roads for laying down
the sewage pipeline have been dug in the City of Allahabad for last more than
four months and the authorities are waiting for the rainy season to be over before
repairing the road, only to avoid the manual filling of the dug portion of the road.
The Court has also been informed that the earth which was dug out for laying the
pipes has been removed by the contractor.
</p>
<p id="p_11">       The Chief Secretary shall examine as to under which authority the earth
has been removed by the contractor, with reference to the contract entered, for
the purpose he shall indicate as to who is responsible for the state of affairs and
as to what appropriate action is to be taken in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_12">       The Defence Department has been offered State land i.e., Plot Nos.614
and 615, total area 1055.60 square metres situate at Mehdauri, Allahabad, which
is adjoining cantonment area in lieu of land provided at Mori Gate. Let the
competent Military authority examine the offer and if the land is acceptable they
may give their consent in writing. The competent Military authority shall, however,
hand over the possession of the land at Mori Gate for establishment of the
pumping station immediately as we have been assured on behalf of the State
that it shall provide equivalent land, as asked for by the defence authority,
adjoining any existing cantonment area. The competent Military authority may file
an affidavit in respect of suitability of the land now offered by the next date.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       The competent defence authority shall also file an affidavit stating as to
when the STP at Fort New Cantt. and Old Cantt. shall be established and made
operational, separate dates for the purpose may be indicated.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       The Court has been informed that I.I.T., Kanpur has established its own
STP and the discharge of used water is up to the standard prescribed. Further
notices have been issued by the U.P. Pollution Control Board to the H.R.I.,
Allahabad, B.H.U., Varanasi, Allahabad University, Allahabad and other such
institutions. In case no reply is received, appropriate action in accordance with
the provisions of the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Pollution Act</a> shall be taken.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       The U.P. Pollution Control Board shall file an affidavit disclosing the test
report of the water as available in river Ganges at Allahabad on date.
</p>
<p id="p_16">       Impleadment application filed today is allowed. Let M/s VIRCL
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                                  4</span>

Infrastructure &amp; Project Limited be impleaded as respondent No.18. Learned
Standing Counsel may inform the newly impleaded respondent about the
proceedings pending before this Court. A copy of the application filed today may
also be forwarded to the newly impleaded respondent so that the said
respondent may file its affidavit disclosing the progress report of sewer work and
establishment of STP.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      This Court by its order dated 26.3.2010 had permitted the three tanneries;
M/s Renates Eastern Export Jajmau, Kanpur, M/s Imperial Leather Finishers Pvt.
Ltd. Jajmau, Kanpur and M/s Salik Leather Finishers Jajmau, Kanpur to operate
for a period of four weeks so as to unable the U.P .Pollution Control Board to
monitor their functioning by drawing samples of the discharge. In the affidavit
filed on behalf of U.P. Pollution Control Board, it has been submitted that
samples of the effluent were drawn. The discharge from M/s Renates Eastern
Export Jajmau, Kanpur and M/s Salik Leather Finishers Jajmau, Kanpur satisfies
the norms. In view of the aforesaid stand taken by the U.P. Pollution Control
Board, it may permit the running of the aforesaid tanneries subject to regular
inspection and monitoring of the discharge. In respect of the third tannery M/s
Imperial Leather Finishers, the Pollution Board may submit a fresh report by the
next date.
</p>
<p id="p_18">   Apart from the above, it has been stated in paragraph 20 of the affidavit of the
U.P. Pollution Control Board that 12 tanneries submitted applications that they
have removed their shortcomings and may be inspected. Out of the 12, five
have removed their short comings as per the inspection report of the U.P.
Pollution Control Board. These five tanneries are M/s Tanners Company, 91A,
Wazidpur, Jajmau, Kanpur, M/s New Era International, 60C, Gajjupurwa, Jajmau,
Kanpur, M/s Roshan Leather Industry, 10, Gajjupurwa, Jajmau, Kanpur,
Ms.Sartaj Tanners, Wazidpur, Jajmau, Kanpur, and M/s Leather Tan ( Faiyaz
Tanners), D.T.S.Road,Jajmau, Kanpur. The aforesaid five tanneries may be
permitted by the Pollution Control Board to become operational subject to
continuous monitoring and inspection by the Pollution Control Board and subject
to the necessary report being filed by the next date.
</p><p id="p_19">     M/s. Upper India Tannery Pvt. Ltd, have submitted an application that they
will not adopt wet process and will operate the dry process only, let the Tannery
file a proper affidavit and undertaking before the U.P. Pollution Control Board
who may take appropriate action thereon.
</p><p id="p_20">     U.P. Pollution Control Board may further inspect M/s Crown tanneries and
submit a report by the next date. We however make it clear that the permission to
be granted to U.P. Pollution Control Board is only conditional subject to review
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                                        5</span>

and monitoring from time to time and if any deficiency/shortcoming is found, it
shall be open to the U.P. Pollution Control Board to close the tannery
immediately.
</p><p id="p_21">      We also direct the respondent State authority to file an affidavit disclosing
various steps taken in pursuance of our directions issued from time to time in this
Public Interest Litigation and what are the proposed steps in that regard.
</p><p id="p_22">          After having heard learned counsel for the parties and perusing the record,
we have an impression that various departments of the State Government have
not been coordinating amongst themselves resulting in slow progress in the
matter and execution of projects. The Chief Secretary of the State has to
intervene and take the command.
</p><p id="p_23">      We hope and trust that the Chief Secretary of the State shall monitor the
progress and compliance of the orders passed earlier in the matter. The pollution
in the river Ganges is increasing alarmingly day by day, which effects the life of
the common man of the State at large. The magnitude of the pollution in the river
Ganges and its effect are not only being felt by the people of the State and
country alone but by the international community as a whole. We may refer to an
article in the magazine 'Time' ( July, 2010), where it has been stated as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                           " From the Himalayas to the plains, rampant growth is
                        turning the Ganges into a toxic sewer. It is not too late to
                        put things right."</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">          We are of the view that serious efforts by the State Government can still
restore the river Ganges to its earlier glory. We have been told that in other
countries also rivers had been facing same problems. Their Governments have
taken appropriate steps and the pollutants have been removed. Reference be
had to the case of river Thames in U.K. It is for the Chief Secretary to assist the
Court by his presence in the matter by effective and valuable suggestions and
contributions towards the pious project which is to be implemented for cleaning
the Ganges.
</p><p id="p_25">          Let affidavits be filed within three weeks.
</p><p id="p_26">          List on 13th August, 2010, on which date we request the Advocate General
and the Chief Secretary of the State of U.P. to appear and assist the Court in the
matter.
</p><p id="p_27">          Let a copy of this order be supplied to the learned Standing counsel by the
office.
