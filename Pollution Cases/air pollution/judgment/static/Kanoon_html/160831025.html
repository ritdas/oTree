       Keonjhar, Sundergarh and Mayurbhanj in Odisha have rapaciously mined

       iron ore and manganese ore, apparently destroyed the environment and

       forests and perhaps caused untold misery to the tribals in the area. However,

       to be fair to the lessees, they did the detail steps taken to ameliorate the

       hardships of the tribals, but it appears to us that their contribution is perhaps

       not more than a drop in the ocean – also too little, too late.

</p><p id="p_8">      3.     The applications were taken up for consideration on 6 th November,

      2009 when notice was issued to the Central Empowered Committee (for

      short ‘the CEC’) to file its report/response within six weeks.
</p><p id="p_9">      4.     On 26th April, 2010 the CEC submitted an interim report which was

      noted by this Court and taken on record. The report was of a general nature

      but contained quite a few recommendations. Some of the recommendations

      presently relevant are as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                   “(b)   Even otherwise the Rule 24-A(6), MCR, 1960 does not
                          authorize the lessee to operate a mine without the statutory
                          clearances/approvals. Therefore, in respect of a mine covered
                          under the ‘deemed extension’ clause, the mining operations
                          should be permitted to be undertaken in the non forest area of
                          the mining lease only if (i) it has the requisite environmental
                          clearance; (ii) it has the consent to operate from the State
                          Pollution Control Board under the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">Water Act</a>s; (iii)
                          Mining Plan is duly approved by the competent authority;
                          and (iv) the NPV for the entire forest falling within the
                          mining lease is deposited in the Compensatory Afforestation
                          Fund.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                          The mining in the forest land included in the mining lease
                          should be permissible only if, in addition to the above, the
                          approval under the FC Act/TWP has been obtained;</blockquote><p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">                   (c)    No forest land can be leased/assigned without first obtaining
                          the approval under the FC Act. Therefore, the forest area
                          approved under the FC Act should not be lesser than the total
                          forest area included in the mining leases approved under the
                          <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_5">MMDR Act</a>, 1957. Both necessarily have to be the same. In
                          view of the above, this Hon’ble Court while permitting grant
                          of Temporary Working Permission to the mines in Orissa and
                          Goa has made it one of the pre-conditions that the NPV will
                          be paid for the entire forest area included in the mining

                          should be directed to pay the NPV for the entire forest area,
                          included in the mining lease;
</p>
<p id="p_12">                   (d)    In Orissa, substantial areas included in the mining leases as
                          non forest land have subsequently been identified as DLC
                          forest (deemed forest/forest like areas) by the Expert
                          Committee constituted by the State Government pursuant to
                          this Hon’ble Court’s order dated 12.12.1996.            While
                          processing and/or approving the proposals under the FC Act
                          in many cases such areas have been treated as non-forest land.
                          It is recommended that (i) the NPV for the entire DLC area
                          included in the mining lease, after deducting the NPV already
                          paid, should be deposited by the concerned lease holder and
</p><p id="p_13">                          (ii) the mining operations in the unbroken DLC land (virgin
                          land) should be permissible only if the permission under the
                          FC Act has been obtained/is obtained for such area. Keeping
                          in view the peculiar circumstances as was existing in Orissa
                          and subject to the above, the mining operations in the broken
                          DLC land may be allowed to be continued provided the other
                          statutory requirements and Rules are otherwise being
                          complied with.”

      The report concluded by recording as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                   “ a)   an attempt has been made for the first time by the CEC to
                          comply and analyse the status of all the mining leases in a

                           statutory provisions, result in recovery of additional amount
                           towards the NPV etc. running into hundreds of crores of
                           rupees. It would be appropriate that a part of this additional
                           amount, say 50% is used through a SPV for undertaking
                           specific tribal welfare and area development works so as to
                           ensure inclusive growth of the mineral bearing areas. The
                           CEC proposes to file detailed schemes in this regard for
                           seeking permission of this Hon’ble Court provided the State

                           proposed above.”

      The significance of the second conclusion will be discussed by us a little

      later.

      have been accepted and implemented by the State of Odisha.

      Report of the Central Empowered Committee

</p><p id="p_29">      10.    The CEC gave its final report on 25 th April, 2014 which was

      considered by this Court and a detailed interim order was passed on 16 th

      May, 2014.2 The sum and substance of the final report dated 25th April, 2014

      and the interim order is that in the districts of Odisha that we are concerned

      with, namely, Keonjhar, Sundergarh and Mayurbhanj, the total number of

      leases granted for mining iron and manganese ore are 187. Of these, 102

      lease holders did not have requisite environmental clearance (under the

      <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_13">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986) or approval under the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_14">Forest

      (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980 or approved mining plan and/or Consent to

      Operate under the provisions of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Control of

      Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 or the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

      1981. This Court directed that mining operations in these 102 mining leases

      shall remain suspended but it will be open to such lease holders to move the

      concerned authorities for necessary clearances, approvals or consents and

      “as and when the mining lessees are able to obtain all the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">Page 9 of 114</span>
      clearances/approvals/consent they may move this Court for modification of

      this interim order in relation to their cases.”

</p><p id="p_30">      11.    This Court also found that 29 out of 187 mining leases had been

      determined or rejected or had lapsed. It was directed that mining operations

      in these 29 mining leases will also remain suspended but it would be open to

      all these concerned lessees to move the authorities for necessary relief and as

      and when they get the appropriate relief, they could move this Court for

      modification of the interim order.
</p>
<p id="p_31">      12.   This Court also found that 53 iron ore/manganese ore mining leases

      were operational and that they had necessary approvals under the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_18">Forest

      (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980, consent to operate granted by the Odisha State

      Pollution Control Board and also approved mining plans. (There is no

      specific mention about environmental clearance). In addition 3 mining leases

      were located in forest as well as non-forest land, but mining operations were

      being conducted in non-forest areas of the mining lease as the lease holders

      did not have approvals under the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_19">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980.

      Therefore a total of 56 iron ore/manganese ore mining leases were operating

      in the State of Odisha.
</p>
<p id="p_32">      13. As far as the break-up of the 56 operational mining leases is concerned,

      it was found that 14 mining leases were operating on first renewal basis in

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">Page 10 of 114</span>

      Act</a>’) read with Rule 24-A(6) of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 (for

      short ‘the MCR’) and 16 mining leases were operating since lease deeds for

      grant of renewal had been executed in their favour. The remaining 26 mining

      leases were operating on second and subsequent renewal basis with the

      renewal applications pending a final decision with the State Government.

</p><p id="p_33">      14.    In respect of the 14 first renewal mining leases, this Court permitted

      them to continue their operations for the time being in view of the deemed

      renewal provisions. This Court also permitted 16 mining leases to continue

      to operate since they had lease deeds executed in their favour. With regard to

      the remaining 26 mining leases operating on second and subsequent renewal

      applications, this Court drew attention to the decision rendered on 21 st April,

      2014 in <a href="/doc/180993556/" id="a_23">Goa Foundation v. Union of India3</a> wherein it was held that the

      provision for a second or subsequent deemed renewal was not available in

      view of <a href="/doc/64657360/" id="a_24">Section 8(3)</a> of the MMDR Act. Consequently, these 26 lease

      holders were restrained from operating until express orders were passed by

      the State Government under <a href="/doc/64657360/" id="a_25">Section 8(3)</a> of the MMDR Act. Six months

      time was granted to the State Government to take a final decision on the

      renewal applications. This Court left it open to the mining lease holders to

      apply for modification of the interim order dated 16 th May, 2014 on

      obtaining necessary clearances.
</p>
<p id="p_34">      15.     During the hearing of these petitions, we were informed that the

      balance 26 mining leases are now operational in view of the amendment to

      <a href="/doc/64657360/" id="a_26">Section 8(3)</a> of the MMDR Act with effect from 12 th January, 2015.

      However, we are not aware whether these 26 mining leases have the

      necessary statutory clearances.
</p>
<p id="p_35">      16.   We may also mention that pursuant to the liberty granted to move for

      modification of the interim order of 16 th May, 2014 we have received 17

      interim applications for modification. Through a chart handed over to us in

      Court on 3rd May, 2017 we have been informed that in respect of two of the

      17 applications, that is, Zenith Mining (I.A. No. 45) and Kavita Agrawal

      (I.A. No. 47), the lease has not been extended or has been determined and

      they do not have any Environmental Clearance or Forest Clearance. In

      respect of J.N. Pattnaik (I.A. No. 66), there is no Forest Clearance available.

      We were also informed that S.A. Karim (I.A. No.9) actually had a working

      lease and had wrongly been included as a non-operational lease.

      issue has been fully, conclusively and exhaustively dealt with by this Court

      by a judgment and order dated 4 th April, 2016 (<a href="/doc/1707158/" id="a_32">Common Cause v. Union of

      India</a>).4 Therefore, the first issue does not survive for consideration by us.

</p><p id="p_46">      21.   As far as the remaining three issues are concerned, these overlap with

      topics I, II and V dealt with by the CEC. Detailed submissions were made

      before us by learned counsel for all the appearing parties on these issues as

      well as by the learned Amicus and the learned Attorney General.             We

      propose to deal with them in this judgment and order.

</p><p id="p_47">      22.   We may mention that submissions were also made on topics III and IV

      identified by the CEC, that is, illegal mining outside the sanctioned mining

      lease areas and mining leases acquired in violation of <a href="/doc/532738/" id="a_33">Section 6</a> of the

      MMDR Act. We will consider these issues as well.
</p>
<p id="p_48">      23.   As far as topics VI and VII identified by the CEC are concerned, we

      would like to hear the parties in detail in respect of these issues.

</p><p id="p_49">      24.   No challenges or submissions were made on topics VIII, IX and X and

      therefore we accept the report of the CEC on these topics.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">Page 15 of 114</span>
</p><p id="p_50">      25.   At this stage, we may mention some rather frightening figures

      mentioned by the CEC in its final report. According to the CEC, excess

      mining without environmental clearance or beyond what was authorized by

      the environmental clearance is 2130.988 lakh MT of iron ore and 24.129

      lakh MT of manganese ore making a total of 2155.117 lakh MT of iron and

      manganese ore.      This does not include extraction of ore without forest

      clearance. These figures give an indication of the extent of excess or illegal

      or unlawful mining carried out.
</p>
<p id="p_51">      26.    In terms of rupees, according to the CEC the total notional value of

      minerals produced without an environmental clearance or in excess of the

      environmental clearance, at the weighted average price of minerals as

      proposed by the Indian Bureau of Mines comes to about Rs.17091.24 crores

      for iron ore and about Rs.484.92 crores for manganese ore making a total of

      Rs.17,576.16 crores. Again, this does not include mining without forest

      clearance. It is for this reason that we have referred to the megabucks and

      rapacious mining.

      committed by them. It is not necessary for us to delve into those specific

      details.

<p id="p_58">      31.    It was submitted before us by learned counsel for the mining lease

      holders that the reports given by the Commission were not acceptable on the

      8B</a> or <a href="/doc/606986/" id="a_39">Section 8C</a> of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952. It was submitted

      that under these circumstances the reports given by the Commission were

      vitiated and therefore the foundation of the writ petition filed by Common

      Cause was taken away. We are not in agreement with learned counsel for

      the mining lease holders.

<p id="p_59">      32.        The first report given by the Commission was a general, overall

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">Page 20 of 114</span>

      holders who were the subject matter of discussion in the second report is of

      no consequence.
</p>
<p id="p_60">      33.      What we are really perturbed about is the facts stated by the

      Commission in the first report. So far as this is concerned, we are of the

      view that no irregularity or illegality has been committed so as to vitiate the

      first report. Notwithstanding this, we are not relying upon any of the facts

      determined by the Commission for the purposes of our judgment and order.

      followed will indicate that full opportunity was given to the lease holders to

      have their say.

      Some individual lawyers appeared for several lease holders but the fact of

      the matter is that everybody who wanted to be heard was given a hearing.

</p><p id="p_70">      42.    The function of the Commission as stated in the first report, at the

      present stage, is best described in the words of the Commission itself. It is

      stated as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_63">                    “The function of the Commission, at this stage, is only to inquire,
                    assess the data collected and to submit the report on the said basis.
                    On that basis, some remedial measures are suggested by the
                    Commission for controlling illegal mining and violation of the Acts
                    and/or Rules. For that, there is no question of issuing notices to the
                    lessees.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_64">                    For collecting the data and assessing it, the Principles of Natural
                    Justice are fully complied with, as stated above. On the basis of the
                    data submitted by the lessees and the submissions made by Ld.</blockquote><p id="p_71">
</p><p id="p_72">                    Counsel for them, the report is submitted.”

      It is further clarified on page 198 of Volume I of the first report that with

      regard to individual mining leases in which there is a violation of the

      provisions of the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_40">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980 and/or conditions of

      environmental clearance etc. a report would be submitted later on.

</p><p id="p_73">      43.     It is therefore abundantly clear that the first report is generally a

      limited fact finding enquiry on the basis of information supplied by the

      mining lease holders. Therefore, there is absolutely no question of any notice

      being issued to any mining lease holder under <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_41">Section 8B</a> or the right of

      cross examination being granted to any mining lease holder under <a href="/doc/606986/" id="a_42">Section

      8C</a> of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952. We are satisfied that the
W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">Page 25 of 114</span>
      Commission made adequate efforts to collect the facts and this collation in

      the first report was possible with the assistance of the mining lease holders

      and their learned counsel and representatives as well as the government

      authorities and FIMI and FICCI. Under these circumstances, no lease holder

      can seriously contend that the procedure adopted by the Commission in

      collecting facts was either irregular or not in accordance with law. As

      mentioned above, any mining lease holder who wanted to be heard was

      given an opportunity of being heard and was fully aware of what the

      Commission was attempting to achieve and if any particular mining lease

      holder chose not to associate with it, it was at his or her own peril. Lack of

      knowledge of the proceedings before the Commission cannot be appreciated

      and we are quite satisfied that all the mining lease holders were fully aware

      of what was going on, if not personally then certainly through their list of

      learned counsel running into 18 pages or their representatives individually or

      their Federation.
</p>
<p id="p_74">      44.   In Goa Foundation there was a challenge to the report of the Justice

      Shah Commission in respect of its conclusions pertaining to the State of

      Goa. This was dealt with by this Court in paragraphs 11 to 14 of its

      decision. This Court declined to quash the report in view of the statement

      made by the learned Advocate General of Goa. But, this Court took the

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">Page 26 of 114</span>
      view that: “we will, however, examine the legal and environmental issues

      raised in the Report of Justice Shah Commission and on the basis of our

      findings on these issues consider granting the reliefs prayed for in the writ

      petition filed by Goa Foundation and the reliefs prayed for in the writ

      petitions filed by the mining lessees, which have been transferred to this

      Court.”

</p><p id="p_75">      45.   In the present petitions before us, there is no challenge to the reports of

      the Justice Shah Commission.            However, we propose (as in Goa

      Foundation) to confine ourselves to some limited facts adverted to by the

      CEC in its final report. We do not propose to base any of our conclusions on

      the reports of the Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_76">      46.   Learned counsel for the petitioners insisted that the illegal or unlawful

      mining activity carried on in the State of Odisha as noted by the

      Commission deserves to be investigated by the Central Bureau of

      Investigation. Reference in this regard was made to the passage in Part III of

      Volume I of the first report of the Commission to the following effect:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_65">                   “Since this is one of the biggest illegal mining ever observed by the
                   Commission, it is strongly felt that this is a fit case to handover to
                   Central Bureau of Investigation, for further investigation and follow
                   up action.”




W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">Page 27 of 114</span>
</blockquote><p id="p_77">      47.    Similarly, on page 125 of Chapter II of Volume I of the report, it is

      stated as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_66">                    “Terms of Reference No. 8 provides that “The Commission may take
                    the services of any investigating agency of the Central Government
                    in order to effectively address its terms of reference.</blockquote><p id="p_78">

</p><p id="p_79">                    The Commission, therefore, suggests that Central Bureau of
                    Investigation (C.B.I.) may be directed to investigate into allegations
                    of corruption made against politicians, bureaucrats and others.”


      We will consider this at the appropriate stage. Suffice it to say for the time

      being that the Commission made certain significant observations in Chapter

      II of the report to the effect that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_67">                a   That the tribals in the area have been displaced or stay in pathetic
                    and miserable conditions in same area. There is rampant air
                    pollution with the trees having the colour of minerals making it clear
                    that tribals are forced to breathe polluted air and drink polluted

</p><p id="p_81">      48.   Adverting to corruption in the area due to illegal mining activities, the

      Commission felt that the Vigilance Commission was unlikely to conduct an

      impartial and independent enquiry for arriving at just and proper findings

      because of external pressures. Accordingly, it would be more appropriate if

      the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) conducts a detailed enquiry into

      all cases that have been registered between 2008 and 2011. It was also noted

      that the railways have issued demand notices to the extent of Rs.1,874

      crores. The latest position with regard to these notices is not available.
</p><p id="p_82">      49. It was also noted that notices have been issued in 146 cases to various

      lease holders for recovery of mined ore as per <a href="/doc/60667211/" id="a_43">Section 21(5)</a> of the MMDR

      Act. In the Koira circle notices have been issued to 55 lessees for more than

      Rs. 13,000 crores; in Joda circle notices have been issued to 72 lessees for

      recovery of more than Rs. 44,000 crores; in Keonjhar circle notices have

      been issued to 4 lessees for recovery of about Rs. 1,065 crores; in Koraput

      circle notices have been issued to three lessees for the recovery of about

      Rs. 44 lakhs; and in Bolangir circle notice has been issued to 1 lessee for the

      recovery of about Rs.29.5 crores. In Baripada circle notices have been

      issued to 11 lessees for recovery of more than Rs. 467 crores. In other

      words notices have been issued to the lessees for recovery of more than Rs.

      crores)!!
</p><p id="p_83">      50. We have adverted to the reports of the Commission, without relying

      on them, only to highlight the gravity of the situation and nothing more. The

      gravity of the situation is also apparent from the report of the CEC and the

      Commission seems to support it.
</p>
<p id="p_84">      Initial contention

</p><p id="p_85">      51.     The initial contention urged on behalf of the respondents - lease

      holders was that in giving the report dated 16th October, 2014 the CEC has

      exceeded its remit. In this context, reference was made to the order of 13 th

      January, 2014 in which it is stated that “The Report will not cover cases

      other than forest and environmental issues.”

</p><p id="p_86">      52.       We are of opinion that this objection deserves immediate rejection.

      The subsequent orders passed by this Court have been completely

      overlooked by learned counsel inasmuch on 21st April, 2014 it was

      specifically noted by this Court that “CEC, in the meanwhile, will make out

      a list of such lessees who are operating the leases in violation of the law.”

      Similarly, in the record of proceedings of 16th May, 2014 it was noted that

      “The Central Empowered Committee will give a final report on the Writ

      Petition by the end of July, 2014………”

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">Page 30 of 114</span>
</p><p id="p_87">      53.              From a reading of the orders and the proceedings that have

      been held in this regard from time to time, it is quite obvious to us that the

      jurisdiction of the CEC was not limited and it was expected to give a

      detailed report on all aspects of illegal mining or mining being carried out

      without any lawful authority in whatever manner. The initial objection

      raised on behalf of the lease holders is therefore rejected.

      Central Empowered Committee

</p><p id="p_88">      54.     The Central Empowered Committee or the CEC was first constituted

      by this Court by an order dated 9th May, 2002 (<a href="/doc/1725193/" id="a_44">T.N.Godavarman v. Union of

      India</a>)5 as an interim body. Thereafter, it was constituted by a notification

      dated 17th September, 2002 issued under <a href="/doc/66315068/" id="a_45">Section 3(3)</a> of the Environment

      (Protection) Act, 1986 (for short ‘the EPA’). It has continued functioning

      and assisting this Court for more than a decade and even though it has been

      criticized on a couple of occasions, it is now an established body which

      renders extremely valuable advice to this Court and provides factual material

      on the basis of which this Court can make some recommendations and pass

      appropriate orders.6

</p><p id="p_89">      55.   The details of the functioning of the CEC have been discussed by this

      Court in <a href="/doc/37541448/" id="a_47">Samaj Parivartana Samudaya v. State of Karnataka</a>.7 In that

      decision, questions were raised about the credibility of the CEC and while

      rejecting the submissions, it was made clear that the recommendations made

      by the CEC are subject to the satisfaction of this Court. We need say

      nothing more except that during the course of hearing of the present

      petitions, some of the conclusions arrived at by the CEC were disputed by

      the petitioners and even by the learned Amicus and some were supported by

      learned counsel for the mining lease holders, the learned Attorney General

      and the learned counsel for the State of Odisha. It is therefore quite clear

      that in the present cases, the CEC as a fact finding body has functioned

      impartially and it is only on the conclusions arrived at by the CEC on the

      basis of the facts gathered that there can be some debate and discussion.

      Anyone may disagree with the views of the CEC and there is no need to

      make heavy weather about this at all.

<p id="p_90">      56.    In so far as the report given by the CEC on 16 th October, 2014 (the

      final report) is concerned, before going into the details thereof, we may

      mention that the CEC has stated that it held meetings with the Chief

      Secretary and other senior officials of the State of Odisha and others on six

      dates. It also heard the lease holders and others on seven dates and it held

      meetings with three of the lease holders that is Jindal Steel and Power Ltd.

      (JSPL), Sarda Mines Pvt. Limited (SMPL) and Essel Mining and Industries

      Ltd. (Essel) on 10th September, 2014. The CEC visited the site of the mining

      lease of SMPL from 4th March, 2014 to 7th March, 2014 and had site visits of

      a number of other lessees from 12th July, 2014 to 16th July, 2014.


</p><p id="p_91">      57.    As far as the facts collected by the CEC are concerned, there is no

      dispute with regard to their correctness. The CEC has recorded that there

      are 187 iron ore and manganese ore mining leases in the State of Odisha.

      On the basis of the material and information collected, a statement was

      prepared showing lease-wise and year-wise details of production of iron ore

      and manganese ore, permissible production and production without

      environmental clearance/beyond environmental clearance. The details in

      this regard have been given as Annexure R-14 to the final report.

</p><p id="p_92">      58.   Regarding the correctness of the information, the CEC has this to say:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_72">                “24.      A copy of the above said statement prepared by the CEC was
                made available, through the Director, Mines and Geology, Government
                of Odisha and also through the Federation of Indian Mining Industries
                (FIMI), to the lessees of each of the mining leases to enable them to
                verify the production and other details as given in the statement.</blockquote><p id="p_93">

                August, 2014 and also in the representations filed before the CEC a
                large number of lessees stated that the yearwise production details are
                not correctly reflected in the statement. Some of them also stated that

                the environment clearance details are not properly reflected in the
                statement. Therefore, it was decided that (a) the State Government will
                reconcile the annual production and other details with the respective
                lessees and (b) the copies of the environmental clearances may also be
                filed before the CEC by those lessees who are disputing the
                environmental clearances details provided by the State. Accordingly a
                meeting was convened by the Director, Mines &amp; Geology (DMG) with
                the lessees on 14th August, 2014 and during which the annual
                production and other details were reconciled. The reconciled leasewise
                and yearwise production and other details provided to the CEC by the
                State of Odisha may be seen in the statement enclosed at Annexure -
                R-11 to this Report. The figures modified in the said statement, after
                reconciliations, are shown in bold print.”

</p><p id="p_95">      59.   The CEC noted that the Director, Mines and Geology of the

      Government of Odisha had informed the CEC that each lease holder with the

      exception of SMPL and JSPL agreed with the reconciled production details.

      On facts, therefore, there is no dispute with regard to the contents of the

      report of the CEC, although the conclusions might be disputed. Separately,

      the CEC has dealt with the facts concerning SMPL and JSPL pursuant to a

      meeting held with them on 11th September, 2014.

      respect of land in which the mineral vests in the government. An application

      for the grant of a mining lease is required to be made by an applicant to the

      State Government in Form I to the MCR. Sub rule (5) of Rule 22 deals with

      a mining plan and it requires that a mining plan shall incorporate, amongst

      other things, a tentative scheme of mining and annual programme and plan

      for excavation for year to year for five years.

      laws including the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_66">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and

      ground water aquifer and usable lands to a minimum. It also mandates

<p id="p_123">      83.   Briefly therefore, the overall purpose and objective of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_69">MMDR Act</a>

      as well as the rules framed there under is to ensure that mining operations

      are carried out in a scientific manner with a high degree of responsibility

      including responsibility in protecting and preserving the environment and

      the flora of the area. Through this process, the holder of a mining lease is

      obliged to adhere to the standards laid down under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_70">Environment

      (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 or the EPA as well as the laws pertaining to air and

      natural resources is ruled out. If the holder of a mining lease does not

      adhere to the provisions of the statutes or the rules or the terms and

      conditions of the mining lease, that person is liable to incur penalties under

<p id="p_124">      Environment Impact Assessment Notification of 27th January, 1994

</p><p id="p_125">      84. As can be seen from the statutory scheme adverted to above, protection

      and preservation of the environment is a significant and integral component

      of a mining plan, a mining lease and mining operations ˗˗ and rightly so.

</p><p id="p_126">      85.   Keeping this in mind, an Environment Impact Assessment Notification

      dated 27th January, 1994 was issued by the Central Government in exercise

      of powers conferred by <a href="/doc/142884/" id="a_74">Section 3(1)</a> and Section 3(2)(v) of the EPA read

      with Rule 5(3)(d) of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986.              The

      Environment Impact Assessment Notification dated 27th January, 1994 (for

      short ‘EIA 1994’) is a prohibitory notification and directs that on and from

      the date of its publication in the official gazette: (i) expansion or

      modernization of any activity (if pollution load is to exceed the existing one)

      and (ii) a new project listed in Schedule I to the notification, shall not be

      undertaken unless it has been accorded environmental clearance (for short

      EC) by the Central Government in accordance with the procedure specified

      in the notification.
</p>
<p id="p_127">W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">Page 43 of 114</span>
</p><p id="p_128">      86.   The notification provides, among other things, that in case of mining

      operations, site clearance shall be granted for a sanctioned capacity and shall

      be valid for a period of five years from commencing mining operations.

      What this means is that on receipt of an EC a mining lease holder can extract

      a mineral only from a specified site, upto the sanctioned capacity and only

      for a period of five years from the date of the grant of an EC. This is

      regardless of the quantum of extraction permissible in the mining plan or the

      mining lease and regardless of the duration of the mining lease.

      Consequently, a mining lease holder would necessarily have to obtain a fresh

      EC every five years and can also apply for an increase in the sanctioned

      capacity. There is no concept of a retrospective EC and its validity

      effectively starts only from the day it is granted.       Thus, the EC takes

      precedence over the mining lease or to put it conversely, the mining

      operations under a mining lease are dependent on and ‘subordinate’ to the

      EC.

      are concerned with the 1st Note which deals with the expansion and

      modernization of existing projects. This reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_73">                   “1. Expansion and modernization of existing projects

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">Page 44 of 114</span>
                   pollution load is to exceed the existing levels. The words “pollution
                   load” will in this context cover emissions, liquid effluents and solid
                   or semi-solid wastes generated. A project proponent may approach
                   the concerned State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) for certifying
                   whether the proposed modernization/expansion activity as listed in
                   Schedule-I to the notification is likely to exceed the existing
                   pollution load or not. If it is certified that no increase is likely to
                   occur in the existing pollution load due to the proposed expansion or
                   modernization, the project proponent will not be required to seek
                   environmental clearance, but a copy of such certificate issued by the
                   SPCB will have to be submitted to the Impact Assessment Agency
                   (IAA) for information. The IAA will however, reserve the right to
                   review such cases in the public interest if material facts justifying the
                   need for such review come to light.”

</blockquote><p id="p_130">      88.   The Note is significant and from its bare reading it is clear that if any

      proposed expansion or modernization activity results in an increase in the

      pollution load, then a prior EC is required. The project proponent should

      approach the concerned State Pollution Control Board (for short the SPCB)

      for certifying whether the proposed expansion or modernization is likely to

      exceed the existing pollution load or not. If the pollution load is not likely to

      be exceeded, the project proponent will not be required to seek an EC but a

      copy of such a certificate from the SPCB will require to be submitted to the

      Impact Assessment Agency which can review the certificate.

</p><p id="p_131">      89.    What is the requirement, if any, under EIA 1994 with regard to an

      existing mining lease where there is no proposal for expansion or

      modernization? Does such a mining lease holder require an EC to continue


W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">Page 45 of 114</span>
      mining operations? This is answered in the 8th Note which is also of some

      importance and this reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_74">                   “8. Exemption for projects already initiated

                   For projects listed in Schedule-I to the notification in respect of

                   the State Government including NOC from the respective State
                   Pollution Control Boards have been obtained before 27 th January,
                   1994, a project proponent will not be required to seek environmental
                   clearance from the IAA. However those units who have not as yet
                   commenced production will inform the IAA.”

</blockquote><p id="p_132">      90.   The above Note makes it clear that existing mining projects that have a

      no objection certificate from the SPCB before 27 th January, 1994 will not be

      required to obtain an EC from the Impact Assessment Agency. Of course,

      this is subject to the substantive portion of EIA 1994 and the 1 st Note.

      However, if the existing mining project does not have a no objection

      certificate from the SPCB, then an EC will be required under EIA 1994.

</p><p id="p_133">      91.   Two questions immediately arise from a reading of the 1 st and the 8th

      Note. The first question is: What is the base year for considering the

      pollution load while proposing any expansion activity? The second question

      is: What is the duration for which an EC is not necessary for an ongoing

      project which does not propose any expansion, or to put it differently, what

      is the validity period for a no objection certificate from the SPCB?



W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">Page 46 of 114</span>
</p><p id="p_134">      92.    In our opinion, as far as the first question is concerned, a reading of

      EIA 1994 read with the 1st Note implies that the base year would need to be

      the immediately preceding year that is 1993-94. This is obvious from the

      opening sentence of the 1st Note, that is, “A project proponent is required to

      seek environmental clearance for a proposed expansion/modernization

      activity if the resultant pollution load is to exceed the existing levels.”

      (Emphasis supplied). In its report, the CEC has taken 1993-94 as the base

      year and we see no error in this. Even the MoEF in its circular dated 28 th

      October, 2004 stated with regard to the expansion in production: “If the

      annual production of any year from 1994-95 onwards exceeds the annual

      production of 1993-94 or its preceding years (even if approved by IBM), it

      would constitute expansion.” If that expansion results in an increase in the

      pollution load over the existing levels, then an EC is mandated.

</p><p id="p_135">      93.   It was contended on behalf of the mining lease holders that in terms of

      the circular of 28th October, 2004 the annual production even prior to

      1993-94 could be considered for ascertaining if there was an expansion or

      not. We cannot accept this submission for a variety of reasons. For one, the

      existing levels mentioned in the 1st Note clearly have reference to the

      immediately preceding year and not to a preceding year in a comparatively

      remote past. Secondly, a very high annual production in any one year is not

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">Page 47 of 114</span>
      reflective of a consistent pattern of production – it could very well be a freak

      year and that freak year certainly cannot be a basic standard or the norm to

      measure expansion. Then if the interpretation sought to be given is accepted,

      there would be an absence of consistency and a lack of uniformity with

      different mining lease holders having different base years. This is hardly

      conducive to good governance. Finally, EIA 1994 was intended to prevent

      the existing environmental load from increasing based on the existing data

      of the immediate past and not data of a few years gone by. We may add that

      the only exception that could be made in this regard would be if there is no

      production during 1993-94. In that event, the immediately preceding year

      would be relevant and that is the only reasonable interpretation that we see

      for the use of the words “or its preceding years”.
</p>
<p id="p_136">      94.    On the question of the duration or exemption period from an EC in

      respect of a project that has commenced prior to 27th January, 1994 the

      substantive portion of EIA 1994 and the 8th Note grant an exemption from

      the requirement of obtaining an EC if there is no expansion and the existing

      pollution load is not exceeded. In any event, a no objection certificate from

      the SPCB is necessary for continuing the mining operations. Consequently,

      even if any mining lease holder does not have an EC or does not require an

      EC for continuing mining operations (but has a no objection certificate from

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">Page 48 of 114</span>
      the SPCB), the absence of an EC would not have an adverse impact on the

      mining lease holder unless of course, there was an expansion in the mining

      operations without any certificate from the SPCB. In addition to this, the

      validity period (if any) of the certificate from the SPCB is important – we

      have not been made aware whether there is such a validity period or not.

</p><p id="p_137">      95. The contention of learned counsel for the mining lease holders that EIA

      1994 was rather vague, uncertain and ambiguous cannot be accepted. In our

      opinion, on a composite reading of EIA 1994, it is clear that: (i) A no

      objection certificate from the SPCB was necessary for continuing mining

      operations; (ii) An expansion or modernization activity required an EC

      unless the pollution load was not exceeded beyond the existing levels; (iii)

      The base year for determining the pollution load and therefore the proposed

      expansion would be with reference to 1993-94; (iv) Whether an expansion or

      modernization would lead to exceeding the existing pollution load or not

      would require a certificate from the SPCB which could be reviewed by the

      IAA; (v) New projects require an EC; and (vi) Existing projects do not

      require an EC unless there is an expansion or modernization for the duration

      (if any) of the validity of the certificate from the SPCB. We need not say

      anything more on this subject since the CEC has proceeded to discuss the

      issue of mining in excess of the EC or in excess of the mining plan only

      from the year 2000-01 onwards. The prior period may, therefore, be ignored

      and it is the period from 2000-01 onwards which is actually relevant for the

      present discussion.

<p id="p_138">      96.   It was submitted by learned counsel for the mining lease holders that

      the MoEF had caused some confusion with regard to the requirement of an

      EC at the time of renewal of a mining lease. In this connection, reference

      was made to a Press Note of July 1994 and a letter dated 19 th June, 1997 of

      the MoEF to the Chief Conservator of Forests in the MoEF.

</p><p id="p_139">      97.    Learned counsel for the mining lease holders sought to buttress their

      submission that EIA 1994 was vague and ambiguous by mentioning two

      circulars issued by the MoEF on 5th November, 1998 and 27th December,

      2000 extending the period for obtaining an EC for new units. However, these

      circulars are apparently not on our record (which goes into 148 volumes)

      and therefore we cannot make any comment about them. These circulars

      were mentioned to also contend that even for new units the absence of an EC

      would not have an adverse impact on them, since the period for obtaining an

      EC was extended from time to time.        A reference was also made to a

      circular dated 14th May, 2002 which later on became the subject of

      consideration by this Court in <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_75">M.C. Mehta v. Union of India</a>.8 A reading of

      the circular of 14th May, 2002 indicates that several units had come up in

      violation of EIA 1994. The MoEF had taken the view that such units may be

      permitted to apply for an EC by 31st March, 1999 which was then extended

      to 30th June, 2001 by circulars dated 5th November, 1998 and 27th December,

      2000 respectively.
</p>
<p id="p_140">      98.   By the circular dated 14 th May, 2002 the deadline for applying for an

      EC was extended up to 31st March, 2003 as a last and final opportunity to

      obtain an ex post facto EC in respect of units which had commenced mining

      operations without obtaining a prior EC in violation of EIA 1994. The

      circular also stated that: “Suitable directions shall be issued by all States/UTs

      under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_76">Environment (Protection) Act</a> to units to stop construction

      activities/operations of all such units that fail to apply for environmental

      clearance by 31st March, 2003. Units which fail to comply with these

      directions shall be proceeded against forthwith under the relevant provisions

      of the Environment (P) Act, 1986 without making reference to this

      Ministry.”

</p><p id="p_141">      99.   It was submitted that in view of these ambiguous and unclear signals

      emanating from the MoEF which resulted in confusion being worse

      confounded, the mining lease holders were not clear whether or not they

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">Page 51 of 114</span>
      were required to obtain an EC particularly in respect of pre-EIA 1994

      mining leases and operations.
</p>
<p id="p_142">      100.   As mentioned above, these dates and the text of the circulars were

      emphasized by learned counsel for the lease holders to contend that it was

      not obligatory for the mining lease holders, who did not expand their mining

      operations, to obtain an EC and in any event the period for obtaining an EC

      was extended till 31st March, 2003 with ex post facto approval. In this

      context, reliance was placed on M.C. Mehta referred to above.

</p><p id="p_143">      101. We are not in agreement with the contention of learned counsel for the

      mining lease holders on the interpretation given to the various circulars for

      the reasons given above and must also correctly appreciate the decision of

      this Court in M.C. Mehta.
</p>
<p id="p_144">      102.    In M.C. Mehta the issue that arose for consideration was whether

      mining activity in the Aravalli hills causes environmental degradation and

      what directions are required to be issued. While considering this issue, this

      Court also considered EIA 1994 and the circular dated 14 th May, 2002. In

      doing so, this Court categorically held in paragraph 37 of the Report that the

      intention of the MoEF was not to legalize the continuance of mining activity

      without complying with the requisite stipulations. If that were unfortunately

      so, then it would demonstrate a lack of sensitivity of the MoEF to the

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">Page 52 of 114</span>
      principles of sustainable development and the object behind issuing EIA

      1994. This Court said:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_75">                   “It does not appear that MOEF intended to legalise the
                   commencement or continuance of mining activity without
                   compliance of stipulations of the notification. In any case, a statutory
                   notification cannot be notified [modified] by issue of circular.
                   Further, if MOEF intended to apply this circular also to mining
                   activity commenced and continued in violation of this notification, it
                   would also show total non-sensitivity of MOEF to the principles of
                   sustainable development and the object behind the issue of
                   notification. The circular has no applicability to the mining activity.”

</blockquote><p id="p_145">      103.    Adverting to the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_77">MMDR Act</a>, this Court expressed the view in

      paragraph 52 of the Report that the approval of a mining plan does not imply

      that a mining lease holder can commence mining operations. The mining

      lease holder is nevertheless obliged to comply with statutory provisions

      including the EPA and other laws. It was said:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_76">                   “The grant of permission for mining and approving mining plans and
                   the scheme by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India by itself
                   does not mean that mining operation can commence. It cannot be
                   accepted that by approving mining plan and scheme by the Ministry
                   of Mines, the Central Government is deemed to have approved
                   mining and it can commence forthwith on such approval……. A
                   mining leaseholder is also required to comply with other statutory
                   provisions such as the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_78">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, the Air
                   (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_79">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, the Water

                   (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980. Mere approval of the mining plan by the
                   Government of India, Ministry of Mines would not absolve the
                   leaseholder from complying with the other provisions.”

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">Page 53 of 114</span>
</blockquote><p id="p_146">      104.   This Court also considered the question of the applicability of EIA

      1994 to the renewal of an existing mining lease. It was held that the said

      notification would apply to the renewal of a mining lease that came up for

      consideration post 27th January, 1994. In other words, for the renewal of a

      mining lease, an EC was required by the mining lease holder. It was held in

      paragraph 77 of the Report:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_77">                   “We are unable to accept the contention that the notification dated
                   27-1-1994 would not apply to leases which come up for
                   consideration for renewal after issue of the notification. The
                   notification mandates that the mining operation shall not be
                   undertaken in any part of India unless environmental clearance by
                   the Central Government has been accorded. The clearance under the
                   notification is valid for a period of five years. In none of the leases
                   the requirements of the notification were complied with either at the
                   stage of initial grant of the mining lease or at the stage of renewal.
                   Some of the leases were fresh leases granted after issue of the
                   notification. Some were cases of renewal. No mining operation can
                   commence without obtaining environmental impact assessment in
                   terms of the notification.”


</blockquote><p id="p_147">      105.   It is clear from the decision rendered by this Court that EIA 1994 is

      mandatory in character; that it is applicable to all mining operations

      –expansion of production or even increase in lease area, modernization of

      the extraction process, new mining projects and renewal of mining leases. A

      mining lease holder is obliged to adhere to the terms and conditions of a

      mining lease and the applicable laws and the mere fact that a mining plan

      has been approved does not entitle a mining lease holder to commence

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">Page 54 of 114</span>
      mining operations. In M.C. Mehta this Court concluded that EIA 1994 is

      clearly applicable to the renewal of a mining lease.

</p><p id="p_148">      106. Subsequent to the decision in M.C. Mehta two clarificatory circulars

      were issued by MoEF on 28th October, 2004 and 25th April, 2005. These

      were adverted to by learned counsel for the mining lease holders but in our

      opinion they are not relevant except to the extent that they make it explicit

      that following the decision of this Court in M.C. Mehta, an EC is required to

      be obtained before the renewal of a mining lease and that the term

      ‘expansion’ would include an increase in production or the lease area or

      both.
</p>
<p id="p_149">      107.    It was submitted on behalf of the mining lease holders that the

      possibility of getting an ex post facto EC was a signal to the mining lease

      holders that obtaining an EC was not mandatory or that if it was not

      obtained, the default was retrospectively condonable. We do not agree. We

      have referred to various provisions of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_82">MMDR Act</a> and the rules framed

      thereunder to indicate the statutory importance given to the protection and

      preservation of the environment. This was also emphasized in M.C. Mehta

      in which it was also stated that “It does not appear that MOEF intended to

      legalise the commencement or continuance of mining activity without

      compliance of stipulations of the notification.” It appears to us that the

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">Page 55 of 114</span>
      MoEF was, in a sense, cajoling the mining lease holders to comply with the

      law and EIA 1994 rather than use the stick. That the mining lease holders

      chose to misconstrue the soft implementation as a licence to not abide by the

      requirements of the law is unfortunate and was an act of omission or

      commission by them at their own peril. We cannot attribute insensitivity to

      the MoEF or even to the mining lease holders to environment protection and

      preservation, but at the same time we cannot overlook the obligation of

      everyone to abide by the law. That the MoEF took a soft approach cannot be

      an escapist excuse for non-compliance with the law or EIA 1994.

      Environment Impact Assessment Notification of 14th September, 2006

</p><p id="p_150">      108. On 14th September, 2006 another EIA Notification was issued by the

      MoEF. This notification (for short EIA 2006) required prior EC for projects

      or activities mentioned in the Schedule to it both for major as well as minor

      minerals if the leased area is 5 hectares or more. We were informed that

      several mining lease holders, in compliance with EIA 2006, applied for and

      were granted an EC.
</p>
<p id="p_151">      109. It was submitted by learned counsel for the mining lease holders that

      the confusion, vagueness and uncertainty caused by EIA 1994 and

      subsequent circulars and other communications did not end with the

      issuance of EIA 2006. Reference was made to a circular dated 13 th October,

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">Page 56 of 114</span>
      2006 which deals with interim operational guidelines till 13 th September,

      2007 in respect of applications made under EIA 1994. We do not see the

      relevance of this circular (which really dealt with transitional issues) not

      only for the reason given in M.C. Mehta that circulars cannot override

      statutory notifications but also because it deals with the procedure for

      considering applications made under EIA 1994.
</p>
<p id="p_152">      110.    Reference was also made to a circular dated 2 nd July, 2007. The

      passage relied upon reads as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_78">                   “It is clarified that all such mining projects which did not require
                   environmental clearance under the EIA Notification, 1994 would
                   continue to operate without obtaining environmental clearance till
                   the mining lease falls due for renewal, if there is no increase in lease
                   area and/or there is no enhancement of production. In the event of
                   any increase in lease area and or production, such projects would
                   need to obtain prior environmental clearance. Further, all such
                   projects which have been operating without any environmental
                   clearance would obtain environmental clearance at the time of their
                   lease renewal even if there is no increase either in terms of lease area
                   or production.”


</blockquote><p id="p_153">      111.   The aforesaid circular relates to three categories that is: (i) Mining

      leases, where no EC was required under EIA 1994 would continue to operate

      without an EC; (ii) If there was an increase in the lease area or enhancement

      of production, an EC was required by the mining lease holder; (iii) All

      projects would require an EC at the time of renewal of the mining lease even

      if there was no increase in the lease area or enhancement of production.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">Page 57 of 114</span>
</p><p id="p_154">      112.      Reference was also made to an Office Memorandum dated

      19th August, 2010. However a reading of this document brings out that it

      basically relates to construction at site but makes it clear that no activity

      relating to any project covered under EIA 2006 including civil construction

      could be undertaken without obtaining a prior EC except fencing of the site

      to protect it from getting encroached and construction of temporary sheds for

      the guards.
</p>
<p id="p_155">      113.      Reference was also made to Office Memorandums dated

      16th November, 2010 and 12th December, 2012 but having gone through

      them we find them of little relevance as they deal with procedural issues

      only.
</p>
<p id="p_156">      114.    All that we need to say on this subject is that there is no confusion,

      vagueness or uncertainty in the application of EIA 1994 and EIA 2006

      insofar as mining operations were commenced on mining leases before 27 th

      January, 1994 (or even thereafter). Post EIA 2006, every mining lease

      holder having a lease area of 5 hectares or more and undertaking mining

      operations in respect of major minerals (with which we are concerned) was

      obliged to get an EC in terms of EIA 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_157">      115.    An attempt was then made by learned counsel for the mining lease

      holders to get out of the rigours of EIA 1994 and EIA 2006 by contending

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">Page 58 of 114</span>
      that some of them had modified the mining plan (with approval) and that

      therefore they had extracted iron ore or manganese ore, as the case may be,

      in terms of the mining plan but not necessarily in terms of the EC that had

      been obtained, if at all.
</p>
<p id="p_158">      116. We have already held that a mining plan is subordinate to the EC and

      in M.C. Mehta it was held by this Court that having an approved mining

      plan does not imply that a mining lease holder can commence mining

      operations. That being so, a modified mining plan without a revised or

      amended EC, is of no consequence. What the contention of learned counsel

      suggests to us is that under the shield of a modified mining plan, illegal or

      unlawful mining in the form of mining without an EC, mining by

      over-reaching EIA 1994 and EIA 2006 was being carried out.

</p><p id="p_159">      117.   The contention apart, the subterfuge of obtaining a modified mining

      plan to get over the adverse effects of excess and illegal or unlawful

      production of iron ore or manganese ore was deprecated by the Ministry of

      Mines of the Government of India. In a letter dated 29 th October, 2010

      addressed to the Controller General, Indian Bureau of Mines it was pointed

      out that State Governments had expressed a concern that the Indian Bureau

      of Mines (IBM) had been modifying mining plans for allowing an increase

      in production of ore without adequate intimation to the State Governments.

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">Page 59 of 114</span>
      A concern was raised that such a revision was often being used to increase

      production of ore, which is sometimes not accounted for in mining

      operations in the concerned mining lease. It was made clear that all

      modifications of mining plans shall be effective prospectively only and

      earlier instances of irregular mining shall not be regularized through a

      modification of the mining plan.
</p>
<p id="p_160">      118.     In a subsequent letter dated 12 th December, 2011 addressed to the

      Chief Secretary in the Government of Orissa the said Ministry of Mines

      noted that there were violations of the actual production limit laid down in

      the mining plan and that the State Government had finally taken steps to

      curb illegal mining in respect of over-production of minerals. There was a

      reference to suggest (and we take it to be so) that 20% deviation from the

      mining plan (in terms of over-production) would be reasonable and

      permissible. However, it appears from a reading of the communication that

      illegal mining was going on beyond the 20% deviation limit and that

      appropriate steps were needed to curb these violations. Learned counsel for

      the petitioners submitted that such egregious violations must be firmly dealt

      with by cancellation or termination of the mining lease and a soft approach

      is not called for.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">Page 60 of 114</span>
</p><p id="p_162">      119. In this context, it is worth noting that a High Level Committee (called

      the Hoda Committee) on the National Mineral Policy noted in its Report

      dated 22nd December, 2006 in paragraph 3.47 as follows :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_79">                   “3.47 An EMP [Environment Management Plan] has to be prepared
                   under the MCDR and got approved by IBM. However, this EMP is
                   not acceptable to the MoEF. The miner has to prepare two EMPs
                   separately ˗˗ one for IBM and another for MoEF. The Committee
                   suggests that IBM and MoEF should prepare guidelines for a
                   composite EMP so that IBM can approve the same in consultation
                   with MoEF’s field offices. This will eliminate anomalous situations
                   where increase of even a few tonnes in production requires project
                   authorities to get a fresh EMP approved from the MoEF although the
                   IBM allows a grace of +10% per cent, keeping in view the
                   fluctuations in the market situation and process complexities. If a
                   single EMP is accepted in principle such anomalies can be resolved
                   in advance. The Committee feels the MoEF should also have a
                   cushion of +10% per cent in production while giving EIA
                   clearance.”


</blockquote><p id="p_163">      120.     The above passage indicates that the permissible variation in

      production as per the Indian Bureau of Mines is +10% but according to the

      letter dated 12th December, 2011 issued by the Ministry of Mines, the

      reasonable variation limit could be +20%. It is not clear why there was a

      shift in the variation, but as rightly pointed out by learned counsel for the

      petitioners, the fact that in some cases the variation exceeded 20% was a

      cause for concern which necessitated strict and punitive action.

</p><p id="p_164">      121. A submission was made by learned counsel for the mining lease

      holders to the effect that since many of them had been granted the first

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">Page 61 of 114</span>
      deemed statutory renewal of the mining lease under Rule 24A of the MCR,

      the requirements of EIA 1994 would not be applicable. We were shown

      various amendments made to Rule 24A of the MCR from time to time

      particularly the amendments made on 10th February, 1987, 7th January 1993,

      27th September, 1994, 17th January, 2000, 18th July, 2014 and 8th October,

      2014. In our opinion, none of these are of any consequence, the reason

      being that for the purposes of renewal of the mining lease, an application is

      required to be made by the mining lease holders and the deemed renewal

      clause under Rule 24A of the MCR will come into operation only after an

      application for renewal is made in Form J in Schedule I of the MCR. Under

      Rule 26 of the MCR, the State Government may refuse to renew the mining

      lease. That apart, the position in environmental jurisprudence with regard to

      the renewal of a mining lease has been made explicit by this Court in M.C.

      Mehta. Even otherwise, in view of EIA 1994, it is quite clear that the

      renewal of a mining lease would require a prior EC.
</p>
<p id="p_165">      122. We may also draw attention in this regard to a circular dated 28 th

      October, 2004 issued by the MoEF wherein it was stated that in view of the

      decision in M.C. Mehta all mining projects of major minerals of more than 5

      hectares lease area that had not yet obtained an EC would have to do so at

      the time of renewal of the lease.

</p><p id="p_167">      123.   Finally, it was submitted that whenever an EC is granted, it would

      have retrospective effect from the date of the application for grant of an EC.

      In this context, it was pointed out that there were enormous delays in

      granting an EC and that the Hoda Committee had noted with reference to

      EIA 2006 that if all goes well, the grant of an EC takes about 232 days

      whereas the international norm is that an EC is granted within six months or

      180 days. According to the additional affidavit filed by some mining lease

      holders, the period of 232 days mentioned by the Hoda Committee was

      actually a conservative estimate and that in fact it takes anything upto 390

      days for the grant of an EC. It was submitted that the position was even

      worse under EIA 1994 since the MoEF rarely showed any urgency in the

      grant of an EC. Examples were cited before us to show that in some

      instances the grant of an EC took more than two years. Taking all this into

      consideration it was submitted that it would be more appropriate that the EC

      is given retrospective effect from the date of the application.

</p><p id="p_168">      124. We are not in agreement with learned counsel for the mining lease

      holders. There is no doubt that the grant of an EC cannot be taken as a

      mechanical exercise. It can only be granted after due diligence and

      reasonable care since damage to the environment can have a long term

      impact. EIA 1994 is therefore very clear that if expansion or modernization

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">Page 63 of 114</span>
      of any mining activity exceeds the existing pollution load, a prior EC is

      necessary and as already held by this Court in M. C. Mehta even for the

      renewal of a mining lease where there is no expansion or modernization of

      any activity, a prior EC is necessary. Such importance having been given to

      an EC, the grant of an ex post facto environmental clearance would be

      detrimental to the environment and could lead to irreparable degradation of

      the environment. The concept of an ex post facto or a retrospective EC is

      completely alien to environmental jurisprudence including EIA 1994 and

      EIA 2006. We make it clear that an EC will come into force not earlier than

      the date of its grant.

<p id="p_169">      Illegal Mining

</p><p id="p_170">      125.    A question raised by learned counsel for the mining lease holders

      concerned the interpretation of the expression ‘illegal mining’. Reliance

      was placed on the report of the CEC which refers to Rule 2(iia) of the MCR

      to conclude that the violation of any rule within the mining lease area would

      not come within the definition of ‘illegal mining’ except where there has

      been a violation of the rules framed under <a href="/doc/179493821/" id="a_83">Section 23C</a> of the MMDR Act.

      According to the CEC:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_80">                    “17. Illegal mining has been defined as mining operations
                    undertaken by any person in any area without holding a mining
                    lease. It does not include violation of any rules within the mining
                    lease area except the Rules made under Section 23C of the MMDR
W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">Page 64 of 114</span>
                   Act, 1957. The mining lease area shall be considered as an area held
                   with lawful authority by the lessee (refer Rule 2(iia), MCR, 1960).”


</blockquote><p id="p_171">      126.   As can be seen from the above, there is a difference of opinion

      between the CEC and the Commission on what is illegal mining or mining

      without lawful authority and we will give our views on the subject.

</p><p id="p_172">      127. According to the lessees a mining operation only outside the mining

      lease area would constitute ‘illegal mining’ making illegal mining lease

      centric. We are unable to accept this narrow interpretation given by the CEC

      and relied upon by learned counsel for the mining lease holders.

</p><p id="p_173">      128. The simple reason for not accepting this interpretation is that Rule 2(ii

</p><p id="p_174">      a) of the MCR was inserted by a notification dated 26 th July, 2012 while we

      are concerned with an earlier period. That apart, as mentioned above, the

      holder of a mining lease is required to adhere to the terms of the mining

      scheme, the mining plan and the mining lease as well as the statutes such as

      the EPA, the FCA, the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_84">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

      1974 and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_85">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. If any

      mining operation is conducted in violation of any of these requirements, then

      that mining operation is illegal or unlawful. Any extraction of a mineral

      through an illegal or unlawful mining operation would become illegally or

      unlawfully extracted mineral.
</p>
<p id="p_175">W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">Page 65 of 114</span>
</p><p id="p_176">      129.    It is not, as suggested by learned counsel, that illegal mining is

      confined only to mining operations outside a leased area. Such an activity is

      obviously illegal or unlawful mining.     Illegal mining takes within its fold

      excess extraction of a mineral over the permissible limit even within the

      mining lease area which is held under lawful authority, if that excess

      extraction is contrary to the mining scheme, the mining plan, the mining

      lease or a statutory requirement.   Even otherwise, it is not possible for us to

      accept the narrow interpretation sought to be canvassed by learned counsel

      for the mining lease holders particularly since we are dealing with a natural

      resource which is intended for the benefit of everyone and not only for the

      benefit of the mining lease holders.
</p>
<p id="p_177">      Encroachments

</p><p id="p_178">      130. <a href="/doc/749104/" id="a_86">Section 4(1)</a> of the MMDR Act makes it clear that no person can carry

      out any mining operations except under and in accordance with the terms

      and conditions of a mining lease granted under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_87">MMDR Act</a> and the rules

      made thereunder.        Obviously therefore, any person carrying on mining

      operations without a mining lease, is indulging in illegal or unlawful mining.

      This would also necessarily imply that if a mining lease is granted to a

      person who carries out mining operations outside the boundaries of the



W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">Page 66 of 114</span>
      mining lease, the mineral extracted would be the result of illegal or unlawful

      mining.
</p>
<p id="p_179">      131.      In its report, the CEC has dealt with illegal mining outside the

      sanctioned mining areas. It is stated that 82 mining leases for iron ore and

      manganese ore were identified by the Commission where there were

      encroachments in the form of illegal mining pits, illegal over-burden dumps

      etc.
</p>
<p id="p_180">      132. In respect of these 82 mining leases, the State of Odisha appointed a

      Committee on the suggestion of the Commission, to survey and identify the

      exact extent and location of the sanctioned lease area, lease area under

      occupation     of   the   mining   lease   holder   and    the   area   under

      encroachment/illegal mining. The Committee or the Joint Survey consisted

      of officers of the Revenue Department, Forest Department and Mining

      Department of the State of Odisha who carried out a field survey in respect

      of 39 mining leases. The findings of the field survey or the Joint Survey

      were verified by a team comprising of the Director Mines, Chief Engineer,

      ORSAC and the Additional Secretary, F &amp; E Department of the Government

      of Odisha.
</p>
<p id="p_181">      133. It is mentioned in the report of the CEC that the Joint Survey for each

      of the 39 mining leases is technically sound and reliable. However, in

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">Page 67 of 114</span>
      respect of some of the leases, it would be desirable for the State Government

      to take another look at the results of the field survey. Unfortunately, the

      CEC has not identified these mining leases that require another look. Be that

      as it may, the fact is that a joint survey has not been conducted in respect of

      43 mining leases.
</p>
<p id="p_182">      134. We are of the view that for completing the record and taking the report

      of the CEC to its logical conclusion, it would be appropriate if a fresh Joint

      Survey is conducted by concerned officers of the Government of Odisha

      from the Revenue Department, the Forest Department, the Mining

      Department and any other department that may be deemed necessary. The

      Forest Survey of India, the MoEF, the Indian Bureau of Mines and the

      Geological Survey of India should also be associated in the Joint Survey. In

      our opinion, it would also be appropriate if the CEC is also associated in the

      Joint Survey and the best and latest technology should be made use of

      including satellite imagery and thereafter a report is submitted in this Court

      on or before 31st December, 2017 after hearing the 82 lessees identified by

      the Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_183">      Adherence to the mining plan

</p><p id="p_184">      135. A side issue raised by learned counsel for the mining lease holders in

      this regard was the necessity (if any) of adhering to the annual plan or

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">Page 68 of 114</span>
      calendar plan of mining. It was contended that a mining lease holder could

      mine in excess of the annual plan. While it is so, this submission must be

      tempered and appreciated in the proper context. A mining plan is valid for a

      period of five years but there could be a 20% variation in extraction over and

      above the mining plan. This is the maximum that is stated to be reasonably

      permissible according to the Ministry of Mines. In terms of Rule 22(5) of

      the MCR a mining plan shall incorporate a tentative scheme of mining and

      annual program and plan for excavation from year to year for five years. At

      best, there could be a variation in extraction of 20% in each given year but

      this would be subject to the overall mining plan limit of a variation of 20%

      over five years. What this means is that a mining lease holder cannot extract

      the five year quantity (with a variation of 20%) in one or two years only.

      The extraction has to be staggered and continued over a period of five years.

      If any other interpretation is given, it would lead to an absurd situation

      where a mining lease holder could extract the entire permissible quantity

      under the mining plan plus 20% in one year and extract miniscule amounts

      over the remaining four years, and this could be done without any reference

      to the EC. The submission of learned counsel in this regard simply cannot

      be accepted.

      Ministry of Mines of the Government of India to the Chief Secretary of the

      Government of Odisha (adverted to above) concerning violation of annual

      production limit laid down in the approved mining plan, it was stated, inter

      alia, that an analysis of production and violations in 104 mining leases for

      bulk minerals in the last ten years was undertaken by the Indian Bureau of

      Mines. It was noted that in 71 cases there was excess ore produced beyond

      the reasonable variation limit of 20%. It was noted that this was partly due

      to the failure of the State machinery to restrict the movement of minerals.

</p><p id="p_187">      137. In a further letter dated 5th September, 2012 it was reiterated that any

      violation of the mining plan or the mining scheme noticed by the State

      Bureau of Mines to initiate suitable action. It was reiterated that transit

      passes to such mines should not be issued by the State Government so as to

      stop any additional outgo. It was added: “Needless to say any revision on

      the limits of production is subjected to statutory clearances under

      Environment and Forest laws.       Having said that, the State Mining and

      Geology officials should not also lose focus on taking stringent action

      against any instances of illegal mining, undertaken outside the leased area,

      While mining in excess of permissible limits under the mining plan or the

<p id="p_192">      141. <a href="/doc/45830151/" id="a_99">Section 21(1)</a> of the MMDR Act is clearly relatable to a penal offence

<blockquote id="blockquote_85">                    13. A penal statute or penal law is a law that defines an offence and

                    Law Dictionary, 7th Edn., p. 1421.) Penalty is a liability composed
                    (sic imposed) as a punishment on the party committing the breach.
                    The very use of the term “penal” is suggestive of punishment and
                    may also include any extraordinary liability to which the law
                    subjects a wrongdoer in favour of the person wronged, not limited to
                    the damages suffered. (See Aiyar, P. Ramanatha: The Law Lexicon,

                    uniform but the weight of authority is in favour of the view that the
                    marginal note appended to a section cannot be used for construing
                    the section. There is no justification for restricting the section by the

</p><p id="p_202">      149. We are in agreement with the view expressed by the learned Attorney

      General and Shri Dwivedi as also the view expressed in Karnataka Rare

      Earth. The decision in Khemka &amp; Co. is not at all apposite. There is no

      ambiguity in <a href="/doc/60667211/" id="a_122">Section 21(5)</a> of the MMDR Act or in its application. We are

      also of opinion that though <a href="/doc/45830151/" id="a_123">Section 21(1)</a> of the MMDR Act might be in the

      realm of criminal liability, <a href="/doc/60667211/" id="a_124">Section 21(5)</a> of the MMDR Act is certainly not

      within that realm.
</p>
<p id="p_203">      150. In our opinion, <a href="/doc/60667211/" id="a_125">Section 21(5)</a> of the MMDR Act is applicable when

      any person raises, without any lawful authority, any mineral from any land.

      In that event, the State Government is entitled to recover from such person

      the mineral so raised or where the mineral has already been disposed of, the

      price thereof as compensation. The words ‘any land’ are not confined to the

      mining lease area. As far as the mining lease area is concerned, extraction of

      a mineral over and above what is permissible under the mining plan or under

      the EC undoubtedly attracts the provisions of <a href="/doc/60667211/" id="a_126">Section 21(5)</a> of the MMDR

      Act being extraction without lawful authority. It would also attract <a href="/doc/45830151/" id="a_127">Section

      attracted and is not limited to a violation committed by a person only outside

      the mining lease area – it includes a violation committed even within the

      mining lease area. This is also because the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_129">MMDR Act</a> is intended, among

      other things, to penalize illegal or unlawful mining on any land including

      mining lease land and also preserve and protect the environment. Action

      under the EPA or the MCR could be the primary action required to be taken

      with reference to the MCR and Rule 2(ii a) thereof read with the Explanation

      but that cannot preclude compensation to the State under <a href="/doc/60667211/" id="a_130">Section 21(5)</a> of

</p><p id="p_204">      151. What is the significance of this discussion? It was submitted that the

      CEC has taken the following view:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_88">                   “…… it may be appropriate that 30% of the notional value of the
                   iron and manganese produced by each of the lessees without/in
                   excess of the environmental clearances may be directed to be
                   recovered from the concerned lessees and with the explicit
                   understanding the concerned lessees as well as the officers will
                   continue to be liable for action under the provisions of the respective
                   Acts.”


</blockquote><p id="p_205">      152. Learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned Amicus were of

      opinion that the provisions of <a href="/doc/60667211/" id="a_132">Section 21(5)</a> of the MMDR Act require that

      the entire price of the illegally mined ore should be recovered from each

      defaulting lessee. Similarly, in its affidavit, the Union of India differs with

      the recommendation of the CEC. According to the affidavit of the Union of
W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">Page 78 of 114</span>
      India this would be contrary to the statutory scheme and in fact 100%

      recovery should be made under the provisions of <a href="/doc/60667211/" id="a_133">Section 21(5)</a> of the

      MMDR. We may note that only to this extent, the learned Attorney General

      differed with the view expressed by the Union of India and submitted that

      the recommendation of the CEC to recover only 30% of the value of the

      illegally mined ore should be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_206">      153. In our opinion, there can be no compromise on the quantum of

      compensation that should be recovered from any defaulting lessee – it

      should be 100%. If there has been illegal mining, the defaulting lessee must

      bear the consequences of the illegality and not be benefited by pocketing

      70% of the illegally mined ore. It simply does not stand to reason why the

      State should be compelled to forego what is its due from the exploitation of

      a natural resource and on the contrary be a party in filling the coffers of

      defaulting lessees in an ill gotten manner.
</p>
<p id="p_207">      Calculations on merits

</p><p id="p_208">      154. The issue now is with regard to the calculations made by the CEC with

      regard to the production of iron ore and manganese ore without or in excess

      of the EC and/or the mining plan. As already mentioned above, the figures

      were not disputed (except by JSPL and SMPL). Therefore, only the

      application of the figures requires consideration and so we do not need to

      examine each individual case. However to understand and appreciate the

      manner in which the CEC has arrived at its figures, we may state that this

      has been specifically mentioned by the CEC in its report. The basis of the

      calculations is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_89">                   “(a)   the production during the year 1993-94 has been considered
                          as the permissible production during each year till the mining
                          lease did not have the environmental clearance;</blockquote><p id="p_209">

</p><p id="p_210">                    (b)   the permissible production for the year in which the
                          environmental clearance was obtained for the first time has
                          been considered on pro rata basis of (a) the prescribed annual
                          production and (b) the date of the grant of the environmental
                          clearance. For this purpose the environmental clearance
                          granted on or before 15th of a month has been considered
                          valid for the entire month. Where the environmental clearance
                          has been granted after 15th of a month it has been considered
                          valid from the subsequent month. For example if the
                          environmental clearance for a mining lease has been granted
                          say on 10th October, 2008 for an annual production of say 12
                          lakh MT then in that case the permissible production for the
                          mining lease for the year 2008-09 would be taken as 6 lakh
                          MT (12x6/12 lakh MT) and 12 lakh MT per annum in the
                          subsequent year; and

</p><p id="p_211">                   (c)    wherever a mining lease having environmental clearance has
                          been granted revised environmental clearance for a higher
                          production the permissible annual production for the year,
                          during which the revised environmental clearance has been
                          granted, has been considered on pro rata basis of the
                          quantities prescribed in the earlier environmental clearance
                          and the revised environmental clearance. For example if the
                          mining lease was having environmental clearance for annual
                          production of 12 lakh MT and say on 28 th September, 2009 it
                          has been granted revised environmental clearance for annual
                          production of say 24 lakh MT then in that case the
                          permissible production for the year 2009-10 would be taken
                          as 18 lakh MT (12x6/12+24x6/12) and 24 lakh MT per
                          annum in subsequent years.”

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">Page 80 of 114</span>
</p><p id="p_212">      155. A submission made by the mining lease holders was that the maximum

      production in any year up to 1993-94 should be considered as the base for

      making the calculations. Such a contention was also urged before the CEC

      and was rejected. We have examined this contention independently and are

      of the view that the base year of 1993-94 is most appropriate - we have

      already given our reasons for this. Some lessees might lose in the process

      while some of them might benefit but that cannot be avoided. In any event,

      each mining lease holder is being given the benefit of calculations only from

      2000-01 and is not being ‘penalized’ for the period prior thereto. We think

      the mining lease holders should be grateful for this since it was submitted by

      learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned Amicus that the penalty

      should be levied from the date of EIA 1994. In our opinion, the cut-off from

      2000-2001 (without interest) is undoubtedly reasonable and there can be

      hardly be any grievance in this regard. The mining lease holders cannot

      have their cake and eat it too, along with the icing on top.

</p><p id="p_213">      156. Since the recommendation made by the CEC in this regard is not

      totally unreasonable, we accept that the compensation should be payable

      from 2000-2001 onwards at 100% of the price of the mineral, as rationalized

      by the CEC.

      Violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980

</p><p id="p_215">      157.    Before dealing with the violations of <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_134">Section 2</a> of the Forest

      (Conservation) Act, 1980 (for short ‘the FCA’), it is necessary to give a brief

      background.
</p>
<p id="p_216">      158.     The FCA came into operation initially through the Forest

      (Conservation) Ordinance, 1980 with effect from 25th October, 1980. The

      said Ordinance was repealed and subsequently the FCA came into effect on

      25th December, 1980.
</p>
<p id="p_217">      159. Section 2 of the FCA provides that no State Government or other

      authority shall make, except with the prior approval of the Central

      Government, any order directing, inter alia, that any forest land or any

      portion thereof may be used for non-forest purposes.

</p><p id="p_218">      160.    The interpretation of Section 2 of the FCA first came up for

      consideration in <a href="/doc/1476082/" id="a_135">State of Bihar v. Banshi Ram Modi</a>. 12 In that case, Banshi

      Ram Modi was granted a mining lease for mining and winning mica.

      During the course of mining operations, feldspar and quartz were

      discovered. Modi then applied to the Central Government to include these

      minerals in the lease. The State Government agreed to do so but did not

      obtain the previous approval of the Central Government for the inclusion of

      the two minerals in the original lease.
</p>
<p id="p_219">      161. The Central Government took the view that since its previous approval

      had not been obtained for inclusion of feldspar and quartz in the mining

      lease, Modi could not be permitted to mine these two minerals. This led

      Modi to approach the High Court with the contention that he was not

      breaking up or clearing any forest land other than the land on which mining

      operations were already being carried on. The High Court allowed the writ

      petition but feeling aggrieved, the State of Bihar preferred an appeal in this

      Court.
</p>
<p id="p_220">      162. The question before this Court was a narrow one, namely, whether

      prior approval of the Central Government is necessary in respect of a mining

      lease, granted for winning a certain mineral prior to the coming into force of

      the FCA, if the lessee applies to the State Government after the FCA came

      into force for permission to win and carry any new mineral from the broken

      up area?
</p>
<p id="p_221">      163. While answering this question in the negative, it was held that after the

      commencement of the FCA no fresh breaking up of forest land or no fresh

      clearing of the forest on any such land could be permitted by the State

      Government or any authority without the approval of the Central

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">Page 83 of 114</span>
      Government. However, in respect of broken up land, it was held that if the

      State Government permits the lessee to remove any discovered mineral, it

      cannot be said that there has been a violation of Section 2 of the FCA

      particularly since there is no breaking up of any fresh forest land.

</p><p id="p_222">      164. Subsequently in <a href="/doc/1186098/" id="a_136">Ambica Quarry Works v. State of Gujarat and Ors</a> 13

      when the lease of the mining holder came up for renewal, the FCA had

      already come into force. Since the forest department of the State of Gujarat

      refused to give a no objection certificate, the application for renewal of the

      lease was rejected. The question that arose for consideration was whether,

      after coming into force of the FCA, the mining lease holder was entitled to

      renewal of the mining lease. While answering the question in the negative

      this Court held that the renewal of a lease cannot be claimed as a matter of

      right. The primary purpose of the FCA was to prevent deforestation and

      ecological imbalance as a result of deforestation. Therefore, the primary

      duty under the FCA was to the community and the obligation to society must

      predominate over the obligation to the individuals. While distinguishing

      Banshi Ram Modi this Court held that renewal of the lease would lead to

      further deforestation or at least it would not help in reclaiming the area

      where deforestation had already taken place. The primary purpose of the
13 (1987) 1 SCC 213


W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">Page 84 of 114</span>
      FCA is to prevent further deforestation and any interpretation must sub-serve

      that purpose and implement the FCA. Under the circumstances, it was held,

      considering the scheme of the FCA that refusal to renew the lease without

      prior approval of the Central Government was not unjustified.

</p><p id="p_223">      165. This view was reiterated in <a href="/doc/104313664/" id="a_137">Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra

      v. State of U.P</a>.14      It was held that the FCA does not permit mining in a

      forest area. Reiterating the view expressed in Ambica Quarry Works, it was

      observed that compliance of Section 2 of the FCA is necessary as a

      condition precedent even for the renewal of a mining lease. This Court went

      so far as to hold that if any decree or order has already been obtained by any

      of the mining lease holders, from any Court relating to renewal of their

      lease, the same shall stand vacated and similarly, any appeal or other

      proceeding taken to obtain a renewal or against any order or decree granting

      renewal shall also become non est.

      up for consideration in <a href="/doc/1725193/" id="a_138">T.N. Godavarman v. Union of India</a>.15            In its

      decision of 12th December, 1996 this Court observed that during the course

      of hearing it appeared that there is a misconception about the true scope of


14 (1989) Supp. (1) SCC 504

15 (1997) 2 SCC 267

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">Page 85 of 114</span>
      the FCA and the meaning of the word ‘forest’ used therein. Consequently,

      there is also a misconception about the need for prior approval of the Central

      Government as mandated by Section 2 of the FCA in respect of certain

      activities in a forest area, which activities are more often of a commercial

      nature.
</p>
<p id="p_225">      167. In this context, it was held that ‘forest’ must be understood according

      to its dictionary meaning and it would cover all statutorily recognized

      forests, whether designated, reserved, protected or otherwise. It was further

      held that ‘forest’ would also include any area recorded as a forest in the

      government records irrespective of the ownership. With this in mind, this

      Court directed that prior approval of the Central Government is required for

      any non-forest activity within the area of any ‘forest’. In accordance with

      Section 2 of the FCA all on-going activity within any forest in any State

      throughout the country, without prior approval of the Central Government

      must cease forthwith. This particular direction given by this Court is of

      immense significance.
</p>
<p id="p_226">      168. This Court further directed each State Government to constitute within

      one month an Expert Committee, inter alia, to identify areas which are

      ‘forest’ irrespective of whether they are so notified, recognized or classified

      under any law and irrespective of the ownership of the land of such forest.

      effect from 12th December, 1996.        The only issue that remained was

      identification of all such lands by the District Level Committees and as

      mentioned above this exercise was completed by the State of Odisha on or

      about 6th January, 1998. The lands identified by the DLC are compendiously

      26th April, 2010. It was recommended by the CEC that given the peculiar

      circumstances prevailing in the State of Odisha, mining operations in the

      entire DLC lands included in the mining leases, may be allowed to continue

      on payment of the Net Present Value (NPV) subject to the fulfillment of

      additional NPV as well as an amount towards penal compensatory

      afforestation has been paid by the defaulting mining lease holders, the

      or unlawful mining in forest lands stands regularized.

</p><p id="p_237">      177. The CEC did not accept this submission made on behalf of the mining

      the violation of Section 2 of the FCA.
</p>
<p id="p_238">      178. We are of opinion that the view expressed by the CEC in this regard is

      partially correct. Given the fact that the defaulting mining lease holders have

      been asked to pay and have paid additional NPV as well as an amount

      towards penal compensatory afforestation, it must be assumed the violation

      of the FCA has been condoned to a limited extent, more particularly since in

      its order dated 7th May, 2010 this Court permitted the State of Odisha to

      accept such recommendations of the CEC made in the report dated 26 th

      April, 2010 as are acceptable to it. The relevant recommendations made by

                   Hon’ble Court while permitting grant of Temporary Working
                   Permission to the mines in Orissa and Goa has made it one of the
                   pre-conditions that the NPV will be paid for the entire forest area
                   included in the mining leases. Similarly, all the mining lease holders
                   in Orissa should be directed to pay the NPV for the entire forest area,
                   included in the mining leases;
</p>
<p id="p_240">                   (d)    In Orissa, substantial areas included in the mining leases as
                   non forest land have subsequently been identified as DLC forest
                   (deemed forest/forest like areas) by the Expert Committee
                   constituted by the State Government pursuant to this Hon’ble
                   Court’s order dated 12.12.1996. While processing and/or approving
                   the proposals under the FC Act in many cases such areas have been
                   treated as non-forest land. It is recommended that (i) the NPV for
                   the entire DLC area included in the mining lease, after deducting the
                   NPV already paid, should be deposited by the concerned lease
                   holder and (ii) the mining operations in the unbroken DLC land
                   (virgin land) should be permissible only if the permission under the
                   FC Act has been obtained/is obtained for such area. Keeping in view
                   the peculiar circumstances as was existing in Orissa and subject to
                   the above, the mining operations in the broken DLC land may be

      this Court on 12th December, 1996 followed by the order dated 4th March,

      1997 namely that mining must cease forthwith in forest areas. In regard to

      this violation, the only benefit (at best) that can be granted to the mining

      lease holders that we are concerned with, is till 6 th January, 1998 when the

      affidavit was filed in this Court in I.A.Nos. 2746-2748 of 2009 in T.N.

      Godavarman. With effect from 7th January, 1998 any mining activity in

      forest and DLC lands would clearly be completely illegal and unauthorized

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">Page 91 of 114</span>
      and the benefit that the mining lease holders have derived from this illegal

      mining would be subject to <a href="/doc/60667211/" id="a_141">Section 21(5)</a> of the MMDR Act. Therefore, the

      price of the iron ore and manganese ore mined by the mining lease holders

      from 7th January, 1998 is payable until forest clearance under Section 2 of

      the FC Act is obtained by the mining lease holders.
</p>
<p id="p_242">      180. The report of the CEC dated 16th October, 2014 deals with 51 mining

      leases. It has been recorded by the CEC that of them 15 mining leases have

      been found not involved in undertaking mining operations in violation of the

      FCA. There are 16 mining leases that have violated the provisions of the

      FCA between 25th October, 1980 and 1999-2000 and the State Government

      in some of the cases has already issued a show cause notice to the mining

      lease holders. It is further stated that most of the violations pertain to the

      period prior to 12th December, 1996. The CEC has not made any particular

      recommendation in regard to these 16 mining leases nor do we, except to

      direct the State Government to promptly take a decision on the show cause

      notice preferably within a period of four months and in any case before 31 st

      December, 2017.
</p>
<p id="p_243">      181. The CEC has also dealt with 18 others mining lease holders (other than

      M/s. Essel Mining and Industries Ltd. relating to the Kasia Iron Ore Mines

      and Jilling-Langlotta Iron &amp; Manganese Ore Mines). With regard to these

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">Page 92 of 114</span>
      18 mining lease holders, the view taken by us above would hold good and

      clearly they are liable to compensate the State for the entire price of the iron

      ore and manganese ore illegally mined with effect from 7 th January, 1998

      until the forest clearance was obtained by the concerned mining lease holder.

</p><p id="p_244">      182. We have fixed 7th January, 1998 as the cut-off date despite the orders

      dated 12th December, 1996 and 4th March, 1997 only for the reason that it is

      possible that some mining lease holders (we do not know how many) were

      not aware that they were inadvertently conducting mining operations on

      DLC lands which were identified by the State of Odisha as forest lands on

      the directions of this Court.     For the purposes of <a href="/doc/60667211/" id="a_142">Section 21(5)</a> of the

<blockquote id="blockquote_96">                   “It will be seen that in the above cases the mining operations have
                   been done in the forest land in violation of the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_143">Forest (Conservation)
                   Act</a>, 1980 and consequently also in violation of this Hon’ble Court
                   order dated 12.12.1996. The CEC recommends that 70% of the
                   notional value of the iron ore and manganese produced by the
                   lessees by undertaking mining operations in the forest land in

                   be recovered from the respective lessees. Wherever the mineral
                   production is both from the forest land as well as non-forest land
                   then in such cases the notional value of the production from the
                   forest land may be calculated on pro rata basis of the extent of the
                   forest land and non-forest land involved. The notional value of the
                   mineral, time limit for payment of the compensation, use of the

</blockquote><p id="p_246">      183. For the reasons that we have already expressed above, we are not in

      agreement with the CEC that only a part of the notional value (in this case

      70%) of the iron ore and manganese ore produced by the mining lease

      holders should be recovered. We are of the view that <a href="/doc/60667211/" id="a_145">Section 21(5)</a> of the

      MMDR Act should be given full effect and so we reiterate that the recovery

      should be to the extent of 100%.
</p>
<p id="p_247">      184. There may be some overlap in the period when mining operations were

      conducted by the mining lease holders without an EC and/or an FC. We

      make it clear that mineral extracted either without an EC or without an FC or

      without both would attract the provisions of <a href="/doc/60667211/" id="a_146">Section 21(5)</a> of the MMDR Act

      and 100% of the price of the illegally or unlawfully mined mineral must be

      compensated by the mining lease holder. To the extent of the overlap or the

      common period, obviously only one set of compensation is payable by the

      mining lease holder to the State of Odisha. We order accordingly. However,

      we make it clear that whatever payment has already been made by the

      mining lease holders towards NPV, additional NPV or penal compensatory

      afforestation is neither adjustable nor refundable since that falls in a different

      category altogether.

      has been any violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/532738/" id="a_162">Section 6</a> of the MMDR Act.

</p><p id="p_266">      194. As far as Jindal Steel &amp; Power Limited is concerned, we propose to

      that it is the benami holder of Sarda Mines Pvt. Ltd. If it is so held to be a

      benami holder of Sarda Mines Pvt. Ltd. then there is a violation of <a href="/doc/532738/" id="a_163">Section 6</a>

      of the MMDR Act. However, the CEC has refrained from making any

      observations or recommendation in this regard. Accordingly, we propose to

      been shown to the contrary, we accept the recommendation of the CEC in

<p id="p_268">      Violation of Rule 37 of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960

</p><p id="p_269">      196. The CEC has discussed the possible violation of Rule 37 of the MCR.

      In this context, it was noted that there were several mining lease holders who



W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">Page 100 of 114</span>

      by filing revision petitions under <a href="/doc/193683108/" id="a_165">Section 30</a> of the MMDR Act read with

      Rule 55 of the MCR before the Central Government. The challenge to the

      show cause notice was on the ground that persons who were not government

      servants could not have been included in the Committee and also that the

      Committee was not notified in the official gazette as required by <a href="/doc/140090159/" id="a_166">Section

      26(2)</a> of the MMDR Act.
</p>
<p id="p_274">      200. The Central Government set aside the order constituting the

      Committee and the State of Odisha has challenged the orders of the Central

      Government before the Orissa High Court through writ petitions. We are

      told that the writ petitions filed by the State of Odisha are pending in the

      High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_275">      201. As far as Aryan is concerned, we were informed that the matter was

      pending with the State of Odisha and a request was made to us to permit the

      State of Odisha to pass a final order on the submissions made by Aryan. On

      28th April, 2017 we had permitted the State of Odisha to pass final orders but

      we are not aware whether any orders have since been passed.

      appearing for some of the mining lease holders that it might be appropriate if

      the raising contracts between these eight mining lease holders and the raising

      contractors are given a fresh look. This suggestion was not acceptable to

      one of the mining lease holders. However, we are of opinion that the

      suggestion is reasonable and it will be appropriate if in fact a fresh look is

      given to the raising contracts entered into by the mining lease holders and

      the raising contractors. We are also of opinion that such an order ought to be

      passed with the consent of the mining lease holders since any delay in

      disposal of the issue would not really sub-serve the interests of anybody

      including the mining lease holders.

<p id="p_278">      204.    Accordingly, for considering the appointment of an appropriate

      Committee in respect of the eight mining lease holders mentioned above we

      would like to hear learned counsel for the parties. We make it clear that the

      proposed Committee will be entitled to lift the corporate veil, the importance

      of which in cases such as the present, has been emphasized in <a href="/doc/50527052/" id="a_167">State of

      Intergenerational equity

</p><p id="p_279">      205. Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel for the petitioner sought to

      impress upon us the need to consider intergenerational equity and if possible

      to place a limit on the extent of mining in the State of Odisha by referring to

      an article titled: “Intergenerational equity: a legal framework for global

      environment change” by Edith Brown Weiss. He laid emphasis on three

      principles that form the basis of intergenerational equity.

</p><p id="p_280">      206. The first principle relied on is called the principle of ‘conservation of

      options’. This requires each generation to conserve the diversity of the

      natural and cultural resource base in such a manner that the options available

      to future generations are not restricted. It was submitted that the extent of

      mining activities being carried on in Odisha indicate that the entire iron ore

      will perhaps be fully extracted within a period of 30 years and nothing

      would be available for future generations. Therefore some sort of a limit

      would have to be placed on the mining operations.
</p>
<p id="p_281">      207. The second principle relied on is the principle of ‘conservation of

      quality’. This was with reference to the submission that future generations

      should not be subjected to a quality of the planet worse than what it is today.

      In other words, future generations are also entitled to quality enjoyment of

      the diversity in the natural and cultural resource base.

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">Page 104 of 114</span>
</p><p id="p_282">      208. The third principle relied upon was the principle of ‘conservation of

      access’ which is to say that future generations have an equitable right to

      access the diversity of the natural and cultural resource base as is available

      to the present generation.
</p>
<p id="p_283">      209. There is no doubt considerable substance in the submission

      particularly if this is considered in the light of intergenerational rights and

      obligations which have been dealt with in the said article. However, it is

      really not for this Court to lay down limits on the extent of mining activities

      that should be permitted by the State of Odisha or by the Union of India.

      Nevertheless, this is an aspect that needs serious consideration by the policy

      and decision makers in our country in the governance structure. At present,

      keeping in mind the indiscriminate mining operations in Odisha, it does

      appear that there is no effective check on mining operations nor is there any

      effective mining policy. The National Mineral Policy, 2008 (effective from

      March 2008) seems to be only on paper and is not being enforced perhaps

      due to the involvement of very powerful vested interests or a failure of

      nerve. We are of opinion that the National Mineral Policy, 2008 is almost a

      decade old and a variety of changes have taken place since then, including

      (unfortunately) the advent of rapacious mining in several parts of the

      country. Therefore, it is high time that the Union of India revisits the

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">Page 105 of 114</span>
      National Mineral Policy, 2008 and announces a fresh and more effective,

      meaningful and implementable policy within the next few months and in any

      event before 31st December, 2017. We are constrained to pass this direction

      in view of the facts disclosed in these petitions and in judgments delivered

      by this Court with regard to mining in Goa and Karnataka.

      Inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation

</p><p id="p_284">      210. It was emphasized by Shri Prashant Bhushan that because of the

      rampant illegal or unlawful mining being carried out in Odisha, there should

      be an enquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (for short ‘the CBI’) to

      ascertain and determine the persons involved either in turning a Nelson’s eye

      to rampant illegal or unlawful mining or being conspirators in the activity

      and the extent of the illegal or unlawful mining. It was submitted that the

      Justice Shah Commission had very strongly recommended an inquiry

      conducted by the CBI and criminal elements being brought to book for the

      despoliation of the land.
</p>
<p id="p_285">      211. For the present, we do not propose to direct an investigation or inquiry

      by the CBI for the reason that what is of immediate concern is to learn

      lessons from the past so that rapacious mining operations are not repeated in

      any other part of the country.        This can be achieved through the

      identification of lapses and finding solutions to the problems that are faced.

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">Page 106 of 114</span>
      Undoubtedly, there have been very serious lapses that have enabled large

      scale mining activities to be carried out without forest clearance or

      environment clearance and eventually the persons responsible for this will

      need to be booked but as mentioned above, the violation of the laws and

      policy need to be prevented in other parts of the country. The rule of law

      needs to be established. We are therefore of the view that it would be

      appropriate if an Expert Committee is set up under the guidance of a retired

      judge of this Court to identify the lapses that have occurred over the years

      enabling rampant illegal or unlawful mining in Odisha and measures to

      prevent this from happening in other parts of the country.

</p><p id="p_286">      212. There is no doubt that the recommendations of the Commission can

      form a platform for the study but it is also necessary to use technology for

      maintenance of registers, records and data through computers, satellite

      imagery, videography and other technology tools so that the natural wealth

      of our country is not rapaciously exploited for the benefit of a few to the

      detriment of a large number, many of whom are tribals inhabiting the land

      for several generations.

<p id="p_297">                    11. The State Government has, earlier, registered a Society, namely,

                    Odisha, which has been registered vide registration number

                    act as SPV for the purpose. It is now proposed to wind up the said

</p><p id="p_299">      216.   It appears that the scheme has been implemented with the Chief

      Secretary of Odisha as the ex-officio Chairman of the SPV. There are several

      other members and directors of the SPV. There is no further information

      available with this Court with regard to the implementation of the scheme.

</p><p id="p_300">      217.   During the course of hearing, some of the mining lease holders

      represented by Shri Gopal Subramanium, Senior Advocate offered to deposit

      and in fact did deposit an amount of Rs.237.05 crores for utilization by the

      SPV for carrying out welfare works and activities in the districts of

      Keonjhar, Sundergarh and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. The deposit was made by

      way of a cheque on 6th April, 2017 and was without prejudice to the rights

W.P. (C) Nos. 114/2014 etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">Page 110 of 114</span>
      and contentions of lessees. In terms of our directions, the Registry has

      encashed the cheque and kept the amount in a short term fixed deposit. We

      have mentioned this only to point out that there are huge amounts available

      with the Special Purpose Vehicle for tribal welfare and area development

      works and we have absolutely no idea about the utilization of the funds or

      whether they are in fact being used for tribal welfare and area development

      works. We also expect that as a result of the orders that we are passing

      today, very large amounts will again be made available to the State of

      Odisha.    These amounts should also be kept with the Special Purpose

      Vehicle.
</p>
<p id="p_301">      218. To ensure that the amounts are utilized for the benefit of tribals in the

      affected districts and for area development works, we would like the Chief

      Secretary of Odisha to file an affidavit stating the work done as well as

      providing the audited accounts of the receipt and expenditure of the SPV

      from its inception.

      Accordingly, I.A. No. 9 (filed by S.A. Karim) is also dismissed but as being

      infructuous. However, it is made clear that the State Government should

      ensure that the lessee S.A. Karim in fact has valid statutory clearances.

      have enabled rampant illegal and unlawful mining in Odisha and to

      recommend preventive measures not only to the State of Odisha but
