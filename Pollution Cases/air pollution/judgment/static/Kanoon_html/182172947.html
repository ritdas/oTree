<p id="p_12">	 FACTUAL
MATRIX
 


 


 


	In
the present petition, a very grave and serious problem of pollution
caused by dyeing and printing industry at Jetpur has been highlighted
before this Court. Jetpur is situated in Saurashtra (part of Gujarat)
about 65 kms. from Rajkot city. The town of Jetpur has about 1170
dyeing and printing units. Around 40,000 workers earn their
livelihood by working in such dyeing and printing units at Jetpur. It
appears that the units have formed an association, named, the Jetpur
Dyeing &amp; Printing Association (for short, 'JDPA'). It appears
that around 30.00 MLD water is used for washing of sarees every day
and at the end of the day, the trade effluent is discharged into a
pond named as "Fatal Talav". It also appears that
majority of the units use their own water and  space facility for
washing their printed materials within their units, but those who do
not have this facility, send their product to washing ghats located
in the surrounding villages covering 40 kms. of the area. Some of the
dyeing units, inspite of having their own washing systems, outsource
their washing job to increase their daily production. It also appears
that some of such washing ghats were illegally constructed and were
being used without any permission or sanction from any competent
authority. Such ghats have a capacity to cater to the requirement of 
five to seven dyeing &amp; printing units per ghat.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_13">	It
also appears that well-developed natural drainage in the surrounding
area of Jetpur town tempted the dyeing &amp; printing units to
discharge their effluents directly into the nearby drainage without
any treatment. This resulted in adverse effect on the water resource.
To curb this problem, the authority concerned forced the units to
implement the Common Sewerage Treatment plant (for short, 'CETP') for
disposal of waste water. However, inspite of such steps being taken
by the authority, majority of the units continue to outsource washing
job to illegal ghats, and thereby, divert the untreated discharge to
natural drainage, and as a result of this, the ground water
pollution in streams, ponds, rivulets, rivers got contaminated
thereby, directly affecting the cattle and the soil. When such water
is being used for the purpose of irrigation, it result in built-up of
a secondary salinization/alkalinization, affecting the production of
crop.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_14">	This
petition was filed in the year 2009. This Court has been monitoring
this petition for almost more than three years. On 15th
January 2009, a Division Bench of this Court took cognizance of this
pollution problem for the first time and directed the respondent No.3
</p><p id="p_15">- Gujarat Pollution Control Board, to submit its report.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_16">	On
receipt of the report filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board,
this Court asked the learned Government Pleader to ascertain whether
any unit was functioning illegally without the consent of the Gujarat
Pollution Control Board, and if so, what action had been taken by the
District Collector. Thereafter, on 24th July 2009, it was
reported to this Court that about 900 industrial units are
functioning in that area and the District Collector had initiated
various course of actions. It was also stated that raw-materials like
gum, starch, synthetic dyes, acetic acid, caustic soda and sodium
silicate are used by the textile processing units in the dyeing and
printing process of fabrics. It was also brought to the notice of
this Court that various complaints had been received by the GPCB.
After conducting a detailed enquiry, the GPCB noticed that some of
the units were causing serious environmental pollution and most of
the polluting units had not obtained consent from the GPCB. It was
also informed to this Court that, consequently, statutory notices had
been issued to all those units. On 24th July 2009, the
GPCB filed a report before this Court stating that they had taken
action in this regard. It was also brought to the notice of this
Court that there are effluent treatment plants and two more were
under contemplation. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_17">	Considering
the seriousness of the matter, this Court directed the GPCB to submit
periodical report, with the interval of three months, after assessing
the situation, and also directed to state as to what further actions
were taken against the polluting units. On 28th June 2010,
this Court directed the GPCB and the respondent No.4 to undertake
joint measures to demolish all unauthorized washing ghats. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_18">	On
27th July 2012, a Division Bench of this Court passed the
following order:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_19">"Inspite
of the order dated 28th June, 2010, the 4th
respondent has not made clear whether he has taken joint measures
with Gujarat Pollution Control Board to demolish unauthorised washing
ghats. No affidavit or report has been filed. By way of last chance,
we allow two weeks' time to 4th respondent to file action
taken report failing which, the 4th respondent will appear
before the Court in person on the next date and/or the Court may be
impose costs. Post the matter on 12th August, 2010 withing
10 cases in the first board.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_20">The
Pollution Control Board may also file report by that date."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_21">	Thereafter,
on 9th September 2010, the matter was taken up for further
hearing, and on that day, it was informed by the GPCB that 104
illegal washing ghats had already been demolished with the help of
the Collector, and 36 more illegal ghats were required to be
demolished. The Court was also informed that steps had been taken to
identify and demolish those ghats too. On behalf of the Association,
a statement was made that the GPCB had cleared the proposal to set up
new effluent treatment plants, for which land had already been
identified and steps had been taken to set up one new effluent
treatment plant at Derdi near Jetpur. With regard to the second
plant, land had been identified and purchased, but clearance of
Junagadh Municipalty was awaited. A statement was
also made that two common effluent treatment plants were already
functioning and, if necessary, the GPCB may monitor the two treatment
plants. Taking into consideration the steps taken by the respondents,
the following directions were issued on 9th September
2010:-  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_22">"(i)	5th
respondent is directed to complete setting up of one effluent
treatment plant at Derdi. So far as other treatment plants are
concerned, the matter be taken up with the Municipality and other
competent authorities. If there is any difficulty, in the interest of
public in general, setting up of such effluent treatment plants is
required in the local municipal area, the authority will consider the
same in accordance with law. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_23">(ii)
	The Gujarat Pollution Control Board is directed to demolish 36
identified illegal washing ghats. The Collector and the concerned
Mamlatdar will provide suitable assistance in the matter of such
demolition and report the progress to the Court. If there are more
than 36 illegal washing ghats, the petitioner will give details of
such Ghats to the competent authorities.  The Gujarat Pollution
Control Board, Rajkot and the concerned Mamlatdar in their turn will
identify and if so required, demolish such illegal washing ghats.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_24">(iii)	If
there is any Dyeing and Printing unit which is illegally functioning
in the area, without the consent of the competent authority or the
Pollution Control Board, it will be open to the petitioner to bring
the said fact to the notice of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board at
its Rajkot office.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_25">(iv)	The
competent authority and the Pollution Control Board, Rajkot is
directed to monitor the local ETPs and CEPT units atleast once in
every two months and submit its report regularly to this Court. The
next by-monthly inspection report be filed by the next date of
hearing."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_26">	On
23rd November 2010, this Court noticed, from the stand
taken by the respondents, that the effluent was being discharged in
the agricultural fields. The stand on behalf of the Association was
that such effluent was being discharged after treatment and was
suitable for the purpose of agriculture as per the agricultural
norms. Therefore, this Court passed the following order:-
</p> 


<p id="p_27">"From
the stand taken by the respondent, it appears that the effluent is
being discharged in the agricultural fields. Counsel for the 5th
respondent-Association submits that such effluent is discharged after
treatment, as per the agricultural norms. However, this Court wants
experts' opinion on the question whether discharge of such water is
polluting: (i) Agricultural crops; (ii) Agricultural fields/soil;
</p><p id="p_28">(iii) Underground water and/or; (iv) adjacent rivers; if any. Learned
counsel appearing on behalf of Gujarat Pollution Control Board will
give details of the Experts of area; including Professors of
Universities who can be requested to carry out inspection and submit
report before the Court on this issue.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_29">Let
a copy of this order be handed over to learned counsel appearing on
behalf of Gujarat Pollution Control Board.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_30">Post
the matter on 22nd December 2010."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_31">	On
22nd December 2010, the GPCB provided list of experts, and

<p id="p_39">	On
21st April 2011, this Court noticed the list of experts as
forwarded by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to find out as to
who could inspect and report to the Court that the industries at
Jetpur are polluting the agricultural fields, crops, underground
water, adjacent river, etc., and to suggest steps, if any, to avoid

</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_46">	The
First Report of the Expert Committee was placed before this Court for
its consideration, and on perusal of the said report, this Court
recorded the following order dated 5th July 2011:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_47">"From
the progress report submitted by the Experts Committee constituted by
the Court, it appears that there is pollution in the water bodies.
The flow of the streams/rivers is being contaminated by untreated
effluent from washing ghats. The contamination varies with the site
situation and the soil characteristics. From the said report, it
further appears that the Committee need the help of a Soil Analyst
and a Hydro Geologist. If it is so required, they may take the help
of them of their choice.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_48">In
the circumstances, the dyeing and printing units situated in and
around the town of Jetpur in the District of Rajkot are directed to
state as to why all the units be not closed as they are polluting the
water bodies, rivers, water dam, etc. After closure , it it is found
that one or the other unit has taken steps to rectify the defects and
is not discharging any effluent in the water bodies, rivers, dam, etc
and do not take any advantage of washing in the illegally constructed
washing ghats, the Court may order to reopen of such unit.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_49">The
Gujarat State Pollution Control Board is directed to come out with a
notice in the newspapers, one English and another Vernacular
(Gujarati) published from Rajkot and inform the dyeing and printing
units that the Court may close all the units if illegally constructed
washing ghats are not demolished immediately, and if they do not stop
discharging effluent in the water bodies, rivers, dam, agricultural
fields, etc., in such a case, no separate notice need be issued to
any individual unit.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_50">Post
the matter on 27th July 2011 withing five cases."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_51">	Thereafter,
on 27th July 2011, on behalf of the Committee constituted
by this Court, a prayer was made for extension of  time till 30th
September 2011, to submit final report. Accordingly, the Committee
was granted time up to 30th September 2011, to submit its
final report. On the same day, this Court also directed the Committee
to submit an interim report showing illegal discharge of effluents,
if any, made by any industrial unit which was causing pollution by
use of washing ghats. The GPCB was also directed to find out whether
any unit was using illegally constructed washing ghats and/or causing
pollution, and in such case, the GPCB was directed to request the
Electricity Board to disconnect the electric connection and also the
competent authority to disconnect the water connection of such units.
The GPCB was also directed to issue order for closure of such unit
without waiting for further orders from this Court.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_52">	On
6th September 2011, the second interim report was filed
before this Court by the Superintending Geo-hydrologist, Coordinator
of Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board. On consideration of the
same, this Court passed the following order:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_53">"Second
interim report has been filed by Superintending Geo Hydrologist,
Coordinator of Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board by letter
dated 25th August 20011. It appears that many of the
illicit structures and illegal washing ghats have been demolished.
There are certain more illicit structures/unauthorised washing ghats
still existing. The Committee has recommended to develop a joint
mechanism, which will have a periodical check of the area to see that
no such illicit structures are made in near future. Learned counsel
on behalf of the petitioner referring to the affidavit filed today
submitted that the illegal washing ghats are continuing to discharge
effluents directly into the river and in open land, and the Dying
Unit Supplying material to the illegal ghat. Though the aforesaid
facts has been brought to the notice of the Gujarat Pollution Control
Board, but no action has been taken. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_54">Learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the association submits that the
electrical connections of such units have been disconnected, but it
is not made clear as to why illegal washing ghats have not yet been
demolished.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_55">We
accordingly direct the Collector and the Association of the Units to
demolish all the washing ghats in the area by 21st October
2011, failing which, this Court may pass appropriate strictures
against the officers of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board,
Collector of the District and other Officers.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_56">If
the petitioner bring such fact to the notice of the Gujarat Pollution
Control Board and no demolition is made within ten days, it will be
open to the petitioner to bring such fact to the notice of this Court
at any time. Let a copy of this order be handed over to the counsel
for the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and the counsel for the
Association. Post the matter on 8th November 2011.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_57">In
the meantime, the Committee will submit its final report before this
Court. If the effluent treatment plant-DERDI pursuant to the earlier
order is not constructed, court may pass appropriate order."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_58">	Thereafter,
on 28th September 2011, a Final Report was placed before
us by the Experts Committee. We deem it fit to quote the observations
as under: 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_59">"(a)	As
any activity in a village comes easily to the notice of the concerned
Talati, it is apparent that concerned Talatis must be aware about
illegal washing ghats. However, they seem to be unconcerned about it
and feel that any reporting on this to higher authorities does not
come under their preview or responsibility.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_60">(b)	It
has already been established that the present CETP is not competent
enough to tackle treatment of effluents from both Nagarpalika and
JDPA units. Two new CET Plants have been proposed by JDPA at Derdi
and Bhatgam. Design and estimate for these projects is under process.
Delay in these projects has already resulted in illegal outsourcing
of washing and mushrooming up of illegal ghats in agricultural lands.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_61">(c)	The
illegal washing ghats also use some adjoining land for drying the
cloths. Thus agricultural land is being used for nonagricultural
purposes.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_62">(d)	As
mechanism of reporting illegal washing does not exist, no action has
been taken on any Dyeing and Printing unit for promoting illegal
ghats.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_63">(e)	In
Central Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) two levels of effluents are
drained through a common drainage network of about 35-40 kms.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_64">a.
</p><p id="p_65">	Nagarpalika effluent (About 3.0 MLD)
 


 


 


b.
</p><p id="p_66">	Process house effluent from units of Jetpur Dyeing and Printing
Association (JDPA) (about 4.0 MLD-effluent of approximately 1175 JDPA
units)
 


 


 


</p><p id="p_67">(f)	Both
the effluents have wide variation in their chemical composition. The
Nagar Palika effluent is less contaminated than the effluents of
process houses. This dilutes the process house effluent. But during
last few years water consumption by Nagarpalika has increased
manifold and the effluent has increased by 25 to 30%. The CETP is
originally designed for effluents load of 7.0 MLD only. Excess
effluent load of Nagarpalika is burdening the CETP of JDPA and hence
hampers its efficiency.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_68">(g)	The
water contaminated by effluents of illegal ghats has different color
shades (Green/Yellow/Orange), with foul odour not to the liking of
human senses.
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_69">(h)	The
washing ghats located in upstream areas are affecting the ground
water as will as river water due to contamination of effluent in
downstream area and also deteriorate the soil matrix in the fields
where it is used for irrigation.
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_70">(i)	The
effluent contaminated water fall under either salinity or alkalinity
or both. This results in secondary Salinization and alkalinization in
soils
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_71">(j)	With
a few exceptions, all the water contaminated samples have high
sodicity hazards.
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_72">(k)	On
the basis of water quality class, exceptionally (only three samples),
all the samples fall in C4S4
class; hence is not suitable for irrigation.
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_73">(l)	The
process house and ETP effluent water have BOD values higher than the
permissible limit.
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_74">(m)	No
third party assessment or Periodical performance evaluation
(Qualitatively and Quantitatively) of CETP of JDPA is being done at
present and hence no impartial report on such aspects is available.
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_75">(n)	It
has been observed that CETP inlet effluent parameters (Qualitatively
and Quantitatively) have not been fixed for all CETP members to match
with the norms of the CETP design parameters.
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_76">(o)	In
the present modern era lack of an on-line monitoring system (which is
a must for effective pollution monitoring) to check important
parameters of quality of treated water from out let of CETP is quite
visible as no such data on day to day basis is available with any
concerned agency.
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_77">(p)	No
method or model to evaluate the water audit exists in the area and
farmers use the treated effluent water for irrigation purpose without
the basic awareness about the long term effect of treated water on
soil matrix and groundwater. 
</p>
 


 
 


 


<p id="p_78">(q)	Being
rocky terrain, a good drainage system is developed in the area.
Several small and medium drains are carrying the effluents from
illegal ghats and draining in to the major drainage systems and
finally to the rivers. Such inlets to major drainage Systems and main
rivers are not being monitored peridocally by and agency. This
unchedked polluted flow will have very adverse effects on the overall
surface and groundwater regime of the area. 
</p>
 


 
 


 


<p id="p_79">(r)	The
Quantity of the effluent, released by the units, is fixed by the GPCB
at the time of sanction and is also monitored by them. However, a
common and effective monitoring system for periodical checks of the
effluent quantity to avoid the extra load on CETP has not been
established.
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_80">(s)	It
is apparent that all the effluent generated by licensed units of JDPA
has some specific production and effluents treatment norms, hence,
effluent generated will directly be proportional to the chemicals
used. However, there is no mechanism of providing stock positioning
record by JDPA to GPCB, with which an assessment model could be
developed to check the effluent intensity and concentration at
various levels. 
</p>
 


 
 


 


<p id="p_81">(t)	The
dyeing and printing units are within the vicinity of Nagarpalika but
it has no control on JDPA and does not take action on any illegal
activity, with effects the environment. 
</p>
 


 
 


 


<p id="p_82">(u)	It
is observed that maximum illegal washing ghats are situated in the
vicinity of water bodies like Uben and Chhaparwadi dams. Irrigation
department does not take any action on demolishing of such ghats.
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_83">(v)	As
Jetpur Nagarpalika does not have its own sewerage 

 


treatment
plant, untreated municipal effluents overloads the CETP  and
untreated water that does not enter the CETP must certainly be
spoiling the close by ecosystem.
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_84">(w)	Rainfall
data of the area reveals that even after better rains in last decade,
the impact of rain in dilution of pollutants in ground water is
negligible.
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_85">(x)	It
has been observed that steps are not being taken for periodical
health survey in the affected areas by some reputed medical teams,
under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_86">(y)	JDPA
has not made any considerable efforts for R &amp; D to develop
suitable technology on "Reuse of effluent water from dyeing and
printing industry, after filtration" &amp; JDPA does not have
its own effective, qualified and experienced team for monitoring of
its CETP.
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_87">(z)	A
mechanism by JDPA to provide names and addresses of defaulting units
to GPCB and other concerned agencies for suitable action is missing. 
</p>
 


 
 


 

 
 


 

<p id="p_88">	In
the said Final Report, the Committee also showed the results of
effluent contaminated water
samples which were as under:
</p> 

 
 


 


<p id="p_89">Physical
feature:
</p> 


<p id="p_90">The
water sample analysis date (Table-1) indicates that:
</p> 
	  


<p id="p_91">	All
	effluent contaminated river water is green in colour.
</p>	  


<p id="p_92">	The
	effluent from ETP and washing ghat is found yellow in colour with
	greenish tint.
</p>	  


<p id="p_93">	The
	untreated process house water is found orange in colour with
	yellowish tint, which gets converted to orange colour when diluted
	in process house.
</p>	  


<p id="p_94">	Treated
	process house water was observed to be of green colour with
	yellowish tint.
</p>	  


<p id="p_95">	It
	was also observed that waste water has foul odour, which is
	certainly not to the liking of human senses.
</p>
 


 
 


 


<p id="p_96">Chemical
Characteristics
 


The
date (Table-1) showed that:
</p> 
	  


<p id="p_97">	The
	electrical conductivity (EC) values varied from 0.91 ti 19.30 dSm-1
	with a mean value of 5.90
	dSm-1.
</p>	  


<p id="p_98">	The
	maximum values of EC range from 7.57 to 19.30 dSm-1
	  


	The
	EC values show decreasing order from Process house effluent
	contaminated water followed by washing ghat, ETP and river water.
</p>	  


<p id="p_99">	All
	the water samples, except Chhaparvadi River water at Mewasa and the
	Uben River at Bhatgam were falling in high category to salinity (C4
	class).
</p>	  


<p id="p_100">	If
	such type of effluent contaminated water is used directly for
	irrigation purpose, it in long run may cause secondary salinization
	in the irrigated fields. 
</p>	

 


 
 


 


<p id="p_101">	Thereafter,
the Committee made the following recommendations:
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_102">1.	As
any activity in a village comes easily to the notice of the concerned
Talati, District Collectors (Rajkot &amp; Junagadh) may be directed
to instruct Mamlatdar and Talaties to report about existence of any
such illegal activities in their areas. Permanent and dedicated teams
for demolition of illegal washing ghats are required to be
constituted for all affected villages.(Action-District Collector).
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_103">2.	Derdi
and Bhatgam projects of creation of new CETPs must be completed at
the earliest. As it may take some time for construction, JDPA
meanwhile should assure the authorities that they will run their
washing ghats as per the GPCB norms and will not do any illegal
out-sourcing for washing. (Action JDPA)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_104">3.	The
washing ghats have some adjoining land also for drying the cloths.
These are the agricultural lands for agricultural purposes only and
cannot be used for other purposes; this is a case of change in
assigned purpose. Against such activities legal action must be taken
by the authorities to ensure that land use does not change. If so,
action to the level of land seizure should be recommended.
(Action-Revenue Department)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_105">4.	Any
Dyeing and Printing unit promoting illegal ghats must be closed for a
minimum period of 6 months. (Action-GPCB)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_106">5.	In
Central Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) two levels of effluents are
coming with one drainage systems. The Nagarpalika must have separate
sewerage treatment plant for their municipal waste and treated water
from this plant should be used to dilute the industrial effluent
before sending it to the CETP for subsequent treatment. This will
enhance the efficiency of CETP/ (Action-Nagarpalika, JDPA &amp; GPCB)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_107">6.	Periodical
performance evaluation (Qualitatively and Quantitatively) of CETP and
JDPA must be done by third party (like NEERI) (Action-JDPA)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_108">7.	CETP
inlet effluent parameters ( Qualitatively and quantitatively) should
be fixed for all CETP members to match with the norms of the CETP
design parameters. (Action- JDPA &amp; CETP members)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_109">8.	On-line
monitoring system of important parameters at the out let of CETP
should be installed by JDPA, so that quality of treated water from
CETP can be regularly checked by GPCB authorities for corrective
actions, if required. (Action-JDPA)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_110">9.	There
is a need of effluent water audit. The treated effluent from CETP
must be periodically checked by some third party like NEERI or any
other agency. This will help to the farmers to assure themselves to
use the treated effluent water for irrigation purpose.(Action-JDPA)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_111">10.	Being
rocky terrain, a good drainage (natural rivulet system) is developed
in the area. Several small and medium drains (rivulets) carry the
effluents from illegal ghats and drain them in to the bigger rivulets
and finally to the major rivers. All inlets of such major drainage
Systems and main rivers should be monitored periodically be GPCB.
(Action-GPCB)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_112">11.	The
Quantity of the effluent, released by the units, is fixed by the GPCB
at the time of sanction and is also monitored by them. However, a
common and effective monitoring system (GPCB + Agriculture + Water
expert + administration) should be established for periodical checks
of the effluent quantity to avoid the extra load on CETP (Action- All
concerned agencies)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_113">12.	As
the effluent is being generated by JDPA, and all licensed units have
some specific production and effluents treatment norms. Stock of the
chemicals required for such treatments should be checked periodically
be all monitoring agencies. (Action-GPCB)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_114">13.	Power
supply bills of treatment plants should be checked regularly to
ensure the operational status by all monitoring agencies.
(Action-GPCB &amp; District Collector)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_115">14.	As
the dyeing and printing units are within the vicinity of Nagarpalika,
they should have control on JDPA. No such activity should be allowed
which effects the environment. (Action-Jetpur Nagarpalika)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_116">15.	It
is observed that maximum illegal washing ghats are situated in the
vicinity of water bodies like Uben and Chhaparwadi dams. Irrigation
Department shall issue specific directives that no water abstraction
activity should be done in the near vicinity of the dam for any
washing ghats. Therefore, the irrigation department should take
immediate action on closing and demolishing of such ghats and get
assurance from the civic body that they will not allow ton develop
such washing ghats in future. (Action-Irrigation Department)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_117">16.	Nagarpalika
should also have some reserve funds available with them to meet the
unforessen expenses related to O &amp; M and up-gradation of sewerage
treatment plant. (Action-Jetpur Nagarpalika)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_118">17.	Rainfall
date of the area reveal that even after better rains in last decade,
the impact of rain in dilution of pollutants in ground water is
negligible. Therefore, it is recommended that ground, water recharge
activity by providing suitable recharge structures should be
promoted. This will help in control the run-off and storing ground
water which will dilute the pollutants. (Action-Water Resources
Department)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_119">18.	Under
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), periodical health survey in
the affected areas must be done by National Institute of Occupational
Health (NIOH) or some reputed hospital teams. This will help to
assess the impact of surface/ground water on human health. A
permanent record should be maintained. (Action-JDPA)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_120">19.	R
&amp; D on developing suitable technology on "Reuse of effluent
water from dyeing and printing industry, after filtration" is
required to be done. JDPA must make sincere efforts to use their
effluent water, after treatment as recycled water. (Action-JDPA)
 


 
 


 


</p><p id="p_121">20.	JDPA
must have its own dedicated team for monitoring of its CETP. The team
should comprise of qualified and experienced personnel for Operation

<p id="p_126">	After
the receipt of the Final Report of the Committee of Experts, the
matter was further adjudicated and it was jointly submitted on behalf
of the GPCB as well as the Association that they would like to give
suggestions to this Court in respect of the report given by the said
Committee. Accordingly, we permitted both the respondents i.e.
respondent No. 5 and the GPCB vide order dated 9th
February 2012 to give their suggestions to the Committee, which had
already submitted its report. The Committee submitted its
supplementary report dated 9th April 2012 after
considering the suggestions made by the Association dated 22nd
February 2012 as well as the suggestions of the GPCB, and after
careful study of the suggestions of the Association, the Committee
once again revisited some of the sites at Jetpur and also discussed
the matter. Accordingly, few suggestions of the Committee were
modified. Few salient features of the supplementary report submitted
by the Committee on 9th April 2012 are as under: 
</p>
 


 


 
	  


<p id="p_127">	The
	Committee recommended that in an emergent situation or gross
	violation of any of the norms or rules or regulations, it should be
	kept open for the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to involve other
	Government machineries even for a limited period.
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_128">	The
	Committee agreed that it would not be in the fitness of things to
	involve Talati of a particular area but the Collector or the
	Mamlatdar of a particular area could be asked to keep a close watch
	over the units, and if any illegal activity is noticed, then they
	should inform the Gujarat Pollution Control Board.
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_129">	The
	Committee was of  the opinion that dyeing of sarees or clothes by
	itself would not create pollution as it is a practice followed since
	time immemorial. However, the Committee suggested that the activity
	of dyeing should be undertaken in such a manner that it would have
	no adverse effect on the agricultural activities. 
</p>	
	 


	
	  


<p id="p_130">	The
	Committee further suggested that one sewerage treatment plant having
	the capacity of 50 lac liters per day must be constructed at the
	cost of the Association and the Association must be asked to operate
	such sewerage treatment plant on behalf of the Nagarpalika till the
	Nagarpalika makes its own sewerage treatment plant.
</p>
 


 

 

<p id="p_131">	An
undertaking on oath has also been filed on behalf of the respondent
No.5-Association through its President,  wherein, it has undertaken
to abide by the recommendations of the Experts Committee including
the supplementary report.  The respondent No.5 has also undertaken to
complete the construction of common Effluent Treatment Plant at
Bhatgam within a period of  two and a half years i.e. by November
2014, and make it functional. The Association has also undertaken to
identify outlet site in place of Derdi by December 2012, and will
report about the same to the GPCB. The Association has undertaken to
complete the construction within two and a half years from the date
of NOC and approval from the GPCB. The Association has also
undertaken to treat municipal sewerage by constructing a sewerage
treatment plant having capacity of treating 50 lac liters sewerage
per day, and after treatment, its treated effluent would be taken
over to the CETP for further treatment. The Association has
undertaken to complete the construction of such STP within a period
of  6 to 8 months from today at its cost and will continue to treat
waste water/effluent till Jetpur municipality makes its own treatment
plant in approximately a period of five years.

<p id="p_132">	After
taking into consideration the aforesaid factual background of the
entire litigation, now time has come for us to decide as to whether,
we should close this Public Interest Litigation, by issuing
appropriate final directions or we should continue to monitor the
progress for a further period in the interest of the people at large.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_133">	The
Supreme Court in Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum v/s. Union of India,
reported in (1996)5 SCC 647, considered in detail the "sustainable
development" to the extent which has been recognised under the
international law and also its practicability under the environmental
laws in India. The Supreme Court in the said judgment held that the
"precautionary principle" and "the polluter pays"
principle have been accepted as part of the law of the land. The
relevant part of the judgment is as under : 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_134">"11.
</p><p id="p_135">Some of the salient principles of "Sustainable Development",
as called out from Brundtland Report and other international
documents, are Inter-Generational Equity, Use and Conservation of
Natural Resources, Environmental Protection, the Precautionary
Principle, Polluter Pays Principle, Obligation to Assist and
Co-operate, Eradication of Poverty and Financial Assistance to the
developing countries. We are, however, of the view that "The
Precautionary Principle" and "The Polluter Pays"
principle are essential features of "Sustainable Development."
The "Precautionary Principle" - in the context of the
municipal law - means :
</p> 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_136">Environmental
	measures - by the State Government and the statutory authorities -
	must anticipate, prevent and attack the causes of environmental
	degradation.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_137">Where
	there are threats of serious and irreversible damage, lack of
	scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing
	measures to prevent environmental degradation. 
</p>	
	 

<p id="p_138">The
	"Onus of proof' is on the actor or the developer/industrialist
	to show that his action is environmentally benign.
</p>	 



 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_139">"The
	Polluter Pays" principle has been held to be a sound principle
	by this Court in Indian Council for <a href="/doc/1356184/" id="a_5">Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of
	India</a>, (1996)3 SCC 212. The Court observed:
</p>	 


	 

<p id="p_140">"We
	are of the opinion that any principle evolved in this behalf should
	be simple, practical and suited to the conditions obtaining in this
	country".
</p>	 


	 

<p id="p_141">The
	Court ruled that:
</p>	 


	 

<p id="p_142">"...once
	the activity carried on is hazardous or inherently dangerous, the
	person carrying on such activity is liable to make good the loss
	caused to any other person by his activity irrespective of the fact
	Whether he took reasonable care While carrying on his activity. The
	rule is premised upon the very nature of the activity carried on".
</p>	
	
	 


	 

<p id="p_143">Consequently
	the polluting industries are ''absolutely liable to compensate for
	the harm caused by them to villagers in the affected area, to the
	soil and to the underground water and hence, they are bound to take
	all necessary measures to remove sludge and other pollutants lying
	in the affected areas". The ''Polluter Pays'' principle as
	interpreted by this Court means that the absolute liability for harm
	to the environment extends not only to compensate the victims of
	pollution but also the cost of restoring the environmental
	degradation. Remediation of the damaged environment is part of the
	process of ''Sustainable Development'' and as such polluter is
	liable to pay the cost to the individual sufferers as well as the
	cost of reversing the damaged ecology.
</p>	 


	 


	  

<p id="p_144">The
	Precautionary Principle and the Polluter Pays Principle have been
	accepted as part of the law of the land. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_6">Article 21</a> of the
	Constitution of India guarantees protection of life and personal
	liberty. Articles 47, 48A and 51-A(g) of the Constitution are as
	under :
</p>	 



 


<p id="p_145">"47.
</p><p id="p_146">Duty of the State to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of
living and to improve public health- The State shall regard the
raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its

</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_151">	We
heard Mr.Dipak H.Sindhi, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner, Mr.P.K.Jani, 
learned Government Pleader,
appearing for the respondent Nos.1, 2 and 4, Ms.Dharmishta Raval and
Mrs.Kalpana K.Raval, learned advocates for the respondent No.3 -
GPCB, Mr.M.C.Bhatt, learned senior counsel, appearing with
Mr.R.D.Raval for the respondent No.5 - Association and Mr.R.R.Trivedi
appearing with Mr.Bhavesh P.Trivedi, learned advocate, for the
respondent No.6 - Jetpur Nagarpalika. 
</p>
 


 


 

<p id="p_152">	Having
heard the learned counsel for the respective parties and having gone
through the materials on record, we are of the opinion that the level
of pollution at Jetpur and surrounding areas
was alarming. We are of the view that monitoring for some more time
at our end is still necessary to protect the ecologically-fragile
Jetpur Taluka. We may only say that it is only when this Court
started looking into this matter that the authorities concerned
thought fit to take appropriate steps. Over a period of time, the
situation has improved to a considerable extent, and we are sure that
with the cooperation of one and all, the ecological conditions at
Jetpur and its surrounding areas can be made much better and all
endeavours must be made to take care of the problem of water
pollution and soil pollution. On suggestions being made by the GPCB
and other authorities, many units were ordered to be closed down, and
most of the illegal washing ghats where illegal washing activities
were being undertaken, have been demolished. However, it appears
that, there are still few washing ghats which may not be authorised
by the GPCB are still continuing with the activity leading to
pollution. After assessing the situation and being satisfied about
the steps being taken to curb the problem of pollution, we also
started passing orders of trial run of such units, whereby the units
are given a chance to start its operation and the GPCB would monitor
the same and place its report as to whether the units are complying
with all the norms and should be permitted to continue its operation.
Many individual petitions by the respective unit have been preferred
and are still pending before this Court. We have extended the order
of the trial run time and again on being satisfied that the concerned
unit is complying with the norms and is not creating any pollution.
Wherever GPCB have objected saying that the unit has failed to comply
with the norms and is creating pollution, we have authorized GPCB to
close down such Units. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_153">	As
stated above, we do not close this Public Interest Litigation but
would like to issue few directions and continue to monitor the
further progress in the matter for some more time. Thus, we issue the
following directions:
</p> 


 


 
	  

<p id="p_154">In
	all pending writ petitions of individual units, wherein we have
	ordered trial run, we direct the GPCB to permit such individual
	units to give three months trial run from today. However, it is
	clarified that during this period of three months, the GPCB shall
	continue to inspect
	the respective unit periodically, preferably every 15 days, and if
	it is found by the GPCB at any point of time that a particular unit
	is creating pollution or is not complying with the directions issued
	by this Court or the GPCB, it shall be open for the GPCB to
	immediately pass an order of closure as recommended by the Experts
	Committee. On expiry of period of three months' trial run, the
	respective unit shall directly apply with the GPCB for further
	extension of three months' trial run, and on such application being
	made, the GPCB shall decide the same and pass necessary orders in
	accordance with law.
</p>	 


	
	  

<p id="p_155">Respondent
	no.3 - GPCB shall organize a task force or a team, if
	necessary, and it would also be open for the GPCB to mobilize other
	departmental officers of the State for strict implementation of our
	directions as well as the recommendations of the Experts Committee.
</p>	 


	
	  

<p id="p_156">There
	should be periodical inspection of the entire area so far as illegal
	washing ghats are concerned, and if any person is found operating
	such illegal washing ghats, the District
	Collector/Mamlatdar/Association is directed to inform the GPCB so
	that appropriate steps could be taken by the GPCB.
</p>	 


	
	  

<p id="p_157">We
	also direct the District Collector/Mamlatdar to take immediate steps
	for demolition of such illegal washing
	ghats and also to take necessary legal action against the owner of
	the land who may have permitted construction of such illegal washing
	ghats.
</p>	 


	
	  

<p id="p_158">Respondent

	Junagadh, operational at any cost, within a period of two and a half
	years, that is, by November 2014. Respondent No. 5 Association shall
	exhibit promptness so far as construction of CETP at Bhatgam is
	concerned, as undertaken by the Association. 
</p>	
	 


	
	  

<p id="p_161">Respondent

	GPCB instead of Derdi for setting up of CETP, within a period of
	three months from today, that is, by December 2012, and the GPCB is
	directed to immediately issue necessary NOC in that regard. 
</p>	
	 


	
	  

<p id="p_162">Respondent
	No.5 Association is directed to complete the construction of CETP at
	such outlet site within a period of two and a half years from the
	date of obtaining an NOC from the GPCB.

	mentioned in Annexures-I and II, and in case of any violation of any

have issued comprehensive directions for achieving the end result in
this case. We direct the Registry of this Court to notify this matter
after a period of six months from today.
