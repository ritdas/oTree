UH-II/2018 dated 16.08.2018 of the 2nd respondent rejecting

representation dated 26.07.2018 made requesting restoration of

directions issued by this Court in W.P (PIL) No.165 of 2018.

UH-II/2018-1587 dated 17.07.2018 issued by 2nd respondent can be

traced to W.P (PIL) No.165 of 2018 filed by one S.Ramachandra

Reddy against the petitioner herein.             W.P (PIL) No.165 of 2018

was filed complaining inaction of respondents therein, particularly

respondent     Nos.2    to       4   in   considering   and   disposing   of

representations filed by S.Ramachandra Reddy against the alleged

violation of Environmental Laws by M/s Giridhari Explosives Private

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.       On 18.07.2018, W.P (PIL).No.165 of 2018 was

disposed of and the operative portion of the order reads thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                     "Under the aforenoted facts and circumstances,
             recording the fact-situation obtained as on today, to the
             effect that the establishment is closed down and is covered
             by the closure orders issued by respondent Nos.2 and 3 as
             well as respondent No.4 - Pollution Control Board, we
             order this writ petition directing that the said situation shall
             continue until respondent No.5 satisfies the competent
             authorities among the respondents that it is entitled to
             commence        operations       in    the   establishment,     after
             rectification of the deficits. We also record the submission
             on behalf of respondent No.5 that it maintains a green belt
             and has also cattle and other beings in the premises which
             are unconnected with the industrial activity.          It is up to
             respondent No.5 to seek requisite orders from respondent
             No.2 - District Collector for permission to deal with all such
             situations, either by removing them from the premises or
             otherwise. It will be open for the District Collector to
             consider any such request of respondent No.5. The District
             Collector shall render a decision on any such request of
             respondent No.5 without delay, having regard to the fact
             that the submission is to the effect that the cattle and other
             living beings are involved, as also the need to maintain the
             green belt".
</blockquote>

<p id="p_6">5.    The   closure     order     dated            17.07.2018   refers     to   a    few

deficiencies either in adhering to the conditions imposed by

2nd respondent or disregard to the standards stipulated by the

consent for operation issued by 2nd respondent.                            It is in this

background the petitioner through representation dated 26.07.2018

requested 2nd respondent/Board for restoration of power supply

for the limited purpose of using electricity in servant quarters, cattle

sheds etc. The petitioner requested to remove the seizure effected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        3</span>




by 3rd respondent. The 2nd respondent refused the said request for

the following reasons:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      i.     The industry shall approach the District Collector to furnish
             a report to the Board on the measures taken by the
             industry to rectify the non compliances, assessment of
             District Collector on the damages caused by operation of
             the unit to the surrounding areas through Revenue &amp;
             Engineering Departments.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      ii.    The industry may approach the Board for restoration of
             power supply only after the receipt of the report from the
             District Collector.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_7">Hence, the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">6.    The other grounds and details urged by the learned counsel

appearing for parties are not adverted to in this order for the view

we are proposing to take while disposing of this writ petition.


</p><p id="p_10">7.    W.P (PIL) No.165 of 2018 was disposed of taking note of the

action taken on the representations filed by the petitioner therein.

The petitioner industry was closed for non-compliance with a few

conditions imposed by the Board.           It is not a case of permanent

shutting down of operations by petitioner industry, which is in

existence for nearly two decades.              The 2nd respondent does

not as well intend permanent closure of petitioner industry.

The petitioner industry through representations now wants removing

seizure effected by 3rd respondent and restoration of power supply

for limited purpose. The petitioner stated across the Bar that it is

prepared to undertake its activities by strictly conforming to the

requirements of Environmental Laws.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     4</span><p id="p_11">




</p><p id="p_12">8.    In this background, we are of the view that the understanding

of the order of this Court dated 18.07.2018 in W.P (PIL) No.165 of

2018 and rejecting the request for restoration of power supply

appears to be erroneous. The respondents ought not to subject

the petitioner to play the game of see saw while removing seizure or

restoring power supply by calling upon the petitioner to first get

seizure lifted or power restored.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">9.    Keeping in view the nature of allegations against the

petitioner and the precautionary and sustainable development

principles, the writ petition is ordered with the consent of the

counsel as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      (a)    the order impugned in the writ petition is set aside;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      (b)    the petitioner is given liberty to represent to 2nd and
             3rd respondents by enclosing a copy of this order within
             one week from today for restoration of power supply for
             domestic and ancillary purposes and also remove the
             seizure effected;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      (c)    the 2nd and 3rd respondents are directed to pass orders
             on the representation of petitioner, both for restoration
             of power supply and removing the seizure effected on
             the premises of petitioner within two weeks from today;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      (d)    the petitioner is directed to submit a comprehensive
             study report on the process the petitioner industry
             undertakes    in    R.S.Nos.107,   109,   110   &amp;   111   of
             Chilemamdi Village, R.S.Nos.44, 47 &amp; 49 of Chilakapalli
             Village, Jharasangam Mandal and also the steps the
             petitioner industry proposes to take for containment of
             impact of noise and vibration from its activities; and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      (e)    the 2nd respondent constitutes a technical committee,
             gets the report examined by the committee and if the

              report of petitioner industry is satisfactory, passes
              temporary revocation orders, thereafter gathers further
              report on the functionality of the measures put in place
              by the petitioner and passes final orders under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_5">Section
              33-A</a>   of   the   Water (Prevention   and   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control      of

              and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as are deemed fit.
