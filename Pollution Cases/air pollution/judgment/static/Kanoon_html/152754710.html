:COMMON ORDER	
	Both the writ petitions are filed by the same petitioner which is a
private limited company.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	2.In the first writ petition viz., W.P.(MD).No.586 of 2012, the petitioner
seeks for a direction to the respondents to provide adequate police protection
to the workers working at the land of the petitioner situated in Survey
No.698/1, 697, 718/1 1B, 717/1, 704, 705, 706, 706, 708/2, 709 at Kodanthur
Village, Karur Taluk and to the properties of the petitioner located in the
landed property of the petitioner on the basis of the representation of the
petitioner dated 30.12.2011

</p><p id="p_7">	3.In the said representation of the petitioner, dated 30.12.2011,
addressed to the Superintendent of Police, Karur District and the Inspector of
Police, K.Paramathi Police Station, (respondents 1 &amp; 2 herein), the petitioner
claimed that they have started construction work for Poultry Farm and Feed Mill
pursuant to the common orders passed by this Court in W.A.(MD).Nos.14, 15, 97
and 238 of 2011 and W.A(MD).885 of 2010.  However, few local people belong to
Kodanthur Village are attempting to obstruct the construction work and on
30.12.2011, when the works of the petitioner were executing construction work, a
mob of nearly 150 villagers barged into the landed property of the petitioner
where the Poultry Farm is being set up and threatened the workers not to
continue the construction activity, otherwise the petitioner/company will face
dire consequences.  They have also warned the petitioner/company to stop the
constitution work. Therefore, the petitioner/company requested for initiation of
criminal action against them and to provide adequate police protection to the
lives of the works working in the property of the petitioner/company.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	4.In the said writ petition, the petitioner has also impleaded the
President,  Kodanthur Village Panchayat,   Aravakurichi Taluk,  Karur District,
also as 4th respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_9">	5.When the matter came up on 24.01.2012, this Court directed the
petitioner to produce the building permit issued by the Panchayat for the
purpose of construction and also directed to produce licence issued by the
Panchayat for conducting the poultry farm.  It was further directed that the
writ petition will be posted for admission only after production of the said
documents.
</p>
<p id="p_10">	6.Subsequently, when the matter came up on 30.03.2012, it was informed
that the local body had rejected the planning permission for the petitioner and
they have challenged the same in another writ petition and hence, the first writ
petition was directed to be posted along with W.P.(MD).No.2085 of 2012.
</p><p id="p_11">	7.The 4th respondent has filed a counter affidavit dated 12.03.2012. In
the counter affidavit, the Panchayat Union has denied the allegation that the
local villagers at the instance of rival company used to collect a mob in front
of the land and make violent protest against the construction activities. These
allegations were made only for maintaining the writ petition and they are only
self serving statements.  Even if it is presumed that the said incident happened
on 16.09.2011, however, the purported complaint was made only on 27.12.2011.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	8.In the second writ petition viz., W.P.(MD).No.3085 of 2012, the
petitioner/company challenges the order 02.03.2012 passed by the 2nd respondent
and after setting aside the same, seeks for the renewal of permission pursuant
to the representation of the petitioner dated 31.01.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_13">	9.When the second writ petition came up on 14.03.2012, notice was directed
to be issued to the 2nd respondent and learned Special Government Pleader was
directed to take notice for the 1st respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	10.On notice from this Court, the 2nd respondent entered appearance
through a counsel and filed a counter affidavit dated 27.08.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_15">	11.Heard both sides.  The disposal of the second writ petition in
W.P.(MD).No.3085 of 2012 will also dispose the first writ petition in
W.P.(MD).No.586 of 2012, as it is incidental to the second writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_16">	12.By the impugned order dated 02.03.2012 issued by the Panchayat of
Kodanthur Village Panchayat,  Aravakurichi Taluk, Karur District, the petitioner
was informed that since they have not completed the building in terms of Rule 30
of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Building Rules, within the period of one year and
hence, the permission granted had already expired. In terms of Condition No.6,
they have not applied for renewal of building plan and since there is no
guidelines issued by the District Collector, Karur, they are unable to renew the
building permit and hence, the petitioner's application for renewal dated
31.01.2012 was returned.
</p>
<p id="p_17">	13.The case of the petitioner/company was that the company was a
registered company registered in the year 1991 and has been in the business of
poultry farm and poultry feeds.  It is already running poultry farm and feed
mill in Poondurai Semoor without any problem or pollution in accordance with
existing norms.  The petitioner/company decided to set up poultry farm and feed
mill in Kodanthur Village (South) and also purchased approximately about 75
acres of land for the said purpose through various registered sale deeds. The
petitioner/company made an application before the 2nd respondent seeking for
grant of building permission for construction of Feed Mill at Survey No.696 and
Poultry Farm in S.No.698/1, 697, 718/A1B, 717/1, 704, 705, 706, 707, 708/2 &amp; 709
at Kodanthur Village.  The 2nd respondent grant building permission as requested
by the petitioner vide proceedings dated 05.04.2010, for the period of one year
commencing from 05.04.2010 ending on 04.04.2011 on certain conditions.  The
petitioner/company approached the Commissioner, Karur Paramathi Panchayat Union,
to grant appropriate planning approval and the Panchayat Union had also passed
resolution dated 16.04.2010 by giving consent to set up the Poultry farm and
Feed mill and based on the same the Commissioner of the Panchayat Union, granted
permission vide proceedings dated 28.04.2010.   Thereafter, the petitioner
applied before the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board for appropriate approval
and the Board was also pleased to grant consent order for setting up the
establishment, under Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution), Act 1981 and
Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974 by proceedings, dated
31.03.2010.  Thereafter, the petitioner approached the Department of Public
Health and Preventive Medicine and they have also granted permission for fixing
the machineries by proceedings dated 08.05.2010.  Consequently, the Fire and
Rescue Department had also granted no objection to set up the Feed Mill factory
and Poultry Farm.   Based upon the above permissions, the petitioner/company was
given a loan of Rs.22,50,00,000/- by the Indian Overseas Bank, Erode and this
petitioner company had also invested huge sum of money by ordering machinery,
leveling the land, fabrication of cages, purling etc., to the tune of
Rs.3,00,00,000/-.  It is stated that one business rival group filed a suit in
O.S.No.225/2010 before the District Munsif Court, Karur, for declaration and
permanent injunction stating that the erection and running of Poultry Farm in
the suit property is objectionable and nuisance to the plaintiff and villagers.
There was no interim order passed in the said suit.  However, at the instances
of that rival group, the Panchayat Union Council passed a resolution No.565
dated 01.07.2010 cancelling the permission granted to the petitioner to set up
new poultry farm and poultry feed mill factory.  On the basis of the said
resolution, the Commissioner of Karur Paramathi Panchayat passed an order dated
06.07.2010, thereby cancelled the licence and building permission.
</p>
<p id="p_18">	14.Aggrieved by the action of the Panchayat Union, the petitioner filed
W.P.No.8812 of 2010 before this Court.  The said writ petition was allowed by
this Court on 28.07.2010.  However, in the meanwhile, the 1st
respondent/District Collector passed an order dated 11.10.2010 cancelling the
building permission granted by the 2nd respondent on the ground that no
resolution was passed in Kodanthur Village Panchayat and the building permission
was granted in violation of the norms.   Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner
filed another writ petition in W.P.No.12948 of 2010 before this Court.
Subsequently, the Vice President of the the 2nd respondent Panchayat passed an
order dated 04.10.2010 cancelling the building plan issued by the President of
the said village panchayat stating that setting up of poultry farm and feed mill
would cause pollution to the surrounding and mosquitoes &amp; flies would spread
diseases.  By an order dated 04.10.2010, the petitioner/company was directed to
stop construction work, failing which action will be initiated under the
provisions of Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act, 1994.
</p>
<p id="p_19">	15.Aggrieved by the order of the 2nd respondent, the petitioner filed
W.P.No.13105 of 2010 before this Court.  By a common order dated 03.12.2010,
this Court dismissed both the writ petitions.   As against the said order, the
petitioner/company preferred two writ appeals being W.A.Nos.14 &amp; 15 of 2011.
The Panchayat Union has also filed appeals in W.A.No.97 of 2011 and W.A.No.238
of 2011.  Even as against the order in W.P.No.8812 of 2010, dated 28.07.2010,
the Panchayat Union has preferred Writ appeal in W.A.No.885 of 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_20">	16.All the five writ appeals were heard together by the Division Bench and
a common order was passed on 16.09.2011.  In the said common order, the Division
Bench upheld the order in W.P.No.8812 of 2010 and held that the Pollution
Control Board has given consent to establish the unit. But, at the same time, at
Para 40, the Division Bench has observed as follows:-
	"40.............. However, quashing of the order of the Commissioner,
dated 05.07.2010 by which the original order of the executive authority, dated
05.04.2010 stands restored does not in our view take away the right of the
authorities contemplated under the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Building Rules, 1997, in
cancelling or modifying the same in accordance with law.  In all fairness, in
our considered view especially during the subsistence of the permission granted
by the executive authority, when a contrary decision was attempted to be taken
by the Commissioner of Panchayat Union, he ought to have heard the company
before passing such orders.
</p>
<p id="p_21">In Para 41 it was observed as follows:-
</p><p id="p_22">	"41.......... However, it is always open to the Executive Authority, to
act as per the said provision of the rules enumerated above in the event of any
contingency in respect of the grant of permission."
</p>
<p id="p_23">In para 44 it was observed as follows:-
</p><p id="p_24">	"44...........Accordingly, the stop work notice issued by the Vice
President of the Panchayat, dated 04.10.2010 challenged in W.P.(MD).No.13105 of
2010 cannot sustain in the eye of law, when the Company has been issued a
permission by the executive authority by way of a building permission as per the
Tamil Nadu Panchayats Building Rules 1997.  Insofar as it relates to the order
of the Inspector of Panchayats on 11.10.2010 which has been challenged in
W.P.(MD).No.12948 of 2010, it has to be remembered that the power of the
executive authority namely the President of Village Panchayat in issuing
permission for building as per the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Building Rules 1997, or
the power of Inspector to suspend any resolution passed by the village panchayat
or cancel any licence or permission granted is certainly unassailable.  That
power is available to the District Collector being the Inspector of Panchayats
under Section 202 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act, 1994..."
</p>
<p id="p_25">In Para 48 it was observed as follows:-
</p><p id="p_26">	"48.Inasmuch as we are of the view that the authority competent namely,
the executive authority under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act 1994 being the
President as per the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Building Rules 1997, has granted
permission to the company which is the appellant in W.A.(MD).Nos.14 and 15 of
2011.  Unless and until, that is varied either by the executive authority
himself in the manner known to law as enumerated above or set aside or suspended
by the Inspector of Panchayats namely, the District Collector as per the
provision of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Section 202</a> by following the principles of natural justice as
provided therein, it is certainly no open to the District Collector unilaterally
to come to a conclusion as if the resolution passed by the panchayat on
16.04.2010 approving the approval granted by the executive authority, dated
05.04.2010 is invalid or without jurisdiction or such approval has been granted
unilaterally by the president without resolution of the panchayat when such
resolution is not a condition precedent as per the statutory rules or based on
any other reasons.  This aspect has also not been considered by the learned
single Judge."
</p>
<p id="p_27">Finally, in para 52 it has been held as follows:-
</p><p id="p_28">	"52.In the result,
</p><p id="p_29">		i)W.A.(MD).Nos.14 &amp; 15 of 2011 are allowed and the impugned orders,
dated 11.10.2010 and 04.10.2010 are set aside.
</p><p id="p_30">		ii)W.A.(MD).No.97 of 2011 stands ordered with a direction to the
President of the Panchayat and the Inspector of Panchayats, namely, the District
Collector, to act as per the provisions of the Rules as well as the Act after
giving opportunity to the writ petitioner as well as the public and others who
are likely to be affected in respect of granting of permission by the executive
authority namely, the President dated 05.04.2010 and pass appropriate orders.
</p><p id="p_31">		iii)The writ appeals No.885 of 2011 and 238 of 2011 stand dismissed.
No costs.  Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed."
</p>

<p id="p_32">	17.After the disposal of the said Writ Appeals, the petitioner/company
sent a letter dated 31.01.2012 to the 2nd respondent seeking for extension of
building permission for further period of two years.  In receipt of the same,
the impugned order came to be passed  stating that the originally permission was
granted for only one year and during that period, the building has not been
constructed and application for renewal was not made 30 days prior to the lapse
of permission and hence, there is no scope for renewal and the application was
rejected.
</p>	
<p id="p_33">	18.The contention raised by the petitioner was that the full period for
one year to complete the construction of poultry farm and feed mill was not
given to the petitioner as the permission granted on 05.04.2010 was cancelled by
the 2nd respondent panchayat on 04.10.2010 and the cancellation order was
challenged before this Court and the final orders were passed in writ appeals
only on 16.09.2011.  Hence, the petitioner was not given full period of one year
to construct the building as per the building permission. The earlier permission
was cancelled prematurely and the same was challenged in the writ appeals, the
same was disposed of only on 16.09.2011 and hence, the question of making
application for renewal before 30 days of the lapse of permission did not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_34">	19.In the counter affidavit filed by the 2nd respondent, it was contended
that the contentions of the petitioner that no sufficient time was granted to
the petitioner in view of the earlier proceedings before this Court may not be
correct.  Even after the order passed by this Court in Writ Appeals on
16.09.2011, the petitioner did not immediately approach the Panchayat, though
the original order dated 05.04.2010 lapsed on 04.04.2011 itself.   The
petitioner's request for renewal was made only on 31.01.2012, almost after a
period of four months after the orders were passed in the writ appeals.   As on
date, the permission granted by the Panchyat Union is lapsed and plan approval
is also lapsed.
</p>
<p id="p_35">	20.Mr.T.Mohan appearing for the Panchayat contended that even the pendency
of the proceedings did not also preclude the petitioner from applying for
renewal and that even that period has also come to an end.
</p>
<p id="p_36">	21.The question that arises for consideration is whether the petitioner's
request for renewal can be granted as per the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Building
Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_37">	22.It is admitted that the originally building permission was granted for
a period of one year on 05.04.2010 and it lapsed on 04.04.2011 and the building
construction has not been completed during the said period.  Assuming that there
was no request for renewal due to the pendency of the proceedings, even then the
writ appeals were finally disposed on 16.09.2011 and that period is excluded,
still the petitioner did not apply for renewal 30 days prior to the expiry of
the building permission.  Therefore, the petitioner cannot be allowed to contend
against the teeth of the statutory provision.
</p>
<p id="p_38">	23.In this context, a reference is made to the judgment of this Court in
Kousic &amp; Co. Vs. The District Collector, Erode &amp; others  reported in 2012 Writ
L.R. 559 for contending that a Unit cannot run without getting running licence
and they are bound to take permission/licence to install machineries and run the
unit and the said condition is mandatory as failure to get licence will lead to
penal consequences.
</p><p id="p_39">	24.In view of the above, it is held that petitioner is not having currency
of building permission and the writ petition in W.P.(MD).No.3085 of 2012 is
liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_40">	 25.Hence, the question of putting up their construction as found in their
letter dated  30.12.2012 and for consequently police protection also does not
stand for scrutiny of law. 	In this context, a reference was made to the
judgment in CDJ 2012 MHC 3661 (GAIL India Ltd. rep by its Senior Manager (Law)
Vs. The State of Tamil Nadu, rep by its Secretary to Government, Home Department
&amp; others) for contending that the grant of police protection is not automatic
and if  the aggrieved person filed a petition for protection, only in case there
was a failure on the part of the Police to take action even in the teeth of
congnizable offence, the Court may grant direction suitably.  Hence, the writ
petition in W.P.(MD).No.586 of 2012 is also liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_41">	26.In view of the above, both the above writ petitions are dismissed.
Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petitioner is clsoed.  No costs.
