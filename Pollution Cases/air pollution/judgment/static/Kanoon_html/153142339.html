      IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA
                   AT CHANDIGARH


                          RSA No.3541 of 2011 (O&amp;M)
                          Date of decision: 11.01.2013


R.A. Goel (since deceased) through LRs.
                                              ......Appellant

State of Haryana
                                              .......Respondent

CORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE A.N. JINDAL

Present:     Mr. Vikas, Advocate,
             for Mr. A.K. Bansal, Advocate,
             for the appellant.
             *****

A.N. Jindal, J.
</pre>

<p id="p_1">             Amended memo of parties filed by the appellant, is taken on

record.
</p>
<p id="p_2">             Having remained unsuccessful before both the Courts below, the

plaintiff-appellant (hereinafter referred as 'the plaintiff') has preferred this

regular second appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             The plaintiff, after his retirement as Engineer-in-Chief from the

Public Works Department, was appointed as Chairman of the Haryana State

Pollution Control Board (for brevity 'the Board') on 15.03.1990, the tenure of

which was only for three years. However, with the change of the Government

in May/June, 1991, one S.P. Grover was appointed as Chairman of the said

Board on 07.09.1991. Since S.P. Grover was junior to the plaintiff, therefore,

he (plaintiff) challenged the said notification before this Court by filing a writ

petition i.e. CWP No.14123 of 1991.             However, due to change of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> RSA No.3541 of 2011 (O&amp;M)                                         2</span>

circumstances the State of Haryana superseded the said Board under <a href="/doc/855503/" id="a_1">Section

61</a> and <a href="/doc/348852/" id="a_2">62</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and

due to that the aforesaid writ petition stood infructuous and accordingly, an

order was passed by this Court on 11.05.1992.           Thereafter, the plaintiff

challenged the aforesaid order of the State Government through another CWP

No.5752 of 1992, but the said petition was also dismissed on 15.05.1992.

The SLP filed by him against the said order, was also dismissed on

30.06.1992. In the light of the liberty, as given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court

to claim the arrears, the plaintiff filed a civil suit for recovery of the salary.

The said suit was dismissed and the appeal filed by him was also dismissed.

</p><p id="p_4">             Heard, the factual situation is not disputed. It is settled by now

that <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_4">Article 311 (2)</a> of the Constitution of India does not apply to a tenure

post, which is held for specified term or a contractual appointment. The

abolition of a post for administrative exigencies or superseding of the Board

as per the provisions of law, as happened in this case, cannot be said to be in

violation of any constitutional provisions. Since the plaintiff had not so far

joined the regular service, therefore, he cannot be said to be enjoying the

privileges, to which a person holding a regular post is entitled to as per

<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_5">Article 311</a> of the Constitution. After the Board was superseded, the plaintiff

could not be said to be left with any right in the post, which he was holding

on part time basis, so as to entitle him to seek the damages/wages.

</p><p id="p_5">             No substantial question of law arises for determination.

             Dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
