ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 


 

<p id="p_1">1.	This
appeal, preferred under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_1">Section 378</a> of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973, is directed against the order of acquittal passed by
the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad in Criminal Case
No.1758 of 1991 on 07.01.1998.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_2">2.	As
per the prosecution case, the appellant, who was serving as Law
Officer with the Gujarat Pollution Control Board constituted under
<a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_2">Section 4</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>
(hereinafter referred to as the  Act ), has been authorised to
prosecute respondent Nos.1 to 7. The appellant was also given
authority to file criminal case against respondent Nos.1 to 7 in the
Court of learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad for the
offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_4">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_6">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_7">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_8">47</a> of the Act.
The learned Judge framed charge against respondent Nos.1 to 7 and
proceeded with the trial. The prosecution has examined complainants  
Dahyabhai Kalubhai Solanki and Bhavdip Gajjar in order to prove
inextricable involvement of respondent Nos.1 to 7 in the commission
of offence. The prosecution has also produced documentary evidences
such as authority letter and the report of the Government analyst in
order to indicate involvement of respondent Nos.1 to 7 in the
commission of offence. The learned Judge has, after considering the
entire gamut of oral deposition and documentary evidence on record of
the case, held that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove
entire link connecting respondent Nos.1 to 7 in the commission of
offence. He, therefore, acquitted respondent Nos.1 to 7 for the
offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_9">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_10">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_11">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_12">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_13">47</a> of the Act.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">3.	The
appellant, being aggrieved by the aforesaid order, has preferred the
present appeal mainly on the ground that the learned Judge has
committed egregious error in acquitting respondent Nos.1 to 7 for the
offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_14">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_15">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_16">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_17">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_18">47</a> of the Act,
even though there was enough material and evidence available against
respondent Nos.1 to 7. Learned advocate Mr.Mehta for the appellant
submitted that all the mandatory procedures, as prescribed under
<a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_19">Section 21</a> of the Act and Rule 27 of the Gujarat
Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976 (hereinafter
referred to as the  Rules 1976 ), were scrupulously followed by
the appellant and no error was committed in following the said
procedures. Thus, it is submitted by the learned advocate that the
judgment rendered by the learned Judge is required to be quashed and
set aside and respondent Nos.1 to 7 be convicted for the offence
punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_20">Sections  24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_21">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_22">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_23">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_24">47</a> of the Act.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_4">4.	Respondent No.4 is served
but no body appears on his behalf. Learned A.P.P. Ms.Krina Calla,
representing respondent No.8-State, submitted that the learned Judge
has not appreciated the evidence adduced by the prosecution in its
true perspective while acquitting respondent Nos.1 to 7 for the
offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_25">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_26">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_27">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_28">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_29">47</a> of the Act.
Even the report of the public analyst was not considered by the
learned Judge while acquitting respondent Nos.1 to 7. It is submitted
by the learned A.P.P. that the order passed by the learned Judge is
required to be quashed and set aside and respondent Nos.1 to 7 be
convicted for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_30">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_31">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_32">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_33">44</a>
and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_34">47</a> of the Act.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_5">5.	I have heard learned
advocate Mr.Sunil L. Mehta for the appellant and learned A.P.P.
Ms.Krina Calla for respondent No.8-State at length and in great
detail. This Court has also undertaken a complete and comprehensive
appreciation of all vital features of the case as well as the entire
evidence on record.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_6">6.	Taking into consideration
the deposition adduced by complainants   Dahyabhai and Bhavdipbhai,
it becomes clear that the procedure, as prescribed under Rule 27 of
the Rules 1976 has not been followed by the appellant while taking
the sample. When such a procedure has not followed which is mandatory
in nature, then the benefit of the same is required to be given to
the accused in view of the judgment rendered by this Court in the
case of Dahyabhai
Kalubhai Solanki V/s. Devine Intermediates &amp; Chemicals &amp;
Ors., reported in 1996 (1) G.L.R. 729. Thus, considering the reasons
assigned by the learned Judge and evidence on record of the case, the
learned Judge has rightly acquitted respondent Nos.1 to 7 for the
offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_35">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_36">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_37">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_38">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_39">47</a> of the
Act. There is no infirmity in the order passed by the learned Judge
while acquitting respondent Nos.1 to 7.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_7">7.	This
is an acquittal appeal in which Court would be slow to interfere with
the order of acquittal. Infirmities in the prosecution case go to the
root of the matter and strike a vital blow on the prosecution case.
In such a case, it would not be safe to set aside the order of
acquittal, more particularly when the evidence has not inspired
confidence of the learned Judge who had opportunity to observe
demeanour of the witnesses. As this Court is in general agreement
with the view expressed by the learned Judge, the Court does not
think it necessary either to reiterate the evidence of prosecution
witnesses or to restate the reasons for acquittal given by the
learned Judge and this Court is of the opinion that expression of
general agreement with the view taken by the learned Judge would be
sufficient in the facts of the case. This is so, in view of the
decisions rendered by the Supreme Court in the cases of (1) <a href="/doc/582191/" id="a_40">Girija
Nandini Devi &amp; Ors. v. Bijendra Narain Chaudhari</a>, AIR 1967 SC
1124, and (2) <a href="/doc/1474119/" id="a_41">State of Karnataka v. Hema Reddy and another</a>, AIR 1981
SC 1417. On overall appreciation of evidence, this Court is
satisfied that there is no infirmity in the reasons assigned by the
learned Judge for acquitting the respondent. Suffice it to say that
the learned Judge has given cogent and convincing reasons for
acquitting the respondent. The learned advocate for the appellant has
failed to convince this Court to take a view contrary to the one
already taken by the learned Judge and, therefore, the appeal is
liable to be dismissed.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_8">8.	For
the foregoing reasons, the appeal fails and it is hereby dismissed.
</p>
