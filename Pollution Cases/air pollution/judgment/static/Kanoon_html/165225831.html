CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE JYOTI SARAN
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 05-12-2017

              Heard Mr. Nikhil Kumar Agrawal, learned counsel

    appearing for the petitioner and Ms. Binita Singh, learned counsel

    appearing for the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (hereinafter

    referred to as 'the Board').
</p>
<p id="p_13">              With the consent of the parties the writ petition has been

    heard with a view to its final disposal at the stage of admission itself.

</p><p id="p_14">              The petitioner prays for issuance of a writ in the nature of

    certiorari for quashing the order/direction contained in letter bearing

    No. T. 1302 dated 10.2.2017 of the Chairman of 'the Board' passed

    in purported exercise of power vested under section 31A of the Air
 Patna High Court CWJC No.2533 of 2017 dt.05-12-2017                                 2




         (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter referred

         to as the '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air Act</a>') read alongside <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_4">section 33A</a> of the Water

         (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred

         to as the '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water Act</a>') whereby and whereunder the petitioner has

         been directed to close its operation.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                    In substance, the allegation facing the petitioner is that it

         has not been operating its unit in compliance of statutory

         prescriptions. There were complaints of leakage of ammonia gas as

         well as delayed application for renewal of the 'Consent to Operate'

         order and which led to the expiry of the 'Consent to Operate' order

         issued by 'the Board' and the cumulative effect of which default has

         led to the closure order impugned at Annexure 10.

</p><p id="p_16">                    Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having

         perused the records, in my opinion the order put to challenge in the

         writ petition has failed to abide by the statutory prescription

         underlying rule 34(3) of the Water (Prevention &amp; Control of

         Pollution) Rules, 1975 and rule 21A(3) of the Air (Prevention &amp;

         Control of Pollution) Rules, 1983 inasmuch as the establishment

         concerned is entitled to an advance notice before any direction for

         closure is issued in purported exercise of power vested in the

         statutory authority under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_7">section 33A</a> of the '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water Act</a>' and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">section

         31A</a> of the '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">Air Act</a>' and which admittedly was not served on the

         petitioner before the impugned order was passed by the Chairman.
 Patna High Court CWJC No.2533 of 2017 dt.05-12-2017                               3




                     The issue arises, what happens next because even if the

         closure order impugned herein goes yet in absence of 'Consent to

         Operate' order, the petitioner cannot operate its manufacturing unit.

         I am thus of the opinion that an interference with the order

         impugned herein at the present stage would be a plain formality

         because in absence of 'Consent to Operate' order, its quashing and

         remand, would not be making any difference at this stage.

</p><p id="p_17">                    Mr. Agrawal appreciating the position has invited the

         attention of the Court to the submission put forth by the petitioner

         through the supplementary affidavit in which he has stated that

         while the renewal application for grant of 'Consent to Operate' order

         has been filed and is pending consideration before 'the Board', the

         defect whatsoever which was pointed out has since been removed by

         them and the matter now awaits an inspection by a team of 'the

         Board' for final decision on grant of 'Consent to Operate' order,

         under the enactments in question.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                    Responding to          the supplementary affidavit that a

         supplementary counter affidavit has been filed by Ms. Binita Singh,

         learned counsel appearing for 'the Board' and who while not

         disputing that the application filed by the petitioner for issuance of

         grant of 'Consent to Operate' order is yet pending before the 'Board'

         submits that since there were certain obligations to be carried out by

         the petitioner before the inspection could be carried out for a
 Patna High Court CWJC No.2533 of 2017 dt.05-12-2017                               4




         decision on issuance of 'Consent to Operate' order, hence the delay.

         It is stated that the stand of the petitioner on the removal of the

         defects would require verification by the inspection team. Such

         statement is present at paragraphs 9 to 11 of the supplementary

         counter affidavit filed today.
</p>
<p id="p_19">                    It is next submitted by Mr. Agrawal and not contested by

         Ms. Singh that an inspection can only take place while the petitioner

         establishment is in working condition and thus until such time that

         the closure direction would continue, the petitioner would not be in a

         position to operate and the inspection would be meaningless.

</p><p id="p_20">                    Having heard learned counsel for the parties and in the

         circumstances so discussed, where the application(s) of the

         petitioner under the '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air Act</a>' and the '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">Water Act</a>' are pending

         consideration before the respondent-Board for issue of a 'Consent to

         Operate' order thereunder and that a meaningful inspection can only

         be carried out while the manufacturing unit of the petitioner is in

         operation, this Court while directing the 'Board' and its authorities

         to dispose of the application(s) filed by the petitioner for issuance of

         'Consent to Operate' order under 'the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_13">Water Act</a>' as well as 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_14">Air

         Act</a>' by carrying out the required inspection within a maximum

         period of 4 weeks from today, would stay the operation of the

         impugned order passed by the Chairman of 'the Board' dated

         10.2.2017 which would allow the petitioner to operate his
         Patna High Court CWJC No.2533 of 2017 dt.05-12-2017                                      5




                  establishment for a meaningful inspection with a caution that this

                  interim order should not be treated as a permission to get engaged in

                  business purposes rather the permission is to enable 'the Board' and

                  its authorities to complete the exercise on the issue of 'Consent to

                  Operate' order.
</p>
<p id="p_21">                              It goes without saying that the interim order passed by this

                  Court to stay the closure order of the Chairman passed in purported

                  exercise of power vested under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_15">section 31A</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_16">Air Act</a>'

                  alongside <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_17">section 33A</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_18">Water Act</a>' dated 10.2.2017 impugned

                  at Annexure 10 shall abide by the final outcome of the exercise.

</p><p id="p_22">                              It also goes without saying that should 'the Board' decide in

                  favour of the petitioner the order would cease to operate.

</p><p id="p_23">                              The   writ    petition     is   allowed   with   the   direction

                  aforementioned.
