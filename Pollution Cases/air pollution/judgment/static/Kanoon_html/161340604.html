        vigilance squad carried out alleged inspection of the industrial 
        unit run by the revisionist in the name and style of M/S  Kishan 
        Chand Chaina Ram. Some discrepancies were found. Arguments 
        were heard by  Ld Trial Court and vide impugned order Ld Trial 
        Court had passed the order on charge. 
</p><p id="p_3">    3.           Being   aggrieved  by  the  order  of   Ld  Trial  Court,   present 
        revision has been filed on the following  grounds:
</p><p id="p_4">        a)   that   Ld Trial Court erred in coming   to the conclusion that 
        there is sufficient ground to frame charge against the accused 
        u/s 24/25/26 read with <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_11">section 43</a>/<a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_12">44</a> of Water (Prevention and 
        <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 without there being any material 
        on record. 
</p><p id="p_5">        b)   that Ld Trial Court failed to appreciate  that there  was no 
        evidence   available   on   record   to   hold   the   revisionist   guilty   of 
        violating the provisions of said Act.
</p><p id="p_6">        c)   that   the alleged inspection report is forged and fabricated 


Cr. R. NO. 69/13                                                    Page 2 of 6 pages

        as no inspection was carried out  on 30.05.2000d)                that          Ld 
        Trial Court erred in passing the impugned order inspite of the 
        fact   that   there   was   been   material   contradictions     and 
        inconsistency in the allegations leveled by the complainant.
</p><p id="p_7">             with these grounds revisionist   has prayed   for setting aside 
             the order  passed by Ld Trial Court.
</p><p id="p_8">    4.        I have heard Sh. Sanjeev Kumar,   Ld counsel for revisionist 
        and Sh Hitesh Bhutani, Ld  counsel for  respondents.
</p><p id="p_9">    5.        I have considered the arguments advanced by Ld counsel for 
        the parties and gone through the file.
</p><p id="p_10">    6.         In this case, revisionist has challenged the impugned order 
        dated 14.05.2013   whereby it was held    that there  is sufficient 
        ground  to frame  the  charge  against  the  accused  u/s  24/25/26 
        read with <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_14">section 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_15">44</a> of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">Control of 
        Pollution Act</a>), 1974.
</p><p id="p_11">    7.        In the entire revision, grounds for challenging the impugned 
        order   as   taken   by   revisionist   are     that   there   are   material 
        contradictions and inconsistency in the allegations levelled by 
        the complainant;  there was no evidence available on record to 
        hold the revisionist guilty of violation of the provisions of Water 
        (Prevention   and   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_17">Control   of   Pollution   Act</a>),   1974   (herein   after 
        called as the Act).  Ld counsel for revisionist had argued that in 
        the report,   it is mentioned that coal fire   bhatties were being 


Cr. R. NO. 69/13                                                  Page 3 of 6 pages
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                            4</span>

        used by the revisionist  in the premises whereas SDM examined 
        as   CW­2     had   stated   that   gas  chullahs  were   being   used.    The 
        allegations   of   the   complainant   in   filing   the   complaint   is   also 
        being challenged by the revisionist in the present revision.  It is 
        also the contention of revisionist  that no consent is required in 
        respect to shops of   halwais in non conforming areas   and the 
        consent is only  required for industrial units.  There is nothing on 
        record to prove that polluting water was being  discharged in the 
        sewer.
</p><p id="p_12">    8.        On the other hand, Ld counsel for respondent had refuted 
        the averments of revisionist and has stated that complainant was 
        authorized     to   file   the   complaint.     There   was   no   effluent 
        treatment plant    being maintained  in the  inspected  premises, 
        therefore,   untreated   water   was   being   released   in   the   sewer 
        hence provisions of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_18">section   24</a>/<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_19">25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_20">26</a> read with <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_21">section 43</a> and 
        <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_22">44</a> of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_23">Control of Pollution Act</a>), 1974 are 
        attracted against the revisionist.
</p><p id="p_13">    9.        After   considering   the   submissions   of   Ld   counsel   for   the 
        parties,     provisions   of   law   and   impugned   order,   I   am   of   the 
        opinion that  revision  as preferred by revisionist  does not have 
        any merits in the case.  Admittedly the effluent treatment plant 
        was not installed in the premises in question, there are specific 
        allegations   against   the   revisionist   that   untreated   water 


Cr. R. NO. 69/13                                                    Page 4 of 6 pages
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                             5</span>

        containing ghee and oil  and other ramenants  of manufacturing 
        sweets     were being discharged along with water in the sewer. 
        This   fact   has   not   been   disputed   by   the   revisionist.    The   only 
        defense   taken   by     them   in   argument   is   that   before   cleaning 
        utensils they were  wiping same  with cloth.  In my opinion, this 
        is   triable   question   which   is   to   be   decided   by   Ld   Trial   Court 
        during the course of evidence. Whether oil and ghee,  which was 
        bound to be present in the utensils used   for manufacturing of 
        sweet,  was being removed  before cleaning them or not.  At the 
        stage of charge, Ld Trial Court had only to consider the prima 
        facie   case   against   the   accused   persons   and   since   it   has   been 
        proved on record, prima facie, by the complainant that  accused 
        persons is running manufacturing unit of sweets and namkeen 
        in   premises   in   question;  secondly    there   was   no   effluent 
        treatment plant installed;  thirdly  there was no other provision 
        being   maintained for treating the water before going in sewer 
        and  fourthly  notification   on   which   the   revisionist   is   relying, 
        which provides that ETP is not to be fixed in manufacturing of 
        sweets shop,  is after the date of inspection  and does not declare 
        the previous inspections  to be invalid. In my opinion, on these 
        grounds   revision   is   not   maintainable   and   is   liable   to   be 
        dismissed. Order of Ld Trial Court is upheld.
</p><p id="p_14">    10.       In view of my above  discussion,  the revision petition filed by 


Cr. R. NO. 69/13                                                      Page 5 of 6 pages
