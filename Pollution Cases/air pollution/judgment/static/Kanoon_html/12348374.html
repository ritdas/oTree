              Criminal Procedure for quashing the order taking cognizance dated

              24.03.2014 passed in O.C.R. Case No. 37 of 2014 by the learned C.J.M.,

              Pakur, whereby cognizance of the offence under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_2">Section 37</a> of the Air

              (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and <a href="/doc/1964073/" id="a_4">Sections 38</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_5">44</a> of

              the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 has been taken

              against the petitioner. The petitioner further prays for quashing the entire

              criminal proceedings of the case, so far as the petitioner is concerned,

              which is pending in the court of the learned C.J.M., Pakur.

</p><p id="p_2">                     The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that a complaint

              case has been filed against five accused persons and the petitioner is

              shown as accused no. 4, therein. It is submitted that as per the complaint

              case, the accused persons have established a crushing plant. It is further

              submitted that although the petitioner is having storage but, he is not

              running any crushing plant and only making use of the place for storage.

              In this context, the learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to

              Annexure-2, to show that the petitioner has been given license by the

              Assistant Mining Officer, Pakur vide License No. 46 of 2011, dated 17th

              February, 2011, having validity till 31st December, 2011. By referring

              Annexure-4, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that it has

              been renewed from time to time. It is further submitted that the provision

              with regard to the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as

              well as Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 does not

              arise in the case of the petitioner. However, a complaint has been filed for

              the alleged offence, as punishable under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_9">Section 37</a> of the Air (Prevention
       and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as well as under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_11">Section 24</a> of the

      Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. It is further

      submitted that as per the allegations made in the complaint in paragraph 4,

      none of the accused persons had legally obtained 'No Objection

      Certificate' from the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board and thus

      they are operating their units illegally in violation of the provisions as laid

      down under the Air and Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>.

      It is also alleged in paragraph 5 of the complaint that the accused persons

      have not obtained previous consent from the Board to establish their units.

      In this context, by referring Annexure-3, it is submitted that an application

      for obtaining      previous consent was filed on 16th August, 2011

      (Annexure-3) but the previous consent has not been given by the Board till

      date and for that the petitioner cannot be made liable.

</p><p id="p_3">             The learned A.P.P. for the State submitted that since the present

      case has arisen out of a complaint case, notice may be issued upon the
