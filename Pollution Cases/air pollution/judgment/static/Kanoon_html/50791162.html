                                  O RDE R


PER SAKTIJIT DEY, J.M.:


</pre><p id="p_1">      These three appeals, all by the same assessee, are directed
against    separate   orders    of   ld.   CIT(A)-IV,    Hyderabad     for   the
assessment years 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.    As facts and issues in all these appeals are more or less
common, for the sake of brevity, we will refer to the grounds and facts
as involvdd in ITA No. 337/Hyd/2011. Assessee has raised the
following grounds:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "1. The order of the learned Commissioner of Income tax
      (Appeals) IV, Hyd. dt. 30-12-2010 for the above assessment
      year is contrary to law and facts.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     2.    The appellant contends that its income amounting to
     Rs.32,77,52,980 for the year is not liable to tax under the
     provisions of the Income tax Act..
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                          ITA Nos. 337, 33 8, 339/Hyd /2011
                                               A.P. Pollution Co ntrol Boa rd



</blockquote><p id="p_3">3. The appellant contends that the income derived by it is the
income of the State and is therefore not liable to tax under
<a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_1">Article 289( 1)</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4. Without prejudice, it is contended that the activities of the
appellant board constitute the functions incidental to the
ordinary functions of the State and therefore, its income is
immune from tax under Clause (3) to <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_2">Article 289</a> of the
Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5. The appellant contends that the functions performed by the
appellant board fall under <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_3">Article 48A</a> of the Constitution of
India which provides for protection and improvement of
environment falling under the directive principles of State Policy
in Part IV of the Constitution of India. The appellant therefore,
contends that any income derived in the exercise of functions
performed by the State or incidental to ordinary functions of the
State is not liable to tax under <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_4">Article 289(1)</a> or under <a href="/doc/512915/" id="a_5">Article
289(3)</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6. It is contended that the appellant is an agent of the State
performing the State functions falling under <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_6">Article 48A</a> of the
Constitution. Hence, its income is immune from taxation.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7. It is contended that the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority Vs.
Union of India &amp; Others reported in 283 ITR P.97 is
inapplicable. The learned Commissioner of Income tax(Appeals)
erred in mechanically in applying the said decision, without
going into the distinction on the factual aspects of the actual
functions exercised by the appellant board and its relationship
with the ordinary functions of the State.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8. Without prejudice, it is also contended that the appellant
board is entitled to approval uls 10(23C)(iv) of the LT Act and
its income is also exempt under the said provisions as the
appellant board fulfills all the requisite conditions specified for
approval under the said section 10(23C)(iv).
</p>
<p id="p_9">9. It is contended that the calculation of income is not correct.
The correct figure of Income should be Rs. 1 9,46,56,4701-
against Rs.32,77,52,9801- mentioned in the Assessment order.
Likewise the calculation of tax payable including interest at
Rs.16,87 ,27 ,233/- is not correct. The correct amount of tax
including interest is Rs.IO,22,13,334/-.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10. The appellant contends that the levy of interest u/s 234A/<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_7">B
of the IT Act</a> is not correct and the appellant denies its liability
for levy of such interest amounts.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          3</span>
<p id="p_11">                                                  ITA Nos. 337, 33 8, 339/Hyd /2011
                                                       A.P. Pollution Co ntrol Boa rd



</p><p id="p_12">      11. The appellant craves leave to add, amend or alter any of the
      aforesaid grounds as the occasion may require.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      12. For these and other reasons that may be urged at the time
      of hearing, it is prayed that the income of Rs. 19,46,56,470.00
      be exempt from tax and the appeal be allowed. "
</p>

<p id="p_14">3.    In addition, assessee has raised two more additional grounds,
which are more or less off-shoots of ground No. 9. As can be seen
from the grounds raised, ground Nos. 1, 2 &amp; 11 being general in
nature, do not require any specific adjudication. Ground No. 3 to 7
are on the issue of immunity from taxation under <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_8">Article 289(1)</a> of the
Constitution of India, whereas ground No. 8 is against rejection of
exemption claimed u/s 10(23C)(iv) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_9">IT Act</a>. In ground No. 9
along with the additional ground, assessee has contested the
determination   of   income   at   Rs.   32,77,52,980      as     against       Rs.
19,46,56,570 and ground No. 10 is in respect of levy of interest u/s
234A and 234B of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_15">4.    Briefly the facts are, assessee earlier known as Andhra
Pradesh State Board for Prevention and Control of Water Pollution is
a statutory authority created by the Govt. of Andhra Pradesh with
effect from 24/01/1976 in exercise of power conferred by <a href="/doc/768381/" id="a_10">section 4(1)</a>
of   water   (prevention    and    control   of   pollution)      Act,      1974.
Subsequently, after enactment of AIR (prevention and control of
pollution) Act, 1981 by the Parliament, the name of the Board was
changed to AP Pollution Control Board. Till AY 2002-03, assessee
claimed exemption u/s 10(20) of the Act, as a local authority.
However, after amendment to the definition of local authority u/s
10(20) with effect from 01/04/2003, by <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_11">Finance Act</a>, 2002, assessee
became liable to pay income-tax. Since assessee failed to file any
return of income, even after it became liable to pay tax, AO initiated
action u/s 147 of the Act by issuing a notice u/s 148 on 31/10/08
calling upon assessee to submit return of income for AYs. 2004-05 to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        4</span>
                                                ITA Nos. 337, 33 8, 339/Hyd /2011
                                                     A.P. Pollution Co ntrol Boa rd



2008-09. In response to the notice issued u/s 148, assessee filed its
return of income for impugned AY on 04/12/2008 on the basis of
unaudited accounts. Subsequently, assessee filed revised return
along with statutory audit reports on 04/06/09. AO observed that
revised return can only be filed when the omission was not within the
knowledge of assessee. As assessee was well aware                     that the
accounts were not audited by the respective due dates, the revised
returns filed are not valid in law, therefore, AO ignored both the
original as well as revised returns of income. In course of assessment
proceeding, AO while examining the details of receipts and payments
of assessee during the year, observed that assessee has applied very
meager amount towards the objects for which it is created i.e.
prevention and control of pollution and almost no amounts were spent
for regulation or for punishing the culprits who violated the norms of
pollution control. AO observed that though the assessee claims its
activities to be pure charitable nature but in reality assessee has not
undertaken any such activity. AO observed that during the year
assessee has shown receipts of Rs. 33,23,75,784 together with
opening balance of Rs. 25,38,05,153, thus, the total funds available
at the hands of assessee for the year under consideration was about
Rs. 58 crores, out of which, the amounts applied for various
environmental schemes and their percentage to the available funds
were found to be as under:

</pre><p id="p_16">5.     On analyzing the data as appearing in the tables, AO observed
that the amount spent towards salaries is three times more than the
amounts used for the schemes formulated by the board. It was also
noted by AO that the total revenue expenditure is 15% of the
available funds and the total amounts applied for various schemes is
only   2%.     According   to   the    AO,        establishment    expenditure          is
approximately 8 times the amounts applied for various schemes. On
examining the balance sheet as on 31/03/05, he noticed that the total

available funds was simply lying in the banks as FDs, instead of being

utilized in regulatory and enforcement activities for which assessee
was created. AO was of the view that the activities pertaining to the
schemes formulated by assessee as well as central govt.                          are not
exactly in tune with the statutory functions of the assessee board as
contained in <a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_12">section 17</a> of Water (prevention and control of pollution)
Act, 1974 and AIR (prevention and control of pollution) Act, 1981,
which are mainly advisory and inspection related functions. AO after
taking into account certain provisions of the concerned Acts, noted
that though the assessee board is vested with various powers to
prevent and control pollution of water and environment but in a
number    of    instances,    the    board       is   found    to   have       failed     in
enforcing/preventing the violations. In this regard, AO also referred to
few   instances     of   violation    committed         by    certain      institutions/
establishments. AO also referred to the report submitted by C&amp;AG
wherein various lapses/inactions of the board in enforcing the
provisions of Act were pointed out. Though, assessee claimed that
the provisions of AP Charitable and <a href="/doc/377820/" id="a_13">Hindu Religious Endowments Act</a>,
1987 is not applicable, as the Board cannot be termed as a public
charitable     institution   or     endowment,        but,    AO      rejected        such
submissions of assessee. Finally, AO having noticed the fact that the
assessee is neither registered u/s 12AA of the Act, nor approved u/s
10(23C)(iv), held that it is not eligible for availing exemption either u/s
11 or u/s 10(23C(iv). Accordingly, AO treated the surplus of Rs.
33,77,52,980 as income of assessee for the impugned AY. Being
aggrieved of the assessment order so passed, assessee preferred
appeal before ld. CIT(A).

<p id="p_17">6.    Before     the first   appellate    authority,         assessee      apart      from

raised additional ground claiming immunity from taxation under <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_14">article

assessee in the context of the facts and materials on record, found
that AO has basically assessed the income at the hands of assessee
for the following reasons:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       "i) that the appellant board does not have registration under
       sec. 12A for the year,

       10(23)(vi) for the year,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       iii) That it had huge surplus and the unspent funds were kept in

       Act</a>, 1987."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">Ld. CIT(A) did not approve the view of AO that only because
assessee has not spent substantial part of its income for the objects
of prevention and control of pollution and has earned surplus in the
respective AYs, the character of the assessee is non-charitable. He
also observed that the expenditure incurred towards salaries of the
staff cannot be considered to be towards purposes beyond the aims
and objects of the board. Ld. CIT(A) observed that considering the
nature of functions to be performed by board which is of regulatory,
advisory and technical in nature, it has to be performed with the help
of   officers   and   staff   having   requisite   technical     and     scientific
qualification. Therefore, payment of salary cannot be a disqualifying
factor as far as claim of exemption is concerned. Ld. CIT(A) also
observed that the observations made by C &amp; AG being in the nature
of guidance could not have been considered as basis for denying
exemption either u/s 11 or u/s 10(23C)(vi) of the Act. However, ld.
CIT(A) noted that assessee is neither registered u/s 12AA nor
approved under <a href="/doc/602691/" id="a_16">section 10(23C)(vi)</a>. Therefore, assessee's claim of
exemption either u/s 11 or u/s 10(23C) cannot be entertained. As far
as assessee's claim of immunity from taxation under <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_17">article 289(1)</a> of
the Constitution of India, ld. CIT(A) observed that assessee was no
more a local authority for the purpose of income-tax act, after
amendment to <a href="/doc/602691/" id="a_18">section 10(20)</a> w.e.f. 01/04/2003. At the same time,

assessee is not a part of the state itself. Ld. CIT(A) observed that
assessee is a distinct legal entity. Hence, income of assessee cannot
be said to be the income of the state so as to prevent such income
from union taxation. Ld. CIT(A) observed that the income generated
by assessee does not go to the coffers of the state directly and even
does not remain as income of the state. Though, assessee's funds
might have been spent as per the directions of the state govt. but the
same remain as the fund of assessee board and not of the state govt.
Ld.   CIT(A)   analyzing   the   provisions   of   <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_19">article    289(1)</a>       of    the
Constitution of India observed that what is exempt from union taxation
is the income of the state and not the income of any authority under
the state. Ld. CIT(A) observed, if the government exercises its power
to dissolve the board, then the properties, funds, debts, etc. of the
board devolve thereafter upon the state govt. Till the time of such
dissolution all of those belong to assessee itself and not to the state.
Ld. CIT(A) referring to the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case
of Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority Vs. Union of India
and others, 283 ITR 97, held that even if assessee board has been
constituted by the state govt. with a view to fulfill the state obligation
under <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_20">article 48A</a> of the Constitution of India, that fact alone is not
sufficient to conclude that income of assessee is the income of state
itself, so as to exempt it from union taxation as per <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_21">article 289</a> of the
Constitution of India. Ld. CIT(A) was of the view that the activities
carried on by assessee cannot even be said to be as business or
trade or any operation of that nature on behalf of the state govt. Even
otherwise also, if the operations of the assessee were to be treated to
be in the nature of trade or business as the parliament has not made
any specific provision regarding taxation of income derived there
from, the income earned by assessee will not be immune from
taxation. Ld. CIT(A) opined that assessee being an independent legal
personality distinct from the state and till such time the income
earned by assessee goes to its own funds and not to the state
coffers, the income earned by assessee will not be free from taxation

</p>

<p id="p_19">7.    As far as assessee's claim of exemption u/s 10(23C(vi) is
concerned, ld. CIT(A) noted that the Chief Commissioner of Income-
tax vide order dated 10/12/2009 has rejected assessee's claim of
approval u/s 10(23C)(vi). However, considering the fact that assessee
has filed writ application challenging the order of CCIT, which is still
pending in the jurisdictional High Court, he directed the AO to
ascertain present status and decide the issue in accordance with the
directions of Hon'ble High Court while deciding the writ application.

<p id="p_27">8.5. It is submitted that the taxability of any income derived by the
state depends upon the following factors:

<p id="p_32">8.7.   Ld. AR objecting to reliance placed by CIT(A) on the decision of
Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority (supra), submitted
that there is a distinction between the appellant body and the case
relied on by the Commissioner of Income tax(Appeals).
</p>

<p id="p_33">8.8. It was submitted, in Adityapur Industrial Area Dev. Authority, a
body corporate was constituted under the Bihar Industrial Area Dev.
<a href="/doc/32871775/" id="a_32">Authority Act</a>, 1974 to provide for planned development of industrial
area for promotion of industries and connected matters. This is
essentially a commercial activity. This activity can also be undertaken
by     any   non-state    or   private   organization,       providing       planned
development of industrial area and to promote industries. This is a
subject which is not exclusively a state function. It is one thing to

state, that a state can carry on the activity, but altogether different to
state except the state no one can else carry on the activity. This is
also not an activity mandated to be done only by the state under the
Constitution of India or by statute. The Development Authority is not Cl
regulatory body. The Development authority is merely acting as a
complimentary body to the activity of promotion of industries which is
also undertaken by private players. Therefore, the judgment of the
Hon 'ble Supreme Court should be understood in the light of the
nature of activity that is sought to be discharged by the Development
authority constituted under the Bihar State Act which is a commercial
activity, though by itself the authority may not be carrying on any
trade.
</p>

<p id="p_34">8.9.     Ld. AR submitted, it may be true that the Adityapur Industrial
Area Development Authority in carrying out its functions may not be
carrying on any trade or business. Yet the fact remains even a private
entity can take up similar activity. This is not the case in the
A.P.Pollution Control Board.
</p>

<p id="p_35">8.10. Referring to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in A.P.
State Road Transport Corpn.Ltd. Vs. ITO (52 ITR 524). Here again
carrying on transport business is not the prerogative of the State
alone. It was submitted, in Adityapur Industrial Area Dev. Authority as
well as the A.P.State Road Transport Corpn. Ltd. the activity carried
on is an activity which even a private or non state entity can carry on
and unlike the present case does not fall within the exclusive domain
of the state activity.

<p id="p_36">8.11 Ld. AR submitted, a ratio of a decision cannot be applied
without looking into the factual aspect. In this context, he relied upon
the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/900951/" id="a_33">Commissioner of

submission.
</p>

<p id="p_37">8.12. It was submitted that assessee is only an agent appointed
exclusively for carrying out the state function or the state obligation
mandated by the Constitution of India as well as by the statute. If the
veil of the assessee board is lifted, it would be seen that the state is
the person running and controlling the board. It is state which
performs the obligation through an agent appointed exclusively for the
purpose. To substantiate the aforesaid contention, ld. AR referred to
various provisions of the Water (prevention and control of pollution)
Act, 1974 and AIR (prevention and control of pollution) Act, 1981,


8.13. Ld. AR submitted, the fact that assessee board shall have its
own funds, does not make any difference if it is acting as an exclusive
agent of the state for performing a state function or a state obligation
which falls wholly in the realm of state domain. This distinction may
be relevant in all cases where the functions performed by the state
can also be performed by a non state agent as the functions do not
fall exclusively within the state domain. This distinction is vital and
makes all the difference in determining whether the income derived by
the appellant board can be said to be a state income falling within the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_34">Article 289( 1)</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_38">9.    The ld. DR on the other hand strongly supporting the finding of
the ld. CIT(A) on the issue submitted that assessee being a distinct
legal entity separate from the state govt., the income derived by
assessee cannot be considered to be the income of state govt.
thereby making it immune from taxation under <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_35">article 289(1)</a> of the
Constitution of India. Ld. DR submitted that neither the funds of
assessee are the funds of the state govt. or the fees received by it is
the income of the state. He submitted that as the income derived by
assessee goes to enhance its own funds and not to the state govt. the
income generated will not be the income of the state govt. To

substantiate such contention, ld. DR brought to our notice the
provisions contained under Chapter VI of water (Prevention and
control of pollution) Act, 1974. Thus, in sum and substance, ld. DR
submitted that as assessee is a distinct legal entity separate from the
state govt. and income of assessee also goes to its own kitty not to
the state, it cannot be said that the income earned by assessee being
the income of state govt. is exempt from taxation under <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_36">article 289(1)</a>
of the Constitution of India. In support of such contention, ld. DR
relied upon the following decisions:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">            1. AP State Road Transport Corporation Vs. CIT, 52 ITR
            524 (SC)

            others, dt. 31/05/13


</blockquote><p id="p_39">10.   In rejoinder, ld. AR submitted that the principle decided by the
ITAT, Hyderabad Bench in case of AP Housing Board (supra) will not
apply to the facts of assessee's case because the act performed by
the present assessee can only be performed by the state alone and
not by anyone else. It was submitted that AP Housing Board is a
commercial organization as it is engaged in the activity of purchase
and sale of land, construction of houses and sale of the same. It
receives money for the services rendered like any other business
undertaking. It was submitted, the activity carried on by Housing
Board can also be carried on by any other person and the nature of
activity is also not something which only a state can alone take up
and no one else. Further, the activity is carried on by a separate
entity created and controlled by the state but not by the state itself.
Ld. AR explaining the exact nature of activities carried on by the
board and the fee received submitted that the activities carried on by
assessee can only be carried on by the state or its agent and not by
anyone else. It was submitted, the nature of receipt also will show
that the functions performed by the board are only state functions and

no private player is entitled to charge such fee from industries. The
board does not render any services to the persons paying such fee.
Therefore, the character and nature of receipts of the board indicate
that it is working only as an agent or an extended arm of the state
and not like any corporation established for carrying out the activities
which even a non-state actor or any private institution can carryout. It
was submitted that the board does not owe any obligation to any
person or institution or industry for receiving any money. The
beneficiaries of the activities of the board are public at large or the
citizens of the state. It was submitted that the activity undertaken by
the board is a welfare activity which a welfare state undertakes in
discharge of its duties towards its objects. The board does not carry
out any business or commercial activity. Thus, it was submitted that
as the activity carried on by the board is of such a nature which the
state alone can carry on the income generated/derived from such
activity has to be treated as income of the state govt.

<p id="p_40">11.   We have considered the elaborate submissions made from both
sides and perused the orders of the departmental authorities as well
as other materials on record. We have also carefully applied our mind
to the decisions relied upon by the parties before us. At the outset,
we need to observe that though the assessee board was created with
effect from 24/01/1976 as Andhra Pradesh State Board for the
Prevention     and   Control   of   Water     Pollution    and      subsequently
rechristened    as   Andhra    Pradesh   Pollution     Control       Board       after
enactment of the AIR (prevention and control of pollution) Act, 1981,
but, the assessee board never claimed immunity from payment of
income-tax under <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_37">article 289</a> of the Constitution of India. Only after
assessee lost the claim of exemption u/s 10(20) of the Act, by virtue
of amendment to the definition of the expression local authority w.e.f.
01/04/2003 and it failed in its attempt, either in getting approval u/s
10(23C)(vi) or being registered u/s 12AA of the Act for the impugned
AY, as a last resort it staked its claim of immunity from payment of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                        18</span>
                                                ITA Nos. 337, 33 8, 339/Hyd /2011
                                                     A.P. Pollution Co ntrol Boa rd



income-tax under <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_38">article 289</a> of the Constitution of India, that too at
the stage of proceeding before the first appellate authority. It is a fact
on record that during the assessment proceeding also for the
impugned AY, assessee never claimed that its income is exempt from
taxation by virtue of <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_39">article 289(1)</a> of the Constitution of India. Be that
as it may, the issue before us is whether the income of the assessee
board can be said to be the income of the state govt. so as to get
immunity from taxation under      <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_40">article 289(1)</a> of the Constitution of
India. In this regard, it is the submission of assessee that as the
activities carried on by assessee is of such a nature which the state
alone can carry on and no other person or organization can carry on
such activity, the income derived by assessee while carrying out such
activity has to be treated as the income of the state. In this context,
ld. AR has taken us through various provisions of the Water
(prevention and pollution control) Act, 1974 and AIR (prevention and
control of pollution) Act, 1981, to submit that the activity carried on by
assessee board under the said provisions is only as an agent or
extended arm of the state. Hence, the income of the board has to be
treated as income of the state govt. Before deciding the validity of the
aforesaid claim of assessee, it is necessary to look into the provision
contained under <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_41">article 289(1)</a> of the Constitution of India, which is
extracted hereunder for the sake of convenience:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">            "Exemption of property and income of a State from Union
            taxation
            (1) The property and income of a State shall be exempt
            from Union taxation
            (2) Nothing in clause ( 1 ) shall prevent the Union from
            imposing, or authorising the imposition of, any tax to such
            extent, if any, as Parliament may by law provide in
            respect of a trade or business of any kind carried on by,
            or on behalf of, the Government of a State, or any
            operations connected therewith, or any property used or
            occupied for the purposes of such trade or business, or
            any income accruing or arising in connection therewith
            (3) Nothing in clause ( 2 ) shall apply to any trade or

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_29">12.   On careful analysis of <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_42">Article 289</a>, extracted above, it is to be
observed, the said article is divided into three parts. Clause (1) of
<a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_43">Article 289</a> says that the property and income of State shall be
exempt from union taxation. <a href="/doc/808995/" id="a_44">Article 289(2)</a> however provides that
nothing in clause(1) shall prevent the union from imposing and
authorizing the imposition of any tax to such extent, if any, as
parliament may by law provide in respect of a trade or business of
any kind carried on by, or on behalf of the government or State, or
any operation connected therewith, or any property used or occupied
for the purpose of such trade or business, or any income accruing or
arising in connection therewith. <a href="/doc/512915/" id="a_45">Article 289(3)</a> provides that nothing in
clause(2) shall apply to any trade or business or to any class of trade
or business, which parliament may by law to be incidental to the
ordinary functions of government. Thus, a plain reading of the
aforesaid clauses of <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_46">Article 289</a> makes it clear that they are
independent of each other and speaks of three different situations.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_41">13.   On a perusal of The Water (prevention and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_47">Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974, it is to be noticed that <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_48">section 4</a> of the said Act empowers
the state govt. to constitute a state pollution control board through a
notification published in the official gazette for exercising such
powers and functions as may be assigned to the board under the Act.
Similarly, <a href="/doc/1966744/" id="a_49">section 4</a> of The AIR (prevention and control of pollution)
Act, 1981, provides that state pollution control boards constituted
under <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_50">section 4</a> of the water (prevention and control of pollution) Act,
1974 shall be deemed to be the state board for the prevention and
control of air pollution. Further, other provisions of both the aforesaid
Acts does not leave any room for doubt that the state govt. exercises
control over the functioning of the board, but at the same time,
<a href="/doc/546640/" id="a_51">section 37</a> of The Water(prevention and control of pollution) Act, 1974
makes it clear that the board shall have its own fund constituted by
the sums paid by the state govt. and all other receipts by way gifts,

grants, donations, benefactions, fee or other wise shall be carried to
the fund of the board and all payments by the board shall be made
there from. It further provides that the board may expend such sums
as it thinks fit for performing its functions under the Act and such
sums shall be treated as expenditure payable out of the fund of the
board. <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_52">Section 37A</a> also empowers the board to borrow money from
any source by way of loans or issue of bonds debentures or such
other instruments as it may deem fit for the performance of any of its
functions under the Act, but, of course with the consent of the or the
authority given by the Central or State govt. <a href="/doc/159581089/" id="a_53">Section 38</a> provides that
the board for each financial year shall prepare its own budget
showing estimated receipt and expenditure for the next FY and copy
of the said budget shall be forwarded to the Central/State Govt. From
the aforesaid provisions, it becomes abundantly clear that the income
generated by the board which goes to constitute its own fund does not
go to the consolidated fund of the state and is distinct and separate
from the fund of the state govt. <a href="/doc/348852/" id="a_54">Section 62</a> of The Water (prevention
and control of pollution) Act, 1974 empowers the state govt. to
supersede the state pollution control board, if it is of the opinion that
the state board has persistently made defaults in the performance of
the functions imposed on it by or under the Act or circumstances exist
which render it necessary in the public interest to do so. Only upon
supersession of the state board the state govt. takes over all the
powers and functions and duties performed by the state board and
also property owned or controlled by the board shall vest in the state
govt. Therefore, from the aforesaid provision, it becomes clear that
until supersession of the state board, not only it retains its distinct
and independent identity but also the funds and property of the board
also remains in its possession.

<p id="p_42">14.   Therefore,   examining      the   aforesaid   facts     vis-à-vis       the
provisions contained under <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_55">Article 289</a> of the Constitution of India, it
is evident that the powers/functions exercised by the board cannot be

(2) and (3) of <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_56">Article 289</a> may not be applicable to the facts of
assessee's case. The only provision under which assessee can
possibly claim immunity from taxation is clause (1) of <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_57">Article 289.</a> On
a plain reading of the said clause, it is clear that only property or
income of state is exempt from union taxation. The expression
'income of a state' as incorporated under <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_58">Article 289(1)</a> has to be
interpreted to mean, the income of the state govt. itself and not the
income of some authority other than the state, such as statutory
authority or board which is a independent/separate juristic entity,
even though it may be owned or controlled by the state govt. As we
have stated earlier, provisions of both the water (prevention and
control of pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (prevention and control of
pollution) Act, 1981, make it clear that the funds of the board are its
own funds and does not belong to the state govt. Only in case of
supersession of the board, the property of the board vests with the
state govt. Therefore, until such supersession the fund of the board is
distinct from the fund of state govt. Considered in the aforesaid
perspective, the income/receipts of the Board cannot be considered to
be the income/receipts of the state govt. It also cannot be disputed
that assessee is an independent/separate juristic entity distinct from
the state govt., though, the state may be exercising control over the
board. Further, the facts and materials on record also make it clear
that the income/receipts of the board remain as its own funds and not
transferred to the coffers of the state govt. In the aforesaid facts and
circumstances when the income/receipts of the board remain with the
board itself and not transferred to the state govt. such income/receipt
has to be considered as income/receipt of the board and not of the
state govt. Therefore, such income/receipt cannot be immune from
taxation under <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_59">article 289(1)</a> of the Constitution of India.

      Development Authority Act, 1974, particularly<a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_62"> s. 17</a> thereof, we
      have    no   manner     of   doubt    that   the   income   of    the
      appellant/Authority constituted under the said Act is its own
      income and that the appellant/Authority manages its own funds. It
      has its own assets and liabilities. It can sue or be sued in its own
      name. Even though, it does not carry on any trade or business
      within the contemplation of cl. (2) of <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_63">Art. 289</a>, it still is an
      Authority constituted under an Act of the legislature of the State
      having a distinct legal personality, being a body corporate, as
      distinct from the State. Sec. 17 of the Act further clarifies that
      only upon its dissolution its assets, funds and liabilities devolve
      upon the State Government. Necessarily therefore, before its
      dissolution, its assets, funds and liabilities are its own. It is,
      therefore,   futile  to    contend    that   the   income   of    the
      appellant/Authority is the income of State Government, even
      though the Authority is constituted under an Act enacted by the
      State legislature by issuance of a notification by the Government
      thereunder."

<p id="p_44">16.   The Hon'ble Supreme Court after analyzing the provisions
contained under <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_64">article 289</a> as a whole and taking note of the
principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of AP
State Road Transport Corpn. Vs. ITO (52 ITR 524) observed as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">      "Considerable reliance was placed on the principles laid down in
      the aforesaid decision by learned counsel appearing for the Union
      of India. He submitted that having regard to the provisions of the
      Act under which the appellant/Authority is established, the same
      conclusion may be reached. In particular, emphasizing the fact
      that as in Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation case
      (supra), so in the instant case as well,<a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_65"> s. 17</a> of the Act provides
      that upon dissolution of the appellant/Authority, the properties,
      funds and dues realizable by the Authority along with its liabilities
      shall devolve upon the State Government. Impliedly, therefore,
      such properties, funds and dues vest in the Authority till its
      dissolution, and only thereafter it vests in the State Government.
      He also referred to various other provisions of the Act and
      submitted that there was nothing in the Act which attempted to
      lift the veil from the face of the corporation. Even though the
      Authority was created under an Act of the legislature, it was still
      an Authority which had a distinct personality of its own, having
      perpetual succession and a common seal, with powers to acquire,
      hold and dispose of property, and to contract, and could sue and
      be sued in its own name. Shri Venugopal, on the other hand, tried
      to distinguish the judgment on the ground that the Andhra

      Pradesh Road Transport Corporation is being run on business
      lines, and a corporation that runs on business lines is
      distinguishable and different from a corporation which is not run
      on those lines. Even if such a distinction is drawn, that will not
      have the effect of making the income of the corporation the
      income of the State Government having regard to the other
      features noticed above."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_45">The Hon'ble Supreme Court finally held that exemption can be
claimed under <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_66">Article 289(1)</a> of the Constitution of India only if the
income can be said to be the income of the state govt.
</p>

<p id="p_46">17.   Considered in the light of the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court as aforesaid and facts involved in the present appeal,
under no circumstances it can be held that the income/receipts of the
assessee is that of the state govt.. This is because, not only
assessee is a distinct and separate legal/juristic entity but funds of
the assessee also belong to assessee. Though, the learned AR has
tried to impress upon us that the principles laid down in case of
Adityapur Industria. (supra) will not be applicable to assessee, but,
we are unable to agree with the same. In our view, the principles laid
down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court squarely applies to the facts of
the case of assessee. While dealing with identical issue in case of AP
Housing Board (supra), a coordinate bench of this Tribunal has held
that Housing Board being a separate juristic entity, income derived by
it cannot be considered to be the income of the state under <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_67">article
289</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>

<p id="p_47">18.   The entire issue can also be looked into from another angle. As
can be seen till AY 2002-03, assessee had been claiming exemption
u/s 10(20) by treating itself to be a local authority.            Moreover,
assessee has also applied for registration u/s 12AA of the Act as a
charitable institution and has also been granted such registration in
pursuance to the directions of the ITAT. Furthermore, it is a fact on
record that assessee has also applied for approval u/s 10(23C)(iv) of
the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_68">IT Act</a>, and approval has also been granted to assessee from AY
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                          24</span>
                                                   ITA Nos. 337, 33 8, 339/Hyd /2011

2009-10 onwards. From the aforesaid facts, it becomes clear that
assessee by its own actions considers itself to be a separate legal
entity distinct from the state govt.          That being the case, the
income/receipts of the board has to be treated as its own income and
not    of the state govt. In the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we
agree with the ld. CIT(A) that assessee cannot get immunity from
taxation under <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_69">article 289</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>

<p id="p_48">19.    As far as the next issue relating to claim of exemption u/s
10(23C)(iv) of the Act is concerned, considering the fact that
assessee's     writ   application   is   pending     before        the     Hon'ble
Jurisdictional High Court, we uphold the directions of the ld. CIT(A).
</p>

<p id="p_49">20.    Now coming to the issue raised in ground No. 9 read with
additional grounds, ld. AR has submitted before us that the actual
receipts as per the revised return is Rs. 19,46,56,470 as against Rs.
32,77,52,980 considered by AO. After considering the submissions of
assessee vis-à-vis the facts and materials on record, we direct the AO
to verify this aspect and adopt the correct figure after affording a
reasonable opportunity of being heard to assessee in the matter.
</p>

<p id="p_50">21.    As far as levy of interest u/s 234A and 234B is concerned, such
interests being automatic and mandatory, we do not find any reason
to interfere with the same.
</p>

<p id="p_51">22.    In the result, assessee's appeal is partly allowed for statistical
purposes.

exemption under <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_70">Article 289(1)</a> of Constitution of india or u/s 10(23C)
