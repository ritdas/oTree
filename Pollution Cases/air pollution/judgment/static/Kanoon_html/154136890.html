SURYA KANT, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">(1).         The length and width of the right to appeal bestowed on the

victim of a crime through the amendment(s) carried out in the Code of

Criminal Procedure, 1973 by Act No.5 of 2009 w.e.f. December 31, 2009

is still eluded of unanimity amongst different High Courts. A Division

Bench of this Court in Smt. Ram Kaur @ Jaswinder Kaur vs. Jagbir

Singh @ Jabi &amp; Ors., 2010(3) RCR (Crl.) 391, also made an attempt

to define the expression "victim" within the meaning of Section 2(wa) for

the purpose of his right to appeal under proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_1">Section 372</a> CrPC. A

learned Single Judge while considering an application seeking leave of

this Court to prefer appeal against the order of acquittal passed in

relation to the accusations under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_2">Sections 279</a>, <a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_3">337</a>, <a href="/doc/1721129/" id="a_4">338</a> and <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_5">304-A</a> IPC

found an apparent conflict between proviso to <a href="/doc/1938563/" id="a_6">Section 372</a> and <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_7">Section

378</a> CrPC and vide his order dated September 5, 2011 passed in CRM-

              victim before a Court to which an appeal shall

              ordinarily lie against the order of conviction of such

              a Court while <a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_9">Section 378</a> of the Code refers to filing

              of an appeal to the Court of Session from an order of

              acquittal passed by a Magistrate only in respect of

              cognizable and non-bailable offences. There would

              provided to a victim in the cases where the offences

              are bailable and in which cases the aforesaid

              ambiguity amounts to giving with a left hand only to

              be taken away by the right hand."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">(2).         Since the Division Bench in Smt. Ram Kaur's case (supra)

did not address the afore-mentioned issue, the learned Single Judge

referred the matter to a larger Bench. Another learned Single Judge

came across yet another issue in Crl. Misc. No. 790-MA of 2010 (O&amp;M),

namely, whether a 'victim' under proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_10">Section 372</a> CrPC includes

the 'complainant' also and owing to its importance, he too vide order

dated May 09, 2012 referred the following question to a larger Bench:-

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">             "Whether the word "victim" as mentioned in the

             proviso of <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_11">Section 372</a> CrPC include complainant also

             for the purpose of availing the remedy of appeal as

             given to the victim by aforesaid proviso?"


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">(3).         The above question was framed in an application filed by the

complainant seeking special leave to appeal under <a href="/doc/1856707/" id="a_12">Section 378(4)</a>

against the order of acquittal passed by the Magistrate in a case under

<a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_13">Section 138</a> of Negotiable Instruments Act.

</blockquote><p id="p_2">(4).         Both the references made by two different learned Single

Judges were considered by two of us on July 18, 2012 and having regard

to the newly emerging principles of criminal jurisprudence, the Division
 CRM-790-MA-2010 final                                            -4-

<p id="p_3">

Bench formulated four questions (reformulated along with additional

questions in para 6) and referred them for determination to a larger

Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_4">(5).         The continued quest for true answers to the questions so re-

phrased, in an arena witnessing a note of discordance amongst different

High Courts on one question or the other, led to fairly long hearings

with remarkable assistance rendered by a team of bright young lawyers

comprising Sarvshri PS Ahluwalia, Deepak Sabharwal and Arjun

Sheoran, with an equally meaningful assistance rendered by a battery

of State counsel representing the States of Punjab and Haryana, who

addressed the issues with totally non-adversarial approach.

(6).         During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the parties

rightly pointed out that besides the re-modulation of four questions

which found mention in the reference order dated July 18, 2012, some

issues, ancillary but of paramount importance, also deserve to be

answered by the larger Bench. We, therefore, formulate the following

seven questions that arise for our consideration:-


</p><p id="p_5">          (A)    What is the true import and meaning of the

                 expression 'victim' as defined under <a href="/doc/328668/" id="a_14">Section 2(wa)</a>

                 read with proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_15">Section 372</a> Cr.P.C.?
</p>
<p id="p_6">
          (B)    Whether 'complainant' in a private complaint-case,

                 who is also the 'victim' and the 'victim' other than the

                 'complainant' in such cases are entitled to present

                 from the High Court under <a href="/doc/1856707/" id="a_17">Section 378(4)</a> CrPC?


          (C)    Whether the 'rights' of a victim under the amended

                 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_18">Cr.P.C</a>. are accessory and auxiliary to those perceived

                 to be the exclusive domain of the 'State'?


          (D)    Whether presentation of appeal against acquittal is a

                 'right' or an 'obligation' of the 'State' stemming from

                 the Constitution?

                 appeal against that order of acquittal under Clause

                 the said proviso, can be converted into an appeal and

                 transferred to the Court of competent jurisdiction?


          (G)    What would be the period of limitation for a 'victim'

                 to prefer an appeal under proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_22">Section 372</a>

Legislative History and Emerging Principles of Criminal
Jurisprudence:-
</p>
<p id="p_9">International Scenario:
</p>
<p id="p_10">(7).         The universalist views on criminal justice system emphasize

on the norms collectively recognized and accepted by all of humanity.

The internationally accepted norms whereunder an individual's

criminal act(s) is accountable are universally binding and applicable

across national borders on the premise that crimes committed are not

just against individual victims but also against mankind as a whole.

The crime against an individual thus transcends and is taken as an

assault on humanity itself. It is the concept of the humanity at large as

a victim which has essentially characterized 'crimes' on universally-

accepted principles. The acceptability of this principle was the genesis

of Criminal Justice System with State dominance and jurisdiction to

investigate and adjudicate the 'crime'. For long, the criminal law had

been viewed on a dimensional plane wherein the Courts were required

to adjudicate between the accused and the State. The 'victim' - the de

facto sufferer of a crime had no participation in the adjudicatory

process and was made to sit outside the Court as a mute spectator. The

ethos of criminal justice dispensation to prevent and punish 'crime'

would surreptitiously turn its back on the 'victim' of such crime whose

cries went unnoticed for centuries in the long corridors of the

conventional apparatus. Various international Declarations, domestic

legislations and Courts across the world recognized the 'victim' and they

<p id="p_11">

voiced together for his right of representation, compensation and

assistance. The UN Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for the

Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power, 1985, which was ratified by a

substantial number of countries including India, was a landmark in

boosting the pro-victim movement. The Declaration defined a 'victim' as

someone who has suffered harm, physical or mental injury, emotional

suffering, economic loss, impairment of fundamental rights through acts

or omissions that are in violation of criminal laws operative within a

State, regardless of whether the perpetrator is identified, apprehended,

prosecuted or convicted and regardless of the familial relationship

between the perpetrator and the 'victim'.

<p id="p_12">(8).           European Union (EU) also took great strides in granting and

protecting the rights of 'victims' through various Covenants including

the following:-

</p>
<p id="p_20">(11).        Much before the United Nations stepped into or the other

developed nations legislated for the protection and promotion of victims'

rights, the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/153998550/" id="a_23">Rattan Singh vs. State of Punjab</a>,

(1979) 4 SCC 719, lamented against complete desertion of a victim in

our criminal jurisprudence observing that "The victimization of the

family of the convict may well be a reality and is regrettable. It is a

weakness of our jurisprudence that the victims of the crime, and the

distress of the dependants of the prisoner, do not attract the attention of

the law. Indeed, victim reparation is still the vanishing point of our

criminal law. This is a deficiency in the system which must be rectified

by the Legislature.     We can only draw attention to this matter.

Hopefully, the Welfare State will bestow better thought and action to

traffic justice in the light of the observations we have made".

(12).        The Legislature though did not come forward to address the

issue but the Law Commission of India, nonetheless, in its 154th Report

attributed Chapter-XV on "Victimology" made radical recommendations

on the aspect of compensatory justice through a Victim Compensation

Scheme. Thereafter came the report of a Committee on the Reforms of

Criminal Justice System, commonly known as "Malimath Committee

Report, 2003". The Committee was constituted by Government of India

with an avowed object of suggesting ways and means for developing a

cohesive system in which all the parts work in coordination to achieve

the common goal as the people by and large have lost confidence in the

criminal justice system and the bewildered victim is crying for attention

and justice. The Committee recommended the right of the victim or his

legal representative 'to be impleaded as a party in every criminal

proceeding    where the charge       is   punishable with seven years

imprisonment or more'; the right of voluntary organizations for

impleadment in court proceedings in select cases; the victim's right to be

represented by an advocate of his choice and if he is not in a position to

afford, to provide an advocate at the State's expenses; victim's right to

participate in criminal trial; the right to know the status of

<p id="p_22">

investigation and take necessary steps in this regard and to be heard at

crucial stages of the criminal trial including at the time of grant or

cancellation of bail. The Committee further recommended that "the

victim shall have a right to prefer an appeal against any adverse

order...; he should be provided legal services and that 'victim

compensation' is a State obligation in all serious crimes, whether the

offender is apprehended or not, convicted or acquitted" and for this

object a separate legislation be enacted.

in <a href="/doc/105430/" id="a_24">Jahira Habibullah H. Sheikh &amp; Anr. vs. State of Gujarat &amp;

leave to be granted by the High Court and a complainant's right to

other than the complainant should be entertained "in those cases only

where it is convinced that the public interest justifies an appeal against

High Court. The Law Commission of India in its 41st Report given in

September, 1969 as also in 48th Report pertaining to the Criminal

Procedure Bill, 1970, however, recommended to restrict the right of

appeal given to the State Government against an order of acquittal by

introducing the concept of 'leave to appeal' and that all appeals against

acquittal should come to the High Court though it rejected the right to

appeal to "the victim of a crime or his relatives".

(26).        The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 came into being on

January 25, 1974 repealing<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_47"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, 1898. The

recommendations made by the Law Commission of India, referred to

embargo in sub-Section (3) to <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_48">Section 378</a> against entertainment of an

appeal against acquittal "except with the leave of the High Court". Sub-

section (4) of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_49">Section 378</a> retained the condition of maintainability of an

appeal at the instance of a complainant against an order of acquittal

passed in a complaint-case only if special leave to appeal was granted by

brought on the Statute Book by the same <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_66">Amendment Act</a> through a

newly-added <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_67">Section 357A</a> which inter alia provides that "every State

rehabilitation, or where the cases end in acquittal or discharge and the

victim has to be rehabilitated, it may make recommendation for

compensation". Similarly, its sub-Section (4) enables that "Where the

offender is not traced or identified, but the victim is identified, and

where no trial takes place, the victim or his dependents may make an

application to the State or the District Legal Services Authority for

award of compensation".

upon and/or earned by the innumerable victims after a protracted

accused were, however, acquitted by the trial court holding that the

deceased died in a road accident.        The State did not prefer appeal

against the order of acquittal but the informant-cum-complainant

asserted herself to be a 'victim' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_85">Section 2(wa)</a> and

filed appeal under proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_86">Section 372</a> without seeking 'special leave'

consequential right to appeal were disputed, the Division Bench on

consideration of the amended provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_87"> of the Code</a> held that :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">                   "A bare perusal of the definition of "victim" reveals

             that the victim means a person, who has suffered any

             loss or injury caused by reason of the act or omission of

             the offender, and further expression "victim" includes

             his or her guardian or legal heir. The General Assembly

             of the United Nations in its 96th plenary meeting on

             29th November, 1985, made a Declaration of Basic

             Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of

             the world suffer harm as a result of crime and the abuse

             of power and that the rights of these victims have not

             been adequately recognised and also that frequently

             their families, witnesses and other who aid them are

             unjustly subjected to loss, damage or injury. The

             means only a person, who has suffered any loss or

is a near relation of the deceased, cannot be said to be a person who has

suffered any loss or injury caused by reason of the act or omission of the

offender. Undisputably, she is neither guardian nor legal heir of the

deceased. Therefore, in our view, the complainant in the instant case is

not the 'victim' who can prefer an appeal under <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_88">Section 372</a> of the

State of NCT of Delhi &amp; Ors</a>, 2011(2) AD (Delhi) 210. In the first

case, the appellant who was the father of the deceased, filed appeal

under proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_92">Section 372</a> of the Code against acquittal of the accused

in a case under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_93">Section 302</a> IPC etc. and claimed himself to be a 'victim'

within the meaning of <a href="/doc/760919/" id="a_94">Section 2(wa)</a> of the Code. In the second case

also, the appellant was the father of deceased Nasreen who was married

to one of the accused. The primary question that arose for consideration

in the first case was whether the appellant (Chattar Singh) could be

regarded as a 'victim' for the purpose of proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_95">Section 372</a> of the

Code? The Court held that "a victim of crime is a person who suffers any

loss or injury as a result of the crime. Although the expression "any loss

or injury" is an expansive expression, it appears that it has been used in

the context of the person whose suffering is the direct and most proximate

result of the crime".   The Bench further held that a definition which

employs the expression "means and includes" is an exhaustive definition

and in the present case <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_96">Section 2(wa)</a> would refer to a crime victim in

the natural and ordinary sense as the person who directly and most

proximately suffered the loss or injury but it would also include - (a) his

or her heirs in case he or she was dead; or (b) his or her guardian if he

or she was a minor or of unsound mind or under some other disability.

(41).        The Delhi High Court thereafter concentrated on the word

"heirs" and after referring to the related case law held that "in the case

of <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_97">Section 2(wa)</a>, since the word 'heirs' is preceded by the word 'legal', it
 CRM-790-MA-2010 final                                           - 26 -
</p>
<p id="p_63">

must be construed in the legal sense as that is the clear intention of the

Legislature. The expression 'legal heirs' in relation to a victim, therefore,

clearly refers to a person who is entitled to the property of the

victim under the applicable law of inheritance".              Applying this

principle to the facts of the first case, the Court rejected the appellant's

plea of being a 'victim' as his deceased son had left behind his widow

and children (Class-I heirs) while the appellant (father) was only a

Class-II heir and was not entitled to succeed the estate of the deceased

under the <a href="/doc/685111/" id="a_98">Hindu Succession Act</a>, 1956 in the presence of Class-I heirs.

In the second case, the father (Karimul Hajazi) of the deceased was held

to be a 'victim' on applying the principle of Muslim Law under which the

person responsible for the death of another person from whom the first

person is otherwise to inherit, would be disqualified from such

inheritance and on this analogy the husband of the victim was treated

as non-existent and father of the victim was to be her legal heir.

principles of succession and inheritance prescribed under personal laws

do not apply when compensation is awarded by the State who do not

function under any personal law.          It was further held that the

compensation in such like cases would not be necessarily awarded to the

legal heirs only according to the personal law, but equitably to the next

of kin.

preferred an appeal before the High Court under proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_103">Section 372</a>

of the Code.      The Gauhati High Court held that "person who has

suffered loss due to a crime is obviously a victim" and that "in <a href="/doc/760919/" id="a_104">Section

(46).        There is thus lack of unanimity on the constituent and

composition of 'legal heirs' of a 'victim' for the purpose of locus to appeal

under proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_110">Section 372</a>. While the Delhi High Court has taken the

view that the expression "legal heir" is referable to the personal law of

the 'victim' and whosoever has first preference to succeed the estate

under such law, would be the sole 'legal heir' of the 'victim' for the

purposes under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_111"> the Code</a>, the Gauhati High Court has viewed it

differently and liberally.

<p id="p_67">(47).        <a href="/doc/760919/" id="a_112">Section 2(wa)</a> of the Code defines 'victim' to mean a person

who has suffered any loss or injury caused by the reason of the act or

the omission for which the accused person has been charged and the

expression "victim" includes his or her 'guardian' or 'legal heir'. We find

on its plain reading that the Legislature has classified the 'victim' in

two categories i.e. (i) a person who has suffered any loss or injury

caused by the act or omission attributed to the accused; and (ii) the

'guardian' or 'legal heirs' of such 'victim'. The correct understanding of

the first part of the term "victim" is contingent and is subject to the true

scope of the words "loss" or "injury" contained therein. Both these

words are not defined in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_113"> the Code</a>, however, its <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_114">Section 2(y)</a> says that

"words and expressions used herein and not defined but defined in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_115"> the

to them in that Code".

(48).        <a href="/doc/519920/" id="a_116">Section 23</a> IPC defines "wrongful loss" and it says that

</pre><p id="p_68">"'wrongful loss' is the loss by unlawful means of property to which the

person losing it is legally entitled". It is further explained that "a person

is said to lose wrongfully when such person is wrongfully kept out of any

property, as well as when such person is wrongfully deprived of

property". According to <a href="/doc/1106981/" id="a_117">Section 44</a> IPC, the word "injury" "denotes any

harm whatever illegally caused to any person, in body, mind, reputation

or property". It is, thus, in the context of offences against property,

especially under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_118">Section 418</a> and 'mischief' as defined in <a href="/doc/441951/" id="a_119">Section 425</a>

IPC that the term 'wrongful loss' has been used in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_120"> the Penal Code</a>. The

Legislature while defining 'victim' in <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_121">Section 2(wa)</a> of the code has used

the word 'any loss' before 'or injury' and has not restricted it to

'wrongful loss' only. We, thus, find that the words 'loss' and 'injury'

used in <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_122">Section 2(wa)</a> are synonymous. This view is also fortified by the

use of wide term 'any loss' in clause (b) as compared to 'the loss' in

clause (c) of <a href="/doc/875650/" id="a_123">Section 357(1)</a> of the Code.
</p>
<p id="p_69">(49).        It is so acte clair that a person who has suffered an injury in

body or mind or reputation or to his/her property or if such person has

been caused loss of property, to which he is legally entitled to,

unlawfully at the hands of another person who has been charged as an

accused, is the 'victim' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_124">Section 2(wa)</a>. Similarly,

if as a result of the aggravated form of victimization, such 'victim' of

first part does not survive, the second part of the definition of 'victim' as

defined in <a href="/doc/915147/" id="a_125">Section 2(wa)</a> of the Code substitutes the first part and

categories of persons have been defined in the term 'victim' in <a href="/doc/915147/" id="a_127">Section

2(wa)</a> of the Code, namely, (i) who has suffered loss or injury; (ii)

Guardian of the above category, if sufferer is a minor or of unsound

mind; and (iii) legal heirs of the first category if the sufferer dies.

(51).        The phrase "legal heir" has not been defined in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_128"> the Code</a> or

the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_129">IPC</a>. In its literal sense the word "legal" means as something which

is established, appointed or authorized by law. Black's Law Dictionary

(9th Edition) explains "heir" to mean "a person who, under the laws of

intestacy, is entitled to receive an intestate descendant's property - Also

termed as 'legal heir'; 'heir at law'; 'lawful heir'..." and that in civil law,

'heir' means "a person who succeeds to the rights and occupies the place

of, or is entitled to succeed to the estate of, a descendant, whether by an

act of the descendant or by operation of law". The Chambers Dictionary

defines the word "heir" (in law) as "a person who actually succeeds to

property, title etc. on the death of its previous holder". The Oxford

English Dictionary (Indian Edition) also defines the word "heir" to mean

"a person legally entitled to the property or rank of another on that

person's death". It further defines "heir-at-law" to mean "an heir by

right of blood especially to the real property of an intestate".

(52).        According to Barron's Dictionary of Legal Terms (3rd

</pre><p id="p_71">Edition), the term "heirs" means "strictly those whom statutory law

would appoint to inherit an estate should the ancestor die without a

Will (intestate); sometimes referred to as 'heirs-at-law', 'rightful heirs',

'legal heirs'. The term is often applied indiscriminately to those who

inherit by Will or deed, as well as by operation of law".

(53).        <a href="/doc/1652416/" id="a_130">In Angurbala Mullick vs. Debabrata Mullick</a>, AIR 1951

SC 293, it was held that the word "heirs" cannot normally be limited to

"issues" only. It must mean all those persons who are entitled to the

property of another under the law of inheritance. <a href="/doc/1923018/" id="a_131">In N.Krishnammal

vs. R. Ekamabaram &amp; Ors</a>, (1979) 3 SCC 273, the question that

arose for consideration was whether the expression "heirs" would mean

'legal heir' and it was ruled that the legal terms such as 'heirs' used in a

Will must be construed in legal sense, unless a contrary intention is

clearly expressed by the testator.

Sabnis (Dr</a>.), (1994) 3 SCC 481, explained that the word "heir" may be

construed both in a wider as well as in a narrower sense and therefore,

which sense would be applicable to the facts of a particular case would

depend upon the intention and scheme of the particular legislation in

which the question occurred.

<p id="p_74">

"heir" must be construed in the broad and general sense so as to include

all those on whom the estate of the deceased dwells whether on

intestacy or by means of testamentary instrument like a Will and that

such an interpretation promotes and effectuates the cardinal legislative

idea or purpose to bring to a close or at least rectify the evil of neglect to

Hindu women at the hands of their husbands and after their husbands'

death by those who may succeed to or inherit their husbands' estate.

(56).         We may also refer to some of the Parliamentary legislations

where the expression "legal heir" finds mention but without any

definition.    The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior

Citizens Act, 2007 defines "relative" [<a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_136">Section 2(g)</a>] which means "any

legal heir of the childless senior citizen who is not a minor and is in

possession of or would inherit his property after his death".         Such a

'relative' is obligated to maintain a senior citizen as per <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_137">Sections 4</a>&amp;<a href="/doc/758150/" id="a_138">5</a> of

the 2007 Act. The Advocates' <a href="/doc/179735/" id="a_139">Welfare Fund Act</a>, 2001 (<a href="/doc/1519126/" id="a_140">Section 11</a>) cast

a duty on the Trust Committee to make payment out of the welfare fund

to the members of the fund or their nominees or legal heirs. <a href="/doc/681709/" id="a_141">The

Merchant Shipping Act</a>, 1958 (<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_142">Section 141</a>) also contemplates payment

of compensation to a seaman and in the case of a deceased seaman, to

the person nominated by him or to his legal heirs. <a href="/doc/885477/" id="a_143">Section 44</a> of the

Delhi Police Act, 1978 also contemplates payment of compensation to a

person who has suffered loss or damage to his property or grievous hurt

or to the legal heirs of any person who was no more alive. <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_144">The Income

Tax Act</a>, 1961 [<a href="/doc/919618/" id="a_145">Section 10(BC)</a>] permits deduction of an amount received

or receivable from the Central or State Government or a local authority

by an individual or his legal heir by way of compensation on account of

any disaster etc. Similarly, the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_146">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986 defines

a "complainant" to mean a consumer and in case of death of the

consumer his legal heir or representative, who are competent to make a

complaint [<a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_147">Section 2(1)(v)</a>].
</p>
<p id="p_76">(57).        It thus appears that every heir who, in law, is entitled to

succeed to the estate of a deceased 'victim' in one or the other

eventuality, shall fall within the ambit of Section2(wa)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_148"> of the Code</a>, even

if the estate of such deceased 'victim' is to devolve upon the legal heirs

as per the order of preference prescribed under the personal law of such

'victim'.   This conclusion of ours is also compatible with the other

provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_149"> of the Code</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_77">(58).        It is pertinent to take stock of two other provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_150"> of the

Code</a>, namely, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_151">Sections 357</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_152">357-A</a> pertaining to "Order to Pay

Compensation" and "Victim Compensation Scheme", respectively.

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_153">Section 357</a> provides that when a Court imposes a sentence of fine or a

sentence of which fine forms a part, the Court may, where such fine is

recoverable from a person convicted of any offence for having caused the

death of another person, order the whole or any part of the fine so

recovered to be applied, inlcuding "in paying compensation to the

persons who are, under the <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_154">Fatal Accidents Act</a>, 1855 (13 of 1885),

entitled to recover damages from the person sentenced for the loss

resulting to them from such death".

(59).        <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_155">Section 357-A</a> of the Code, on the other hand, contemplates

</pre><p id="p_78">formulation of a Scheme by the Government for providing funds for the

purpose of "compensation to the victim or his dependents who have

suffered loss or injury as a result of the crime and who require

rehabilitation".        The Legislature has consciously prescribed two

different categories of eligible persons who are entitled to be

compensated under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_156">Section 357(1)(c)</a> or <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_157">Section 357-A</a> of the Code, in

the case of the death of a 'victim'.
</p>
<p id="p_79">(60).        <a href="/doc/413034/" id="a_158">Section 1-A</a> of the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 entitles the

wife/husband, parent and child, if any, of the person whose death has

been caused by wrongful act, neglect or default, to maintain an action

and recover damages in respect thereof. It may thus be seen that the

persons who are entitled to be compensated by the Court under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_159">Section

357(1)(c)</a> for the death of their near and dear ones, could be the spouse,

parent or child of such victim but they may not necessarily be entitled to

seek compensation within the scheme formulated under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_160">Section 357-A</a>

unless it is proved that such a claimant was 'dependent' on the deceased

and requires 'rehabilitation'. To say it differently, it is nowhere

contemplated under the scheme<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_161"> of the Code</a> that the compensation

recoverable    from     an   accused   or   admissible   under   the      Victim

Compensation Scheme [<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_162">Sections 357(1)(c)</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_163">357-A</a>], is payable only to

the 'legal heirs' of a deceased victim.

preconditioned the admissibility of compensation to the next kin of a

victim, we revert back to the second part of the definition of "victim"

under <a href="/doc/915147/" id="a_166">Section 2(wa)</a> of the Code which includes his/her guardian or

legal heir within the expression "victim", with special reference to the

right to 'engage an advocate' under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_167">Section 24(8)</a> or the 'right to appeal'

under proviso to <a href="/doc/1938563/" id="a_168">Section 372</a> of the Code.
</p>
<p id="p_82">(62).        The Legislature while specifying four categories of the next

of kin of the deceased victim, has purposefully couched the language of

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_169">Section 357(1)(c)</a> in a manner which leaves no grey area for the Court

firstly to determine the status of the claimant as a 'legal heir' and then

the order of succession amongst different categories of heirs. Similarly,

the Legislature did not deem it necessary to use the expression "victim"

in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_170">Section 357</a>, while in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_171">Section 357A</a>, it has shrunk the otherwise

widened circumference of the word "victim" by imposing the riders like

'dependent' or his/her requirement for 'rehabilitation'.

(63).        Since the expression "legal heir" has not been used in

<a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_172">Section 2(wa)</a> for the purpose of non-testamentary succession including

entitlement to compensation under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_173"> the Code</a>, it must be safely inferred

and construed that both the expressions "guardian" and "legal heir" are

relatable to some other rights given to a 'victim' under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_174"> the Code</a>

including the one under proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_175">Section 24(8)</a> to 'engage an advocate'

with the permission of the Court and the other substantive 'right to

appeal' under proviso to <a href="/doc/1938563/" id="a_176">Section 372</a> of the Code.

(64).        The right to 'engage an advocate' given to a 'victim' draws

</pre><p id="p_83">parity from the right to fair trial guaranteed to an accused and is

essentially meant to enable the Court to have the viewpoint of a 'victim'

who remained discounted for years and to whom the Legislature

unambiguously intends to provide a presence and appearance before the

Court. Since the very object of this right is to give restricted

participation in trial to the 'victim' and assist the Court to arrive at a

just conclusion, it is not necessary nor<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_177"> the Code</a> perceives so that only

that 'legal heir' who has preferential entitlement to succeed to the

property of an intestate, alone shall be competent to engage such

advocate. The 'right to appeal' under proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_178">Section 372</a> at the best

enables the Appellate Court to call for the records, re-appraise the

evidence and determine - (i) whether acquittal of the accused is

justified? Or (ii) whether the accused has been rightly convicted for a

lesser offence? Or (iii) whether the compensation determined under

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_179">Section 357</a> is inadequate? Such an exercise, in our humble opinion, can

be undertaken by the appellate court on presentation of appeal by any

'legal heir' irrespective of his proximity with the deceased under the

personal law. Any narrow construction would defeat the very legislative

object behind insertion of <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_180">Section 2(wa)</a> and proviso to <a href="/doc/1938563/" id="a_181">Section 372</a> of the

Code and re-introduce the mischief which the Legislature has intended

to remove.

<p id="p_84">(65).        It was contended and rightly so that the meaning of the

term "victim" or that of his/her "legal heir" deserves to be given widest

amplitude to meet with all kinds of peculiar or unforeseen situations,

two of which are illustratively given below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">             (a) where a major, unmarried orphan is murdered and

                   the   accused    person(s)/undertrial(s)   was/were

                   acquitted of the charges and the State does not

                   prefer an appeal against the acquittal.

                   the charges and the State does not prefer an appeal

                   against the acquittal.</blockquote><p id="p_86">

</p><p id="p_87">            In both the mis-happenings there may not be any person

known as 'legal heir' or a 'guardian' to file an appeal against

unwarranted acquittal and it will be against all canons of justice to say

that the appellate Court in such like situations would be helpless and

the offenders will go unpunished.       Since the Legislature has finally

granted the right to appeal to a 'victim', it is the duty of the Court to

trenchantly affirm such right and provide appropriate remedy.

(66).        We say so also for the reason that the right to 'engage an

advocate' or to 'prefer an appeal' under proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_182">Section 372</a> does not

ipso facto entitle the appellant to claim compensation as a 'legal heir' or

the next of kin of a deceased 'victim'. That being so, every class or

category of legal heirs of a deceased 'victim' can have locus to invoke the

remedy under proviso to <a href="/doc/1938563/" id="a_183">Section 372</a> of the Code, without reading into

<p id="p_88">

<a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_184">Section 2(wa)</a> that if Class-I legal heir of a 'victim' opts out of filing any

appeal, the other legal heirs would also suffer from the same disability.

(67).        The legislative intentment can be given its fullest effect by

permitting all legal heirs, irrespective of their classification under the

personal law to prefer appeal under proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_185">Section 372</a>. Such a

purposive interpretation of the expression "legal heir" within the

meaning of <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_186">Section 2(wa)</a> does no violence to nor does it conflict with

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_187">Section 357</a> or 357-A<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_188"> of the Code</a>. Even if a Class-II legal heir prefers

an appeal say against inadequate compensation, the appellate court in

the event of enhancement of compensation shall be obligated to disburse

the enhanced amount to those persons only who are entitled to the same

under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_189">Sections 357(1)(c)</a> or 357-A<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_190"> of the Code</a>, as the case may be. We,

therefore, hold that the expression "legal heir" within the meaning of

<a href="/doc/915147/" id="a_191">Section 2(wa)</a> of the Code does not exclude other than the Class-I legal

heirs of a deceased 'victim' nor the right to 'engage an advocate' or

prefer an appeal is restricted to those persons only to whom

compensation is payable under <a href="/doc/875650/" id="a_192">Sections 357</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_193">357-A</a> of the Code or under

the <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_194">Fatal Accidents Act</a>, 1855.
</p>
<p id="p_89">(68).        The above-stated interpretation saves the Court from

legislating and re-writing <a href="/doc/1837174/" id="a_195">Section 2(wa)</a> and is otherwise in conformity

with the pro-victim jurisprudence advanced by the Supreme Court in

PSR Sadhanantham; Ramakanth Rai; M/s JK International and

Puran etc. cases.

(69).         The multiplicity of appeals by more than one legal heir

</pre><p id="p_90">should hardly be a deterrent to hold otherwise as such like procedural

difficulties can be effectively streamlined by the Appellate Court

through an appropriate set of rules or instructions to its Registry. For

example, if the appeal is preferred by other than a Class-I legal heir,

such person can be required to disclose particulars of the Class-I legal

heir(s), if any, and hearing of such an appeal can be deferred till the

appellate court is satisfied that the Class-I legal heirs have not chosen

to prefer appeal despite informed knowledge of the order which can be

appealed against under proviso to <a href="/doc/1938563/" id="a_196">Section 372</a> of the Code. More than

one appeal, if preferred by different legal heirs, can also be not a cause

of concern nor a serious impediment as all such appeals can be clubbed

and decided together by passing one consolidated order.

(70).         It thus finally emerges that the Legislature, before and after

amendment<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_197"> of the Code</a> vide Act No.5 of 2009, has recognized and

conferred one right or the other on the following categories of persons:-

however, puts a caveat that no appeal under sub-Sections (1) &amp; (2) can

be presented to the High Court without its 'leave'. Sub-Section (4)

provides that if an order of acquittal is passed in a case instituted upon

the complaint, the 'complainant' can present an appeal to the High

Court against such acquittal only if the High Court grants 'special leave'

to appeal. The Legislature has thus prescribed different conditions for

the maintainability of appeal against order of acquittal passed in a

'police-case' vis-à-vis a 'complaint-case' i.e. a case instituted upon a

private complaint.      No appeal against acquittal in a complaint-case is

maintainable to the Court of Session and for an appeal to High Court,

the State or Central Government are required to obtain 'leave' of the

High Court as mandated by <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_206">Section 378(3)</a> and if such an appeal is

presented by the complainant, he/she is required to seek 'special leave'

of the High Court under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_207">Section 378(4)</a>.

who is invariably not rescued by the State machinery and whose

complaint is not even registered as FIR (in other than non-cognizable

offences), approaches the Judicial Magistrate under <a href="/doc/943588/" id="a_208">Section 200</a> of the

Code by way of a private complaint hence the intensity of his/her

'victimisation' is much more than that of the 'victim' of a police-case,

Section (4) of <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_210">Section 378</a> restricts the right to present appeal only

against an order of acquittal. It was also advanced that the Legislature

has drawn no distinction between the 'victim' of a police case or that of a

(73).        The High Courts are at variance in opining on the aforesaid

issue. Some have viewed that the 'victim' under <a href="/doc/1837174/" id="a_213">Section 2(wa)</a> is all

inclusive and covers victim in a complaint-case also. Reference in this

regard may be made to (i) a Single Bench decision of this Court in Mrs.

Leave to Appeal in Criminal Appeal No. 139 of 2011, Bhagwan

Singh v. State of Uttrakhand and another, in its order dated

13.12.2011 viewed that a case of acquittal in a complaint case for non-

cognizable and bailable offence falls in clause (b) of sub-Section (1) of

<a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_219">Section 378</a>, hence the victim (who was the complainant in a private

complaint) could file appeal under proviso to <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_220">Section 372</a> to the High

Court but with the leave to appeal by the High Court.

(74).                  There is yet a third stand of judicial opinion as well on the

issue. The Andhra Pradesh High Court in G.Baswaraj's case, has held

that the 'victim' in a complaint case has a right to avail his remedy

either under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_221">Section 372</a> or <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_222">Section 378(4)</a> and it is the prerogative of

such victim-cum-complainant as to which remedy he wants to avail.

That was a matter arising out of the appeal filed by the complainant in

a private complaint under the <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_223">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>, 1881.

(75).                  There are not one but more than a hundred Legislations1

other than the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_224">IPC</a> where the 'victim' and the 'complainant' are two

separate entities. The socio-economic Legislations such as (a) <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_225">Payment

<a href="/doc/62576675/" id="a_228">Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act</a>; (e) Employment of Manual

Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act etc. are a

few of the ones where the 'complainant' can only be a designated

'victimless' crimes, where the act which violates the law of the land does

constitute an 'offence' but there is no visible 'victim' of the crime though

such like crimes have depraving effects on the societal morals and

values. Such an offence includes situations where an individual acts

alone or there are consensual acts of more than one participants. This

is, however, not an issue raised before us and need not be further

alluded.

<p id="p_98">(77).        A part of the uncertainty, however, has been set at rest by

the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a recent decision in Subhash Chand vs.

State (Delhi) Administration, (2013) 2 SCC 17, where on an

interpretation of <a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_233">Section 378</a> of the Code, with special reference to its

sub-Section (1) (a) &amp; (b), it has been held that there is no distinction in a

complaint-case whether such complaint is filed by a 'private person' or a

'public servant' and an appeal against the acquittal in every single

complaint-case shall lie under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_234">Section 378(4)</a> after seeking 'special

leave' of the High Court and even if the acquittal order is passed by a

Magistrate in a complaint filed by a public servant or the State

Government, no appeal shall lie to the Court of Session under <a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_235">Section

378(1)(a)</a> of the Code. The question of status of such complainant as a

'victim' or his consequential right to prefer an appeal under proviso to

<a href="/doc/1938563/" id="a_236">Section 372</a> of the Code, however, was not the subject matter of

consideration in that case.

<p id="p_100">(78).        The expression "complainant" is not defined in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_237"> the Code</a>

though its <a href="/doc/1837174/" id="a_238">Section 2(d)</a> defines "complaint" to mean "any allegation

made orally or in writing to a Magistrate, with a view to his taking

action under this Code, that some person, whether known or unknown,

has committed an offence, but does not include a police report". A

person, other than the informant in a police-case, who makes the

allegation orally or in writing to the Magistrate is a 'complainant'

within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_239">Section 378(4)</a> of the Code. The words "victim"

and "complainant" have been thus used and construed in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_240"> the Code</a>

differently and distinctly. Also a 'victim' can be the 'complainant' but it

may not be necessarily that every 'complainant' is a 'victim'.

(79).        <a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_241">Section 378(4)</a> of the Code enables a complainant to prefer

</pre><p id="p_101">appeal against acquittal of the accused provided that the High Court

grants 'special leave' to such appeal.    The Legislature has imposed

stringent condition on the maintainability of appeal against an order of

acquittal in a complaint-case, for the acquittal by the trial court

reinforces the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused who

has earned acquittal in a case where the complainant himself/herself

was the prosecutor unlike the 'victim' in a police-case who does not have

any say in the trial. Such being the legislative intentment, there cannot

be any scope to doubt that the 'complainant' of <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_242">Section 378(4)</a> who has

failed to establish the complicity can assail such acquittal only with the

'special leave' of the High Court under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_243">Section 378(4)</a> only. The fact that

the Legislature has brought no changes in this sub-Section fortifies its

policy to retain the same legal position as it existed before the

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_244">Amendment Act</a>, 2008.

bringing the guilt home against the accused and establishes his/her

'victimisation' but is aggrieved at the conviction for a lesser offence or

imposition of inadequate compensation, he/she shall be entitled to

invoke the proviso to <a href="/doc/1938563/" id="a_245">Section 372</a> of the Code. We say so for the reason

that in such a case the accused no longer enjoys the protection of

presumed innocence. The proven 'victim' also has no other remedy to

assail the conviction for a lesser offence or imposition of inadequate

compensation except the proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_246">Section 372</a>. Any different

construction would discriminately leave his/her wrong without a

remedy.       The       victims   at   post-conviction   stage   constitute   one

homogenous class and deserve to be treated alike.            In such like cases

decided by a Magistrate, even the accused has remedy to file appeal to

the Sessions court under <a href="/doc/1459475/" id="a_247">Section 374(3)</a> of the Code.

(81).        It may be noted here that<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_248"> the Code</a> postulates different

procedures for conducting Magisterial or Sessions trials in complaint-

cases.    In a Magisterial trial, it is the complainant who follows the

accusatorial procedure without getting any assistance from the Public

Prosecutor. However, if the complaint pertains to an offence triable

exclusively by the Court of Session, after such complaint-case is

committed by the Magistrate to the Court of Session under <a href="/doc/323386/" id="a_249">Section 209</a>

of the Code, the Public Prosecutor shall open the case and conduct the

trial as provided by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_250">Sections 225</a> and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_251">226</a>. The procedural advantage

available to a complainant in the complaint-case triable by the Court of

Session, is also inconsequential to take a view different from what has

been held above, for in such like cases also the Public Prosecutor will

have to bank upon the same set of evidence which the complainant had

produced at his own before the Magistrate at the pre-committal stage.

(82).        What will happen if the 'victim' in a complaint-case is

different from the 'complainant' or where such 'victim' cannot otherwise

be a 'complainant' due to statutory embargo against the filing of the

complaint by some one other than the designated authority of State?

Would he/she be entitled to file an appeal under proviso to Section 372

or should he/she be clubbed together with the complainant under

<a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_252">Section 378(4)</a> of the Code?      We are of the view that the 'victim' in

complaint-cases cannot have a remedy superior to that of the

complainant of such case and since the Apex Court in the latest decision

in Subhash Chand's case (supra) has held that the complainant's

remedy, whether he is a private person or a public servant, to question

the acquittal lies only in <a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_253">Section 378(4)</a> of the Code, hence the 'victim'

will also have to be relegated to that conditional remedy only.

Similarly, where a 'victim' is competent to institute a private complaint

but permits or consents expressly or implicitly to the filing of such

complaint by his family-members, near and dears or an acquaintance,

the 'victim' and 'complainant' in such a case cannot be seen differently

and would be inseparable, hence the 'victim' will also fall back on

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_254">Section 378(4)</a> only which specifically refers to filing of appeals against

acquittal at the instance of complainant and not under proviso to

<a href="/doc/1938563/" id="a_255">Section 372</a> of the Code which has been pre-dominantly incorporated to

provide right to appeal to the 'victims' in police-case who are not

permitted to participate or have any say during trial.

<p id="p_105">(84).        The answer to this question entirely depends upon the

understanding of the two ancillary questions, namely, (i) whether the

right of a 'victim' is subordinate or inferior to that of the State? (ii)

whether the fetters imposed on the right to appeal against acquittal on

the State under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_267">Section 378(3)</a> or on a complaint under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_268">Section 378(4)</a>

also operate on the right of appeal given to a 'victim'?

(85).        There are as many as three stands of judicial opinion with

reference to the first ancillary question. The first category comprises

those cases where the Courts have held that the State is superior to the

'victim' and if the State files an appeal challenging the acquittal, the

appeal of the 'victim' will not be entertained. This view was taken by a

Division Bench of Gujarat High Court in (i) <a href="/doc/1286882/" id="a_269">Bhikhabhai Motibhai

Bhai Makwana vs. State of Gujarat and 9 others Criminal

Appeals No. 238 of 2012 and 608 of 2012, another Division Bench of

Gujarat High Court referred the matter to the larger Bench for the

purpose of deciding (i) whether the appeal filed by the victim under the

proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_270">Section 372</a> of the Code, challenging acquittal, or conviction

for lesser offence, or awarding inadequate compensation, is not

maintainable on the ground that the State has filed an appeal against

the same order and for the same purpose? (ii) whether an appeal filed

by the State be not entertained on the ground that the appeal preferred

by the victim invoking his right under proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_271">Section 372</a> of Code, is

the High Court, challenging the acquittal, should he first seek leave of

the Court, as is required in case of appeal being preferred by the State?

Overruling both the earlier divergent views of the Division Benches, the

Full Bench of Gujarat High Court held that the appeals in both the

cases are maintainable. The Full Bench also disagreed with the view

taken by this Court in Smt. Ram Kaur's case; the Patna High Court in

</blockquote><p id="p_107">(87).        The reason that found favour with the Gujarat High Court

to take the afore-quoted view is that if the 'victim' is excluded from the

purview of proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_273">Section 372</a>, he would have no remedy to challenge

inadequate compensation though the award of compensation is one of

the vital means for redressing the grievances of a 'victim' as ruled by

the Apex Court in (i) <a href="/doc/46112/" id="a_274">Manish Jalan vs. State of Karnataka</a>, (2008) 8

SCC 225; (ii) <a href="/doc/635335/" id="a_275">R.Vijayan vs. Baby &amp; Anr</a>., (2012) 1 SCC 260; and (iii)

<a href="/doc/14570141/" id="a_276">Roy Fernandes vs. State of Goa &amp; Ors</a>., AIR 2012 SC 1030.

(88).        The second view, in total contrast to the first one, is of

Allahabad High Court in Ajay Misra vs. Rajiv Gupta &amp; Ors.

Crl.Misc.Case No.32 of 2011 decided on 23.03.2011, holding that the

right of appeal given to a 'victim' is more comprehensive and superior to

the right of the State.     The third view is that of the Full Bench of

Gujarat High Court in Bhavuben Dineshbhai Makwana's case

(supra) laying down that the rights of the 'victim' and the State operate

in different spheres and neither ousts the other, therefore, filing of

appeal by the one will not rob the other of its right to appeal.

(89).        Right to challenge a conviction or acquittal or any other

sentence or order, emanates only from a Statute. The scheme<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_277"> of the

Code</a> after various amendments, confers right of appeal only on four

categories of persons; (i) accused; (ii) State; (iii) victim; and (iv)

complainant in complaint cases, and none else. In tune with what has

been discussed above, the correct interpretation, in our opinion, would

be that a 'victim' who happens to be the 'complainant' in the police- case,

if files appeal against acquittal is not required to take 'leave' under

<a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_278">Section 378</a> of the Code. To this extent we are, therefore, unable to

agree, with reverence, to the view taken by the Full Bench of Gujarat

High Court and hold that the 'victim' (including a complainant in a

police case) is not required to apply for or obtain any leave under

<a href="/doc/1856707/" id="a_279">Section 378(4)</a> of the Code nor such a 'victim' is required to seek leave in

cases where appeal is against inadequacy of compensation and

punishment for lesser offence.
</p>
<p id="p_109">(90).        It hardly calls for a debate that the varied rights given to the

State, the victim or a complainant under Chapter XXIX of the Code are

not inter se dependent and each right operates within its own sphere.

For example, the State has got a right to appeal on the ground of

inadequacy of       sentence [<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_280">Section 377</a>]      but   a victim      (including

complainant who is also a victim in police case) has got no such right

though he/she can prefer appeal if the accused is convicted for a lesser

offence. State has no right to appeal against conviction of an accused

for a lesser offence. The legislative scheme thus does not permit an

inter se comparison of the rights or duties granted or assigned to a

'victim' or the State under the afore-stated Chapter of the Code.

(91).        Having held that the right(s) of the 'victim' under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_281"> the Code</a>

including the one translated through proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_282">Section 372</a>, are

incomparable with and are distinct from those of the State, the second

ancillary question, namely, whether the fetters imposed on the right to

appeal against acquittal on the State will also operate on the right to

appeal given to a 'victim', also stands answered in part. Since the right

of a 'victim' to prefer appeal under proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_283">Section 372</a> is independent

of and is not contingent upon or subject to the right to appeal of the

State under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_284">Section 378(1)</a> to (3)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_285"> of the Code</a>, the condition of seeking

'leave' of the High Court expressly imposed on the State under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_286">Section

378(3)</a> cannot be read into proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_287">Section 372</a> where the Legislature

consciously did not incorporate such a fetter.
</p>
<p id="p_111">(92).        The Court shall always presume that while amending or

bringing a new enactment, the Legislature was fully aware of the

provisions of the existing Statute.      The Parliament had thus full

knowledge of the fetters imposed by it on the presentation of appeals by

the State or a complaint through <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_288">Section 378(3)</a> &amp; (4)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_289"> of the Code</a>, yet it

gave the right to appeal to a 'victim' free from any obstacle under

proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_290">Section 372</a> of the Code. The legislative policy to grant

unconditional right to appeal to a 'victim' is thus writ large. It would

indeed not only amount to re-writing the proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_291">Section 372</a> but

would also defeat the legislative will if the restrictions expressly

embedded in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_292">Section 378(3)</a> &amp; (4) are impliedly planted into proviso to

<a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_293">Section 372</a> of the Code also. Since leave to appeal under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_294">Section 378(3)</a>

is confined only to such appeals which are presented by the State or

Central Governments under sub-Section (1)(b) or sub-Section (2)(b) of

<a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_295">Section 378</a> of the Code, with due regard at our command, we are

unable to agree with the view taken by the Division Bench of this Court

in Smt. Ram Kaur's case (supra) that a 'victim' shall be required to

seek leave/special leave to appeal while exercising his/her right to

appeal under proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_296">Section 372</a> of the Code and overrule the same

to that extent. On the same analogy, we express our inability to agree

with the view taken by the Patna High Court in Guru Prasad Yadav's

case (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_113">(93).        The cumulative effect of the above discussion is that the

right(s) of a 'victim' under the amended Code are substantive and not

mere brutam fulmen hence these are not accessory or auxiliary to those

of the State and are totally incomparable as both the sets of rights or

duties operate in different and their respective fields. We thus hold

that a 'victim' is not obligated to seek 'leave' or 'special leave' of the

High Court for presentation of Appeal under proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_297">Section 372</a> of

the Code.

(D) Whether presentation of appeal against acquittal
    is a 'right' or an 'obligation' of the 'State'
    stemming from the Constitution?
</p>
<p id="p_116">(94).        The evolution of right to appeal against acquittal discussed

in extenso in the earlier part of this order unveils that the right to

appeal against acquittal has seen roller-coaster like changes ranging

from the 'no right to appeal' [1861] to 'the unconditional right to appeal'

[1898] followed by a 'conditional right to appeal' [1973 Code] and again

'unconditional right to appeal' in some of the cases to be filed in the

Court of Session [2005] in favour of the State. While the complainant in

a case instituted on complaint got a conditional right to appeal against

acquittal under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_298">Section 378(4)</a> [1973], a 'victim' as defined or explained

by us has also now got unconditional right to appeal [2009].

(95).        Right to live with human dignity without any fear or actual

subjection to any kind of unlawful, unsocial and physical or mental

abuse and be a member of the self-regulated civic society too is one of

the most cherised fundamental right bestowed on every person under

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_299">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The protection or conferment of certain

rights on a victim under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_300"> the Code</a> therefore cannot be mirrored as a

favour shown to him/her by the Legislature. These are only a minuscule

part of the fundamental rights of vast magnitude guaranteed under the

Constitution. The State as a custodian of the power for enforcement of

the rule of law owes a corresponding duty to protect these Fundamental

Rights.   The State also performs the duty of parens patriae besides

making an endeavour to fulfill the promises contained in Articles 38 or

39-A of the Constitution. The right to prosecute a wrong-doer, to bring

his guilt home and to compel such guilty person to undergo the awarded

sentence is an essential part of the State's enormous duties.            The

presentation of appeal against an unmerited and reckless acquittal is

also an integral duty of a welfare State, who "has an overall control over

the law and order and public order of the area under its jurisdiction",

even if such a duty has been assigned by the Legislature as a 'right' in

the literal sense. <a href="/doc/1515604/" id="a_301">State of Rajasthan vs. Sohan Lal &amp; Ors</a>., (2004) 5

SCC 573, lends full support to us in this regard when it holds that "The

State does not in pursuing or conducting a criminal case or an appeal,

espouse any right of its own but really vindicates the cause of society at

large, to prevent recurrence as well as punish offences and offenders

respectively, in order to preserve orderliness in society and avert anarchy,

by upholding the rule of law".
</p>
<p id="p_118">(96).        In an era of enlightened and well-informed society who

justifiably demands its rights or frowns upon the belied promises, it will

be too farfetched to say that the 'duty' of the State under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_302">Sections 377</a> or

378 is actually a 'right' exercisable at the discretion of State Executive.

The fact that the Legislature has chosen to grant unconditional right to

appeal to a 'victim' as compared to the conditional right given to a State

under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_303">Section 378(3)</a> implies towards the failure of the State machinery

in preserving the fair balance upto the expectations of the people. The

State therefore no longer enjoys any privileged status as an 'appellant'

provide a uniform appellate forum to a 'victim' when he/she prefers an

appeal under proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_306">Section 372</a>, and the State also prefers its

appeal against the same order under <a href="/doc/1796168/" id="a_307">Section 378(1)(b)</a> of the Code?

Under proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_308">Section 372</a>, the victim's appeal shall lie to the Court

to which an appeal lies against the order of conviction of such Court. To

say it differently, the victim shall present the appeal in the same Court

where the appeal of the accused, had he been convicted, would have

been maintainable.      Now, if the order of acquittal is passed by the

Magistrate in respect of a cognizable but bailable offence, the victim's

appeal shall lie to the Court of Session before whom the accused, if

convicted, can prefer his appeal under <a href="/doc/1075777/" id="a_309">Section 374(3)</a> of the Code.

(98).        If we turn to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_310">Section 378(1)(a)</a>, it provides that the District

Magistrate may ask the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the

Court of Session from an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in

respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence.            Clause (b) of

<a href="/doc/1796168/" id="a_311">Section 378(1)</a> of the Code enables the State Government to direct the

Public   Prosecutor to present an appeal to the High Court from an

original or appellate order of acquittal passed by any Court other than

the High Court [not being an order under Clause (a)]. There is thus

no ambiguity that if an order of acquittal is passed by a Magistrate in

respect of a cognizable but bailable offence and the State decides to

challenge it, the State's appeal shall lie to the High Court only but if the

'victim' prefers appeal against the same order, it shall lie to the Court of

Session.

<p id="p_123">(99).        Similarly, the scheme<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_312"> of the Code</a> nowhere discerns that the

Legislature    ever     intended   to   create   two   parallel   streams   for

adjudication of appeal(s) against the same order. Contrary to it, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_313">Section

372</a> lays emphasis that no appeal shall lie from any judgement or order

except as provided for by this Code. That apart, the literal

interpretation of proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_314">Section 372</a> or <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_315">Section 378(1)(a)</a>&amp;(b)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_316"> of the

Code</a> leads to a piquant, anomalous and absurd situation of utter

confusion where the Court of Session would have no choice but to await

the outcome of the appeal preferred by the State before the High Court

and then perform its bounden duty to follow that decision of the

superior Court to negate, for all intents and purposes, the right to

appeal of a 'victim' contrary to the legislative object behind insertion of

the proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_317">Section 372</a> of the Code.

(101).       Let us now analyse the second part of the proviso added to

</pre><p id="p_125"><a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_318">Section 372</a>. It says that "the victim shall have a right to prefer an

appeal.......and such an appeal shall lie to the Court to which an

appeal ordinarily lies against the order of conviction of such

Court". The adverbial expression "ordinarily" is suffixed to the Court

where convict's appeal shall lie. The marginal discretion or exception of

Forum carved out by the Legislature pertains to the appeal preferable

by an accused against his conviction and not of the 'victim' which 'shall'

lie to the same Court where the appeal against the order of conviction

of such Court is maintainable. To say it differently, if there is no change
 CRM-790-MA-2010 final                                         - 62 -
</p>
<p id="p_126">

in the appellate forum for the presentation of appeal by a convict, the

victim's appeal shall not lie to any other Court except that Court.

(102).       Caught in the web of apparent conflict, the Uttrakhand High

Court in Bhagwan Singh's case (supra), drew force from the word

'ordinarily' mentioned in proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_319">Section 372</a> and made an attempt to

reconcile the provisions, holding that the appeal of the 'victim' in the

cases at Sr.No.3 of the table given in para 100 of this order, should also

lie in the High Court and not in the Sessions Court. The expression

"ordinarily" has been construed to mean that the appellate forum made

available to a 'victim' under proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_320">Section 372</a> is not mandatory in

character and can be changed in exceptional or special circumstances.

The said construction assumes as if the proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_321">Section 372</a> says that

"the victim shall have a right to prefer an appeal........and such appeal

shall ordinarily lie to the Court to which an appeal lies against the

order of conviction of such Court".        The proviso, however, says

otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_127">(103).       The afore-stated shift in the venue of appeal to be preferred

by a 'victim' from the Court of Session to the High Court, otherwise runs

parallel to the legislative scheme inhering <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_322">Section 378(1)(a)</a>, namely, to

provide easier, less cumbersome and less time-consuming process of

presenting appeal against the unmerited and reckless acquittals by

Magistrates. In fact, the suggested recourse would substantially nullify

the effect of the amendment made in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_323">Section 378</a> by Act No.25 of 2005
 CRM-790-MA-2010 final                                          - 63 -
</p>
<p id="p_128">

and will re-introduce the unamended provision whereunder all appeals

against acquittal used to be maintainable before the High Court only.

(104).       Similarly, the victim will be severely prejudiced and

tribulated (the accused as well) if his appeal in respect of a 'cognizable'

and 'bailable' offence is ordered to lie in the High Court only. Even if

the victim is excepted from the rigors of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_324">Section 378</a> (3) or (4), the high

cost of litigation in the High Court will dissuade him from appealing.

The victim would always be uncertain and at the cross-roads in

choosing the forum of appeal which shall depend on the decision of the

State to prefer or not its appeal. The very presentation of their

respective appeals by the 'victim' and the State before different forums

would lead to indecisiveness and adhocism.
</p>
<p id="p_129">(105).       The 'draftsman' has inconversantly slipped up while drafting

the proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_325">Section 372</a>, when he overlooked <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_326">Section 378(1)</a> as

amended by Act No.25 of 2005. Resultantly, the laudable legislative

policy behind enabling the District Magistrate to present an appeal to

the Sessions Court so as to avoid time taxing procedure of seeking

State's sanction for filing an appeal has been put on hold.

(106).       The only effective modicum to meet with the situation as we

perceive can be to interpret and construe <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_327">Section 378(1)(a)</a> in such a

manner that the State's appeal(s) in respect of all the cognizable

offences (whether bailable or non-bailable) are presented to the Court of

Session, for such a recourse is the least harmful, non-prejudicial and

substantively conforms to the legislative vision underlying the

<p id="p_131">(107).       The Supreme Court in a catena of decisions has ruled that

the intention of the Legislature is generally gathered from the language

used and the words chosen by it to express its intentment.

Conventionally, the Court would not add or mend the language of the

Statute or read words into it by substituting some other words or

otherwise. Similarly, the Court should endeavour to give meaning to

each and every word used by the Legislature as neither the words in a

Statute can be brushed aside being surplusage nor they be construed to

render a part of the Statute blank. Rather, the Courts always believe

that the legislature has inserted every part of the Statute for a purpose

and words are not there for mere fustian eloquence. Any construction
 CRM-790-MA-2010 final                                                                              - 65 -

which renders a word or a provision of a Statute redundant needs to be

avoided unless there are compelling reasons.2

(108).            The propounders of the rule of literal interpretation always

insist that the words of a Statute should first be understood in their

natural, ordinary or popular sense and the phrases and sentences be

construed according to their unambiguous literal meaning unless such a

recourse leads to some absurdity or where the object of the Statute

suggests to the contrary. The strict literal expression of the words has

thus been taken as the safest key to open up the true intentment of a

Statute.3

(109).            In those cases where the language used in a Statute is

capable of bearing more than one construction, the Court in its attempt

to find out the true meaning shall have due regard to the consequences

of alternative constructions so as to avoid the resultant hardship,

serious inconvenience, injustice, absurdity, inconsistency or a 'straight

clash' between two Sections of the same Act. In Venkataramana

Devaru vs. State of Mysore, AIR 1958 SC 255, the Supreme Court

held that "the rule of construction is well-settled that when there are in

an enactment two provisions which cannot be re-conciled with each

other, they should be so interpreted that, if possible, effect should be

to a 'useless', 'lumber' or 'dead-letter' is not a harmonious construction

as 'to harmonise is not to destroy'. [Ref. (i) JK Cotton Spinning &amp;

Weaving Mills Co.Ltd. vs. State of UP &amp; Ors., (1986) 4 SCC 90

is that when a choice has to be made out of the two given constructions,

both of which require reading of some additional words, the Court will

naturally prefer the one which is more in consonance with reason or

justice. [Ref. <a href="/doc/1177057/" id="a_335">Ramaswamy Nadar vs. State of Madras</a>, AIR 1958 SC

<p id="p_139">(112).       The Heydon's rule known as the 'Mischief Rule' or the Rule

of 'Purposive Construction' also serves as a master-key to remove the

ordeal caused by the material words in a Statute which congenitally
 CRM-790-MA-2010 final                                                                                 - 67 -

possess two or more constructions. This rule lays down four guiding

principles namely, (i) what was the law before the making of the Act?

</p><p id="p_141">(ii) what was the mischief or defect for which the law did not provide?

</p><p id="p_142">(iii) what is the remedy that the Act has provided? and (iv) what is the

reason behind the remedy? The Heydon's rule says that after following

these principles, the Courts must adopt that construction which shall

'suppress the mischief and advance the remedy'. The quoted rule has

been approved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and consistently followed

by the Indian Courts.4

(113).               The Court would invariably be reluctant to create casus

omissus where there is none, nor shall insert a desired provision in an

enactment as it will amount to legislating and not construing the

Statute.           However, where a vacuum caused in a Statute due to the

omission by its draftsman forestalls the Court to construe it consistent

with its legislative policy, it becomes the bounden duty of the Court to

fill in such gap and secure the object of the Statute. Gladstone vs.

Bower (1960) 3 All.ER 353 (CA) very aptly explains that "the Court

will always allow the intention of the Statute to override the defects of

wording but the Court's ability to do so is limited by recognized canons of

interpretation...".

the interests of a 'victim' and those of the State, it appears more

appropriate, just, fair and proper not to compel the 'victim' to go to High

Court instead the State can be detoured to present its appeal to the

Sessions Court even against an order of acquittal passed by a

distinct forum of appeals against acquittal passed by the Magistrate in

relation to cognizable offences. The recourse so suggested is the most

viable substitute which neither jeopardizes the rights of the parties nor

dilutes the legislative intention.   It also does not traverse through

unknown jurisprudential principles as the interpretative power of the

Court to notice the omission of a draftsman vis-à-vis the Legislature's

intention and to abridge that distance is well recognized.        There is

presumed prospective in operation unless the Legislature expressly or

by necessary implication gives retrospective effect to it.      No such

inference can possibly be drawn, even remotely, in the instant case.

Otherwise also, it is one of the cardinal principles of statutory

interpretation that a Statute dealing with substantive rights shall be

prospective unless there are words in the Statute sufficient to show the

intention of the Legislature to affect existing rights. Osborn's Concise

Law Dictionary says that "a new law ought to regulate what is to follow,

not the past". These principles have been laid down and reiterated in a

string of decisions including in (i) <a href="/doc/656658/" id="a_383">Keshavan Madhava Menon vs.

</p>
<p id="p_165">(125).       These very principles apply in the case of an amendment in

a Statute. If the amendment intends to create a substantive right or if

it affects the vested right, it shall ordinarily be prospective in nature

though an amendment in the procedural law like relating to form and

limitation can be applied retrospectively. These principles have been

<p id="p_167">(126).       Since right to appeal is a substantive right and it cannot be

inferred by implication unless the Statute expressly provides so, the

only inescapable conclusion would be to hold that the right to appeal

given to a 'victim' under proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_388">Section 372</a> of the Code is prospective

and has become enforceable w.e.f. December 31, 2009 only. A 'victim' is

proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_389">Section 372</a> if such order has been passed on or after

date of occurrence etc. To be more specific, it is clarified that it is the

date of passing of the order to be appealed from and not any other fact

situation, which shall determine the right to appeal of a 'victim'. As a

corollary thereto, it is held that the remedy availed by a 'victim'

including revision petition against acquittal of the accused by an order

passed before December 31, 2009, cannot be converted into an appeal

under proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_390">Section 372</a> and it shall have to be dealt with in

(127).       Various    High   Courts   have   experienced     difficulty   in

</pre><p id="p_169">determining the period of limitation for an appeal preferable by a victim

under proviso to <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_392">Section 372</a> of the Code. A Division Bench of Patna

High Court in <a href="/doc/89813643/" id="a_393">Raghunath Yadav vs. State of Bihar</a>, 2011 (6) RCR

(Crl.) 133, has viewed that since the period of limitation for filing an

appeal against the acquittal under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_394">Section 378</a> is ninety days and no

period of limitation has been provided for filing an appeal under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_395">Section

372</a> by a 'victim', the same period of limitation as provided under <a href="/doc/1004075/" id="a_396">Article

<a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_398">Section 372</a> of the Code also. The Full Bench of Gujarat High Court in

Bhavuben Dineshbhai Makwana's case (supra) too, with reference to

<a href="/doc/1004075/" id="a_399">Article 114(a)</a> of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_400">Limitation Act</a>, has held that the period of ninety

days should be the reasonable period for a 'victim' to file an appeal as

the said period is the longest period of limitation for filing an appeal

against an order of acquittal prescribed by the Legislature.

(128).       The Delhi High Court in Kareemul Hajazi's case (supra),

however, thought differently and after referring to certain precedents

laying down that 'in the absence of prescription of the limitation period,

the statutory authority must exercise its jurisdiction within a

reasonable period', it decided to bring the 'victim' at par with the

'accused' for the purpose of period of limitation to prefer appeal and held

that since an accused is required to prefer appeal to the High Court

within sixty days as prescribed under <a href="/doc/1903086/" id="a_401">Section 374</a> of the Code read with

(129).       One        of   the   well-recognized    principles    of   criminal

jurisprudence is that 'crime never dies'. The maxim 'nullum tempus qut

locus occurrit regi' [lapse of time is no bar to Crown in proceedings

against offenders] is an age-old rule embedded in criminal justice

delivery system. The public policy behind this rule is that a criminal

offence is considered as a wrong committed against the State and the

Society though it is committed against an individual. The aforesaid rule

of prudence has been duly acknowledged by the Parliament as it has

prescribed no period of limitation for filing an appeal under proviso to

<a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_404">Section 372</a> of the Code against an order of acquittal.

limitation to apply for grant of special leave to appeal to the High Court

against the order of acquittal passed in a complaint-case. The appeal

against acquittal in such cases can be filed within 30 days of the date of

grant of special leave to appeal as provided under Clause (b) of <a href="/doc/1004075/" id="a_415">Article

114</a> of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_416">Limitation Act</a>. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dharam

Pal's case compared the provisions of old Code with <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_417">Section 378</a> of the

new Code and held that appeals against acquittal preferred by the State

Government or the Central Government continue to be governed by

<a href="/doc/1004075/" id="a_418">Article 114(a)</a> of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_419">Limitation Act</a>. In other words, those appeals must

be filed within 90 days from the date of order appealed from. A 'victim'

therefore is also entitled to the said maximum period of limitation i.e.

90 days to prefer his/her appeal against an order of acquittal.

(133).       Under <a href="/doc/368265/" id="a_420">Section 378(5)</a> of the Code, an application for the

grant of special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal moved by the

complainant who is a public servant, can be entertained by the High

Court within a period of six months and within sixty days in every other

case, from the date of the order of acquittal. However, the State or

Central Governments are not entitled to take benefit of six months'

period given to the complainant-public servant for the purpose of their

appeal against an order of acquittal which is required to be preferred

within ninety days as per <a href="/doc/1004075/" id="a_421">Article 114</a> of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_422">Limitation Act</a>. The grey

(135).       The legislature has not chosen to provide different period(s)

</pre><p id="p_179">of limitation for the purpose of appeals maintainable at the instance of a

'victim' under proviso to <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_428">Section 372</a>. It has also not carried out any

corresponding amendment in the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_429">Limitation Act</a>. Since

<a href="/doc/1464822/" id="a_430">Article 115(b)</a> thereof does not draw any distinction between the appeals

preferable by the State, the 'victim' or the accused, the period of

limitation for an appeal preferred by the State, the 'victim' against an

order other than that of acquittal or by the accused, shall therefore be

governed by <a href="/doc/1464822/" id="a_431">Article 115(b)</a> of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_432">Limitation Act</a>.

(136).       The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1432851/" id="a_433">Japani Sahoo vs. Chander

Shekhar Mohanty</a>, (2007) 7 SCC 374, observed that mere delay in

approaching the court of law would not by itself afford a ground for

dismissing the case though it may be a relevant circumstance in

reaching the final verdict. There is no gainsaying that where no period

of limitation is expressly provided to prefer an appeal, the aggrieved

person is expected to approach the appellate court within a reasonable

period. The 'reasonableness' of the period within which an appeal may

be preferred, however, is purely a question of fact and will have to be

determined keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of each

case.
</p>
<p id="p_181">(137).       The Legislative intentment behind Articles 114 &amp; 115(b) of

the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_434">Limitation Act</a> in prescribing the period of limitation for appeals to

the High Court or to the Court of Session against different type of

orders, is the best guiding factor to determine reasonableness of the

period of limitation for an appeal preferable at the instance of a 'victim'

also. It would, therefore, be reasonable to view that for appeal against

acquittal filed by a 'victim' to the High Court the period of limitation

would be 90 days and where such appeal lies to the Sessions Court such

period shall be 60 days. For appeal against any other order, the

reasonable period would be 60 days to the High Court and 30 days for

appeals to the Sessions Court from the orders passed by the Magistrate,

as the case may be. To be more specific, the period of limitation for the

purpose of filing appeal(s) by a victim shall be as under:-

</p><pre id="pre_18">(a)     In case of acquittal -
             (i)   Where appeal    90 days   Date of order

(138).       The limitation period of ninety, sixty and thirty days, as the

</pre><p id="p_182">case may be, prescribed above for the maintainability of an appeal by a

victim, in our considered view, ought to be counted from the date such

'victim' acquires knowledge of the order appealable under proviso to

<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_435">Section 372</a>. We say so for the reason that in most of the State cases,

the 'victim' has no participatory role at the trial stage and the

possibility of his/her remaining in the dark about the adverse order

cannot be lightly brushed aside. The above rule of limitation, therefore,

cannot be mechanically enforced even if the victim had no informed

knowledge regarding culmination of the trial proceedings as it might

cause serious prejudice to his/her rights, close to the extent of snatching

away the right to appeal earned by the victims after a long drawn

battle.
