<p id="p_1">                            The writ petition has been filed seeking a direction to the

                      respondents to restore electricity service connection with lesser capacity of

                      8 KW (1HP) to the petitioner's premises viz. No.A1, North Main Road,

                      Chidambaram-608 001 for the purpose of office use, tyre show room and for

                      operating compressor alone within the time stipulated by this Court.




</p><p id="p_2">                            2.Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the

                      petitioner Unit had obtained licence under the Tamil Nadu Factories Act and

                      the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has issued consent to operate under

                      the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981 and Water (Prevention

                      and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974 to the petitioner unit and thereafter, the

                      same was being periodically renewed. The petitioner unit has also obtained

                      fire licence issued by the Fire Department and the Chidambaram

                      Municipality has also issued D&amp;O Trade Licence after due inspection by the

                      officials of the Municipality. According to the learned counsel appearing for

                      the petitioner, even though the petitioner unit was functioning in the said

                      premises for more than 25 years, the concerned authority has refused to

                      grant renewal on the ground that as per G.O. Ms. No.1703 dated

                      24.07.1974, the petitioner's retreading unit cannot be permitted to run at

                      mixed residential zone. As the said action of refusing to renew the

                      petitioner's licence is totally untenable in law, the petitioner has filed Writ

                      Petition No.37147 of 2016 before this Court. In the meantime, the persons

                      having enmity against the petitioner unit had approached the National

                      Green Tribunal Southern Zone by filing O.A. No.211 of 2016 seeking an order

                      to close the petitioner's unit. Although the petitioner Unit filed a counter

                      affidavit refuting the false and untenable claims made against the

                      petitioner, a direction was issued to close the industry. Pursuant to the said

                      order, the respondents had disconnected the electricity service connection.

                      As the petitioner industrial unit could not run with 8 KW service connection,

                      the petitioner made an application dated 22.04.2017 to the respondents

                      seeking restoration of electricity service connection. Since the same has not

                      been considered, the petitioner is before this Court with the above prayer.




</p><p id="p_3">                            3.Learned Standing counsel appearing for the respondents would

                      submit that if the prayer of the petitioner is reasonable as per law, the

                      same will be considered on merits.
