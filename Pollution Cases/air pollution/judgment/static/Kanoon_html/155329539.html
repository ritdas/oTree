     THESE PETITIONS COMING ON FOR FURTHER
HEARING THIS DAY, THE COURT, MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                          ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Since common questions of law and facts involved in

all the above petitions, all these petitions were taken

together to dispose of them by this common order in order

to avoid repetition of discussion.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2.    These are the petitions filed by the petitioners

respective accused under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C. with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               :7:</span>



the prayer to allow the criminal petition and quash the

entire        proceedings   initiated   against    the   respective

petitioners        in   C.C.No.504/2013,          C.C.No.506/2013,

C.C.No.508/2013, C.C.No.505/2013, C.C.No.510/2013 and

C.C.No.507/2013 pending before the Court of Civil Judge

and J.M.F.C., Haveri.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">         3.      Brief facts as averred by the petitioners in the

petitions that petitioners established their industrial plant

and producing graded stone aggregate. In the said process

of production, the petitioners use jaw crushers, conveyer

belts and vibrators, and in that process cause air pollutants

to be emitted causing air pollution. It is alleged that

petitioners are causing air pollution, which comes within

the purview of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Act</a>. Hence, petitioners obtained the

consent operation as required under provisions of <a href="/doc/840666/" id="a_3">Section

2</a> of the Air Act. The said consent for operation expired on

30.06.2012. Hence, the petitioners are operating the

industrial plant in violation of provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>. The

further averment that the petitioners filed W.P.Nos.49340-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                          :8:</span>



49352/2012 (GM-MMS) before the High Court of Karnataka

Bengaluru   against    the   closure   order   wherein   the

complainant/board was also arrayed as respondent. The

Hon'ble Court was pleased to pass final order dated 10th

day of December, 2012 wherein the respondent was

directed to permit the petitioners to continue the operation

up to 23.12.2012 or till such time the application is

considered and dispose of by the licensing authority. The

further averments that complainant/respondent visited the

industrial plant of the petitioners on 13.12.2012 and

submitted the report that the said industrial plants are

operating and he seeks authorization to prosecute the

petitioners for operating the industrial plant after the

closure order. Accordingly, filed the private complaint in

P.C.No.181/2013,      P.C.No.122/2013,    P.C.No.179/2013,

P.C.No.182/2013, P.C.No.178/2013 and P.C.No.180/2013

under <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_5">Section 200</a> of the Cr.P.C. and alleged offences

under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_6">Section 21</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">31A</a> punishable under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_8">Section 37</a> of

the Air (Prevention of Control) Act before the Civil Judge

and J.M.F.C. at Haveri. The trial court by its order dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             :9:</span>



06.07.2013 has taken cognizance in the said private

complaint     by    registering     the    C.C.No.504/2013,

C.C.No.506/2013,        C.C.No.508/2013,   C.C.No.505/2013,

C.C.No.510/2013 and C.C.No.507/2013 for the offences

alleged to have been committed under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_9">Section 21</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">31A</a>

punishable under <a href="/doc/1296808/" id="a_11">Section 37</a> of the          Air   Act. Being

aggrieved by the order passed by the JMFC Court

registering the case and initiating the criminal proceedings

against the above petitioners, the petitioners approached

this Court by filing the above petitions and they have

challenged the legality and correctness of the order of the

said JMFC Court on the grounds as mentioned in the

respective petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      4.     Heard the arguments of the learned counsel

appearing for the petitioners/accused in respect of all the

petitioners so also the arguments of the learned counsel

appearing for the respondent/complainant in respect of all

petitions.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                          : 10 :</span><p id="p_8">



</p><p id="p_9">     5.      Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners

during the course of argument made the submission that

the Pollution Control Board passed the order dated

05.09.2012 directing the petitioners for the closure of the

units. The above petitioners challenged the said order by

preferring writ petition before the Hon'ble High Court at

Bengaluru    in   W.P.Nos.49340-49352/2012           (GM-MMS).

Learned counsel made the submission that writ petitions

were disposed of on 10.12.2012. The writ petitions were

allowed and the petitioners were permitted to operate the

units up to 23.12.2012 or till such time the application is

considered and dispose of by the licensing authority.

Learned     counsel   made        the   submission   when   on

10.12.2012 itself the closure order dated 05.09.2012

issued by the respondent/Pollution Control Board was set

aside by allowing the writ petitions, the Pollution Control

Board said to have conducted mahazar proceedings on

13.12.2012, hence the counsel submitted that when the

closure order itself has been set aside, there is no reason

for the respondent authorities again to conduct the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             : 11 :</span>



mahazar proceedings. Hence, he submitted that it is

patently   illegal.   He   also      made   the   submission   that

subsequently the private complaints came to be filed

against the petitioners, wherein without considering all

these aspects of the matter the learned JMFC Court passed

the order registering the case and issue of process to the

petitioners herein. Learned counsel draw the attention of

this Court to the order passed by the court in the writ

proceedings so also he draw the attention of the Court

about   the    documents       produced      by   the   petitioners

regarding filing of their application before the licensing

authority and renewal of the license up to 31.03.2015.

Hence, the learned counsel made the submission that in

view of the documents produced by the petitioners and in

view of the order of the Hon'ble High Court in the writ

proceedings filing of the private complaint and initiation of

the criminal proceedings are totally baseless and it is sheer

abuse of the process of the Court. Hence, he submitted to

allow the petitions and to set aside initiation of        criminal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                          : 12 :</span>



proceedings against all the petitioners in the respective

petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      6.     Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the

respondent/ Pollution Control Board during the course of

argument made the submission that even looking to the

order passed by the Hon'ble High Court in the writ

proceedings the petitioners were permitted to continue to

operate their unit up to 23.12.2012 and they were

supposed to make the application requesting for shifting of

their unit to the safer zone. He also made the submission

that the petitioners were permitted to shift their units to

the safer zone on 09.01.2013, which they have not

complied with. He also made the submission that in view

of the circular issued by the Pollution Control Board and as

the petitioners herein were supposed to run their units

only in the safer zone, the criminal proceedings were

initiated against the petitioners for non-compliance of the

orders of the Pollution Control Board and running the units

in the non-safer zone. Hence, he submitted that filing of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                          : 13 :</span>



the private complaint and initiation of criminal proceedings

by the order of JMFC Court are in accordance with law and

as per the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_12">Air Act</a> and hence learned

counsel lastly made the submission that there is no merit

in all the above petitions and submitted to reject the

petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">      7.     I have perused the averments made in the

respective petitions and also documents produced by both

the sides and also considered the oral submissions made

by the learned counsel on both the sides at the Bar.


</p><p id="p_14">      8.     It is no doubt true the Pollution Control Board

issued the order dated 05.09.2012 for the closure of the

units as there will be a pollution of the air and the said

order of the Pollution Control Board has been challenged

by the petitioners herein by filing writ proceedings before

the Hon'ble High Court and the said writ proceedings were

disposed of by the Hon'ble Court by its order dated

10.12.2012. Perusing the order of the Hon'ble High Court,

the petitioners were permitted to operate their units at the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                           : 14 :</span>



present site up to 23.12.2012 or till such time the

operation is considered and disposed of by the licensing

authority. Looking to Para No.5 of the order in the said writ

proceedings the Court observed "with these observations

petition is allowed and Annexure-H dated 05.09.2012 is

quashed." So this order itself clearly goes to show that the

order dated 05.09.2012 issued by the Pollution Control

Board directing the above petitioners for closure of their

industrial units itself has been set aside by the Hon'ble

High Court. But looking to the documents produced, the

document dated 13.12.2012 goes to show that strangely

that the authorities of the Pollution Control Board said to

have visited the place of the industrial units and drawn the

mahazar and produced the said mahazar proceedings.

When the order for closure of the industrial units itself has

been set aside by the Hon'ble High Court, there is no basis

for the said authorities again to go to the industrial units to

conduct    the   mahazar       proceedings.   Therefore,    no

importance can be attached to the mahazar proceedings.

Looking to the documents produced by the petitioners,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                            : 15 :</span>



they also clearly goes to show that they were permitted to

carry their industrial units. Even documents produced

clearly goes to show that they have made the application

seeking    renewal    of      the   license,   there   is   an

acknowledgement to that effect by the Chairman, District

Stone Crushers Regulation Committee, Haveri and even

the Form No.C produced by the petitioners also goes to

show that this license was also renewed for a period of 3

years from the date of issue. It is mentioned that license is

valid up to 31.03.2015. Looking to all these materials

placed on record, I am of the opinion that there is no basis

for the respondent/ Pollution Control Board to approach

the JMFC Court by way of filing private complaints as

against the petitioners herein. The learned Magistrate

ought to have taken all these aspects into consideration

before ordering to register the criminal cases against the

above petitioners. In view of the orders of the courts and

also the materials placed by the petitioners by way of

relevant documents, I am of the opinion that the initiation

of criminal proceedings against the petitioners in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                             : 16 :</span>



respective petitions is nothing but an abuse of process of

the Court. Hence, the petitions are allowed. Impugned

orders for initiation of criminal proceedings against the

petitioners are set aside.

Pollution Control Board regarding safer zone and non-safer

zone is concerned and if it is their contention in that regard

that the petitioners violated any of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_13">Air

Act</a>, they are at liberty to take appropriate action in

accordance    with   law.     With   these   observations,   the

petitions are disposed of.
