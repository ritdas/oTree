Hon'ble Prof. Dr. R. Nagendran
Expert Member


                                                      Dated: August 12, 2013


Justice Dr.P.Jyothimani, Judicial Member



</p><p id="p_7">1.   We heard the learned counsel for the applicant as well as for the

respondents. This application has been filed by the applicant for a direction

against the respondent Nos. 1 to 4 to consider his representation in respect

of the running of the Yarn Twisting unit run by the 5th respondent in his

business place at No. 8/76, North Muniyappan Koil Street No.1,

Karungalpatti, Salem-6 by using either weaving machines or cell phone

towers, etc.


</p><p id="p_8">2)   By our earlier order dated 24.7.2013, we have observed that if the

application for consent filed by the 5th respondent is pending before the 3rd

and 4th respondents, there is no bar for the 3rd and 4th respondents to

consider the same in accordance with law and pass appropriate orders. Now

it is brought to the notice of this Tribunal by Shri A. Ilango, the learned


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                2</span>
 counsel appearing for the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board that, in fact, the

Pollution Control Board has passed the consent order on 6.8.2013 and the 5 th

respondent has produced a copy of the original consent order, a reading of

which shows that the consent has been given upto 31.3.2014 under the

Water(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">3)   It is seen that in the consent order under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air Act</a>, the noise level has

been restricted at 55 dB(A) between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. and at 45 dB(A)

between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. That apart, under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">Water Act</a>, many other

conditions have also been incorporated. The condition in the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a> also

makes it very clear that the 5th respondent shall ensure that the DG set at the

terrace (for Cell Phone Tower) is not operated and shall take steps to remove

the DG set. We have also directed that the 5 th respondent shall not use the

DG set at any time and in fact the learned counsel appearing for the 5 th

respondent has undertaken that the he shall remove the DG set in the terrace

after informing the agency who has installed the Cell Phone Tower. The 5th

respondent, who is also present as party in person, undertakes to remove the

DG set forthwith.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">4)   The learned counsel appearing for the applicant has submitted that in as

much as the consent order has been passed on 16.8.2013, a copy of the said

order be given to him to enable him to file an appeal before the Appellate

Authority, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control. The learned counsel appearing for

the 5th respondent agrees to give a copy of the consent order to the counsel

for the applicant so that he can file an appeal.

</p><p id="p_13"> 5)   It is made clear that in order to enable the applicant to move an appeal

before the said Appellate Authority effectively, the 5th respondent shall not

operate the unit as per the consent order till 19.8.2013. In the meantime, it is

open to the applicant to move the Appellate Authority, Pollution Control and

obtain any interim order as may be given by the Appellate Authority, Pollution

Control. It is also made clear that if, by 19.8.2013, the applicant fails to obtain

any interim order, it will be open to the 5th respondent to act as per the

consent order dated 6.8.2013 of Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.


</p><p id="p_14">6)   If the agency who has erected the Cell Phone Tower, M/s. Indus Tower,

is aggrieved by the order of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, it is open

to them also to approach the said Appellate Authority, Tamil Nadu Pollution

Control Board.
