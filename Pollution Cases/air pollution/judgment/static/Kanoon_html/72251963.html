:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        This writ petition has been filed seeking a writ of Mandamus to direct
the respondents 1 to 7 herein to take appropriate action against the ninth
respondent who is creating noise pollution by using prohibited horn type
loudspeaker without getting any permission or licence, within the time limit
that may be stipulated by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2. Considering the nature of the issue involved herein, this Court by
order dated 21.12.2017, suo-motu, impleaded the Secretary to Government, 
Public Department, Fort St. George, Chennai ? 600 009, as the tenth
respondent in this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3. Mr.J.Gunaseelan Muthiah, learned Government Advocate takes notice  
for the respondents 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 10. Mr.N.S.Karthikeyan, learned
Additional Government Pleader takes notice for the third respondent. In view
of the order that is going to be passed, notice to the other respondents is
dispensed with.         
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4. By consent, the writ petition itself is taken up for final disposal.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5. According to the petitioner, the petitioner Sangam is registered
under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act and the members of the
petitioner Sangam are residing in the said area. Meanwhile, the ninth
respondent - Church without obtaining proper permission from the competent
authority, constructed a prayer hall and further, is using banned horn type
long handle loudspeakers and thereby, created noise pollution in that
locality. Due to the act of the ninth respondent, the residents therein are
suffering a lot because of noise pollution caused by him.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6. Further, the ninth respondent used the horn speakers as against the
provisions of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 and
caused hindrance to the students and patients in that area. Therefore, the
petitioner Sangam made a representation to the respondents to initiate
appropriate action against the ninth respondent, but no action is forthcoming
so far. Hence, the present writ petition is filed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7. The learned Counsel for the petitioner has mainly contended that the
ninth respondent has conducted the prayers all along the day by using the
banned horn type long handle loudspeakers with high volume and he also
erected loudspeakers in eight directions permanently. Despite several
restrictions were imposed on the use of loudspeakers, the ninth respondent
having disregard to those rules framed under the Noise Pollution (Regulation
and Control) Rules, 2000, violated the same and caused noise pollution to the
extent possible and thus, the petitioner Sangam made several representations
to the authorities concerned seeking appropriate action against the use of
loudspeakers by the ninth respondent, however, their request did not see the
light of the day so far and hence, he prayed for a writ of Mandamus to direct
the respondents 1 to 7 to take appropriate action against the ninth
respondent for the use of the banned loudspeakers.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        8. Heard the submissions of the learned Government Advocate appearing 
for the respondents 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 10 and also, the learned Additional
Government Pleader appearing for the third respondent in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        9. At the outset itself, this Court finds it appropriate to refer to
some of the decisions relating to the negative impact of 'Noise Pollution' on
the society and the need of the hour to reduce and/or curtail the same to the
maximum extent possible for the betterment of the lives and they are:
</p><p id="p_10">        9.1. <a href="/doc/1721976/" id="a_2">In Appa Rao, M.S. v. Govt. of T.N</a>., (1995) 1 LW 319 (Mad), the
Madras High Court taking a note of the serious health hazard and disturbance
to public order and tranquility caused by the uncontrolled noise pollution
prevailing in the State, issued a writ of mandamus for directing State
Government to impose strict conditions for issue of license for the use of
amplifiers and loudspeakers and for directing Director-General, Police (Law
and Order) to impose total ban on use of horn type loudspeakers and
amplifiers and air horns of automobiles.
</p><p id="p_11">        9.2. The impact of noise pollution caused by cone speakers and its
deleterious effect on public has been emphasised by K.P.Sivasubramaniam,J., 
in the case of Church of God (Full Gospel) Vs. The Government of Tamil Nadu
in W.P.No.34449 of 2002 dated 28.2.2003. Paragraph 20 of the said judgment,
which is relevant to re-emphasis for the present scenario, is set out
hereunder:
</p><p id="p_12">        "20. While parting with this case, I am also inclined to caution the
petitioners as well as such religious enthusiasts/ fundamentalists, to
practice their respective faith in a cultured way and not to resort to
aggressive or unfair methods and resorting to a method of worship which is
inhuman. God, to whichever religion He belongs to, is said to be present
everywhere and does not require a blaring and deafening amplifier to hear the
prayer of his devotees. The nature of evil and adverse effects which noise
pollution causes to the children, aged, sickly, pregnant women and even
normal individuals and how it disturbs the student community etc., have been
repeatedly emphasised with scientific facts and figures, any number of times
in newspapers, magazines, health journals and other media. Whether any 
individual has a legal or fundamental right to affect the body and mind of
another person has been dealt with in detail by the Division Bench in
Apparao's case and by the Supreme Court in the very appeal by the petitioner
and there is no need to repeat them. Suffice it to say that religious faith
existed and flourished in the past during several centuries in a better
manner without the aid of amplifiers or other gadjets which have come into
being only during the past few years. Belief in religion is and should remain
a private and personal affair. When it crosses the four walls of the house or
the place of worship and becomes a public issue, it is the singular most
factor and root cause for all the violence, extremism, terrorism and strife
we are now witnessing, national and international. The amplifiers probably
signify the growing trend of intolerance between different groups. Religion
is not a trade requiring advertisement by amplifiers. It is a pity that the
police as well as the Pollution Control authorities are yet to strictly
implement the rules and regulations in spite of repeated directions by the
Court and the Government. There is no impediment to enforce them provided the
enforcement is carried out impartially and uniformly. Marriage halls also
have become noisy with music parties forcing the invitees to run away at the
earliest. Music and melody which should be soothening, instead make the
audience frightened and terror stricken. It is paradoxical to claim that we
are becoming more and more civilised and at the same time we indulge in such
acts which are most uncivilised. Even animals run away from noisy areas. Not
only animals in forests but also in zoos are protected from noise pollution
because they cannot survive in noisy atmosphere. Motorists passing through
the forest and protected areas are warned against using the horn and the
visitors to the zoo are directed to pass through silently. Why should we
human beings reduce ourselves to less than animals, is the question which the
petitioners and their counterparts in other religions should address
themselves."
</p>

<p id="p_13">        9.3. The Honourable Supreme Court in In Re: Noise Pollution reported in
AIR 2005 SUPREME COURT 3136, while holding that there is need for creating  
general awareness towards the hazardous effects of noise pollution, has
elaborately dealt with the issue with regard to the implementation of the
laws for restricting use of loudspeakers and high volume producing sound
systems. In paragraphs 9 and 10, the Honourable Supreme Court elucidated the 
importance of Articles 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution of India and
observed as follows:
</p><p id="p_14">        "9. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_3">Article 21</a> of the Constitution guarantees life and personal liberty
to all persons. It is well settled by repeated pronouncements of this Court
as also the High Courts that right to life enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_4">Article 21</a> is not of
mere survival or existence. It guarantees a right of persons to life with
human dignity. Therein are included, all the aspects of life which go to make
a person's life meaningful, complete and worth living. The human life has its
charm and there is no reason why the life should not be enjoyed along with
all permissible pleasures. Anyone who wishes to live in peace, comfort and
quiet within his house has a right to prevent the noise as pollutant reaching
him. No one can claim a right to create noise even in his own premises which
would travel beyond his precincts and cause nuisance to neighbours or others.
Any noise which has the effect of materially interfering with the ordinary
comforts of life judged by the standard of a reasonable man is nuisance. How
and when a nuisance created by noise becomes actionable has to be answered by   
reference to its degree and the surrounding circumstances, the place and the
time.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        10. Those who make noise often take shelter behind <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_5">Article 19(1)</a>A
pleading freedom of speech and right to expression. Undoubtedly, the freedom
of speech and right to expression are fundamental rights but the rights are
not absolute. Nobody can claim a fundamental right to create noise by
amplifying the sound of his speech with the help of loudspeakers. While one
has a right to speech, others have a right to listen or decline to listen.
Nobody can be compelled to listen and nobody can claim that he has a right to
make his voice trespass into the ears or mind of others. Nobody can indulge
into aural aggression. If anyone increases his volume of speech and that too
with the assistance of artificial devices so as to compulsorily expose
unwilling persons to hear a noise raised to unpleasant or obnoxious levels
then the person speaking is violating the right of others to a peaceful,
comfortable and pollution-free life guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_6">Article 21.</a> <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_7">Article 19(1)</a> A
cannot be pressed into service for defeating the fundamental right guaranteed
by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_8">Article 21.</a> We need not further dwell on this aspect. Two decisions in
this regard delivered by High Courts have been brought to our notice wherein
the right to live in an atmosphere free from noise pollution has been upheld
as the one guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_9">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. These decisions are
Free Legal Aid Cell Shri Sugan Chand Aggarwal alias Bhagatji v. Govt. of NCT
of Delhi and others, AIR (2001) Delhi 455 (D.B.) and <a href="/doc/1220539/" id="a_10">P.A. Jacob v.
Superintendent of Police, Kottayam</a>, AIR (1993) Kerala 1. We have carefully
gone through the reasoning adopted in the two decisions and the principle of
law laid down therein, in particular, the exposition of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_11">Article 21</a> of the
Constitution. We find ourselves in entire agreement therewith."
In paragraphs 11 to 20, the Honourable Supreme Court has analysed the term 
'noise pollution' as under:     
</p><p id="p_16">        "11. The present cases provide an opportunity for examining several
questions, such as what is noise? What are its adverse effects? Whether noise
pollution runs in conflict with the fundamental rights of the people? And
what relief can be allowed by way of directions issued in public interest?
</p><p id="p_17">        I Noise what it is?
</p><p id="p_18">        12. The word noise is derived from the Latin term "nausea". It has been
defined as "unwanted sound, a potential hazard to health and communication
dumped into the environment with regard to the adverse effect it may have on
unwilling ears."
</p><p id="p_19">        13. Noise is defined as unwanted sound. Sound which pleases the 
listeners is music and that which causes pain and annoyance is noise. At
times, what is music for some can be noise for others.
</p><p id="p_20">        14. <a href="/doc/152587107/" id="a_12">Section 2(a)</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1981, includes noise in the definition of 'air pollutant'.
</p><p id="p_21">        15. <a href="/doc/152587107/" id="a_14">Section 2(a)</a> "air pollutant" means any solid, liquid or gaseous
substance including noise present in the atmosphere in such concentration as
may be or tend to be injurious to human beings or other living creatures or
plants or property or environment.
</p><p id="p_22">        16. According to Encyclopaedia Britannica : "In acoustics noise is
defined as any undesired sound."
</p><p id="p_23">        17. According to Chambers 20th Century Dictionary , noise means Sound  
especially of loud, harsh or confused kind; a sound of any kind; an over loud
or disturbing sound; frequent or public talk.
</p><p id="p_24">        18. In Chambers 21st Century Dictionary, the definition of noise has
undergone a change. Noise pollution stands carved out as a phrase separately
from noise. The two are defined as under:
</p><p id="p_25">        "Noise a sound; a harsh disagreeable sound, or such sound; a din.
pollution an excessive or annoying degree of noise in a particular area, e.g.
from traffic or aeroplane engines."
</p><p id="p_26">        19. "Pollution" is a noun derived from the verb "pollute". <a href="/doc/70356524/" id="a_15">Section 2(c)</a>
of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 defines "environmental pollution"
to mean the presence in the environment of any environmental pollutant.
<a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_16">Section 2</a> (b) of the said Act defines "environmental pollutant" to mean any
solid, liquid or gaseous substance present in such concentration as may be,
or tends to be injurious to environment.
</p><p id="p_27">        20. Thus, the disturbance produced in our environment by the
undesirable sound of various kinds is called "noise pollution"."
In paragraphs 89 to 101, the Honourable Supreme Court dealt with the
statutory laws in India regarding the menace of 'Noise Pollution', as
hereunder:
</p><p id="p_28">        "VI. Statutory Laws in India
</p><p id="p_29">        89. Not that the Legislature and the Executive in India are completely
unmindful of the menace of noise pollution. Laws have been enacted and the
Rules have been framed by the Executive for carrying on the purposes of the
legislation. The real issue is with the implementation of the laws. What is
needed is the will to implement the laws. It would be useful to have a brief
resume of some of the laws which are already available on the Statute Book.
Treatment of the problem of noise pollution can be dealt under the Law of
Crimes and Civil Law. Civil law can be divided under two heads (i) The Law of
Torts (ii) The General Civil Law. The cases regarding noise have not come
before the law courts in large quantity. The reason behind this is that many
people in India did not consider noise as a sort of pollution and they are
not very much conscious about the evil consequences of noise pollution. The
level of noise pollution is relative and depends upon a person and a
particular place. The law will not take care of a super sensitive person but
the standard is of an average and rational human being in the society.
</p><p id="p_30">        The Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000.
</p><p id="p_31">        90. In order to curb the growing problem of noise pollution, the
Government of India has enacted the Noise Pollution(Regulation and Control)
Rules, 2000. Prior to the enactment of these rules noise pollution was not
being dealt specifically by a particular Act.
</p><p id="p_32">        "Whereas the increasing ambient noise levels in public places from
various sources, inter-alia, industrial activity, construction activity,
generator sets, loudspeakers, public address systems, music systems, 
vehicular horns and other mechanical devices, have deleterious effects on
human health and the psychological well being of the people; it is considered
necessary to regulate and control noise producing and generating sources with
the objective of maintaining the ambient air quality standard in respect of
noise;"
</p><p id="p_33">        91. The main provisions of the noise rules are as under:
</p><p id="p_34">        1. The State Government may categorize the areas into industrial,
commercial, residential or silence areas/zones for the purpose of
implementation of noise standards for different areas.
</p><p id="p_35">        2. The ambient air quality standards in respect of noise for different
areas/zones has been specified for in the Schedule annexed to the Rules.
</p><p id="p_36">        3. The State Government shall take measures for abatement of noise
including noise emanating from vehicular movements and ensure that the
existing noise levels do not exceed the ambient air quality standards
specified under these rules.
</p><p id="p_37">        4. An area comprising not less than 100 meters around hospitals,
educational institutions and courts may be declared as silence area/zone for
the purpose of these rules.
</p><p id="p_38">        5. A loudspeaker or a public address system shall not be used except

</p><p id="p_64">        103. In India there is no separate Act that regulates the manufacture,

is regulated by <a href="/doc/176528/" id="a_37">The Explosives Act</a>, 1884. The Noise that is produced by these
fireworks is regulated by the Environmental Protection Act, 1986 and The

In paragraphs 158 to 165, the Honourable Supreme Court while scrutinizing the
ways and means to check/control noise pollution, has held as under:
</p><p id="p_65">        "158. The need for checking noise pollution as highlighted by the
petitioners and several intervenors deserves appreciation.
</p><p id="p_66">        159. Need for specific legislation to control and prevent noise
pollution still needs some emphasis. Undoubtedly, some laws have been 
enacted. Yet, compared with the legislation in developed countries India is
still lagging behind in enacting adequate and scientific legislations. We
need to have one simple but specific and detailed legislation dealing with
several aspects referable to noise pollution and providing measures of
control therefor.
</p><p id="p_67">        160. There is an equal need of developing mechanism and infrastructure
for enforcement of the prevalent laws. Those who are entrusted with the task
of enforcing laws directed towards controlling noise pollution, must be so
trained as to acquire expertise in the matter of fighting against noise
pollution by taking preventing and deterrent measures both. They need to be
equipped with the requisite equipments such as audio meters as would help
them in detecting the level of noise pollution more so when it crosses the
permissible limits and the source thereof.
</p><p id="p_68">        161. Above all, there is need for creating general awareness towards
the hazardous effects of noise pollution. Particularly, in our country the
people generally lack consciousness of the ill effects which noise pollution
creates and how the society including they themselves stand to benefit by
preventing generation and emission of noise pollution. The target area should
be educational institutions and more particularly schools. The young children
of impressionable age should be motivated to desist from playing with
firecrackers, use of high sound producing equipments and instruments on
festivals, religious and social functions, family get- togethers and
celebrations etc. which cause noise pollution. Suitable chapters can be added
into text-books which teach civic sense to the children and teach them how to
be good and responsible citizen which would include learning by heart of
various fundamental duties and that would obviously include learning not to
create noise pollution and to prevent if generated by others. Holding of
special talks and lectures can be organized in the schools to highlight the
menace of noise pollution and the role of the children in preventing it. For
these purposes the State must play its role by the support and cooperation of
non-government organizations (NGOs) can also be enlisted.
</p><p id="p_69">        162. Similar awareness needs to be created in police and civil
administration by means of carrying out a special drive to make them
understand the various measures to curb the problems and the laws on the
subject. Resident Welfare Associations (RAWs), service clubs (such as Rotary
International and Lions International) and societies engaged in preventing
noise pollution as part of their projects need to be encouraged and actively
involved by the local administration. Festival and ceremonies wherein the
fireworks and crackers are customarily burst can be accompanied by earmarking 
a place and time wherein and when all the people can come together and
witness or view a show of fireworks dispensing with the need of crackers
being burst in the residential areas and that too which is done without any
regard to timings. The manufacturers can be encouraged to make such fireworks
as would display more the colours rather than make noise.
</p><p id="p_70">        163. Not only the use of loudspeakers and playing of hi-fi amplifier
systems has to be regulated even the playing of high sound instruments like
drums, tom-toms, trumpets, bugles and the like which create noise beyond
tolerable limits need to be regulated. The law enforcing agencies must be
equipped with necessary instruments and facilities out of which sound level
meters conforming to Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) code are a bare
necessity.
</p><p id="p_71">        164. Preventive measures need to be directed more effectively at the
source. To illustrate, the horns which if fitted with the automobiles would
create hawking sound beyond permissible limits, should not be allowed to be
manufactured or sold in the market as once they are available they are likely
to be used.
</p><p id="p_72">        165. Loudspeakers and amplifiers or other equipments or gadgets which
produce offending noise once detected as violating the law, should be liable
to be seized and confiscated by making provision in the law in that behalf."
</p>
<p id="p_73">In paragraph 168, it is held as follows:
</p><p id="p_74">        "II. Loudspeakers
</p><p id="p_75">        1. The noise level at the boundary of the public place, where
loudspeaker or public address system or any other noise source is being used
shall not exceed 10 dB(A) above the ambient noise standards for the area or
75 dB(A) whichever is lower.
</p><p id="p_76">        2. No one shall beat a drum or tom-tom or blow a trumpet or beat or
sound any instrument or use any sound amplifier at night (between 10. 00 p.m.
and 6.a.m.) except in public emergencies.
</p><p id="p_77">        3. The peripheral noise level of privately owned sound system shall not
exceed by more than 5 dB(A) than the ambient air quality standard specified
for the area in which it is used, at the boundary of the private place."
In the very same decision, the Honourable Supreme Court also emphasised on  
the awareness over the Noise Pollution and observed thus:
</p><p id="p_78">        "IV. Awareness 
</p><p id="p_79">        1. There is a need for creating general awareness towards the hazardous
effects of noise pollution. Suitable chapters may be added in the text-books
which teach civic sense to the children and youth at the initial/early level
of education. Special talks and lectures be organised in the schools to
highlight the menace of noise pollution and the role of the children and
younger generation in preventing it. Police and civil administration should
be trained to understand the various methods to curb the problem and also the
laws on the subject.
</p><p id="p_80">        2. The State must play an active role in this process. Resident Welfare
Associations, service Clubs and Societies engaged in preventing noise
pollution as a part of their projects need to be encouraged and actively
involved by the local administration.
</p>
<p id="p_81">        3. Special public awareness campaigns in anticipation of festivals,
events and ceremonial occasions whereat firecrackers are likely to be used,
need to be carried out."
</p>
<p id="p_82">        10. Keeping in mind the dicta laid down in the aforesaid decisions by
the Honourable Supreme Court as well as this Court, I have carefully
considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on
record.
</p>
<p id="p_83">        11. Admittedly, the ninth respondent is the Parish Priest of Infant
Jesus Shrine, R.K.Puram, Kattur, Tiruchirappalli - 620 019. It is the
primordial submission of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the
ninth respondent is using the cone speakers/loud speakers during prayers and
thereby, causing noise pollution in that area and thus, the residents therein
are made to undergo the untold menace. Hence, the petitioner made several
complaints/representations to the authorities concerned for initiating
appropriate action against the ninth respondent and to remove the
loudspeakers therein. Finding no response, the petitioner approached this
Court by way of the present writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_84">        12. Today, when the matter is taken up for hearing,  Mr.J.Gunaseelan
Muthiah, learned Government Advocate appearing for the respondents 1, 2, 5,
6, 7 and 10 has drawn the attention of this Court to the communication of the
Village Administrative Officer, Ellakkudi, Agaram Village, Thiruverumbur
Taluk, Trichy District, dated Nil, addressed to the seventh respondent,
wherein it is informed that during the peace committee meeting held on
20.12.2017, the ninth respondent agreed to remove the cone speakers and also
undertakes to conduct prayers in a peaceful manner without causing any noise
pollution. Further, he has also drawn the attention of this Court to the
letter of the ninth respondent, dated 20.12.2017 addressed to the sixth
respondent in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_85">        13. The said statement made by the ninth respondent is recorded.
Accordingly, the cone speakers installed by the ninth respondent have    to
be removed forthwith. It is to ensure that any box speakers used within the
campus of the ninth respondent, shall not cause any disturbance to the
residents therein, failing which, the same shall be seized and confiscated
forthwith.
</p>
<p id="p_86">        14. With the above observations, this writ petition stands
disposed of. Consequently, the connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed. In
the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_87">        15. However, considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the
case and keeping in mind that the same problem is prevailing in all over the
State as submitted by some of the lawyers in the open Court, this Court is
inclined to issue certain directions/guidelines to regulate the noise
pollution in public/other places and they are:  
</p><p id="p_88">        (i) The State shall strictly implement the provisions of the Noise

</p><p id="p_89">        (ii) The State shall instruct all the authorities to take appropriate
action against the users of cone speakers/loudspeakers in public places
and/or in religious places in violation of the provisions of the Noise

cone speakers are curtailed and the usage of any other sound systems would be 
within the permitted parameters;
</p><p id="p_90">        (iii) The use of cone speakers/loudspeakers in public places shall be
banned/restricted forthwith in the interest of general public and more
particularly, the children and aged persons;
</p><p id="p_91">        (iv) The awareness campaigns shall be conducted among the public about 
the ill-effects of cone speakers/loudspeakers in order to curb the menace of
noise pollution;
</p><p id="p_92">        (v) Any violation in complying with the provisions of the Noise
Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, be taken note of by the
authorities concerned and appropriate action be initiated against the persons
concerned in accordance with law and the instruments used for such violation
be seized and confiscated immediately;
</p><p id="p_93">        (vi)Those, who are conducting the public meetings, shall also
scrupulously follow the directions issued in this order, while using the
sound systems; and  
</p><p id="p_94">        (vii)The tenth respondent shall communicate this order to all the
District Collectors, who inturn, shall intimate the same to all the
