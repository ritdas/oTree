</p><p id="p_2">1.            Petitioner is running a stone crushing unit.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.            The instant petition has been filed raising a challenge to the

orders/directions dated 15.6.2015 and 2.7.2015 passed by the Punjab State

Pollution Control Board and in terms of which the consent granted to the

petitioner has been revoked and the General Manager, Mining has been

called upon to cancel the registration of the petitioner-unit. Petitioner is

also aggrieved by the directions whereby it has been called upon to remove

the entire machinery.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.            At the stage of issuance of notice of motion to the respondent

authorities, interim directions were issued by this Court to the effect that in

the meanwhile status quo shall be maintained with respect to the unit of the

petitioner.</p><pre id="pre_2">

</pre><p id="p_5">4.          During the course of hearing today, it has gone uncontroverted

that petitioner had preferred appeal against the impugned directions under

the provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974

(as amended in 1988) as also under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (as amended in 1987). The appeals had been preferred

to the Secretary, State of Punjab, Department of Science and Technology

being the appellate authority.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.          Ms. Rita Kohli, learned Senior Advocate representing the

respondent-Punjab State Pollution Control Board has been candid in

admitting that the previous incumbent i.e. the Secretary, Department of

Science and Technology, State of Punjab was also holding the additional

charge of the post of Chairman, Punjab State Pollution Control Board,

Patiala and as such there was an obvious conflict of interest.

</p><p id="p_7">6.          We are also of the considered view that the appellate authority

while holding the additional charge of the post of Chairman, Punjab State

Pollution Control Board was virtually acting as a Judge in his own cause

while exercising appellate powers.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.          We have been apprised by learned State counsel that

circumstances have since changed and Mr. Roshal Sankaria, I.A.S is

presently posted and working as Secretary, Govt. of Punjab, Department of

Science and Technology and is no longer vested with the additional charge

of Chairman, Punjab State Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_9">8.          A very fair stand has been taken by Ms. Rita Kohli, learned

senior counsel that the issue be remanded back to the appellate authority for

deciding the appeals afresh.</p><pre id="pre_3">

</pre><p id="p_10">9.           As such, without entering into the merits of the case, the writ

petition is disposed of with the direction to the appellate authority to

examine the appeals preferred by the petitioner-unit against the impugned

directions/orders passed by the Punjab State Pollution Control Board in

accordance with law. Any order that may have already been passed by the

earlier appellate authority while holding the additional charge of the post of

Chairman, Punjab State Pollution Control Board would be treated as non-

est.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.          The exercise of reconsideration be finalized expeditiously and

in any case within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a

certified copy of this order.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.          The interim directions already issued with regard to

maintenance of status quo would enure in favour of the petitioner till the

disposal of the appeals by the appellate authority as has been directed in this

order.
