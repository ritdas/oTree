                                   J U D GEM E N T

</pre><p id="p_2">1.     This Application was originally filed as Writ Petition No. 6930/2009 in the

High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur as Public Interest Litigation. In

pursuance of the order dated 05.12.2013 of the Hon'ble High Court of Madhya

Pradesh in consonance with the judgement dated 9th August, 2012 of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan and Others Vs.

Union of India &amp; Others (2012) 8 SCC 326, the Writ Petition was transferred to

the Central Zone Bench, National Green Tribunal, Bhopal and was registered as

Original Application No.114/2013. The matter was listed for hearing on 13-1-

2014 since the Hon'ble High Court, while ordering the transfer of the case,

directed that the parties shall appear before this Tribunal on 13-1-2014.



</p><p id="p_3">2.     In the Writ Petition the Petitioner claimed that theirs is an organization of

social activists and they hold the river Narmada in reverence. Having observed

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Original Application No. 144/2013 (CZ)                                  Page 2 of 49</span>
 that heavy pollution is being caused to the sacred river Narmada they have taken

up the cause of protection of the river from pollution. In this connection, the

Petitioner's organization, having come to know that Mining Leases (for short,

'ML') as well as Prospective Licenses (for short, 'PL') are being granted for

mining Bauxite mineral in Achanakmar-Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (for

short, 'AABR'), they have filed the Writ Petition. According to them mining

activities in this sensitive area will cause irreparable damage to the ecology as

well as the flora and fauna besides polluting to the river Narmada which originates

in the aforesaid Biosphere Reserve (for short, 'BR').



</p><p id="p_4">3.     The Petitioner stated that the AABR was notified vide Government of

India, Ministry of Environment and Forests (for short, 'MoEF') order dated

30.03.2005 duly indicating the boundaries a copy of which is filed at Annexure P-

1 of the petition. The Petitioner further submitted that the Respondent No.5, M/s

Katni Minerals submitted an Application on 20.08.2002 for granting PL for

Bauxite mineral over an area of 284.774 hectares at village Garhidadar, Tehsil

Pushparajgarh, District Anuppur (MP) (copy filed at Annexure P-3 of the

petition). Accordingly, the Respondent No. 1, Department of Mineral Resources,

Govt. of Madhya Pradesh vide order dated 09.09.2008 recommended the PL for

an extent of 152.655 hectares instead of the sought area of 284.774 hectares in

favour of the Respondent No. 5.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">4.     It was further stated in the petition that as per the information gathered by

the Applicant's organization the District Collector, Anuppur vide memo dated

21.08.2008 referred the matter to respective authorities in the District including

the Divisional Forest Officer (for short, 'DFO'), Anuppur for furnishing requisite

information to examine the Application of the Respondent No. 5. However, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Original Application No. 144/2013 (CZ)                                 Page 3 of 49</span>
 DFO, Anuppur vide his letter dated 11.09.2007 had already informed the

Collector that he was not in favour of granting PL, in view of the fact that the

proposed mining area falls in the AABR and if the mining is allowed , the flora

and fauna in the area would be destroyed. A copy of the report of the DFO,

Anuppur dated 11-9-2007 is filed at Annexure P-5 by the Applicant. The

Applicant further states that in spite of the fact that the Forest Department has

refused to accord permission for granting PL in respect of the aforesaid area

falling in the village Garihdadar which lies in the AABR the District Collector

recommended the case to the Respondent No.1, who in turn referred the proposal

to Respondent No. 8 vide reference No. F-2/101/08/12/1 dated 09.09.2008 for

granting PL for an area of 152.655 hectares. It is the case of the Applicant that the

Respondents took a short sighted decision to grant PL in such an ecologically

sensitive area falling in the AABR for personal benefits despite the local Forest

Officer's concern and refusal to recommend the case. It is the apprehension of the

Applicant that such mining if carried out in the AABR, will not only destroy the

eco-system but will affect the flora and fauna and may also aggravate the

pollution in the river Narmada which originates in the AABR. The river Narmada

is the lifeline for the States of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat and therefore such

mining activities if permitted in such ecologically sensitive areas, falling in the

limits of AABR, will cause irreparable damage. Finally the Applicant prayed for

quashing and setting aside the impugned order/ letter of the Respondent No. 1

dated 09.09.2008 for granting PL to Respondent No. 5 and directing the

competent authority to initiate departmental proceedings against those officers

who are responsible for taking such a decision which may destroy the

environment/eco-system in the AABR.

</p><p id="p_8"> 5.     After hearing the case the Hon'ble High Court was pleased to pass the

following order on 17-7-2009.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">       "In the meanwhile, operation of the impugned order passed on

       9-9-2008 in favour of Respondent No.5 shall remain stayed".



</p><p id="p_11">6.     On 3rd November 2009 the Applicant filed amendment to the Writ Petition

adding Respondent Nos. 6 to 8 however with the prayer that by this amendment

the nature of the petition does not change. The Hon'ble High Court allowed the

amendment vide its order dated 18.12.2009 and on subsequent dates of hearing

notices were ordered to be issued to the newly added Respondents No. 6 and 7 and

later on to Respondent No.8. In the amended petition the Applicant has stated that

vide order dated 07.10.2008 the Respondent No. 1 granted PL to the Respondent

No. 6 M/s Ganpati Minerals in the aforesaid village falling in the limits of AABR

over an extent of 11.237 hectares for Bauxite mining. The Applicant also

challenged the order dated 17.04.2007 of granting ML for Bauxite mining to

Respondent No. 7 Imtiaz Khan for an area of 12.2 acres in the aforesaid village.



</p><p id="p_12">7.     The Respondents No. 1, 2 &amp; 4 filed a combined reply dated 07.08.2009,

stating that under Section 5 (1) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and

Regulation) (for short, 'MMDR') Act, 1957 the State Government, vide their letter

dated 09.09.2008, submitted proposals to the Central Government recommending

the case of the Respondent No.5 for granting PL and no decision has been taken

by the Central Government till the time of filing of the reply and therefore the

Writ Petition is premature and deserves to be dismissed.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Original Application No. 144/2013 (CZ)                                Page 5 of 49</span>
</p><p id="p_13"> 8.     It was further stated by the Respondents No. 1, 2 &amp; 4 that the Respondent

No. 5, submitted Application in form-B for granting PL for Bauxite mining for an

area admeasuring 286.774 hectares in the aforesaid village but the Forest

Department refused NOC as part of it involves forest land. Therefore the area has

been reduced to 152.655 hectares after deducting the forest area and after

considering all the aspects and also taking into account that the proposed PL area

does not fall within the Core Zone of the AABR and mining activities are

prohibited only in the Core Zone but permissible in the Buffer Zone and

Transition Zone, the case was recommended to the Central Government. The

Respondents No. 1,2 &amp; 4 further stated in their reply that as per the Government

of India, Notification/Letter dated 30.03.2005 while declaring the AABR it is

clearly mentioned under Clause 4 (b) that manipulation activities may be

permitted in the Buffer Zone but the same has to be in conformity with the general

guidelines issued on the management of BRs. The area applied by the Respondent

No. 5 falls in the Buffer Zone where mining activities are permissible and the state

government, while sending proposals dated 09.09.2008 to the Government of

India, have already reduced the extent of area applied by the Respondent No. 5

from 284.774 hectares to 152.655 hectares duly excluding the forest area. They

further stated that the recommended PL site is more than 250 mt. away from the

forest and no damage or harm would be caused to the flora and fauna in the area

and the site where the river Narmada originates will not get affected in any

manner. Finally the Respondents No. 1,2 &amp; 4 prayed for outright rejection of the

Writ Petition.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">9.     Subsequently, the Respondent No. 4, in compliance of the Hon'ble High

Court order dated 18.11.2009, filed additional affidavit stating that the

Respondent No. 1, having taken into consideration and having examined all the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Original Application No. 144/2013 (CZ)                                 Page 6 of 49</span>
 aspects, recommended the Application of the Respondent No. 5 for granting PL

for an area of 152.65 hectares. The letter dated 11.09.2007 issued by the Forest

Department which is filed at Annexure P-5 by the Applicant, was mainly based on

the fact that the initial proposal involved forest land and later on it was found that

there will be no effect with regard to the Forest land in the reduced/revised PL

area. Moreover the proposed area does not fall under the Core Zone of AABR but

it falls under the Buffer Zone where the mining activities are permissible. It was

further stated that as the reduced/revised PL area is not only not involving any

Forest land but it is more than 250 mt. away from the notified Forest there is

nothing wrong with the proposal dated 09.09.2008 sent by the Respondent No. 1

to the Central Government recommending the case of Respondent No.5.



</p><p id="p_16">10.    In compliance of the Hon'ble High Court order dated 18.02.2011, the

Respondents No. 1, 2 &amp; 4 have placed on record the Scientific (Research) Report

titled 'Bio-Physical Environment of Amarkantak, M.P.', prepared by Department

of Applied Geology, Barkatullah University, Bhopal and sponsored by

Environmental Planning and Coordination Organization (for short, 'EPCO'), Govt.

of M.P. relating to Bauxite mining carried out by HINDALCO &amp; BALCO

companies at around AABR plateau wherein the Bauxite mining activities of these

two companies have already been stopped. It was further stated that as per the

scientific report the mining by the aforesaid companies relates to area at and

around Amarkantak plateau whereas the impugned proposal dated 09.9.2008

pertains to village Garhidadar which is approximately 25 km. away from the

Amarkantak plateau.
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">11.    In continuation of the above submissions and in compliance of the Hon'ble

High Court order dated 18.02.2011 the Respondents No. 1, 2 &amp; 4 made further
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Original Application No. 144/2013 (CZ)                                   Page 7 of 49</span>
 submissions on 25.07.2011 enclosing a list of MLs and PLs granted to various

persons between 2002 to 2010 with the sanctioned areas ranging from 0.669

hectares to 148.181 hectares in Anuppur District located in the limits of AABR. It

was mentioned in the additional submission that no ML has been granted in the

AABR falling in the limits of village Garhidadar.
</p>
<p id="p_19">


</p><p id="p_20">12.    During the course of hearing of the case before this Tribunal, the State was

directed to file Landscape/ Management Plan for the AABR. Accordingly the

Respondent No. 4, DFO, Anuppur filed an affidavit enclosing Landscape/

Management Plan of proposed PL for Bauxite mine in Garhidadar plateau stating

that the approved PL of the Respondent No. 5 falls in the Transition Zone of

AABR and the same was indicated on maps filed as Annexures G &amp; L of the

affidavit. It was further stated in the affidavit that if ML is granted subsequent to

prospecting by the Respondent No. 5, the mineral has to be transported through

the road passing through in the notified forest land and therefore for utilizing the

forest road for transportation of mineral it requires permission under the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_1">Indian

Forest Act</a>, 1927.
</p>
<p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">13.    The DFO in his affidavit further indicated the demarcation of Core Zone,

Buffer Zone and Transition Zone in the AABR carried out by the Tropical Forest

Research Institute (for short, 'TFRI'), Jabalpur and a map showing theses areas has

been filed at Annexure 'L' in the Landscape Plan.

High Court dated 12.08.2010 has filed a copy of the Guidelines issued by it in

October, 2007 on constitution of Biosphere Reserves in India. Subsequently, the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Original Application No. 144/2013 (CZ)                                  Page 8 of 49</span>
 MoEF has also filed para-wise reply dated 24.09.2011 stating that under the

project or activity "Mining of Mineral" mineral prospecting is exempted from the

requirement of Environmental Clearance (for short, 'EC') as per notification

issued in S.O. No. 3067 (E) dated 01.12.2009. The MoEF further stated that the

area in question falls in Buffer Zone of AABR and even though no legal issues are

involved it has to be ensured that the activities carried out in the Buffer Zone do

not cause any negative impact on the Core Zone and as per the communication

received from the EPCO, Bhopal there is no record in the MoEF to the effect that

any Scientific study has been carried out in the area and the Bio-Physical

Environment Study done during 1995 on the mining sites of the HINDALCO &amp;

BALCO in Anuppur region, has got no relevance in this case.



</p><p id="p_25">15.    The MoEF further stated that the constitution of AABR falling in the states

of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh is through a letter issued by the MoEF dated

30.03.2005 and this is nothing but giving recognition to the area as it is unique

and representative of major eco-system types of the world. This letter is not

legally binding and is only advisory in nature. It is the averment of the MoEF that

since the Applications are submitted to the State Government for granting PL by

the prospective miners, a decision has to be taken by the State Government with

regard to environmental implications that may arise if such mining activity is

permitted to be carried out in the area in question which is rich in mineral

resources and therefore EPCO, Government of M.P., will be advised to take a

scientific assessment and study possible impact on Core Zone including the river

Narmada because as per report of the EPCO, there is no record available about

any scientific study of the area.        The MoEF further stated that the State

Government has recommended the Ministry of Mines, Government of India for

granting PL to Respondent No. 5 &amp; 6 and as per the response received from the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">Original Application No. 144/2013 (CZ)                                 Page 9 of 49</span>
 EPCO, the drainages from this area ultimately join river Narmada near Majholi at

about 15 to 20 km. distance in south west direction.
</p>
<p id="p_26">

</p><p id="p_27">16.    However, not satisfied with the above para-wise reply of the MoEF the

Hon'ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh in its orders dated 13.08.2012 and

21.09.2012 directed the Secretary, MoEF to file a personal affidavit either after

personally inspecting the area or after getting the area inspected by a responsible

officer and answer the following questions which arise in this case:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "1.     Whether the land on which license has been granted for
               mining related activity to Respondents No. 5, 6 &amp; 7 by the
               State Government comes within the Core Zone or the Buffer
               Zone of the Amarkantak biosphere reserve, as declared by
               the Union of India, Ministry of Environment ?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       2.      If the land or any part of it comes within such zone, whether
               mining or mining related activity can be permitted on such
               land.</blockquote><p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">       3.      If such activity cannot be permitted whether the licenses
               granted to Respondents No. 5, 6 &amp; 7 by the State
               Government are liable to be quashed?''


       Accordingly, the Secretary, MoEF filed personal affidavit stating that as per

the guidelines issued with regard to constitution of Biosphere Reserves in the

country, the Governments of Madhya Pradesh &amp; Chhattisgarh, were conveyed

with the MoEF communication dated 30.03.2005 for establishment of AABR

having considered that the area is rich in biodiversity and having ecologically

diverse landscape. As per the information provided by the Additional Principal

Chief Conservator of Forests (for short, 'APCCF'), Regional Office, MoEF,

Bhopal the Respondents No. 5 &amp; 6 have been issued with PL by the Ministry of

Mines, Government of India and the Respondent No. 7 was granted permission

for mining by the Government of Madhya Pradesh.

Court order dated 13.08.2012 the MoEF, vide its order dated 06.09.2012,

constituted a committee under the chairmanship of APCCF, Regional Office,

MoEF, Bhopal comprising the following responsible senior officers as members

to inspect the site and report.

the Mining, Revenue and Forest Departments of the state of Madhya Pradesh and

held a detailed discussion with the District Collector, Anuppur. A copy of the

report of the committee has been filed at Annexure 'C' of the reply of the

Secretary, MoEF. The Secretary, MoEF further stated that the PL/ML granted to

the Respondents No. 5, 6 &amp; 7 are falling within the Buffer Zone of AABR and

according to the BR guidelines of October, 2007 issued by the MoEF, the uses and

activities in the Buffer Zone of the BR are required to be managed in such a way

that they protect the Core Zone and there is no specific mention about the mining

among the uses and activities mentioned therein. However, as per the guidelines

issued on constitution of Biosphere Reserves which stipulate sustainable use of

natural resources through most appropriate technology for improvement of

economic well-being of the local people, developmental activities including

mining and mining related activities, are required to be regulated to ensure

sustainable use of natural resources in the Buffer Zone as per the existing

 regulations by using most appropriate and viable technology and after preparation

of a detailed Landscape Plan by the concerned State Governments.



</p><p id="p_34">19.    The Secretary, MoEF finally stated that in the present scenario, the PL

granted to Respondents No. 5 and 6 by the Ministry of Mines, Government of

India, and the ML granted to the Respondent No. 7 by the Government of Madhya

Pradesh, be kept on hold/suspended until the Landscape Plan for the AABR is

prepared and the decision on the validity of these PLs and ML, be taken up

subsequent to the Landscape Plan drawn by the concerned State Government.



</p><p id="p_35">20.    During the course of hearing the Respondent No. 5 made an objection to the

aforesaid affidavit of the Secretary, MoEF stating that only Core and Buffer Zones

were mentioned in the affidavit but in the official website of TFRI, Jabalpur

'www.icfre.org/userfile/file/institute-TFRI-2011/2012/Achanakmar-170712.pdf'

which is under the control of MoEF, Transition Zone along with Core &amp; Buffer

Zones was also demarcated and the site where the PL granted to his firm, falls in

Transition Zone. Therefore the Counsel for the MoEF was asked to file detailed

report duly explaining the position with regard to issue of demarcation of

Transition Zone apart from the Core and Buffer Zones, raised by the Respondent

No. 5. Accordingly one, Dr. S.K. Lal, Scientist-'B', MoEF, Regional Office,

Bhopal filed affidavit stating that as per the original letter of the MoEF dated

30.03.2005 while declaring the AABR only Core Zone (551.55 sq. km.) and

Buffer Zone (3283.96 sq.km.) were indicated, but subsequently as per the revised

guidelines of MoEF issued in October 2007 the structure and design of the BR is

proposed in such a way that it requires three zones i.e., 'Core', 'Buffer' and

'Transition'. This classification is in tune with the Nomination Form of MAB

Programme of UNESCO and the TFRI, Jabalpur prepared the Nomination Form
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">Original Application No. 144/2013 (CZ)                               Page 12 of 49</span>
 along with related documents for AABR as per the MAB of UNESCO. The

Nomination Form was duly endorsed by the States of Chhattisgarh &amp; Madhya

Pradesh who are responsible for management of the AABR and the same was duly

forwarded to the UNESCO on 20.10.2010 through Ministry of Human Resources

Development, Government of India for inclusion of AABR in the World Network

of BRs under UNESCO programme and the delineation of Transition Zone in the

map prepared by the TFRI, out of the already declared Buffer Zone is only as per

the prescription contained in the Nomination Form of the MAB Programme of

</p><p id="p_37">21.    The Respondent No. 5, M/s Katni Minerals Pvt. Ltd. filed their reply dated

17.08.2009 before the Hon'ble High Court. It is the contention of the Respondent

No. 5 that after thoroughly examining their Application, recommendation dated

09.09.2008, was made to the Central Government by the Respondent No.2 for

granting PL. They further stated that initially they have applied for PL over an

area measuring 284.77 hectares in Garhidadar village but the answering

Respondents having taken into consideration of the entire aspects, reduced the

area and recommended PL for 152.655 hectares only. The site applied for PL falls

in the Buffer Zone of the AABR where mining activities are not prohibited and

even after completing the prospecting of mineral, if ML is applied, it is imperative

to obtain EC which will be issued only after detailed investigation including

Environmental Impact Assessment (for short, 'EIA') is done after looking into all

the environmental and pollution aspects and therefore there is no bar on granting

of PL in the Buffer Zone. The Respondent No.5 has also drawn attention to the

letter dated 30.03.2005 of the Respondent No. 2, MoEF wherein under clause 4

</p><p id="p_38">(b) it is clearly mentioned that manipulation activities may be permitted in the

Buffer Zone of the AABR. Moreover the Respondents No. 1, 3 &amp; 4 in their

 proposals dated 09.09.2008, sent to the Central Government, have already

considered all the relevant issues and reduced the PL area which is more than 250

mt. away from the forest land and there will be no damage to the flora and fauna

in the area as alleged by the Applicant. Subsequently, even if ML is granted and

even if there is some disturbance to ecological balance, as feared by the Applicant,

detailed Environment Management Plan (for short, 'EMP') will be done reducing

the environmental problems. The Respondent No.5 further stated that the

Respondent No. 4, DFO, Anuppur has issued NOCs dated 05.08.2005,

06.11.2007, 28.03.2008 &amp; 01.08.2008 in favour of several other persons for

granting PL/ML in the vicinity and one such case is granting NOC in favour of

Respondent No. 6.
</p>
<p id="p_39">

</p><p id="p_40">22.    Subsequently, vide his additional submissions dated 31.07.2010 the

Respondent No.5 stated that the District Collector, Anuppur, who is the Chairman

of the District Level Field Coordination Committee for the AABR got the area

inspected by the committee members who opined that the area in question does

not fall in the Core Zone and the Nallahs originating in the area join the Narmada

river at village Majholi which is situated at a distance of about 18-20 km. from the

PL site. He further stated that there is no flora and fauna in the PL area and there

is no possibility of causing any damage or adverse effect in the area. It was

further stated by the Respondent No. 5 that as per the document obtained by him

under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_2">RTI Act</a> the aforesaid committee in its meeting dated 13.07.2010 has

recommended granting of NOC for enhancing production capacity of the existing

Bauxite mining leases in the said area and therefore his case also deserves

favourable consideration in the light of the above inspection and recommendations

of the District Level Field Coordination Committee. Subsequently, in compliance

of the Hon'ble High Court order dated 10.09.2012 further affidavit has been filed

 on behalf of the Respondent No.5 stating that the site in question at village

Garhidadar, Tehsil Pushparajgarh, District Anuppur, which was inspected on

30.10.2012 by the committee constituted by the Secretary, MoEF is 10 km. away

from the State Highway Katni-Amarkantak and from the State Highway right up

to the site at Garhidadar village there is a WBM road which is fully motorable

amended Application, filed their reply dated 14.06.2010 stating that they were

granted PL over an area of 11.237 hectares for a period of 2 years in Village

Garhidadar, District Anuppur on the same grounds on which the Respondent No.

7 was also granted PL, and the Petitioner challenged the granting of PL on

03.11.2009 after more than one year of the granting. During this period the

Respondent No.6 completed the prospecting of the mineral and based on the result

of prospecting they were also granted ML for mining of Bauxite. Therefore, at this

juncture after completion of prospecting and after granting the ML the petition

filed by the Petitioner is not maintainable. The Respondent No. 6, further stated

that the land in question is a private land owned by them along with other private

persons whose consent was taken and the ML was granted. The DFO, Anuppur

vide letter dated 05.08.2005 has given the NOC to the answering Respondent and

after due consideration of the Application and based on the recommendation of

the District Collector proposals were sent to the Central Government for granting

the PL. The Respondent No. 6, further contended that the objection raised by the

Petitioner that the mining site is falling in AABR and hence not permissible is not

tenable and in fact the AABR project document itself permits mining activity and

under clause 4 (b) it is specifically mentioned manipulation that the activities are

Respondent No. 6 pleaded dismissal of the petition.



</p><p id="p_43">24.    The Respondent No. 7, Imtiaz Khan who was also impleaded by the

Petitioner vide amended Application dated 03.011.2009 contended that his site

where the ML was sanctioned, does not fall under the Core Zone of the AABR but

in fact it is located in the Buffer Zone far away from the Core Zone at a corner of

the AABR. He further stated that his Application for granting PL was forwarded

to the Government of India by the Mineral Resources Department, Government of

Madhya Pradesh vide letter No. 2-247/2000/12/2 dated 11.08.2003 and

accordingly the Ministry of Mines, Government of India accorded approval for

grant of PL for a period of one year vide their order dated 31st August, 2004 and

thereafter the State Government granted the PL for an area of 13.10 acres (5 acres

of Khasra No. 24/2 plus 8.10 acres of Khasra No. 24/3) at Village Garhidadar,

District Anuppur for a period of one year vide order dated 08.10.2004 and the

prospecting of the area was completed on 11.03.2005 i.e. before the date of

notification (dtd. 30.03.2005) of the AABR. The Respondent No.7 stated that after

prospecting the mineral, he submitted Application dated 30.04.2005 for granting

ML and District Collector, Anuppur recommended the case over an area of 12.20

acres falling in the aforesaid Khasra numbers and thereafter the State Government

submitted proposals to the Government of India and finally after examining the

proposals ML was granted to him by State Government vide order dated

7.08.2008 over an area 12.20 acres for a period of 20 years. The Respondent No. 7

further stated that after completing all the formalities and after obtaining

clearance/consent from the Indian Bureau of Mines, State Pollution Control Board

etc, he has taken up the regular mining activities in the sanctioned area which is

located far away from the Core Zone and thus his lease does not have any

compliance of the orders of the Hon'ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh dated

22.10.2013 filed their reply stating that on the receipt of proposals from the

Government of Madhya Pradesh, the Ministry of Mines accorded prior approval

of the Central Government for (i) grant of ML for Bauxite for an area of 12.2

acres in the aforesaid Village in favour of Respondent No. 7 Imtiaz Khan for a

period of 20 years vide their letter dated 17.04.2007 (ii) grant of ML for Bauxite

4.08.2009 and (iii) grant of PL for Bauxite for an area of 152.665 hectares in

favour of Respondent No. 5, M/s Katni Minerals for a period of 2 years vide their

letter dated 07.09.2009. It was further stated in the affidavit by the Ministry of

Mines, Government of India that the prior approvals of the Central Government

in all the afore mentioned cases was subject to necessary statutory clearances and

approvals and therefore it is for the State Government to take subsequent action

towards the grant of ML considering all aspects and in the light of the provisions

of the Mines and <a href="/doc/47147010/" id="a_3">Mineral Development Regulation Act</a>, 1957, Mineral

(Concession) Rules 1960 and relevant Environmental and Forest laws.


</p><p id="p_46">26. Discussion and Conclusion:
</p>
<p id="p_47">       As noted above, this case was originally filed as PIL before the Hon'ble

High Court of Madhya Pradesh in the year 2009 and was transferred to this

Tribunal to deal with it under the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_4">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 as per the

orders dated 5-12-2013 of the Hon'ble High Court. The legal backing for the

Applicant's case is therefore to be found within the four corners of the NGT Act
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">Original Application No. 144/2013 (CZ)                                Page 17 of 49</span>
 i.e. whether the case involves 'a substantial question relating to environment' and

if so, whether it falls within the Scheduled Acts as it is the case of the Applicant

that the grant of ML/PL would cause great harm to the biodiversity and ecology of

the AABR from where the river Narmada originates and also whether it affects the

livelihood of the local communities which according to the Applicant, is against

the objective and purpose of establishing Biosphere Reserves. Therefore, in the

absence of any specific law dealing with the BRs in the acts listed under the

Schedule-I of the NGT Act, environmental issues involving BRs are required to

be examined keeping in view the related laws i.e. Water (Prevention and Control

of Pollution ) Act, 1974, Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_6">Environment (Protection) Act</a> 1986 listed under schedule-I of the NGT Act, 2010.

The record placed before us shows that there is no express provision banning

manipulation activities in the Buffer and Transition zones of the BRs. However,

these activities have to be in consonance with the purpose of constitution of BRs

under MAB Programme of UNESCO and the Guidelines issued by the MoEF in

2007. Nevertheless, having gone through the pleadings and having heard the

Counsel for the Petitioner and the Respondents at length we feel that the following

points are required to be examined in this case.
</p>
<p id="p_48">

  I.   Under what provision the BRs are constituted and what is the legal backing

       for the issues/objections raised by the Petitioner in respect of granting PL

       and ML in the AABR located outside the Core area.
</p>
<p id="p_49">

 II.   Whether the Central Government or the State Government is vested with

       any authority or powers to restrict/prohibit the activities in the BR and if so,

       what are the activities which can be restricted/prohibited and under what

       provisions of the law.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">Original Application No. 144/2013 (CZ)                                   Page 18 of 49</span><p id="p_50">
 III.   Whether any provisions have been made under the law for preparation of

       Landscape Plan and if so who is the competent authority and what aspects

       have to be taken into account while preparing such Landscape Plan.



IV.    Whether permission for undertaking mining activities, in Buffer and

       Transition zones of a BR, are contrary to the basic objectives of creating

       and maintaining Biosphere Reserves which are rich in biodiversity.



V.     Whether any scientific evidence has been produced by the Applicant or the

       Respondents that the PL and MLs in question, granted in the Buffer and

       Transition Zones of the AABR will lead to adverse impact on the

       biodiversity, cause pollution as well as on the livelihood opportunities of

       the local communities.
</p>
<p id="p_51">27.    We may now examine the above points one after the other as follows:

 I.    Under what provision the BRs are constituted and what is the legal

       backing for the issues/objections raised by the Petitioner in respect of

       granting PL and ML in the AABR located outside the Core area.


       Before we examine the above point it is appropriate to place the following

relevant extracts of the MoEF letter dated 30-3-2005, addressed to the Chief

Secretaries of the states of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh on the establishment

of AABR.

       As per the information furnished by the Respondent No. 2 MoEF the BR is

an international designation made by UNESCO for representative parts of natural

and cultural landscapes extending over large area of terrestrial or coastal/marine

ecosystems or a combination thereof. These areas are internationally recognized

within the framework of UNESCO's MAB Programme, after receiving consent of

the participating country. The MAB Programme initiated, in 1972, is a broad

based ecological programme aimed at improvement of the relationship between

man and the environment; to predict the consequences of today's actions on

tomorrow's world and thereby to increase man's ability to manage the natural

resources of the biosphere efficiently. BRs are designated to deal with one of the

most important questions of reconciling the conservation of biodiversity, the quest

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">Original Application No. 144/2013 (CZ)                                Page 21 of 49</span>
 for economic and social development and maintenance of associated cultural

values. One of the primary objectives of MAB is to achieve a sustainable balance

between the goals of conserving biological diversity, promoting economic

development,           and        maintaining   associated    cultural       values.

BRs are thus special environments for both people and the nature and are living

examples of how human beings and nature can co-exist while respecting each

others' needs. The approach emphasizes research and training and seeks scientific

information to find solution to problems in management and conservation of

natural resources.

</p><p id="p_68">       The concept of Biosphere Reserves, especially its zonation, into Core

Area(s) (dedicated to conservation), Buffer Area(s) (sustainable use) and

Transition Area(s) (equitable sharing of benefits) were later broadly adopted under

the Convention on Biological Diversity (for short, 'CBD') process which entered

into force on 29th        December, 1993. The CBD has two principal objectives,

namely 'Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity' and 'Fair and

Equitable sharing of benefits arising from its utilization'. CBD calls for in-situ

and ex-situ conservation, incentives for conservation and sustainable use, research

and training, awareness and education, impact assessment, regulating access to

genetic resources, access and transfer of technology and provisions of financial

resources. While dealing with these issues, CBD emphasizes on nationally

determined priorities, capacity and needs and with full and effective participation

of local communities. Biosphere Reserves are special entities (sites) for both the

people and the nature and are living examples of how human beings and nature

can co-exist while respecting each other's needs. These reserves contain genetic

elements evolved over millions of years that hold the key to future adaptations and

survival. The high degree of diversity and endemism and associated traditional

 farming systems and knowledge held by the people in these reserves are the

product of centuries of human innovation and experimentation. These sites have

Global     importance,      having       tremendous   potential   for   future   economic

development, especially as a result of emerging new trends in Biotechnology.

       Introduction

       The idea of `Biosphere Reserves' was initiated by UNESCO in
       1973-74 under its Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme. The
       MAB, launched in 1970 by UNESCO, is a broad based ecological
       programme aimed to develop within the natural and social
       sciences a basis for the rational use and conservation of the
       resources of the biosphere and for the improvement of the
       relationship between man and the environment; to predict the
       consequences of today's actions on tomorrows world and thereby
       to increase man's ability to manage efficiently the natural
       resources of the biosphere. The approach emphasizes the
       importance of the structure and functioning of ecological systems
       and their mode of reaction when exposed to human intervention
       including impact of man on the environment and vice-versa. MAB
       is primarily a programme of research and training and seeks
       scientific information to find solution of concrete practical
       problems of management and conservation. MAB's field projects
       and Biosphere reserves constitute the main goal of the whole
       programme.

<p id="p_76">       The Indian National Man and Biosphere (MAB) Committee
       identifies and recommends potential sites for designation as
       Biosphere Reserves, following the UNESCO's guidelines and
       criteria.

        landscapes extending over large area of terrestrial or
       coastal/marine ecosystems or a combination thereof. BRs are
       designated to deal with one of the most important questions of
       reconciling the conservation of biodiversity, the quest for
       economic and social development and maintenance of associated
       cultural values. BRs are thus special environments for both
       people and the nature and are living examples of how human
       beings and nature can co-exist while respecting each others'
       needs.

               contain unique features of landscapes, ecosystems and
               genetic variations e.g. one population of a globally rare
               species; their representativeness and uniqueness may both
               be characteristics of an area.

       In order to undertake complementary activities of biodiversity
       conservation and development of sustainable management aspects,
       Biosphere Reserves are demarcated into three inter-related zones.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">Original Application No. 144/2013 (CZ)                                Page 27 of 49</span>
        These are (I) natural or core zone (ii) manipulation or Buffer zone
       and (iii) A Transition zone outside the Buffer zone.

       The Core Zone:
</p><p id="p_98">       The core zone is kept absolutely undisturbed. It must contain
       suitable habitat for numerous plant and animal species, including
       higher order predators and may contain centres of endemism.
       Core areas often conserve the wild relatives of economic species
       and also represent important genetic reservoirs. The core zones
       also contain places of exceptional scientific interest. A core zone
       secures legal protection and management and research activities
       that do not affect natural processes and wildlife are allowed. Strict
       nature reserves and wilderness portions of the area are designated
       as core areas of BR. The core zone is to be kept free from all
       human pressures external to the system.
</p>
<p id="p_99">       The Buffer Zone:
</p><p id="p_100">       In the Buffer Zone, which adjoins or surrounds core zone, uses and
       activities are managed in ways that protect the core zone. These
       uses and activities include restoration, demonstration sites for
       enhancing value addition to the resources, limited recreation,
       tourism, fishing and grazing, which are permitted to reduce its
       effect on core zone. Research and educational activities are to be
       encouraged. Human activities, if natural within BR, are likely to be
       permitted to continue if these do not adversely affect the ecological
       diversity.
</p>
<p id="p_101">       The Transition Zone:
</p><p id="p_102">       The Transition Zone is the outermost part of a Biosphere Reserve.
       This is usually not delimited one and is a zone of cooperation
       where conservation, knowledge and management skills are applied
       and uses are managed in harmony with the purpose of the
       Biosphere Reserve. This includes settlements, crop lands, managed
       forests and area for intensive recreation, and other economic uses
       characteristic of the region.
</p>
<p id="p_103">       In Buffer Zone and the Transition Zones, manipulative macro-
       management practices are used. Experimental research areas are
       used for understanding the patterns and processes in the

<p id="p_108">       7.8 How Biosphere Reserves are different from Protected Areas
       such as National Parks (NP) and Wildlife Sanctuaries (WS)?

       It may be noted that the BR is not intended to replace existing
       protected areas but it widens the scope of conventional approach
       of protection and further strengthens the Protected Area Network.
       Existing legally protected areas (National Parks, Wildlife
       Sanctuary, Tiger Reserves and Reserved/Protected forests) may
       become part of the BR without any change in their legal status. On
       the other hand, inclusion of such areas in a BR will enhance their
       national value. It, however, does not mean that Biosphere Reserves
       are to be established only around the National Parks and Wildlife
       Sanctuaries. However, the Biosphere Reserves differ from
       Protected Areas due to their emphasis on:
</p>
<p id="p_109">       (i) Conservation of overall biodiversity and landscape, rather than
           some specific flagship species, to allow natural and
           evolutionary processes to continue without any hindrance.

Ministry of Human Resources Department, Government of India states that the

creation of BR is to assist in developing and permitting the concept i.e. possible to

have ecological integrity, sustainable biodiversity and have integration between

rural and urban life style while utilizing natural resources in a responsible manner.

Even the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment do not prohibit the

economic activities in the BR and in fact the guidelines clearly states

Manipulation of Macro Management Practices in Buffer zone / Transition zone as

well as economic uses characteristic of the region and the rules and regulations

provide a broad planning approach to conservation and wise use of natural

resources of the BR without compromising the biodiversity and life style of the

local communities. However, role of the stakeholders in the process should be

ensured and the corporate sector may be included and EIA notification and

restoration of degraded eco system with the BRs has to be integrated into the

planning process.

guidelines prescribed that Local Level Committee to be headed by the

Commissioner or Director (who may be sufficiently senior IFS officer) should co-

ordinate activities of various departments with regard to preparation of Landscape

plan for the areas falling in the Buffer zone and Transition zone it is desirable to

entrust the task to the EPCO in the case of AABR. Conservation and maintenance

of biological diversity, sustainable utilization of natural resources, and

stabilization of the terrain; improvement and regulation of hydrological regime;

people's involvement in planning and management of natural resources and

fulfilling socio-economic and livelihood needs of the people have to be taken into

account while preparing the Landscape plan.

 and Anuppur districts, and wheat fields in Dindori district to the hills of Maikal

ranges of Satpura. The topography, in combination with perennial streams and

valleys has created micro-climatic conditions in the area to provide diverse

environmental conditions, encouraging luxuriant growth for several species of

Thallophytes, Bryophytes, Pteriodophytes (Ferns), Ggymnosperms, Angiosperms

and many species of wild fauna of economic importance. Achanakmar -

Amarkantak BR is blessed with many seasonal monsoon dependent and

permanent streams, rivers like the Narmada, the Johilla and the Sone, many

rivulets and two dams.

</p><p id="p_158">       The basic concept of BR is for the conservation and rational use of the

natural resources and for the improvement of relation between the man &amp;

environment. Therefore, sustainable mining activity in Buffer/Transition zone

does not itself lead to a direct conflict with the objectives of constitution of BRs.

There is no bar in undertaking such activities of utilizing natural resources in a

responsible manner in areas falling outside and located far away from the Core

zone provided the basic conditions prescribed for constitution and maintenance of

BR are fulfilled, ecological integrity is maintained, biodiversity is sustained and

100 % foolproof EIA study is done, EC is granted and no deviation is allowed

from the conditions prescribed while granting the EC. However before the above

exercise is done, detailed Landscape Plan shall be prepared as the AABR is

ecologically sensitive and rich in flora and fauna.

       A perusal of the study report on the Bauxite mining done by HINDALCO

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">       "Amarkantak, by virtue of being source of the Narmada, Sone and
       Johilla rivers, is a very important and holy place which has its
       own importance in cultural and mythological heritage of the
       country. The unique and remarkable feature of Amarkantak
       region are the trijunction of three major hill ranges namely
       Satpura, Vindhyachal and Maikal and river basins (the Narmada,
       the Mahanadi and the Ganga). The Bauxite ore at trijunction of
       Mandla, Bilaspur and Shahdol districts is quantitatively the
       largest and qualitatively the best in the state. Bauxite mining here
       is being carried-out by HINDALCO and BALCO since 1962 and
       1970 respectively.      The indiscriminate mining of Bauxite
       resources from such an important religious place has caused
       adverse effects on the environmental and ecological balance of
       the regions.

       and therefore the landscape of leased area changes drastically
       from lush green forest to varied coloured pits dominated by
       brownish red colour, but the importance of land reclamation
       cannot be denied in this context of increasing mechanization and
       mounting pressure on land due to other competitive use such as
       forestry, park, playground, reservoir etc.

        The initial stages of surface mining comprises of removal of
       vegetation and top soil of the area. Opencast Bauxite mining
       upsets the natural ecosystem due to the land degradation and
       dumping of overburden. The very beginning of opencast mining
       involves in the excavation of laterite overburden to reach the
       Bauxite which is not useful and has to be dumped in and outside
       the mining pit, thus creating a twofold disadvantage, namely (i)
       devastating the land involved in actual extraction and (ii) land
       required for dumping the excavated overburden. The latter is
       much more greater than the land involved in actual mining
       operation. The average stripping ratio of overburden to Bauxite
       ore is reported to be 5:1 in Amarkantak region. The depth of
       mines usually vary from 3 meters to 15 metres. The top fertile
       black cottons oil containing humus and organic contents on
       Bauxite plateau varies in thickness from few centimetres to about
       a meter followed by loose lateritic (ferruginous, pisolites) soil.
       The various environmental problems are produced due to the over
       exploitation of both renewable and non-renewable natural
       resources. In the process, the ecological balance is upset, and the
       environment gets degraded, thereby leading to depletion of
       resources beyond sustainable limits. Environmental protection
       and monitoring is not restricted to the spheres of urban or
       industrial pollution of water, air and land but also extends to the
       misuse of the scarce land resources. It follows that the assessment
       of limits of exploitation of various natural resources and
       monitoring the total environmental situation are essential steps
       for a conservation and eco-restoration strategy. The various
       mining method and practices have gone through a sea change
       over the past several decades resulting in adoption of more
       scientific modes of operation with relatively less adverse
       consequences to the environment. But during opencast mining the
       land cover is completely stripped off and in the process, land
       directly gets degraded.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">       To protect environment from the impact of mining, it is very
       essential to design carefully and implement the environmental
       management programs in mining areas.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">       It may be concluded that an effective environmental management
       plan can minimize the disturbance of ecological balance and
       environmental problems of the mining area and this vital sector
       can very well survive the onslaught of pollution threat. The
       bauxite mining site may be transformed into lush green forest
       after few years of mining which may become more valuable and
       beautiful than earlier forest in the original land".</blockquote><p id="p_160">

MLs granted in the past over large extent of area even in luxuriant forests and

ecologically highly sensitive areas including that of mines sanctioned to

HINDALCO &amp; BALCO, decades ago, before the advent of <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_13">Forest (Conservation)

Act</a> and Environmental laws in the country and without conducting EIA study and

before the concept of 'Sustainable Development' came into prominence, lead to

unscientific and indiscriminate mining causing immense damage to the local

ecosystem besides degrading the land and creating air and water pollution.



</p><p id="p_162">28.     As seen from the above, the basic concept of Biosphere Reserves and their

constitution and as per the guidelines issued in this regard by the MoEF the focus

is on environmental stability, biodiversity monitoring and management,

restoration of ecological balance of the disturbed areas and improve the livelihood

opportunities/standards of local people in consonance with local practices.

Therefore it is clear that management of BRs may be not just for protection but for

sustainable utilization of natural resources which may include mining. BRs

recognize that quality economies require quality environments and that

conservation is important for both.
</p>
<p id="p_163">

</p><p id="p_164">29.    The BR program is entirely voluntary. Ownership of the property and

authority over land and water use does not change when a BR is designated. A BR

does not create any new regulations and does not restrict the rights of citizens. In

BRs, nature is not isolated from man, but it is conserved through using it. Hence,

they are places where livelihood is sustained.

and sharing the results; more importantly to combine many different approaches

in a vast diversity of policy and management fields, towards a balanced

relationship between mankind and nature and total banning of commercial

activities in the Buffer and Transition Zones on mere presumption that these

activities cause further damage to the biodiversity may not be an appropriate

proposition.
</p>
<p id="p_167">


</p><p id="p_168">31.    Provisions have to be made to integrate aspects of biodiversity protection

and commercial activities in the BRs critically assessing the sustainability,

accompanied by a set of related quantitative, qualitative or descriptive attributes.

These attributes when measured or assessed periodically, should indicate the

direction of change for each aspect of sustainable management of natural

resources especially in the present state of increase of anthropogenic pressure.



</p><p id="p_169">32.    The activities that are permitted in BRs vary from one BR to other and even

within the same BR and blanket banning of such activities simply because they

are taken up in the BR is not plausible. If we do not understand what it is that we

are trying to protect and what activity we have to allow just because that the

activity is located in a BR then it will be impossible to maintain a rationale for

protection.
</p>
<p id="p_170">[




</p><p id="p_171">33.    It is a fact that mining and biodiversity conservation have historically been

in conflict. But we need to recognize that nature and development have to

complement each other as they are interdependent. There is a need to optimize

how these inter‐dependencies can play out in perpetuity at a landscape level.

Bauxite mining activity may not be necessarily inconsistent with the maintenance

 of the integrity of the BR particularly if they are combined with measures to

strengthen protection of these areas from other threats.


</p><p id="p_172">34.    Although mining and other related industries impact negatively on

biodiversity and communities, both directly and indirectly, they can make a

significant contribution to sustainable development when environmental, social,

and corporate governance issues are effectively managed. Where residual impacts

of mining are unavoidable, the technology must be developed in such a way that

they can be offset through careful Environmental &amp; Social Impact Assessment

procedures and the impacts can be completely avoided or mitigated or atleast

minimized as all impacts on areas of biodiversity value need careful planning and

management plans appropriate to the level of impact or protection and mining

under question in the Buffer/Transition zone of AABR can be regulated

accordingly if they are permitted based on the Landscape plan on the principle of

sustainable development though avoidance and direct mitigation of potential

negative impacts should be at the forefront of planning.



</p><p id="p_173">35.    Within a Buffer Zone or Transition Zone fragile areas vulnerable for threats

to damage to ecology require more rest and commercial activities including

mining have to be completely stopped or controlled as per the Landscape plan.

Thus it cannot be said in general that activities like mining shall be totally banned

when such areas falling in the Buffer Zone or Transition zone are not notified as

PA or ESZ under the law and they can't be compared with the regulations that are

applicable to PAs which are notified under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

sometimes these sites fall in the areas which act as vital ecological corridor links

and therefore, they must be protected to prevent isolation of fragments of

biodiversity, shall also be taken into account and if justified, it requires

reconsideration of permitting the mines.

       taken by the Government were in pursuance of urgent needs of

       needs and that of the environment is an enduring one, since if
       environment is destroyed for any purpose without a compelling
       developmental cause, it will most probably run foul of the
       executive and judicial safeguards. However, this Court has often
       faced situations where the needs of environmental protection have
       been pitched against the demands of economic development. In
       response to this difficulty, policy makers and judicial bodies across
       the world have produced the concept of "sustainable
       development". This concept, as defined in the 1987 report of the
       World Commission on Environment and Development (Brundtland
       Report) defines it as "Development that meets the needs of the
       present without compromising the ability of the future generations
       to meet their own needs". Returning to the Stockholm Convention,
       a support of such a notion can be found in Paragraph 13, which
       states:

        and coordinated approach to their development planning so as to
       ensure that development is compatible with the need to protect and
       improve environment for the benefit of their population.

       Subsequently the Rio Declaration on Environment and
       Development, passed during the Earth Summit at 1992, to which
       also India is a party, adopts the notion of sustainable development.

       judicial balance of both these concepts would not permit undue
       significance being attached to either of them at the cost of the
       other. The concept of sustainable development in essence admits to
       balance the scale between the quantity of development and the
       quality of environment. The earlier school of thought was that
       development and ecology are opposed to each other but with the
       passage of time and development of law, this concept has
       undergone a tremendous change and is no longer acceptable and
       now prevails the doctrine of 'sustainable development'. The
       principle of sustainable development takes within its ambit the
       Application of the 'principle of proportionality' and the
       'precautionary principle'. In other words, one must, while
       permitting development, not only ensure that no substantial
       damage is caused to the environment but also take such preventive
       measures which would ensure no irretrievable damage to the
       environment even in future on the premise on intergenerational
       equity. All these principles have to be examined and applied on the
       touch stone of "reasonable person's test''. As already indicated, we
       are a developing country, and therefore, have to take somewhat
       liberal approach towards development but certainly not by
       compromising the environmental interest. The precautionary
       principle can be explained to say that it contemplates that an
       activity which poses danger and threat to environment is to be
       prevented. Prevention is better than cure. It means that the State
       Governments and the local authorities are supposed to anticipate
       and then prevent the causes of environmental degradation. The
       likelihood of danger to the environment has to be based upon
       scientific information, data available and analysis of risks.
       Ecological impact should be given paramount consideration and it
       is more so when resources are non-renewable or where the end
       result would be irreversible. The principle of precaution involves
       anticipation of environmental harm and taking measures to avoid
       it or to choose the least environmentally harmful activity. Again it
       is based on scientific uncertainty.
