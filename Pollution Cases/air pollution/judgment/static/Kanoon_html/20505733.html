        DATED THIS THE 15th DAY OF MARCH, 2012

                        J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     W.P (c) No.1941/2012 is filed challenging Exts.P4 and

P6 notices issued by the Secretary of the 1st respondent

Panchayat directing stoppage of the functioning of a

workshop owned by the petitioner, which is conducted in a

building bearing No.2/111, situated within the limits of the

1st respondent panchayat. Averments are to the effect that,

the industry was established as early as in the year 1987 on

obtaining permission from the 1st respondent as per Ext.P1.

The 4th respondent had purchased the property situated on

the backside of the workshop compound, about 11 years

back, and thereafter he had approached the petitioner for

purchasing the property of the workshop also, with a view

to have road frontage for his residential house. Since the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(c) Nos.33006/2011 &amp; 1941/2012 -2-</span>


petitioner had not yielded for such a demand, he started

submitting vexatious complaints before various authorities.

He had filed a civil suit against the petitioner seeking

fixation of boundary and praying for consequential

prohibitory injunction. But the suit was dismissed and the

appeal filed by the 4th respondent is now pending.

According to the petitioner, the 4th respondent is thereafter

causing hindrance to the functioning of the workshop by

making repeated complaints before respondents 1 to 3. On

an earlier occasion the 2nd respondent had issued direction

to the petitioner to take several measures to prevent the

alleged noise pollution, against which the petitioner had

approached this court in W.P (c) No.26162/2008. The said

writ petition was disposed of directing the 1st respondent to

permit the petitioner to function the workshop and to give

time to comply with the conditions and measures suggested

by the 2nd respondent. According to the petitioner all such

measures were complied with and the 2nd respondent had

issued consent, under the provisions of Air (Prevention and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(c) Nos.33006/2011 &amp; 1941/2012 -3-</span>


<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. But again on the basis of

frivolous complaints submitted by the 4th respondent, the 2nd

respondent had issued Ext.P2 notice on 11-04-2011. The

petitioner had submitted a detailed reply to Ext.P2, before

the 2nd respondent. In the meanwhile the 1st respondent had

issued Ext.P4 notice directing stoppage of the workshop on

the ground that 2nd respondent had issued Ext.P2. Inspite of

detailed reply submitted under Ext.P5, the 1st respondent

had issued further notice as per Ext.P6 directing abrupt

stoppage of the workshop. Subsequently the 1st respondent

had refused to renew the licence stating the reason that

the petitioner should obtain renewal of consent from the 2nd

respondent. According to the petitioner all the measures

suggested by the 2nd respondent had already been complied

with and the attitude of respondents 1 and 2 in not

permitting the petitioner to function the workshop is totally

malafide and is only due to the undue influence of the 4th

respondent. Hence the petitioner is seeking to quash

Exts.P4 and P6. Inter alia he is seeking directions against

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(c) Nos.33006/2011 &amp; 1941/2012 -4-</span>


respondents 2 and 3 to take further steps on the basis of

inspection to be conducted.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. W.P (c) No.33006/2011 is filed by the 4th respondent

in W.P (c) No.1941/2012. Grievance voiced is to the effect

that, inspite of repeated notices issued by the 1st respondent

panchayat directing stoppage of the workshop, illegal

operation of the workshop is continued. Hence direction

was sought for against respondents 1 to 3 to take effective

measures to stop such illegal functioning.

</p><p id="p_3">      3. From the materials available in both these cases it

is evident that, with respect to the alleged nuisance and

pollution, the authorities of the Pollution Control Board had

conducted various inspections and suggested remedial

measures. Admittedly the consent to operate issued was

valid only upto 30-11-2011 and the same has not been

renewed.       According      to  the  petitioner in  W.P  (c)

No.1941/2012 the application for renewal of the consent

was submitted within the time before the Pollution Control

Board. In the statement of the Senior Environmental

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(c) Nos.33006/2011 &amp; 1941/2012 -5-</span>


Engineer, State Pollution Control Board it is mentioned

that, on the basis of complaint of the 4th respondent, an

inspection was conducted as early on 12-06-2008. Since the

measures taken were not seen adequate, the petitioner was

directed to provide certain control measures, through the

notice issued on 19-06-2008. Since such measures were not

complied with the Board had refused to consent through

the letter issued on 04-07-2008, and the Secretary of the 1st

respondent panchayat was directed to cancel the licence

issued, vide letter dated 23-07-2008. Thereafter the unit

was inspected on 20-12-2008 and it was found that the

measures have been provided by the petitioner. Accordingly

consent to operate was issued to the unit on 24-12-2008 as

per Ext.R1. But during the year 2009 another complaint was

received and an inspection was conducted. Directions were

issued on 21-03-2009 for strict compliance of the conditions

stipulated in the consent. On the basis of further complaint

received from the 4th respondent yet another inspection was

conducted on 17-03-2009. During that inspection it was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(c) Nos.33006/2011 &amp; 1941/2012 -6-</span>


found that there exist a gap between wall and roof of the

building and part of the works in the workshop is being

conducted outside the unit. It was also noticed that about

40% of the false ceiling was seen removed. Hence a further

show cause notice was issued on 11-04-2011 as per Ext.R3

(Ext.P2 in W.P (c) No.1941/2012). It is stated that even after

Ext.P2, during an inspection conducted on 06-06-2011, it

was found that the workers were cutting steel flats outside

the unit. Therefore a further notice was issued on 18-01-

2012 directing to take full control measures.

</p><p id="p_4">      4.      Learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P (c)

No.1941/2012 submitted that, all the measures which will

be suggested by the Pollution Control Board will be

complied with immediately. It is complained that the last

notice mentioned in the statement filed by the Pollution

Control Board (notice dated 18-01-2012) has not been

received by the petitioner.        I take note of the fact that at

present there is no valid consent granted by the Pollution

Control Board and there is no valid licence granted by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">W.P.(c) Nos.33006/2011 &amp; 1941/2012 -7-</span>


1st respondent grama panchayat. The petitioner is not

entitled to conduct the workshop without renewal of the

consent and licence. It is evident that the Pollution Control

Board had refused renewal of licence on the premise that

the petitioner       has not fully complied with the remedial

measures suggested. I am of the view that a direction to the

petitioner in W.P (c) No.1941/2012 to comply with all the

remedial measures and a further direction to the authorities

of the Pollution Control Board to take a decision after

conducting inspection, will suffice to meet the ends of

justice. If the petitioner obtain renewal of consent, the

panchayat can be directed to take decision on the question

regarding renewal of licence in a time bound manner.

</p><p id="p_5">      5. Under the above mentioned circumstances the writ

petitions are disposed of directing the petitioner in W.P (c)

No.1941/2012 to take effective steps to comply with all the

measures suggested by the Pollution Control Board and to

submit a report of such compliance to the 2nd respondent, at

the earliest possible. The 2nd respondent will conduct an

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">W.P.(c) Nos.33006/2011 &amp; 1941/2012 -8-</span>


inspection at the site, on receipt of such report, within a

period of two weeks from the date of receipt of such report.

On the basis of such inspection the 2nd respondent shall take

a decision on the question of renewal of consent to operate,

without any further delay thereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6.     If the petitioner is granted renewal of the consent

by the Pollution Control Board, he will be at liberty to

produce the consent before the 1st respondent. On receipt of

the renewal of consent, the competent authority in the

1st respondent shall consider the question regarding

renewal of licence, after affording opportunity of personal

hearing to the petitioner as well as to the 4th respondent. A

decision by the competent authority in the panchayat shall

be taken without any delay, on the petitioner submitting the

renewal of consent.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      7.     In order to facilitate the petitioner to comply with

the measures suggested by the Pollution Control Board and

to obtain renewal of the consent and the licence,

implementation of Exts.P4 and P6 shall be kept in abeyance

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">W.P.(c) Nos.33006/2011 &amp; 1941/2012  -9-</span>


for a period of two months from today. However, it is made

clear that the petitioner shall not continue functioning of

the unit thereafter, unless he obtained renewal of the

consent and the licence, as directed above.
