JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR (CHAIRPERSON):


</p><p id="p_33">     The State of Himachal Pradesh is mostly mountainous

nestling in western Himalayas, neighbouring Tibet and China

in the east, Jammu and Kashmir in the north and north-west,

Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand in the south.             It has a

geographical   area   of   55,673   square   kilometres    with   a

population of 6.1 million and is located at altitudes ranging

from 350 to 7000 meters (1050 feet to 21,000 ft.). The forests

of Himachal Pradesh constitute about 2/3rd of the State's

geographical area; are storehouse of rich biodiversity, vital in

preserving the fragile and sensitive Himalayan ecosystem and

are the primary source of livelihood of the residents. The

recorded forest area is 36,986 sq.km. as per the Forest Survey

of India report for the year 2011, which is 66.43% of the total

geographical area and the forest cover spreads over 14,679

sq.km.
</p>
<p id="p_34"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                  4</span>
</p><p id="p_35"> 2.   One of the most significant gifts of nature to mankind in

the wide Himalayan range is Rohtang Pass at a height of

13,500 feet above the sea level. The satellite spots of major

tourist destination at Manali in the north-western Himalayas

are mostly spread in snow (environment) and include Rohtang

Pass, Marhi, Kothi, Salang Nala apart from other spots.


</p><p id="p_36">3.   This tourist spot is termed as the 'Crown Jewel' of

Himachal Pradesh.     It attracts a large number of tourists.

Heavy tourism, besides being a boon to the economy of

Himachal Pradesh, is also the cause for adverse impacts on

ecology and environment of the State. Diverse and devastating

impacts are attributable to unregulated and heavy tourism,

overcrowding, misuse of natural resources, construction of

buildings and infrastructure, littering of waste and other

activities associated with tourism. The characteristics of these

tourism spots are unique and are very vulnerable i.e. their

ecology   and   environment    can   be   subjected   to   rapid

degradation because of the above activities.      The negative

impacts of tourism can only be managed effectively if they

have been identified, measured and evaluated. These effects

could be direct or indirect.   Direct impacts are caused by

presence of tourists and indirect impacts are by infrastructure

created and services required in connection with tourism

activities. The tourist spots to the north of Manali township

have an influx of around 11 lakh visitors annually.        These


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                               5</span>
 sites have a crucial and strategic role in governing the ecology

as well as the atmospheric conditions influencing the local

environment and economy of the area. The major ecological

components are the cleanliness condition, amount and quality

of water in the streams, land's proneness to erosion, physical

load bearing capacity of the land surface and the state of flora

and fauna etc.      While the atmospheric components are

ambient air quality status, diurnal and seasonal fluctuations

in the atmosphere, rainfall and snowfall conditions ultimately,

in a collective form, influence the atmosphere as well as the

agriculture and water resources based activities throughout

this valley.    As per the report of the Expert Committee

constituted by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh, vide order

dated 12th October, 2010, nearly 10,000 persons visit this

tourist spot and nearly 3600 (75% taxis) go to the Rohtang

Pass per day in the months of May and June, every year,

which number is continuously increasing.          The available

amenities and facilities for tourists within the township are

becoming insufficient and thus, the carrying capacity of these

amenities and facilities have virtually crossed its physical and

ecological limits. Over-construction, increased vehicular traffic

and associated air pollution and its impact on snow caps

owing to unregulated tourism remain the notable impacts. As

per the available data, the highest construction rate was

recorded during 1980-85 at 2850 per cent followed by 161.1

per cent during 1990-95. It has also been reported that nearly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                6</span>
 87.3 per cent of the total vehicles plying on Rohtang Pass

belong to tourists.   Remaining small percentage of vehicles

going to Lahaul Valley consists of goods vehicles transporting

eatables and other essential materials. It needs to be noticed

that the only entrance to Lahaul Valley is the Rohtang Pass.

Such natural picnic spots being connected by roads in the

Himalayan region lead to these areas being over-pressurized.

The ambient air quality, due to high number of vehicles on the

top of these mountains, also gets polluted and traffic

congestion adds to it. The two snow points in the Himalaya,

Rohtang Pass (3938 m) in the north-western Himalaya and the

famous Hindu shrine-Badrinath (3133 m) in the central

Himalaya are the headwater regions which can be approached

directly by road. The snow cover is a source of recreation for

the visitors. However, as an adverse impact of heavy tourism,

there has been a considerable fall in the amount of snowfall

received by the region. It is reported that snow recorded at

Kaylong (3064 m.) in Lahaul &amp; Spiti district in the north-

western Himalaya, which is ahead of Rohtang, is reduced by

357 per cent, i.e. from 685 cm in 1990 to 150 cm in 2000.

The Parbati Glacier in the Kullu Valley of Himachal Pradesh

has been receding at the rate of 52 metres per year based on a

study from 1990 to 2001. Based on another study conducted

by the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, Black Carbon,

mostly produced by burning of agricultural waste and

vehicles, is being seen as the major causative factor for rapid
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                              7</span>
 melting of glacier in the Himalayan region. Black Carbon is

primarily unburnt fuel that travels from warmer to colder

areas through air, settles on glaciers and makes them melt

and is believed to be the biggest contributor to global warming

after Carbon Dioxide.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">4.   The study suggests that 40% of the glacial retreat could

be attributed to Black Carbon impact and hence Black Carbon

emission reduction can lead to near term impact on warming

and thus reduce glacier melting.      As per the latest reports

available, as a country, India emits 534 kilotons of Black

Carbon annually with major contributions from domestic

usage, burning of crop residues, sugar industry, dung cake

burning, vehicles, brick kilns, steel industry and power plants.

Dust and Black Carbon from forest fire also accelerate melting

of snow and glaciers in the Himalayas. This is because black

colour absorbs all colours of light. The light absorbed by the

black material interacts with atoms and molecules and

converts the light energy into heat energy. This heat energy

accelerates melting of glaciers. The increasing congestion in

the form of mass tourism in and around Rohtang Pass affects

the topographic fragility and ecological delicacy of this area. It

affects the ambient air pollution levels in and around that

area. The Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) Matter below 100

µ in size, particulate matter (PM10) below 10 µ in size,

particulate matter (PM2.5) below 2.5 µ in size, Black Carbon


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                 8</span>
 (about 0.5 µ in size) monitored at Kothi village, on the way to

Rohtang Pass for the period 2010-2012 suggests that highest

ever TSP was observed to be 388.0 µg m-3 on June 6, 2010

followed by 382.8 µg m-3 on July 8, 2009 which indicates that

during certain time, TSP level remains above permissible limit.

This could be either due to high influx of vehicles or outside

transported aerosols. The monthly maximum average value of

TSP at Kothi was 138.4 µg m-3 in May 2011 indicating above

permissible limit in the month again which coincides with

tourist influx period. The highest ever value recorded for PM10

was 62.4 µg m-3 in May 2011 indicating that it is within

national highways. Over-loaded trucks are a perennial menace

on   the   transport   infrastructure.   Even    though    Indian

Government has issued a blanket ban on over-loading on

vehicles on highways across the country, but still the ground

reality is that majority of the trucks are over-loaded. Research

has indicated that increase in the gross weight, at which a

vehicle operates, will increase its fuel consumption. Much less

obvious is the precise relationship between payload and fuel

economy. Higher emissions from vehicular traffic directly

increase the damage to environment, particularly to glaciers at

high altitudes. So far, the authorities have not specified the

standards for fuel consumption for trucks and heavy duty

vehicles. Other countries like Japan have already introduced a

system for standarisation of fuel consumption for heavy duty

vehicles. The US, Europe and China have contemplated the

implementation of laws and standards for fuel consumption

for trucks. Heavy vehicular traffic and particularly over-loaded

heavy duty vehicles cause serious pollution, resulting in

adverse impact on ecological and environmental zones.

 tremendous increase in the number of trucks and other

vehicles for tourists and local population, being plied on these

routes. Another serious impact of increased vehicular traffic in

these areas is on the wild animals living along the traffic

routes. These include walking or running away from vehicles.

Many wild animals including birds show "high response" to

vehicles. Increase in number of vehicles coincides with

decrease in walking activity and vice versa. The vehicles are

interfering with the animal activity and their mobility in

particular. In some sections, even survival of the animals is

affected. Curiosity on the part of tourists to approach the

animals too closely is another additional factor interfering with

their other activities such as searching for prey, mating and

seeking cover. Vehicular noise may disturb many animals in

their routine activities including breeding behaviour, which

may affect the sustenance of ecosystem

a worrisome factor in the highly sensitive ecological zones in

the State. Forest Survey of India reports show shrinkage of

 linked, an underlying cause seems to be the debilitating

decline in moisture regimes in the hills. Himalayas are one of

the youngest mountainous regions of the world. Its ecosystem

is most fragile, sensitive and susceptible. The catchment areas

of most of the rivers originating in Himalayas lie in Himachal

Pradesh. Inter alia, the causes having a direct impact on

Himachal     Pradesh's     environment         are   deforestation,

uncontrolled and unsustainable grazing, soil erosion, siltation

of dams and reservoirs, industrial and human wastes, forest

6,000 metres. The National Highway-21 closely aligned along

the Beas River, is the most affected stretch where slopes tend

to give way following human disturbance and heavy monsoon

RIGHT TO WHOLESOME AND DECENT ENVIRONMENT


</p><p id="p_47">11. The citizens of the country have a fundamental right to a

wholesome, clean and decent environment. The Constitution

of India, in terms of <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_1">Article 48A</a>, mandates that the State is

under a Constitutional obligation to protect and improve the

environment and to safeguard the forest and wild life in the

country. By 42nd Amendment to the Constitution, the

Parliament, with an object of sensitizing the citizens of their

duty, incorporated <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_2">Article 51A</a> in the Constitution, inter alia,

requiring a citizen to protect and improve the natural

environment including the forests, lakes, rivers and wild life

and to have a compassion for living creatures. The legislative

intent and spirit under Articles 48A and 51A(g) of the

Constitution find their place in the definition of 'environment'

under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 (for short the

'Act of 1986'). The legislature enacted various laws like the Air

giving wide dimensions to the laws relating to protection and

improvement of environment. It is true that Part III of the

Constitution   relating   to   Fundamental   Rights    does    not

specifically devote any Article to the Environment or protection

thereof per se. However, with the development of law and

pronouncement of judgments by the Supreme Court of India,

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_9">Article 21</a> of the Constitution has been expanded to take

within its ambit the right to a clean and decent environment.


</p><p id="p_48">12. The risk of potential harm to the environment and

human    health   resulting    from   development     should   be

considered by somewhat tilting the balance in favour of the

environment and in the larger public interest. According to "a

reasonable person's test", life, public health and ecology have

priority over unemployment and loss of revenue. Development

and protection of environment are not enemies. Right to a

fundamental right, coupled with an obligation on the part of

the State and the citizens.

 boundaries of fundamental right to life and personal liberty

guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_10">Article 21</a> were expanded to include

environmental protection. The Supreme Court strengthened

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_11">Article 21</a> in two ways. First it required laws affecting personal

liberty to also pass the tests of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_12">Article 14</a> and <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_13">Article 19</a> of the

Constitution, thereby ensuring that the procedure depriving a

person of his or her personal liberty be reasonable, fair and

just. Second, the court recognized several unarticulated

liberties that were implied by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_14">Article 21.</a> It is by this second

method that the Supreme Court interpreted the right to life

and personal liberty to include the right to a wholesome

environment. ("Environmental Law and Policy in India" 2nd

Edition, by Shyam Divan &amp; Armin Rosencranz, Oxford

University Press). This principle was initially explained by the

Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/181685796/" id="a_15">Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra,

Dehradun v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a> (AIR 1988 SC 2187). Even

at the stage of interim order, the Supreme Court articulated

the fundamental right to a healthful environment. <a href="/doc/27930439/" id="a_16">In Virender

Gaur v. State of Haryana</a> [1995 (2) SCC 577], explaining upon

this concept, the Supreme Court observed as under:

          Therefore, hygienic environment is an integral

          Government and the municipalities, not only to
          ensure and safeguard proper environment but
          also an imperative duty to take adequate
          measures to promote, protect and improve both
          the man-made and the natural environment."
</blockquote><p id="p_51">14. The Supreme Court then took the view that the factors

governing the quality of life have been included in the

expression "life" contained in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_19">Article 21</a> by reason of creative

interpretation of the said provision by the Court. It said that

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_20">Article 21</a> does not only refer to the necessity to comply with

procedural requirements, but also substantive rights of a

citizen. It aims at preventive measures as well as payment of

compensation in case human rights of a citizen are violated.

The provisions of law were to be susceptible or vulnerable to

challenge even on the ground of unreasonableness. To

examine the legislative impact of environmental laws, it would

be necessary to ascertain the object which the legislature

seeks to achieve and the intent of the legislature. Where the

statute ex facie points out degradation of the environment and

change of user envisaged by the Constitution, e.g. existing

open space to be used for commercial purposes, it may be

necessary to invoke the 'precautionary principle' and ensure

protection of environment. ("Environmental and Pollution Laws

</p><p id="p_52"> 15. The Courts have consistently taken the view that right to

life includes the right to a decent environment. The right to a

clean environment is a guaranteed fundamental right. The

Courts could even impose exemplary damages against the

polluter. Proper and healthy environment enables people to

enjoy a quality of life which is the essence of the right

guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_21">Article 21.</a> The right to have congenial

environment for human existence is the right to life. The State

has a duty in that behalf and to shed its extravagant

unbridled sovereign power and to forge in its policy to

maintain   ecological   balance   and   hygienic   environment.

Though Government has power to give directions, that power

should be used only to effectuate and further the goals of the

approved scheme, zonal plans, etc. If without degrading the

environment or minimizing adverse effects thereupon by

applying stringent safeguards, it is not possible to carry on

development activity applying the principle of sustainable

development, in that eventuality, development has to go on

because one cannot lose sight of the need for development of

industries, irrigation resources, power projects, etc. including

the need to improve the employment opportunities and the

generation of revenue. So a balance has to be struck. (Durga

Das Basu's "Shorter Constitution of India", 14th edition,

 SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPMENT
AND PROTECTION OF ENVIRONMENT


</p><p id="p_53">16. The significance of environmental protection and the

dimensions of the right to a clean and decent environment has

been the subject matter of various judicial decisions by the

Supreme Court of India. Causing environmental degradation

and disturbing the ecology may even result in impinging upon

the protected fundamental rights of the citizens.    The State

has to, therefore, endure to provide clean and decent

environment    and   ensure    that   its   wholesomeness      is

maintained. In the case of Court on its own motion v. Union of

India JT 2012 Vol. 12 SC 503, the Supreme Court had the

occasion to discuss these aspects in some elaboration

whereupon the Court held as under:

          such right and placed a clear obligation on the
          part of the State to ensure meaningful
          fulfillment of such right. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_24">Article 21</a> of the
          Constitution, with the development of law has
          attained wide dimensions, which are in the

          <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_25">Article 19(1)(d)</a> gives a citizen the right to move
          freely throughout the territory of India. This

 freedom is neither absolute in terms nor is free
from restrictions. <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_26">Article 19(5)</a> subjects this
right to imposition of reasonable restrictions
which the State by law may enact. Such
restriction has to be in the interest of general
public or for the protection of interest of any
Scheduled Tribe besides being reasonable and
within       its      legislative    competence.
</p><p id="p_57"><a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_27">Article 25</a> deals with the Right to Freedom of
Religion, subject to public order, morality,
health and other provisions stated in Part III.
All persons are equally entitled to freedom of
conscience and the right to freely profess,
practice and propagate religion. of course, again
this right is subject to reasonable restrictions
within the ambit of <a href="/doc/555375/" id="a_28">Article 25(2)</a> of the
Constitution. In light of these three Articles,
now we have to examine which rights of the
citizens are being violated and what is the scope
of the present proceedings before the court and
what directions, if any, the court can issue
within the four corners of law. It has
undoubtedly and indisputably come on record
that the rights of yatris to the holy shrine
enshrined under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_29">Article 21</a> of the Constitution
of India, are being violated. There is admittedly
lack of basic amenities and healthcare. The
walking tracks are not only deficient but are
also not safe for the pedestrians. The
management and arrangements for the yatris at
the glacier and near the Holy Shrine are, to say
the least, pathetic. Keeping in mind the number
of yatris who come to pay their homage at the
Holy Shrine every year, the management suffers
from basic infirmity, discrepancies, inefficiency
and ill-planning. The Government of India,
State of Jammu and Kashmir and the Shrine
Board are under a constitutional obligation to
provide free movement, protection and health
care facilities along with basic amenities and
proper tracks to be used by the yatris.
</p>
<p id="p_58">10. Now, we may examine the dimensions of
the rights protected under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_30">Article 21</a> of the
Constitution of India. The socio-economic
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                    19</span>
 justice for people is the very spirit of the
preamble of our Constitution. 'Interest of
general public' is a comprehensive expression
comprising several issues which affect public
welfare, public convenience, public order,
health, morality, safety etc., all intended to
achieve the socio-economic justice for people. In
the case of <a href="/doc/1657323/" id="a_31">Consumer Education and Research
Centre v. Union of India</a> (1995) 3 SCC 42, this
Court while noticing <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_32">Article 1</a> of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 (for short
'UDHR') asserted that human sensitivity and
moral responsibility of every State is that "all
human beings are born free and equal in
dignity and rights. They are endowed with
reason and conscience and should act towards
one another in a spirit of brotherhood." The
Court also observed "the jurisprudence of
personhood or philosophy of the right to life
envisaged under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_33">Article 21</a>, enlarges its sweep
to encompass human personality in its full
blossom with invigorated health which is a
wealth to the workman to earn his livelihood, to
sustain the dignity of person and to live a life
with dignity and equality."
</p>
<p id="p_59">11. Not only this, there is still a greater
obligation upon the Centre, State and the
Shrine Board in terms of <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_34">Article 48A</a> of the
Constitution where it is required to protect and
improve the environment. <a href="/doc/555375/" id="a_35">Article 25(2)</a> of the
UDHR ensures right to standard of adequate
living for health and well-being of an individual
including housing and medical care and the
right to security in the event of sickness,
disability etc. The expression 'life' enshrined in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_36">Article 21</a> of the Constitution does not connote
mere animal existence or continued drudgery
through life. It has a much wider meaning
which includes right to livelihood, better
standard of living, hygienic conditions in the
workplace and leisure. The right to life with
human dignity encompasses within its fold,
some of the finer facets of human civilization
which makes life worth living. The expanded

 connotation of life would mean the tradition
and cultural heritage of the persons concerned.
In the case of Consumer Education &amp; Research
Centre (supra), the Court discussing the case of
<a href="/doc/1510944/" id="a_37">C.E.S.C. Ltd. v. Subhash Chandra Bose</a> (1992) 1
SCC 441) stated with approval that in that case
the Court had considered the gamut of
operational efficacy of human rights and
constitutional rights, the right to medical aid
and health and held the right to social justice
as a fundamental right. The Court further
stated that the facilities for medical care and
health to prevent sickness, ensure stable
manpower for economic development and
generate devotion to duty and dedication to give
the workers' best performance, physically as
well as mentally. The Court particularly, while
referring to the workmen made reference to
Articles 21, 39(e), 41, 43 and 48-A of       the
Constitution of India to substantiate that social
security, just and humane conditions of work
and leisure to workmen are part of his
meaningful right to life.
</p>
<p id="p_60">12. Security to citizens by the State is also a
very sensitive issue. The State has to draw a
careful balance between providing security,
without violating fundamental human dignity.
In the case of In Re: Ramlila Maidan Incident
(2012) 5 SCC 1, the Court observed "the
primary task of the State is to provide security
to all citizens without violating human dignity.
Powers conferred upon the statutory authorities
have to be, perforce, admitted. Nonetheless, the
very essence of constitutionalism is also that no
organ of the State may arrogate to itself powers
beyond what is specified in the Constitution."

     and worship" and to ensure "equality of
     status and of opportunity" and "the dignity

     Constitution says and that is what which
     is elaborated in the two vital chapters of
     the Constitution on Fundamental Rights
     and Directive Principles of the State Policy.
</blockquote><p id="p_62">14. Where it is the bounden duty of the State
to protect the above rights of the citizen in
discharge of its constitutional obligation in the
larger public interest, there the law also casts a
duty upon the State to ensure due protection to
the forests and environment of the country.
Forests in India are an important part of the
environment. They constitute a national asset.
We may, at this stage, refer to the concept of
inter-generational equity, which has been
treated to be an integral part of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_39">Article 21</a> of the
Constitution of India. The Courts have applied
this doctrine of sustainable development and
precautionary principle to the cases where
development is necessary, but certainly not at
the cost of environment. The Courts are
expected to drive a balance between the two. In
other words, the onerous duty lies upon the
State to ensure protection of environment and
forests on the one hand as well as to undertake
necessary development with due regard to the
fundamental rights and values.

that the appropriate balance between different

           required to be done before the State can claim
          that it has discharged its constitutional
          obligation in the larger public interest. In fact,
          the report of the SHPC has accepted the
          existence of lack of facilities, non-availability of
          proper    health     care,    need    for   proper
          management,          providing      of      proper
          passage/walking tracks and finally the basic
          amenities. The report proceeds on the basis
          that much is required to be done by the State
          and the Shrine Board. The State and the Shrine
          Board under the umbrella of the Union of India

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">          "113. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_41">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India
          which provides that no person shall be deprived
          of his right to life or personal liberty, except
          according to the procedure established by law,
          is interpreted by the Indian courts to include in
          this right to life, the right to clean and decent
          environment. Right to decent environment, as
          envisaged under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_42">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of
          India also gives, by necessary implication, the

</p><p id="p_68">          Right to clean environment is a guaranteed
          fundamental right. Various courts, particularly

          226 of the Constitution of India to deal with
          issues relating to the fundamental rights of the
          persons. The courts, in fact, can even impose
          exemplary damages against the polluter. Proper

 enjoy a quality life which is the essence of the
right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_43">Article 21.</a> The State
and the citizens are under a fundamental
obligation to protect and improve the
environment including forests, lakes, rivers,
wild life and to have compassion for living
creatures. Right to have living atmosphere
congenial to human existence is a right to life.
The State has a duty in that behalf and to shed
its extravagant unbridled sovereign power and
to forge in its policy to maintain ecological
balance and hygienic environment. The power
to issue directions and other powers should be
exercised by the State to effectuate and further
the goals of approved scheme, zonal plans, etc.
The hazards to health and environment of not
only the persons residing in illegal colonisations
but of the entire town as well as the provisions
and schemes of the relevant Acts have to be
taken into consideration. The most vital
necessities, namely air, water and soil having
regard to the right to life under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_44">Article 21</a>
cannot be permitted to be misused or polluted
so as to reduce the quality of life of others. Risk
of harm to the environment or to human health
is to be decided in public interest, according to
a "reasonable person's" test. Life, public health
and ecology have priority over unemployment
and loss of revenue. It is often said that
development and protection of environment are
not enemies but are two sides of the same coin.
If without degrading the environment or by
minimising the adverse effects thereupon by
applying stringent safeguards, it is possible to
carry on developmental activities applying the
principle of sustainable development, in that
eventuality, development has to go on because
one cannot lose sight of the need for
development of industry, irrigation resources,
power projects, etc. including the need to
improve employment opportunities and the
generation of revenue. A balance has to be
struck. Courts have exercised the power of
imposing exemplary damages against the
pollutants in order to protect the environment
and to restore the damage done to the
environment as well. In fact, even the
disturbance in the environment by undesirable
sound of various kinds, amounts to noise
pollution. It is a shadowy public enemy whose
growing public menace has increased in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                      24</span>
 modern       age   of    industrialisation    and
technological advancement. Noise has become
one of the major pollutants and has serious
effects on human health. Consistent judicial
opinion in India has recognised the right to live
in freedom from noise pollution as a
fundamental right also, protected under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_45">Article
21</a> of the Constitution. If anybody increases the
volume of speech and that too with the
assistance of artificial devices so as to
compulsorily expose unwilling persons to hear a
noise raised to unpleasant or obnoxious levels,
then the person speaking is violating the right of
others to a peaceful, comfortable and pollution-
free life guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_46">Article 21.</a> Courts
have even held that <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_47">Article 19(1)(a)</a> cannot be
pressed into service for defeating the
fundamental right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_48">Article 21</a>
of the Constitution. Thus, the right of an
individual to healthy and clean environment
including air, water, soil and noise-free
environment is of paramount consideration and
it is impermissible to cause environmental
pollution and particularly in violation of the
prescribed standards. Since the different facets
of environment are relatable to life and human
rights and concern a person's liberty, it is
necessary that resources are utilised in a
planned manner. Wherever industrialisation has
an impact on utilisation of essential resources
like air, water and soil and results in
irreversible damage to environment, then it may
be impermissible to utilise these resources in
that fashion. In the recent times, there has been
accelerated degradation of the environment,
primarily on account of lack of effective
enforcement of laws and non-compliance with
the      statutory      norms.      Concentrated
industrialisation in some pockets has been the
other reason for enhanced damage to the
environment. It emerges from the desire of the
people to operate from the areas where the
industry presently exists. [ References: <a href="/doc/1646284/" id="a_49">Subhash

afore-noticed    have    observed   that   Indian    environmental

statutes chiefly employ a system of licensing and criminal

sanctions to preserve natural resources and regulate their use.

Civil compensation recovered through private citizens' suits

plays a peripheral role in the overall regulatory strategy. The

environmental techniques have been strengthened with the

passage of time.        Referring to the fundamental norms, the

author notices that the Indian Constitution is amongst the few

in   the     world   that    contains   specific    provisions   on

environmental protection.      "The issues of environment must

and shall receive the highest attention of the Supreme Court"

was the approach adopted by the apex Court. The Supreme

Court adopted and applied a range of principles to guide the

development of environment and jurisprudence and noticeably

amongst these fundamental norms, inter alia, were the

following:

their obligations under environmental laws.[<a href="/doc/1980462/" id="a_61">Dr.

(4) The 'polluter pays' principle which is a
part of the basic environmental law of the land
requires that a polluter bear the remedial or
clean up costs as well as the amount payable to
compensate the victims of pollution.[Indian
Council for <a href="/doc/1356184/" id="a_62">Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India</a>

(5) The 'precautionary principle' requires
government authorities to anticipate, prevent
and attack the causes of environmental
pollution. This principle also imposes the onus
of proof on the developer or industrialist to show
that his or her action is environmentally
benign.[<a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_63">Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum v. Union
of India</a> AIR 1996 SC 2715]
(6) Government         development      agencies

obligation of the present generation to preserve

generations an environment as intact as the one
we inherited from the previous generation.[<a href="/doc/1149168/" id="a_64">State

           beneficiary of the sea-shore, running waters,

</p><p id="p_73">19. If one analyses the above principles esemplastic in their

correct    perspective,    what       emerges    from    sustainable

development is that environmental protection cannot be

prescind from the balanced approach. Development may be

permitted but with enforcement of appropriate environmental

conditions and safeguards.        The Polluter Pays principle, the

Precautionary Principle and the Principle of Proportionality

could be applied as facets of the said balanced approach.

Irretrievable damage to the environment is not acceptable.

The legislative intent behind the Act of 1986 evidently

demonstrates this principle. It is a general legislation for

environmental protection, as there were uncovered gaps in

areas of major environmental aspects and hazards in the

existing laws. <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_68">The Act</a> contains regulatory, prohibitory and

punitive   provisions     and   are    aimed    at   preservation   of

DISCUSSION ON POLLUTANT-CONTENTS AND REMEDIES:


</p><p id="p_75">20. It is indisputable that the glacier of Rohtang Pass is

facing serious pollution issues and with the passage of time, is

being degraded environmentally, ecologically and aesthetically.

The time has come when not only the State Government, the

authorities concerned but even the citizens must realize their
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                                    28</span>
 responsibility towards restoring the degraded environment of

one of the most beautiful zones of the country as well as

preventing further damage.
</p>
<p id="p_76">
</p><p id="p_77">21. There are various factors which are responsible for

degradation of environment and ecology in this eco-sensitive

area. Vehicular emission is one of the major contributors to

pollution. The impacts of vehicular pollution would seriously

affect the ambient air quality due to the emission of high

carbon content, Black Carbon, nitrogen oxide (NOx) and

Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM). All these are polluting

the clean and healthy air in that area. Vehicular pollution also

adversely affects the glacier, effects of which are evident in

blackening of snow, melting of glacier and other ecological

disturbances in the glacier. The diesel, commercial and

transport vehicles, which are over-loaded and even other

vehicles - public and private - including two-wheelers which

go to the glacier or pass through the glacier en route to further

destinations, are damaging the glacier.


</p><p id="p_78">22. At present, Bharat Stage-III norms are applicable in

Himachal    Pradesh    whereas    BS-IV    norms    have    been

implemented in 20 cities in the country. Introduction of more

stringent norms in that area, thus, would be desirable. The

vehicular traffic has to be restricted as well as regulated. BS-

IV compliant fuel should be provided. Preferably, CNG or

electrical vehicles should be used for tourism purposes, at

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                               29</span>
 least at the initial stage. Only these vehicles should be plying

on those roads and more particularly the vehicles going to the

glacier for tourism or commercial purposes should be

subjected to regular pollution checks. There should be free

flow of traffic    and   over-loading of vehicles should be

prohibited. The vehicles which are unworthy of plying on such

terrain, should not be permitted to ply, particularly the

vehicles which are more than 10 years' old. Regulated tourism

for source point control of dust and BC emission should be

done. Roads for vehicular traffic should be maintained in a

good condition to achieve the desired results of curbing

vehicular pollution.

    that the vehicles which are permitted and are

    plying on this route, particularly, public and

    private transport, trucks and even the other

    private vehicles, including two wheelers, adhere

    to the prescribed norms of emission. The vehicles

    which are violating or are not in conformity with

    the    prescribed         standards          should     not   be

    permitted to cross the barrier. In other words,

    there should be regular pollution check of

    vehicles plying on that route.
</p>
<p id="p_83">(iii) Irrespective of the fact that the vehicles are in

    possession of PUC, still at the barrier, they shall

    be subjected to random pollution checks. If any

    vehicle      is    not    adhering      to    the     prescribed

    emission norms, it shall not be permitted to ply

    on    that        road.   This   will    equally      apply   to

    Government and private vehicles.

<p id="p_85">(v) CNG or electricity operated buses or other

    vehicles of any kind, which would provide

    incentive to tourism are permitted to ply from

    Vashishta      onwards.      The     Government,

    particularly, the Department of Tourism, shall

    ensure that only CNG or electric operated buses,

    including shuttle or deluxe service for a short

    distance are permitted to ply from Vashishta to

    carbon soot pollution. This could be checked at

    the time of issuing of PUC.

    Mehta v. Union of India</a> [(1998) 6 SCC 63] had

    directed that the vehicles which are more than

    15 years old should not be permitted to ply on

    the roads of Delhi. This was aimed at preventing

    and controlling alarming air pollution levels in

    Delhi. Likewise, the terrain from Manali to

    Rohtang Pass and onwards is a very difficult

    high altitude terrain and the old vehicles are

    bound to cause more pollution there. This area,

    is at a high altitude, eco-sensitive and pollution-

    prone one, thus, there has to be more stringent

    standards and restrictions in that area. Thus, we

    direct that the vehicles which are more than 10

    years' old and plying on this route, shall be

    phased out and should not be permitted to

    operate or ply on the route to Rohtang Pass from

FORERSTS,  DEFORESTATION,                THEIR      IMPACT     ON
ENVIRONMENT AND REMEDIES:
</p>
<p id="p_106">27. As    already   noticed,   forests     of   Himachal   Pradesh

constitute about 2/3rd of the State's geographical area and are

the storehouse of rich bio-diversity, vital in preserving the

fragile Himalayan eco-system and is a primary livelihood

source for rural population. The recorded forest area of

66.43% of the total geographical area is the indicator of the

forestry in the State of Himachal Pradesh. Himalayas are one

of the youngest mountainous regions of the world where the

land mass has not yet found its final form, its eco-system is

most fragile, sensitive and susceptible.

forest, is presently nothing but an area of bald mountains. It

 affecting the environment. Forests play a significant role in

controlling pollution. Trees help to clean the air borne

pollutants such as ozone, NO2, SO2, CO, CO2 and small

particulate matter particularly less than 10 microns in size.

Variety of reasons have led to extinguishment or considerable

reduction   of   forests.   Deforestation,   uncontrolled   and

unsustainable grazing, soil erosion, discharge of industrial

and human wastes, effects of climate change on forests in

Himalayas, excessive tourism, forest fires and human conflict

are inter alia the primary factors, which, with the passage of

time, have reduced the forest cover in qualitative as well as

quanitative terms. It is the absolute need of the hour that

sincere efforts should be made to restore and maintain the

forest areas in the larger interest of environment and public

benefit. The solution lies in the urgent need to ensure that

tourism industry in the State is environmentally benign and

the benefits of decentralization are equally distributed,

particularly to rural and local households.     High density of

traffic in the forest area should be controlled. There is a dire

need for carrying out reforestation activity rapidly and at a

massive scale. Taking adequate and effective measures for

prevention and control of forest fires is also another need of

the hour. Prevention of deforestation along all slopes,

promotion of appropriate cover of trees, shrubs, bushes and

grass would further help to prevent soil erosion. Preservation

</p>
<p id="p_108">
</p><p id="p_109">29. Deforestation      seriously     affects   local      and    regional

climates.   Forests   absorb    more     of    the    sun's     radiation.

Deforestation in the tropics increases surface temperatures,

because grasslands are better reflectors of the sun's energy.

Research has demonstrated that replacement of tropical

forests with grassland increases local air and soil temperature,

decreases evapotranspiration and decreases precipitation. The

warming from a reduction in evapotranspiration more than

compensates for the cooling from the increased albedo.

Temperature decreases because of evapotranspiration, which

is   a    cooling   process,    is   reduced         by    deforestation.

Evapotranspiration is reduced, in part because less radiant

energy is absorbed (more is reflected), in part because

atmospheric turbulence (surface roughness) is greater above a

forest than above a grassland and hence can evaporate water

more rapidly from forests, and in part because the roots of

trees generally penetrate to deeper layers of soil than the roots

of pastures, and hence have access to more water. If less

water is available, the vegetation will respond by closing

stomata     and     thereby    increasing       the       resistance    to

evapotranspiration and increasing temperatures. Preservation

of forested land helps reduce local and regional environmental

variability. The greatest effect that forest management could

<p id="p_113">(iv) It is difficult to do plantation at a height of

    2000 metres and above. The seedlings at this

    height are exposed to several biotic pressures of

    cattle, tourists and villagers, who trample the

    young saplings. Therefore, it is required that all

    the plantations must use fairly tall seedlings

    which have been grown and looked after in

    nurseries at appropriate height at least for a

    period of two to three years, having similar

    climatic conditions such that they could adjust

    or adapt to the harsh climatic conditions.

    moisture     conservation    works         including   bio-

    engineering measures in steep hills. A number of

    plants, particularly chil and kail have thick mat

    of needles on forest floor which make the forests

    vulnerable to frequent fire hazards. Thus, the

</p><p id="p_118">31.     Global warming has a direct impact on environment

and ecology of any zone. Global warming, a succession of hot

summers through the 1980s seemed to bear out the

conservationist's   warning    that   the   earth's   climate   was

warming up. This global warming, if it is indeed the case, is a

consequence of the large quantities of carbon dioxide released

into the atmosphere by industries, power stations and motor

vehicles. The earth's temperature will rise, the polar caps will

melt, raising sea levels and causing catastrophic flooding in

low-lying areas and large areas of productive land will become

desert. This global warming - heat - has affected various

countries in the world. The glaciers on the Mount Blanc were

melting causing slush; the impact of what keeps on happening

in the solar atmosphere and the sun directly affects our

planet, hence, there is a need to tackle global warming.

Environmentalists present a grim picture of the effects of

global warming with the mean temperature of the earth

increased by about 1.6 degree celcius. This is a declaration

made at a Conference of Parties to the Framework Convention

on Climatic Changes. Global warming represents the increase


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                                 44</span>

oceans. (Ref: "Environmental and Pollution Laws in India", 2nd

Edition, supra)


</p><p id="p_119">32.     According to a statistical report from the World

Meteorological Organisation, global temperature has registered

an increase of more than 0.6O celcius in the past 100 years. In

the near future, contamination of underground and surface

fresh water supplies is likely near coastal areas (Ref: Law

Relating to Environmental Pollution &amp; Protection, 5th Edition,

Vol.I, by Dr. N. Maheshwara Swamy).
</p>
<p id="p_120">
</p><p id="p_121">33.     Global warming has its impacts in other parts of the

world, as in the Indian sub-continent. It is likely to affect the

glaciers. There will be early and untimely melting of ice

resulting in various environmental issues. Rohtang Pass being

one of the eco-sensitive and fragile areas of the glacier, is likely

to get affected more than other areas. Thus, there is a need

for evolving schemes and mechanism to take greater care of

the glacier in the interest of environmental and ecological

balance.

<p id="p_122">
</p><p id="p_123">34.     The other relevant principle is the 'Polluter Pays'

principle which can be applied to prevent as well as control

further environmental damage in the area. The 'Polluter Pays'

principle is one which is aimed at ensuring that the costs of

environmental damage caused by the polluting activities are


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                                                  45</span>
 borne in full by the person responsible for such pollution. It is

said that this principle means that the polluter should pay for

the administration of the pollution control system and for the

consequences of the pollution, for example, compensation and

clean up. Under this principle, the Government alone cannot

be held responsible for preventing and controlling the

environmental pollution. If this fiscal incident in its entirety is

shifted to the Government, then it would amount to unduly

burdening the common tax payer, for none of his fault, for

taking anti-pollution, preventive and remedial measures. The

actual polluter, thus must be held liable for the damage done.

This doctrine has been accepted in larger parts of the world as

the fundamental principle on environmental matters and has

been one of the underlying principles for action programme on

the environment.

 the cost of restoring environment and also to remove the

sludge and other pollutants. [Ref: Indian Council for Enviro-

Legal Action and Ors. Vs. Union of India and Ors. supra]. The

Supreme Court held that the person causing pollution by

carrying on any hazardous or dangerous activity is liable to

make good the loss caused to any other person by his activity

irrespective of the fact whether he took reasonable care while

carrying on his commercial or industrial activity. In the light

of these principles, it is clear that the persons who are causing

pollution in the eco-sensitive areas resulting in environmental

hazards must be required to compensate for the damage

resulting from their activity. A large number of tourists and

vehicles which are using the roads and are carrying on such

other activities for their enjoyment, pleasure or commercial

benefits must be made to pay on the strength of the 'Polluter

Pays' principle. It will be entirely uncalled for and unjustified if

the tax payers' money is spent on taking preventive and

control measures to protect the environment.               One who

pollutes must pay. We have already discussed at some length

that   the   high   tourist   activity,   vehicular   pollution   and

deforestation attributable to acts of emission require to be

compensated, restored and maintained in a manner that there

is minimum damage and degradation of the environment.

Such an approach can even be justified with reference to the

doctrine of sustainable development.

<blockquote id="blockquote_21">We are also of the view that this Court
under <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_77">Article 32(1)</a> is free to devise any
procedure appropriate for the particular
purpose of the proceeding, namely,
enforcement of a fundamental right and
under <a href="/doc/1566826/" id="a_78">Article 32(2)</a> the court has the
implicit power to issue whatever direction,
order or writ is necessary in a given case,
including all incidental or ancillary power
necessary to secure enforcement of the
fundamental right. The power of the court
is not only injunctive in ambit, that is,
preventing     the    infringement    of    a
fundamental right, but it is also remedial
in scope and provides relief against a
breach of the fundamental right already
committed vide Bandhua Mukti Morcha

any direction, order or writ in cases where
a fundamental right has already been
violated, <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_79">Article 32</a> would be robbed of all
its efficacy, because then the situation
would be that if a fundamental right is
threatened to be violated, the court can
inject such violation but if the violator is
quick enough to take action infringing the
fundamental right, he would escape from
the net of <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_80">Article 32.</a> That would, to a large
extent, emasculate the fundamental right
guaranteed under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_81">Article 32</a> and render it
impotent and futile. We must, therefore,
hold that <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_82">Article 32</a> is not powerless to

fundamental right has been violated. He
can in that event seek remedial assistance

<p id="p_130">26. In the case of <a href="/doc/1031794/" id="a_85">Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan</a>
(1997) 6 SCC 241, this Court held as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">     Each such incident results in violation of
     the fundamental rights of "Gender
     Equality" and the "Right to Life and
     Liberty". It is a clear violation of the rights
     under       Articles 14, 15 and 21 of       the
     Constitution.      One     of    the    logical
     consequences of such an incident is also
     the violation of the victim's fundamental
     right under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_86">Article 19(1)(g) "</a>to practise any
     profession or to carry out any occupation,
     trade or business". Such violations,
     therefore, attract the remedy under
     <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_87">Article 32</a> for the enforcement of these
     fundamental rights of women. This class
     action under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_88">Article 32</a> of the Constitution
     is for this reason. A writ of mandamus in
     such a situation, if it is to be effective,
     needs to be accompanied by directions for
     prevention, as the violation of fundamental
     rights of this kind is a recurring
     phenomenon. The fundamental right to
     carry on any occupation, trade or
     profession depends on the availability of a
     "safe" working environment. Right to life
     means life with dignity. The primary
     responsibility for ensuring such safety and
     dignity through suitable legislation, and
     the creation of a mechanism for its
     enforcement, is of the legislature and the
     executive. When, however, instances of
     sexual harassment resulting in violation of
     fundamental rights of women workers
     under Articles 14, 19 and 21 are brought
     before us for redress under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_89">Article 32</a>, an
     effective redressal requires that some
     guidelines should be laid down for the
     protection of these rights to fill the
     legislative vacuum.

     the Government of India with a view to
     obtain its recommendations after an in-

     The report of the IRC has been given to the
     Government of India but because of
     certain difficulties in the present context,
     no further action by the executive has
     been possible. The study having been
     made by a Committee considered by the
     Government of India itself as an expert
     body, it is safe to act on the
     recommendations of the IRC to formulate
     the directions of this Court, to the extent
     they are of assistance. In the remaining
     area, on the basis of the study of the IRC
     and     its    recommendations,       suitable

     since this exercise can no longer be
     delayed. It is essential and indeed the
     constitutional obligation of this Court
     under the aforesaid provisions to issue the
     necessary directions in this behalf. We
     now consider formulation of the needed
