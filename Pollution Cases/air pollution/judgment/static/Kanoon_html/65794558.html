    <div CLASS="judgments">
      <div class="docsource_main">Telangana High Court</div>
<div class="doc_title">Smt.Vasumathi P vs The Hdfc Bank Ltd., on 19 September, 2018</div><div class="doc_bench">Bench: U.Durga Prasad Rao</div>

<pre id="pre_1">        HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE U. DURGA PRASAD RAO

                     Writ Petition No.12668 of 2012
ORDER:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioners seek a Writ of Mandamus declaring the action of

respondent-bank in not permitting the 1st petitioner to operate locker

No.153 belonging to Late K.Prabhakaran and requiring the petitioners to

produce legal heir certificate as arbitrary, illegal and consequently direct

the respondent-bank to permit the 1st petitioner to open Locker No.153,

Raj Bhavan Road, Somajiguda Branch, HDFC bank, Hyderabad and take

custody of the contents.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2)    The 1st petitioner is the wife and petitioners 2 to 4 are the children

of deceased--Late K.Prabhakaran. Their case is that Prabhakaran was

working in Motorola India Pvt. Ltd., he died on 14.10.2007 due to

Cardiac failure leaving behind petitioners as his legal heirs. During his

lifetime Prabhakaran opened two Savings Bank Accounts with the

respondent-bank and it was also alleged, he also opened Locker No.153

in the HDFC bank of Somajiguda Branch, Hyderabad. After his death

when the petitioners approached the respondent bank for transferring the

locker in favour of 1st petitioner, for taking custody of the contents

therein, the respondent bank insisted for production of legal heir

certificate. Since Prabhakaran mentioned 1st petitioner as his nominee in

his Savings Bank Account maintained in Kukatpally Housing Board

branch, there was no ambiguity as to her status as his wife and though

this fact was brought to the notice of the respondent, it did not heed.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2</span>


</p><p id="p_4">3)    The petitioners under a mistaken impression that a succession

certificate was required to operate the bank locker, filed C.A.No.25/2008

before the Administrator General, High Court of A.P, Hyderabad. The

Administrator General appointed an Advocate Commissioner, who took

inventory of the articles lying in the locker and assessed their value @

Rs.5,32,350/- and as the value of the articles was more than Rs.2,00,000/-

and exceeding his pecuniary jurisdiction, the Administrator General has

dismissed the application as withdrawn giving liberty to the petitioners to

approach the proper Court. The petitioners later came to know that

succession certificate would be issued only in respect of debts and

securities of the deceased and since the bank locker was not a debt or

security, succession certificate was not required.


</p><p id="p_5">      Hence the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4)    Though notice was ordered on respondent bank but none appeared

on its behalf.   Hence heard learned counsel for petitioners Sri Peri

Prabhakar.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5)    Learned counsel for petitioners would submit that Late

K.Prabhakaran, was a customer of the respondent bank Kukatpally

Branch with Account No.3641000021156 wherein 1st petitioner was

shown as nominee of the account holder. Prabhakaran was also operating

Locker No.153 in respondent bank but he did not nominate anybody.

While-so, the account holder died on 14.10.2007 and when the

petitioners, who are the LRs of the deceased approached the bank
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>


authorities with a request that since 1st petitioner is the wife of the

deceased and his nominee in Savings Bank Account, she may be

permitted to operate the bank locker. The respondent authorities did not

accord permission but insisted for production of legal heir certificate.

Learned counsel would submit that of-late the revenue authorities are not

issuing legal heir certificate and in these circumstances, it is difficult to

produce legal heir certificate and therefore, considering that the 1st

petitioner was already shown as nominee of Late K. Prabhakaran, in his

Savings Bank Account, she may be permitted to operate the bank locker

and receive the articles, whose inventory was made by the Advocate

Commissioner appointed by this Court. He thus prayed to allow the writ

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">6)     The point for determination is:
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">      "Whether there are merits in this writ petition to allow?"


</p><p id="p_14">7)    POINT: The claim of the petitioners is that 1st petitioner is the

wife and petitioners 2 to 4 are the minor children of late K.Prabhakaran

and that he maintained Locker No.153 with the respondent bank is not in

dispute since the respondent has not put up its appearance and filed any

counter. Thus it is clear that the petitioners are the legal heirs of late

K. Prabhakaran. The particulars obtained by the Advocate Commissioner

on the direction of this Court, would show that Prabhakaran maintained

Savings Bank Account No.3641000021156 in the Kukatpally Branch of

respondent bank and he showed 1st petitioner as her nominee in the said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         4</span>


account. However, Locker No.153 maintained by him with respondent

bank is concerned, he did not nominate anyone. Since the petitioners are

his legal heirs and as the 1st petitioner is his wife and nominee in respect

of Savings Bank Account, in the considered view of this Court, the 1st

petitioner is entitled to operate Locker No.153.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">8)     Now the crucial aspects germane for consideration are:


</p><p id="p_17">i)     What are the documents to be produced by the petitioners to enable

       1st petitioner to operate the locker?
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">ii)    Whether a writ direction can be issued against the private bank?


</p><p id="p_20">9)     <a href="/doc/1366481/" id="a_1">Section 45ZF</a> of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 deals with the

procedure relating to the claims in respect of safety lockers where

nomination was not made by the hirers. This Section reads thus:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "45ZF. Notice of claims of other persons regarding safety lockers
      not receivable.--No notice of the claim of any person, other than
      hirer or hirers of a locker, shall be receivable by a banking
      company nor shall the banking company be bound by any such
      notice even though expressly given to it: Provided that where any
      decree, order, certificate or other authority from a court of
      competent jurisdiction relating to the locker or its contents is
      produced before the banking company, the banking company shall
      take due note of such decree, order, certificate or other authority"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">Thus the above Section says that in respect of the claims made by any

person other than the hirer of the locker, the banking company shall

entertain such claims upon production of decree, order, certificate or

other authority from a Court competent jurisdiction relating to the locker.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           5</span>


The bank locker is not a debt or security within the mischief of <a href="/doc/1832934/" id="a_2">Sections

214</a>, <a href="/doc/1494917/" id="a_3">370</a> and <a href="/doc/105862/" id="a_4">372</a> of Indian Succession Act, 1925. <a href="/doc/861192/" id="a_5">In Venugopal Loya

and others v. Vijayalakshmi Bung</a> and another1, it was held thus:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">        "Para 4: The plaintiff filed the suit for a declaration that plaintiff
        No. 1 is entitled to operate the bank's locker that stood in the name
        of his mother, Suguna Bai. Under <a href="/doc/1494917/" id="a_6">Section 370</a> of the Indian
        Succession Act, 1925, a succession certificate can be granted only
        in respect of debts and securities and not for any other kind of
        property. A succession certificate cannot be granted in respect of
        ornaments pledged by a deceased with a bank by way of security for
        the debt which the bank had advanced. It is not a debt due from the
        bank. Also, it cannot be granted in respect of ornaments kept in a
        deposit locker in a bank."</blockquote><p id="p_22">

</p><p id="p_23">         Therefore, petitioners cannot be driven to civil court for obtaining

succession certificate to enable them to operate the bank locker. It is true

that the petitioners may file a civil suit seeking suitable reliefs, however,

it is an expensive and time consuming process. Further, the peculiar facts

of this case are that the deceased did in the year 2007 and the petitioners

prosecuted unfruitful proceedings in C.A.No.25/2008 for some time

before the Administrator General, High Court of Andhra Pradesh,

Hyderabad and later filed the instant writ petition. Therefore, having

regard to the facts and circumstances, it is not apposite to drive the

petitioners at this juncture to file a civil suit. As the petitioners are

admittedly the legal heirs of the deceased--hirer of the locker, in my

considered view, the 1st petitioner on behalf of rest of the petitioners can

be permitted to operate the bank locker upon production of a notarised

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">1</span>
    MANU/AP/0079/1991
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                            6</span>


indemnity bond equivalent to the value of the articles as on the date of

this order, whose particulars are noted down in the inventory made by the

Advocate Commissioner appointed by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">10)       Coming to the maintainability of the writ petition, generally writ

jurisdiction is not exercisable against private banks, private companies

and other private organisations as held by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_7">Federal

Bank Limited v. Sagar Thomas</a> and others2. However, in the said

decision an exception is provided as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        "Para 28: Such private companies would normally not be amenable
        to the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. But in
        certain circumstances a writ may issue to such private bodies or
        persons as there may be statutes which need to be complied with by
        all concerned including the private companies. For example, there
        are certain legislations like the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_9">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, the
        <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_10">Minimum Wages Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_11">Factories Act</a> or for maintaining proper
        environment, say the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
        1981 or the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974
        etc. or statutes of the like nature which fasten certain duties and
        responsibilities statutorily upon such private bodies which they are
        bound to comply with. If they violate such a statutory provision a
        writ would certainly be issued for compliance with those provisions.
        For instance, if a private employer dispenses with the service of its
        employee in violation of the provisions contained under the
        <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_14">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in innumerable cases the High Court
        interfered and has issued the writ to the private bodies and the
        companies in that regard. But the difficulty in issuing a writ may
        arise where there may not be any non-compliance with or violation
        of any statutory provision by the private body. In that event a writ
        may not be issued at all. Other remedies, as may be available, may
        have to be resorted to."</blockquote><p id="p_26">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">2</span>
    MANU/SC/0769/2003 = AIR 2003 SC 4325
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                      7</span>


In the instant case, the grievance of the petitioners is that the respondent

authorities by giving a go-by to the statutory provisions contained in

<a href="/doc/1366481/" id="a_15">Section 45ZF</a> of Banking Regulation Act, directed the petitioners to

produce legal heir certificate, for which no specified authority is

designated. It should be noted that <a href="/doc/1366481/" id="a_16">Section 45ZF</a> of Banking Regulation

Act does not specify legal heir certificate but it only says that the

claimant shall produce decree, order or certificate or other authority from

a court of competent jurisdiction. Since the instruction of the respondent

bank is in violation of <a href="/doc/1450343/" id="a_17">Section 45ZF</a>, a direction in the nature of

mandamus can be issued.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">11)    In the result, this writ petition is allowed and the respondent-bank

is directed to permit the 1st petitioner to operate Locker No.153 hired by

late K.Prabhakaran, upon petitioners producing this order and a notarised

indemnity bond for a sum equivalent to the value as on date to be

estimated by bank appraiser of the articles in the locker whose inventory

was made by the Advocate Commissioner appointed by this Court. The

entire exercise shall be completed within three (3) weeks from the date of

receipt of a copy of this order by respondent. The respondent-bank shall

pay cost of Rs.5,000/- (Rupees five thousand only) to the petitioners.

closed.
