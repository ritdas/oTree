CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE JYOTI SARAN
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 15-12-2017

               Heard Mr. Vinay Mistry, learned counsel for the petitioner,

   Dr. Kamaldeo Sharma, learned AC to GA-11, for the State and Mr.

   Shivendra Kishore, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

   Pollution Control Board alongwith Ms. Binita Singh.

</p><p id="p_15">               The petitioner is aggrieved by the order of the Sub-

   Divisional Officer, Danapur bearing Memo No. 637 dated 4.8.2016

   whereby he has been asked to stop operation of the saw mill run in the

   name and style of M/s H.M.Craft.
</p>
<p id="p_16">               While it is not in dispute that the petitioner has a valid
 Patna High Court CWJC No.20002 of 2016 dt.15-12-2017                            2




        licence under the Bihar Saw Mill (Regulation) Act, 1990 and the

        Rules framed thereunder, it is also true that it is not for violation of

        condition of licence that the purported action has been taken rather it

        is because in the opinion of the authorities of the Pollution Control

        Board acting pursuant to a complaint filed in this regard, the running

        of the saw mill within the residential area and the noise pollution so

        created, was beyond the prescribed limit coupled with the fact that

        even though the petitioner had obtained a 'Consent To Establish'

        order bearing No. T-18089 dated 26.12.2011 which was valid for six

        months and within which period the petitioner was required to obtain

        'Consent To Operate' order, under the provisions of the Air

        (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, but he defaulted with

        the result that the application of 'Consent To Establish' order has

        lapsed rendering operation of the saw mill within the residential area

        illegal, that the orders have been passed. These facts stands pleaded in

        paragraph 6 of the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Board and

        has not been contested by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                     Although it is stated by Mr. Mistry, learned counsel for the

        petitioner, that a fresh application has been filed by the petitioner for

        seeking a 'Consent To Establish' but such argument has been

        contested by Mr. Shivendra Kishore, learned Senior Counsel for the

        Board, to submit that since the saw mill is situated in a residential area
          Patna High Court CWJC No.20002 of 2016 dt.15-12-2017                            3




                 until such time that the petitioner shifts the location of the saw mill to

                 an approved area which is beyond the residential area and is

                 acceptable to the Board, the application cannot be acted upon. He

                 submits that the order under challenge is a mere compliance of the

                 opinion of the Board, who have refused operation of the saw mill in

                 view of the circumstances discussed.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                              Having heard learned counsel for the parties, no cause for

                 indulgence is made out to the orders impugned, in the circumstances

                 noted.
</p>
<p id="p_19">                              The writ petition is disposed of leaving it open to the

                 petitioner to act in accordance with law, if he wishes to run his saw

                 mill.
