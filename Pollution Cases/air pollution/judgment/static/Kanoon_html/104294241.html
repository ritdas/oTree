FOR RECORDS PERTAINING TO THE INQUIRY IN QUESTION
INITIATED BY THE R-3 REFERRED TO IN THE NOTICE
CONTAINED IN ANNEXURE-A UPON THE COMPLAINT MADE BY

SCHEDULE PROPERTY; QUASH THE NOTICE DATED 2.3.2020
ISSUED BY THE R-3 CONTAINED IN ANNEXURE-A HEREIN &amp;
ETC.,

     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS
DAY THROUGH VIDEO CONFERENCE, CHIEF JUSTICE MADE
THE FOLLOWING:
                           ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard the learned counsel appearing for petitioner, the

learned AGA for the first and second respondents and the

learned counsel appearing for third and fourth respondents.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>



</p><p id="p_2">      2. The challenge in this writ petition is to the notice of

proposed directions under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_1">Section 33(A)</a> of the Water

(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_3">Section 31(A)</a>

of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as

well as the Rules framed in both the enactments.


</p><p id="p_3">      3. The grievance of the learned Senior Counsel

appearing for the petitioner is that though the notice may be

styled as a show cause notice, there are conclusions already

recorded in the said notice. He invited our attention to clause 4

of the said notice.   He submitted that though there are no

allegations made by anyone that the construction of new STP

for hostel buildings is in the buffer zone of the concerned lake,

the said finding has been recorded in the impugned notice. He

also submitted that the notice directs the Managing Director of

BESCOM to issue necessary direction for disconnection of the

power supply to the hostel and STP. He submits that a fresh

inspection will have to be carried out.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      4. From the last paragraph of the impugned notice, it is

apparent that it is a show cause notice calling upon the

petitioner to show cause as to why a direction to close the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4</span>



operation of the hostel building and STP should not be issued

on the ground that the STP is in the buffer zone of Mylasandra

lake.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">        5. As stated in the writ petition, on 17th March 2020 the

petitioner has submitted a detailed reply.    A     very    drastic

action of closure is proposed to be taken. Therefore, it is

necessary for the third and fourth respondents to give

opportunity of being heard to the petitioner.       At the time of

hearing, it will be open for the petitioner to contend that the

conclusions recorded in the show cause notice are completely

erroneous.     We must make it clear that the conclusions

recorded in the impugned show cause notice will have to be

treated as tentative findings, as Annexure 'A' is a show cause

notice and not a final order. Moreover, it will be open for the

petitioner to call upon the third respondent to make one more

inspection on the site, especially, in the light of the assertion in

the show cause notice that the STP of hostel building is in the

buffer zone of the said lake. Whether the said structure is

within the buffer zone is a matter of physical verification.

Therefore, there will not be any prejudice to both the parties, if
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    5</span>



a fresh inspection is carried out in presence of the

representatives of the petitioner for ascertaining whether the

STP for hostel building is in the buffer zone of the said lake.


</p><p id="p_8">           6. Hence, we need not keep the petition pending and in

the light of the discussion made above, we dispose of the

petition by passing the following:
</p>
<p id="p_9">                                ORDER

</p><p id="p_10">   (i)       We direct the third respondent to grant opportunity of
             being personally heard to the representative of the
             petitioner on the impugned notice at Annexure 'A';

</p><p id="p_11">   (ii)      The observations made in the impugned notice are
             tentative observations and it will be always open to
             the petitioner to contend at the time of hearing that
             the observation regarding the location of the STP is
             erroneous;
</p>
<p id="p_12">   (iii)     If a request is made by the petitioner for inspection
             and survey, as observed earlier, for ascertaining the
             truth, the third respondent may consider of ordering a
             fresh survey before final order is passed;

</p><p id="p_13">   (iv)      After giving an opportunity of being heard to the
             petitioner, after considering the reply filed by the
             petitioner and after considering the fresh survey
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                         6</span>



              report, if any, appropriate order shall be passed by
              the third respondent within a period of three months
              from today;
</p>
<p id="p_14">      (v)     Needless to add that, the direction issued to the
              Managing      Director,       BESCOM   to   withdraw   the
              electricity supply to the hostel and STP shall not be
              acted upon till final order is passed;
</p>
<p id="p_15">      (vi)    If order passed by the third respondent be adverse to
              the petitioner, the same shall not be acted upon for a
              period of one week from the date of the service of the
              said order upon the petitioner;
</p>
<p id="p_16">      (vii)   We make it clear that we have made no adjudication
              on any factual controversy involved in the petition and
              all issues are kept open to be decided after hearing
              the petitioner.
