Writ Petition No. 135 of 2013 was placed before the Court for orders

from carrying out any construction of the sugar factory in respect of

land Gat No. 195 to 197 of village Aashti without placing on record

other permissions which are required to be taken from the Director

(Sugar), Maharashtra State.         It was also observed that only after

obtaining all the permissions / certificates required for construction of

sugar factory, Audumbarraoji may apply to this Court for obtaining

permission for reconstruction of work. On the same day, i.e., on 14 th

August       2013,       Audumbarraoji   made    an     application         to     the

Commissioner of Sugar for grant of certificate authenticating change

Commissioner            of     Sugar   certified   that   the     distance       between

Audumbarraoji's proposed sugar factory in Gat No. 195 of village

Aashti is more than 15 kms from the existing sugar factories.

application bearing No.1758 of 2013 in Writ Petition No.135 of 2013

for vacating the ad-interim relief granted on 14 th August 2013 on the

ground that the certification as required, has been obtained by it.

then, the same has to be granted and there is no discretion left with

the Commissioner of Sugar / Authority as to in whose favour such

certificate should be granted.    In support of his submissions, Mr.

Thorat contended that for the purpose of obtaining the aerial distance

certificate from Commissioner of Sugar, one is required to have with

him aerial distance authentication certificate issued by the Surveyor

General of India; and Lokshakti applied for the same on 6 th February

2009 and the Surveyor General of India issued such authentication

certificate on 2nd March 2009, confirming the distance between the

Lokshakti and neighbouring sugar factories as more than 16 kms. and

with this certificate, on 6th March 2009 Lokshakti applied to the

Commissioner of Sugar for obtaining the aerial distance certificate for

the purpose of submission of IEM with the Central Government. Mr.

Thorat contended that application of Lokshakti was first in point of

time, as prior to this there was no application for the same area. He

however conceded that for the same area there was one IEM granted /

acknowledged in favour of Audumbarraoji [earlier name Gopalkrishna

Sakhar Karkhana Limited].      He further submitted that Lokshakti's

application for aerial distance certificate being the only application,

the Commissioner of Sugar ought to have granted the same

immediately. The commissioner of Sugar without any reason issued

public notice dated 26th March 2009 and invited objections for the

grant of aerial distance certificate in favour of Lokshakti and in

pursuance of this notice, Audumbarraoji by its objection dated 13 th

April 2009 objected to the grant of aerial distance certificate to

Lokshakti. He submitted that Audumbarraoji took objection to grant

of aerial distance certificate to Lokshakti on the false ground that it

had also applied for the same certificate with the Commissioner of

Sugar and the same was pending.      Mr. Thorat contended that by the

order dated 25th November 2009, the Commissioner of Sugar in view

of the interim order passed by this Court on 12 th July 2006 [in PIL No.

20 of 2006], rejected the applications of both, Lokshakti and

Audumbarraoji, for grant aerial distance certificate. However, since

this interim order was subsequently modified on 21st January 2010,

both Lokshakti and Audumbarraoji filed applications with the

Commissioner of Sugar to consider their earlier applications for aerial

distance certificate. The grievance of Mr. Thorat is that the application

of Audumbarraoji for aerial distance certificate was granted on 24 th

February 2010 without inviting objections, relying upon their earlier

application [dated 29th March 2007] for the aerial distance certificate

and thereafter by the order dated 12 th/19th July 2010 rejected

application of the Lokshakti for the aerial distance certificate.



</p><p id="p_32">6.                  Mr. Walawalkar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for

Audumbarraoji opposed these petitions very vehemently. He did not

seriously dispute the proposition of Mr. Thorat that aerial distance

certificate should be granted to the Applicant first in point of time. He

however submitted that Audumbarraoji's application for the aerial

distance certificate was made in the year 2007, the objections were

also called for by issuing public notice by the Commissioner of Sugar;

the application for such certificate by Lokshakti was much later, i.e., in

the year 2009, to which Audumbarraoji has taken objection. It was,

therefore, the submission of Mr. Walawalkar that the Commissioner of

Sugar was justified in granting the aerial distance certificate to

Audumbarraoji and refusing the same to Lokshakti.

              in the matter of measurement of distance from an
              existing sugar factory and the proposed sugar factory.
              Clause-B lays down the requirements for filing the
              Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum. Before filing
              the Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum with the
              Central Government, a proposed sugar factory need to
              obtain a certificate from the Commissioner of Sugar
              that the distance between the site where he proposes
              to set up a sugar factory and adjacent existing sugar
              factories and new sugar factories if any is not less than
              the minimum distance prescribed by the Central
              Government or the the State Government, as the case
              may be. The certificate to be issued by Commissioner
              of Sugar has to be in conformity with the certificate
              issued by Survey of India as the said authority is vested
              with the power to determine the minimum distance. If
              that be so, then it is obvious that the Commissioner of
              Sugar, while issuing a certificate under clause 6-B(1)
              only performs a ministerial act of issuing a certificate in
              consonance with the certificate issued by Survey of
              India. If that be the position, we have no iota of doubt
              that as the Survey of India has already issued a
              certificate in favour of the present Petitioner that the
              Petitioner's proposed sugar factory is at a distance of 27
              Kms. from the existing sugar factory of Respondent No.

objections on 13th April 2009. Both these applications, i.e., application

made by Audumbarraoji and application made by Lokshakti were

rejected in view of the order dated 12th July 2006 passed in PIL No. 20

of 2006.        This order was subsequently modified and the private

factories / karkhanas were permitted to apply for the aerial distance

certificate. Thereafter both Lokshakti and Audumbarraoji relying upon

their old applications, made applications on 12th February 2010 and

24th February 2010 respectively, for the grant of aerial distance

certificate and the Commissioner of Sugar granted the aerial distance

certificate to Audumbarraoji and rejected the application of Lokshakti

for grant of aerial distance certificate.

application dated 29th March 2007 for aerial distance certificate was by

one Gopal Krishna Sakhar Karkhana Limited and Audumbarraoji is a

different entity who used these documents for its benefit and

therefore        aerial        distance   certificate     granted        in      favour       of

Audumbarraoji by Commissioner of Sugar was erroneously granted.

Mr. Thorat in this regard also pointed that after the modification of

interim order in PIL No. 20 of 2006, on 10 th February 2010 Lokshakti

filed     an     application       for    aerial   distance       certificate        whereas

Audumbarraoji filed application for the same purpose on 24 th February

2010; the application of the Lokshakti was therefore prior in point of

time and it could not have been rejected. We do not find merit in the

submission of Mr. Thorat. Firstly, change of name of Gopal Krishna

Sakhar Karkhana Limited to Audumberraoji Sakhar Karkhana Limited

was legal under the authority of Registrar of Companies.                                 Gopal

Krishna Sakhar Karkhana Limited and Audumbarraoji are one and the

same entity and this fact is admitted by Lokshakti in paragraph "J" on

Page no.22 of Writ petition No. 6799 of 2010.

applications for grant of aerial distance certificate.           In short, both

karkhanas claimed aerial distance certificate relying upon their old

applications. Lokshakti having requested Commissioner of Sugar to

grant application dated 6th March 2009, then, surely they cannot take

objection to the Commissioner of Sugar acting on Audumbarraoji's old

application dated 29th March 2007 which is certainly prior in point of

time to Loakshakti's application.

out that aerial distance authentication certificate was granted to

Audumbarraoji on 28th July 2009. We have perused this certificate

which is annexed at page No.134 of Writ Petition No. 6799 of 2010.

This certificate is issued by Survey of India authenticating the aerial

distance between Audumbarraoji's proposed sugar factory and other

sugar factories set up during the period between 2007 to 2009.

Audumbarraoji was required to obtain this certificate as during the

period between 2007, i.e., when the first application for aerial distance

certificate was made and 2009 when one Shree Sant Kusumdas

Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Limited came into existence and distance

between Audumbarraoji and said Shree Sant Kusumdas Sahakari

Sakhar Karkhana was required to be certified. This aerial distance

certificate, in our view, will relate back to Audumbarraoji's earlier

application dated 29th March 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_46">                    To sum up, even if Mr. Thorat's contention that

Applicant first in point of time must be granted aerial distance

certificate is accepted, in that case also we find that Audumbarraoji's

application for aerial distance certificate was filed on 29 th March 2007

and the application of Lokshakti for such certificate was filed on 6 th

March 2009. We also find that in response to the public notice issued

in pursuance of Audumbarraoji's application for aerial distance

certificate,      not     a    single   objection   was    received.          However,

Audumbarraoji raised objection to the grant of aerial distance

certificate to Lokshakti in response to public notice issued by the

Commissioner of Sugar on 26th March 2009. In the backdrop of above

discussion, we are of the view that the Commissioner of Sugar was

justified in granting aerial distance certificate to Audumbarraoji and

refusing the same to Lokshakti.              And therefore we find that these

petitions have no merit.

the IEM is given that he will not take effective steps in the two years

has not taken all effective steps within the period of two years as per

the provisions of Clause 6A of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966, the

IEM in their favour has automatically derecognised and becomes

inoperative. He submitted that mandatory period of 2 years for taking

effective steps by Audumbarraoji was already over on 25 th February

2012. Thereafter on 9th April 2013, first interim order was passed in

Writ Petition No.135 of 2013. This interim order was subsequently

revived by another Division Bench on 10 th May 2013. He submitted

that in any case the interim stay granted by this Court against

Audumbarraoji does not result in stopping of running of time,

therefore, even the period of 4 years contemplated for commencing

the commercial production has elapsed on 25 th February 2014.                  To

factory at the location different than the location mentioned by the

Survey of India. We have perused the said Circular. The circular

mentions that in some cases, the Karkhana / factory is not constructed

in the Gat Number for which the aerial distance certificate is given.

That will result in the breach of provisions of Sugarcane Control Order,

1966. It is further provided by the said circular that it is binding on the

sugar factories who wish to undertake crushing season for the first

time, having already obtained aerial distance certificate, to get

admeasured from the office of Survey of India, the aerial distance

between its factory and other existing factories and ensure that

longitude and latitude of its factory tallies with the longitude and

latitude mentioned in the aerial distance certificate.

crushing season was obliged to obtain required certificate from the

Office of Survey of India. In that view of the matter, in our view, the

may, such certificate is given by the Commissioner of Sugar vide its

gat number. It only mentions village Aasthi. The IEM was on the basis

of aerial distance certificate by the office of Survey of India between

Gat No. 699 of village Ashti and other existing karkhanas. There was

difficulty in the way of Audumbarraoji in acquiring this Gat No.699 and

thereafter they purchased land bearing Gat No.195 to 197 in the

Audumbarraoji on 25th February 2010, the intimation was given to the

Director of Sugar New Delhi on 3rd May 2010 about the change of

location of Audumbarraoji's factory from Gat No. 699 to Gat Nos. 195

to 197. This is permissible in the light of provisions of Press Note No.

7 of 1998.
</p>
<p id="p_61">

</p><p id="p_62">21.                 The question is whether such change in the location is

permissible. Audumbarraoji in this regard relied upon the Press Note

No. 7 of 1998.             We have perused the same.         In the beginning

paragraph, it is mentioned that many of entrepreneurs have

represented to the Government that since the IEM once filed is not

serviced for amendment thereafter, they face hardships in case after

initial filing of the IEM, the project parameters like location, the name

of company, the items and capacities proposed to be manufactured

undergo change, as a result of which for the same investment

proposal, they have to file multiple IEMs. The Central Government in

the light of above observations, decided that IEM filed in the new form

made effective from 1st July 1998 and notified through Press Note No.

4 of 1998 dated 15th June 1998 would be amended/modified as per the

requests of the entrepreneurs.          Mr. Anturkar, the learned Senior

Counsel also seriously did not dispute that the change of location is

permissible. However, he submitted that such application for change

of location has to be treated as an application for fresh IEM. This

submission cannot be accepted in the light of language of Press Note

No.7 of 1998, under which the amendment / modification in the IEM

was allowed to remove hardships of the entrepreneurs to file multiple

IEMs. Naturally, the change of location of factory would relate back to

the date of IEM. We have arrived at this conclusion especially when in

the present case though Gat Numbers are changed, both are in the

same village in respect of which the IEM is granted and even aerial

distance certificate is granted in favour of Audumbarraoji in

compliance with amended Sugarcane Control Order, certifying that

distance between Audumbarraoji's factory and other existing factories

location. We are also supported by the decision of Division Bench of

this Court in Khandoba (supra).    In that case, M/s. Mahavir Sugar

Works on 10th January 2006 applied for the amendment to the IEM

dated 12th October 1998. It was prayed that name of the IEM holder

be amended from M/s. Mahavir Sugar Works to Jaywant Sugars of

India. The Government of India amended the IEM by its letter dated

12th January 2006 in the name of Jaywant Sugars Limited. On 16 th

Department of Industrial          Development, Government of India, for

further amendment in its IEM so as to correct location of village

Dhavadwadi of the proposed sugar factory. It was contended that the

location of village Dhavadwadi of the proposed sugar factory was

correct but the name of tehsil was wrongly mentioned in the IEM

registered on 12th October 1998 and amended on 12 th January 2006.

The Division Bench held that the modification and substitution in the

acknowledgement dated 12th January 2006 was to be treated as a fresh

IEM registered in favour of Jaywant for the first time and the

acknowledgment dated 20th March 2006 was validly granted but it shall

operate from 12th January 2006.

Collector's report dated 26th June 2013 in order to arrive at conclusion

that permissions required under the relevant laws are obtained by

Audumbarraoji and the commissioner of sugar also relied upon the

spot inspection dated 27th August 2013 by Tahsildar, Mohol, which

disclosed       that     Audumbarraoji   has   purchased        machinery         and

by Audumbarraoji within the stipulated time.                   Mr. Anturkar's

submission in this regard that effective steps are required to be taken

at Survey No. 699 and not at Gat No. 195 to 197 cannot be accepted

commence commercial production within the period of four years

from the date of acknowledgement of IEM. He submitted that since

the period of four years was completed on 25 th February 2014 and

admittedly Audumbarraoji has not started commercial production, the

Court in Sukumar Khot (supra) is also misplaced. In Sukumnar Khot

this Court was considering the provisions of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_4">Land Acquisition Act</a>,

1894.      In that case, the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_5">section 4</a> of the Land

Acquisition, 1894 was issued on 20th September 2004 and declaration

under <a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_6">section 6</a> was made on 23rd June 2005 within the time

prescribed by <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_7">section 6</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The petition

was filed on 25th September 2006 challenging this declaration under

<a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_8">section 6</a> and by the order dated 21 st March 2016, declaration made

under <a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_9">section 6</a> was quashed and set aside and matter was remanded

back to the Collector for completing the enquiry under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">section 5A</a> of

the said Act. Subsequent to this order, fresh hearing was given to the

Petitioner under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">section 5A</a> and fresh declaration under <a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_12">section 6</a> was

issued on 10th August 2006. This declaration was objected to on the

ground that same is beyond the statutory period of one year.                 The

Division Bench relying upon the decision of the Apex Court in Padma

Sundara Rao vs. State of Tamil Nadu 4 held that the period prescribed

for issuance of declaration under <a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_13">section 6</a> cannot be extended and

the subsequent declaration is clearly beyond the prescribed period.

must also consider Mr. Anturkar's submissions that the Director

(Sugar) is not the authority which issues the IEM and therefore

application for change of location cannot be made to him and there is

no provision for change of location in the IEM. He supplemented this

contention by submitting that it was obligatory on the part of

Audumbarraoji to obtain fresh aerial distance certificate from the

Commissioner of Sugar subsequent to the change of location of its

factory. This submission, in our view, is also without any substance.

Regarding the provision of change of location, we have already

observed that it is permissible under the Press Note No. 7 of 1998. We

have also held that in the present case application for change of

location will relate back to the date of acknowledgement of IEM. So

far as the Competent Authority with whom the change of location

Sugarcane Control Order, 1966 or the various press notes issued by

the Central Government. In any case, the Petitioner himself relied

upon the Circular of the Commissioner of Sugar dated 17 th September

2012 under which change of location is to be certified by the

commissioner of sugar while giving permission for the first crushing

season and such certification is made on the basis of aerial

authentication certificate by the Commissioner of Sugar under the

impugned order. In the light of discussion made hereinabbove, we do

not find any merit either in the Public Interest Litigation No. 23 of

acknowledgement of IEM, especially when the aerial distance

certificate is also taken by Audumbarraoji in respect of land Gat Nos.

of the order of this Court has given a report to this Court that required

mandatory permissions are obtained by Audumbarraoji, we accept the

same and we do not propose to interfere with the same in exercise of

our jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_23">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. It is

pertinent to note that none of the Petitioners herein has challenged

the said report of the collector either by adopting appropriate

proceedings taking exception to the said report nor they have

amended the extant petitions so as to raise challenge to the said

report. We, therefore, do not find any merit in these petitions.

Audumbarraoji. These Petitioners, in our view, have no locus and they

cannot be said to be aggrieved parties. The issue of locus of aggrieved

party has been explained by the Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1749406/" id="a_24">Jasbhai

Motibhai Desai v. Roshan Kumar5</a>. In paragraph 34 and 35, the Apex

Court has held thus :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">               "34.             This Court has laid down in a number
               of decisions that in order to have the locus standi to
               invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_25">Article 226</a>,
               an applicant should ordinarily be one who has a
               personal or individual right in the subject matter of
               the application, though in the case of some of the
               writs like habeas corpus or quo warranto this rule is
               relaxed or modified. In other words, as a general rule,
               infringement of some legal right or prejudice to some
               legal interest in hearing the petitioner is necessary to
               give him a locus standi in the matter........."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">               35.            The expression "ordinarily" indicates that
               this is not a cast-iron rule. It is flexible enough to take
               in those cases where the applicant has been
               prejudicially affected by an act or omission of an
               authority, even though he has no proprietary or even
               a fiduciary interest in the subject- matter. That apart,
               in exceptional cases even a stranger or a person who
               was not a party to the proceedings before the
               authority, but has a substantial and genuine interest in
               the subject matter of the proceedings will be covered
               by this rule. ...................."

<p id="p_103">35.                 In our considered opinion, the above decision of the
