BY THE COURT :</pre>



<p id="p_1">             Acting upon the direction given by the District

Administration, Jodhpur, the Jodhpur Vidhyut Vitran Nigam

Limited    disconnected       electric     supply       available    to   the

petitioner    firm    which     is   having      business    of     printing,

dyeing,    bleaching    and     washing     of   cloths.     The    District

Administration,       Jodhpur    instructed       the     Jodhpur     Vidhyut

Vitran Nigam Limited to disconnect electric supply to the

petitioner in pursuance to the directions said to be given

by the National Green Tribunal, New Delhi, Circuit Bench at

Jodhpur.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">             The     writ   petition       giving    challenge       to   the

disconnection of the electricity supply preferred by the

petitioner came to be dismissed by learned Single Bench by

order impugned dated 29.5.2015 by observing as under:-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          -2-</span>


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "Having considered the submissions and after
              perusal of the material placed on record, it is
              apparent that the respondents have acted pursuant
              to the direction issued by the NGT by its order
              dated    27.11.2014,   wherein  the    District
              Administration of Jodhpur was directed to stop
              illegal operation of washing, Grey/Printed Cloth
              received from Pali and Balotra with immediate
              effect and when despite the order admittedly on
              the   date,  the  action   was  taken   by  the
              respondents, the petitioner was carrying on
              activities in contravention of the directions
              issued by the NGT.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              In view of the above, in case, the petitioner
              wants any relief qua the action taken by the
              respondents pursuant to the directions dated
              27.11.2014 issued by the NGT, the petitioner has
              to approach the NGT."</blockquote><p id="p_4">



</p><p id="p_5">              In    appeal,       the   argument         advanced       is    that   the

National      Green        Tribunal      never          directed        the    District

Administration, Jodhpur for taking any action to the extent

of     closing      down    business         of    the     petitioner         firm    by

disconnecting electricity supply. Without prejudice to the

above, it is also stated that even as per the respondents

the    disconnection         of    electricity           supply        was    made   for

violation of the provisions of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as

'the    Act   of    1974'),       however,        the    Act     aforesaid      nowhere

empowers      the     District      Administration               to     instruct     for

disconnection        of     electricity           supply.      This      argument    is

substantiated with the aid of <a href="/doc/81392085/" id="a_2">Section 33-A</a> of the Act of

1974, according to which the power to give directions for

stoppage      or     regulation         of     supply       of        electricity    is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          -3-</span>

available to the State Pollution Board and that too after

adhering the procedure given under the Act of 1974 itself.

It   is    asserted       that     learned       Single          Bench    failed       to

appreciate that disconnection of the electricity supply was

wholly     without       jurisdiction          and,     therefore,         the      writ

petition     could        have     not     been        dismissed          being       not

maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">             Per contra, as per learned counsel for respondent

Collector, Jodhpur, the action was taken by the Jodhpur

Vidhyut    Vitran     Nigam      Limited       under       instructions        of     the

District     Administration,         Jodhpur          on    directions         of     the

National Green Tribunal by its order dated 27.11.2014.



</p><p id="p_8">             Heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

             Suffice to mention that before the National Green

Tribunal,    New     Delhi,       Circuit       Bench       at    Jodhpur      certain

Original Applications were filed agitating a common cause

about pollution of river Jojari, the peripheral river of

Jodhpur City as a result of industrial affluents which are

toxic in nature. The Tribunal by order dated 27.11.2014

issued     certain       interim    directions             including      that      "the

District    Administration may            be    directed          to    stop   illegal

washing     of    Grey/Printed       Cloth       received          from    Pali       and

Balotra immediately to control the discharge of untreated

industrial       waste    water    into     river       Jojari         through      RIICO

drain".
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">             From     perusal      of     the     directions           given     it    is

apparent    that     that   National       Green       Tribunal         directed      the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                          -4-</span>

District Administration, Jodhpur to stop illegal washing of

Grey/Printed          Cloth   received        from    Pali       and    Balotra.       No

authority was given to the District Administration, Jodhpur

by the National Green Tribunal to instruct Jodhpur Vidhyut

Vitran    Nigam       Limited    to    stop    electricity            supply    to    the

petitioner       or    any    other     firm    that     may      be    involved      in

illegal washing of Grey/Printed Cloth received from Pali

and     Balotra.       The    petitioner       firm    is        indulged      in     the

business    of     printing,        dyeing,     bleaching         and       washing    of

cloth and may be receiving cloths from stations other than

Pali and Balotra. The disconnection of electricity supply

shall close down work of the petitioner firm relating to

washing of cloths for other stations also. The District

Administration,         Jodhpur,       therefore,      had       no    authority      to

issue    instructions         for     disconnection       of      the       electricity

supply.      The        authority       available           to        the      District

Administration, Jodhpur under the orders of National Green

Tribunal is only to the extent of restraining the person/

establishment/firm/company from washing printed/grey cloths

received from Pali and Balotra. The measures required to be

taken for that purpose must be different than to order for

disconnection         of     electricity       supply.      It     shall       also    be

appropriate to mention that if the District Administration,

Jodhpur found the petitioner guilty of any act that may

amount to violation of the provisions of the Act of 1974,

then the appropriate course was to make a complaint in this

regard to the State Pollution Board and the State Pollution

Board by acting upon that would have initiated process to

stop electricity supply as prescribed under <a href="/doc/81392085/" id="a_3">Section 33-A</a> of

the Act of 1974.

</p><p id="p_13">               For the reasons given above, the impugned action

   of the Jodhpur Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Limited undertaken at

   the instance of District Administration, Jodhpur is without

   jurisdiction, hence is declared illegal. Respondent Jodhpur

   Vidhyut    Vitran    Nigam    Limited      is   directed     to    restore

   electricity connection of the petitioner forthwith.



</p><p id="p_14">               The special appeal is allowed accordingly. The

   acceptance of this appeal shall not prevent the District

   Administration,     Jodhpur   to    take    all   necessary       steps    in

   consonance with the directions given by the National Green

   Tribunal   under    the   order    dated   27.11.2014      and    also    the

   State Pollution Board to take necessary steps to invoke the

   power under <a href="/doc/81392085/" id="a_4">Section 33-A</a> of the Act of 1974.
