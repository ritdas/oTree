<p id="p_1">1.   This is an Appeal preferred by two inhabitants of Jalandhar,

Punjab, challenging the common order dated 14th August, 2012,

passed by the Appellate Authority, constituted under the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (for short, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Act</a>), and

the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short,

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">Water Act</a>), in Appeal Nos. 14 &amp; 15 of 2012. Those were two different

appeals, preferred by Mr. Baldev Raj, (Respondent No. 6) against the

orders dated 18.02.2012 and 09.04.2012 passed by the Punjab

Pollution Control Board (for short, PPCB). The first order, passed by

the PPCB, under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_5">sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_6">22</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, was for refusal to extend the consent to

operate the brick kiln under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air Act</a>. The Second Order was passed

under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_9">section 31</a> of the Air Act giving direction to disconnect electricity

supply and also to District Food and Supply controller (for Short,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                         3</span>
 DFSC) to revoke license of the Brick Kiln of Baldev Raj (Respondent

No. 6).
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.        A brief survey of certain undisputed facts may be taken at the

outset. Baldev Raj (Respondent No. 6) was operating a Brick kiln since

about 1978.The PPCB had issued "consent to operate" order in favour

of Baldev Raj under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">Air Act</a> on 02.09.2003. That consent was valid

till 31.03.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.    The said consent was cancelled on 7.10.2004 on the ground that

Mr. Baldev Raj (Respondent No. 6) was not using 25% of fly ash as per

the mandate of the notification dt. 14.9.1999 as amended on

17.8.2003.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    The notification dt. 14.9.1999 was issued by the Ministry of

Environment and Forests (for Short, MoEF), Government of India,

which mandates that a manufacturer of clay bricks must use at least

25% of fly ash generated from Thermal Power Plants as ingredient of

the bricks. That notification was challenged by way of Writ Petition No.

19398 of 2004 filed before the Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and

Haryana by a group of brick kiln owners. The Hon'ble High Court of

Punjab and Haryana directed the PPCB that no coercive action shall

be taken against the brick kiln owners. The consent for brick kiln of

Mr. Baldev Raj was withdrawn, in the meanwhile, in accordance with

the notification issued by the MoEF.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                       4</span>
</p><p id="p_6"> 5.   The Respondent No.6 again applied for consent which was

granted vide order no.490 dt.17.12.2004 with a validity period up to

16.6.2005. Even after the expiry of the consent to operate i.e from

16.6.2005,the Respondent No. 6 did not apply for grant of consent and

continued to run the Brick Kiln in violation of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_7">6.   The license granted by DFSC (Respondent No. 5), purports to

show that the brick kiln was set up on the land bearing Khasra Nos.

19/4, 16, 24/2 and 25 situated at village Seikhe, Tehsil and District

Jalandhar. The brick kiln in question is now inoperative and closed

down.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.   Briefly stated, the case by present appellant is that though

license was granted by the DFSC to operate brick kiln on a particular

piece of land i.e. khasra Nos. 19/4, 16, 24/2 and 25, yet Baldev Raj is

not exclusive owner of the said land. The land is owned by Co-sharers

including themselves and Baldev Raj. The "consent to operate" was

obtained prior to issuance of the license, in favour of Baldev Raj by the

DFSC. The brick kiln was being operated in the midst of residential

locality of Jalandhar. It is causing air pollution and is detrimental to

the health of the residents of the surrounding area. The brick kiln was

being operated in blatant violation of conditions of the consent granted

by the PPCB as well as the code and practice prescribed in this behalf.

The brick kiln emanated excessive polluted air as the SPM level was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                        5</span>
 found   to   be   much     higher   than   the   prescribed standards   of

500mg/Nm3. Hence, they lodged a complaint against Mr. Baldev Raj to

the PPCB. The PPCB collected stack air samples from the Brick Kiln.

The analysis of such samples was done in Government laboratory

which revealed that the SPM level is much higher than the prescribed

standards. The PPCB issued a Show Cause Notice to Baldev Raj.

Thereafter vide order dated 09.04.2012 the PPCB directed closure of

the brick kiln. The PPCB also gave further directions to disconnect

electricity supply of the brick kiln and to DFSC to revoke the license

granted for the brick kiln.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.    Feeling aggrieved by the said two orders dated 18.02.2012 and

09.04.2012, Baldev Raj, BKO, (Respondent No. 6), preferred two

separate Appeals bearing Appeal No. 14 and 15 of 2012 before the

Appellate Authority constituted under the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of

Pollution) Act</a> 1981 by the Government of Punjab. The Parties were

heard through the Learned Counsel and the appeals were allowed by

the Appellate Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.    Though served, Baldev Raj, BKO, (Respondent No. 6), failed to

appear before this Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.   We have heard learned Counsel. As stated before, Respondent

No. 6, Baldev Raj, BKO remained absent during the hearing. Mr. A. K.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                         6</span>
 Thakkar, learned Counsel appearing for the appellants, argued that

the brick kiln was found to be a polluting unit. He argued that the

stack emission was found to be much beyond the prescribed limit. He

contended that on two occasions, i.e. on 17.2.2011 and 3.2.2012, the

PPCB    collected   samples   from   the   unit   and   found   that   the

concentration of SPM in the stack emission was 780 and 1072

mg/Nm3 respectively against the prescribed limit of 500mg/Nm3. The

Learned Counsel submitted that Baldev Raj (Respondent No. 6) did

not cooperate with the officers of the PPCB while collecting the

samples. He argued that the action of the official PPCB in collecting

and analysing the samples should have been appreciated and

accepted by the Appellate Authority. He further argued that the

credibility of PPCB cannot be undermined by the Appellate Authority.

Finally, he argued that the Appellate Authority should have called

upon the Board to monitor the emission level, including the sampling

and testing procedure in case the consent to operate is again granted

for the brick kiln of Baldev Raj. The Counsel appearing for Respondent

No. 1, 2, 3 and 4 supported the contentions of Learned Counsel, Mr.

A.R. Thakkar.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.    We have perused the relevant documents placed on record. We

have carefully considered the orders of the PPCB as well as that of the

Appellate Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                         7</span>
</p><p id="p_14"> 12.   It appears that the PPCB granted consent to operate the brick

kiln on 27/12/2010. The consent was valid till 23.12.2011. Further it

appears that no further consent was granted by the PPCB to operate

the   brick   kiln.   On    the   basis    of    appellants'   complaint   dated

31/01/2011 the officials of PPCB conducted inspection of the brick

kiln on 17/02/2011. At the relevant time, stack samples were

collected in the presence of Baldev Raj, but he refused to sign on the

container of the samples. The samples were forwarded to Government

approved laboratory for analysis. It was found from the analysis report

that Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) level was 780mg/Nm3.

Obviously,    it   was     much    above        the   prescribed   standards   of

500mg/Nm3.A show cause notice was therefore issued by the PPCB on

14/2/2011 calling upon Baldev Raj (Respondent No. 6) as to why

appropriate action shall not be taken against him for operating the

polluting Brick Kiln unit. Baldev Raj (Respondent No. 6) submitted a

reply to the show cause notice stating that his brick kiln was not

causing any pollution since he had installed pollution control device.

In order to verify the fact situation the officers of PPCB made second

visit to the brick kiln unit of Mr. Baldev Raj (Respondent No. 6). It was

found that the conditions put forth, while granting consent to operate

the unit, were not being complied with by Baldev Raj. So, another

show cause notice was issued to him on 12/10/2011. It appears that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                                8</span>
 Baldev Raj appeared in person before PPCB and requested for another

inspection by a different team. Accordingly, PPCB constituted another

team of officials and the newly constituted team visited the unit of

Baldev Raj on 23/11/2011. The Members of the inspecting team noted

the following deficiencies:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            (i)     Though, a monkey ladder was provided for collecting

                    samples, yet it was not adequate;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            (ii)    The Diesel Generator (DG) set was under operation

                    without providing any canopy;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">            (iii)   Coal crushing machine was not available at site ;
</blockquote>
            (iv)    The approach road was not stabilized.<p id="p_15">


However, the inspection team was not able to collect the samples of

the stack emissions because the brick kiln was not in operation.

Eventually, on 03/02/2012, the stack samples were collected. The

laboratory of State Board analysed the samples and reported that the

concentration of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) level was 1072

mg/Nm3 against the prescribed standards of 500 mg/Nm3 . As a result

of this report the PPCB again issued show cause notice, heard Mr.

Baldev Raj personally and passed orders dated 18/02/2012 refusing

to grant further consent to operate the brick kiln. Another order dated

9th April, 2012, under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_14">section 31</a> (A) of the Air Act, was also issued to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                        9</span>
  stop the operation of brick kiln on account of violation of the

 conditions while granting consent to operate the unit.


</p><p id="p_16">13.     Perusal of the impugned order of the Appellate Authority
revealed that there was confusion in the minds of the members of the
Appellate Authority. The appellate Authority observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">        "The submissions made by the counsel for the appellant and
        record available on the file revealed that the report at Annexure P-
        24 contains cuttings and changes which are not explained. The
        sample was collected on 3.2.2012 but the analysis report revealed
        two different dates of receipt of sample as 4.2.2012 and 9.2.2012
        which itself is contradictory. Moreover, the samples were tested
        on13.2.2012 after the lapse of period of 9 days and the test was
        signed and dispatched on 14.02.2012 but there are cuttings on
        the date of dispatch which could be another date. It seems that
        Board did not follow a transparent procedure while collecting and
        analysing the samples, and did not follow the provisions of <a href="/doc/27292182/" id="a_15">section
        26(3)</a> (d), which prescribe that the person taking the samples shall
        send, without delay, the container or containers to the laboratory.
        The provisions of <a href="/doc/1004117/" id="a_16">sections 26</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1837746/" id="a_17">27</a> of the Air Act have also not
        been complied with."</blockquote><p id="p_17">


</p><p id="p_18">      14.    What appears from the above mentioned reasons, recorded

        by the Appellate Authority, is that the sampling procedure

        adopted by the PPCB was not believed by the Appellate

        Authority. The Appellate Authority did not call for the records of

        the government testing laboratory in order to find out the date of

        receipt of samples and date of testing thereof . The Appellate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                          10</span>
   Authority only quoted <a href="/doc/1446558/" id="a_18">Section 26(3)</a> (d) of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_19">Air Act</a> and opined

  that, it was not duly compiled with. The <a href="/doc/1446558/" id="a_20">Section 26(3)(d)</a> is

  attracted only when the collected sample container is to be

  signed by both the persons, one who is taking the sample and

  other being the occupier of his agent. Thereafter, such samples

  have to be dispatched without any delay, to the laboratory

  applicable only when clause (b), sub-section (4), <a href="/doc/1004117/" id="a_22">Section 26</a> is

  not attracted. The     clause (4)(b) of <a href="/doc/1004117/" id="a_23">Section 26</a> states the

  following:
</p>
<p id="p_20">      "in a case where the occupier or his agent is present at the

  time of taking the sample but refuses to sign the marked and

  sealed container or containers of the sample of emission as

  required under clause ( c) of the sub-section (3), the marked and

  sealed container or containers shall be signed by person taking

  the samples and ........".

<p id="p_21">      When the PPCB came out with a case stating that the sample

  was taken in the presence of Mr. Baldev Raj, who refused to sign

  the container, the version of PPCB could not have been

  discarded by the Appellate Authority. In case of Tatyasaheb Kore

  Warana S.S.K ltd Vs Sharad Baburao Patil, (2011) 12 SCC 543,

   the Apex Court held that the Maharashtra Pollution Control

  Board, being a statutory authority, cannot be disbelieved on

  factual issues of installation of ESPs. In other words, due

  credibility should be given to the act of PPCB when there is

  conflict between the version of a private person and that of

  officials of PPCB. We find that the Appellate Authority did not

  prescribe sufficient reasons to dislodge the findings derived after

  analysis of the samples collected on the two occasions by the

  PPCB. The Appellate Authority passed sweeping remarks while

  discarding the reports of the analysis and findings of the PPCB.

  06.10.1998, a copy thereof is placed on record. This order is

  titled    as   "Punjab   Control   of   Bricks   Supplies,   price   and

  Distribution Control Order, 1998". Clause (3) of the said order

  prohibits manufacturing and selling etc. of bricks without

  licence. It also provides certain norms to be followed at the time

  of granting licence. Clause (5) empowers the District Magistrate

  to refuse the grant or renewal of licence.

   Court of Punjab and Haryana. We are of the opinion that the

  Appellate Authority failed to consider the conduct of Baldev Raj

  (Respondent No. 6) that he was non-cooperative during the

  process of collection of samples by the officials of PPCB. He

  refused to sign containers of the samples and sought inspection

  by separate inspecting party of the PPCB and he did not explain

  why he did not sign the container of the samples. In this way,

  adverse action should have been taken against him. Considering,

  the forgoing discussion, we are of the opinion that impugned

  order of the Appellate Authority is improper, illegal and

  unsustainable. The matter does not stop here. The impugned

  order shows that it has been signed and delivered by two

  members of the Appellate Authority. The <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_24">Section 31</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_25">Air

  Act</a> is reproduced below for ready reference.

</p><p id="p_27"> 18.    The Sub-clause (2) of <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_28">Section 31</a> of the Air Act and Sub-

  clause   (2) of <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_29">Section 28</a> of the Water Act make it explicit that

  the Appellate Authority shall consist of a single Member or three

  Members appointed by the State Government. It does not

  mention a two Member Authority to function as Appellate

  Authority. The intention of legislature appears that the decision

  can be taken either by a single Member or by three Members. If a

  decision is taken by single member authority, then it becomes

  final decision of the authority. If it is the decision of a three

  member authority, there is inherent provision to mitigate any

  difficulty arising due to difference of opinion, i.e. if one of the

  members disagrees the opinion of the rest of the two Members

  will prevail and can be treated as a majority decision of the

  Appellate Authority. This is not possible if only two members are

  appointed because if there is a divergence of opinion among

  them, there is no third member to overcome the difficulty. Under

  the above circumstances, the meeting of the authority attended

  by two members is one more reason as to why the impugned

  order is liable to be quashed.

 set aside. It follows that both the orders dt. 18.02.2012 and

09.04.2012, passed by the PPCB, shall be restored and become

operative. The Appeal is accordingly disposed of, with no order

as to costs.
