                                ORAL JUDGMENT
       (Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)


         Date : 12-07-2018

                        This Public Interest Litigation has been filed inter

         alia contending that Respondent No. 10 has established an

         Industrial Unit in the district of Madhubani. Various statutory

         provisions under the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Pollution Control Act</a> are being violated

         and, therefore, environmental issues have arisen and contending

         violation of the Pollution Control Laws and threat to the

         environment at large this writ petition has been filed in public

         interest under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.

</p><p id="p_13">                        After coming into force of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_3">National Green

         Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 and the provisions of <a href="/doc/159242890/" id="a_4">Section 14</a> therein, the

         jurisdiction of this Court to deal with environmental matters

         stands taken away and vested in the Green Tribunal and

         thereafter against the order passed by the Tribunal, the matters

         have to be agitated before the Supreme Court.

</p><p id="p_14">                        However, normally this Court even though would

         not have exercised jurisdiction in such cases, however, as a

         Tribunal has not been constituted in the State of Bihar, in
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12019 of 2018 dt.12-07-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           3/4</span>




         exceptional circumstances, this Court has exercised its

         jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and invoked

         its writ jurisdiction only because a Tribunal is not functional in

         the State of Bihar. However, in this case, we find that an

         exception is not made out, for the simple reason that the matter

         was agitated before the National Green Tribunal in Kolkata.

         Various orders were passed and now it is stated that the

         Pollution Control Board is not taking action as was directed by

         the Green Tribunal and pointing out certain violation, the writ

         petition has been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                        It is stated that the Pollution Control Board has

         issued some letter for closure in spite thereof, the action is not

         being taken, which fact is seriously disputed by the counsel

         representing the Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_16">                        Be it as it may be, once we are convinced that the

         jurisdiction to deal with such matters vests with the National

         Green Tribunal and when we also find that the issue in question

         was already dealt with by the National Green Tribunal, Eastern

         Zone Bench at Kolkata in O.A. No. 164/2016/EZ, we see no

         reason to make any indulgence into the matter. Petitioner, if

         advised, may invoke the jurisdiction of the National Green

         Tribunal, Kolkata and it would be for the Green Tribunal to deal
              Patna High Court CWJC No.12019 of 2018 dt.12-07-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                        4/4</span>




                      with the issue in question and decide the same.

</p><p id="p_17">                                     Apart from the aforesaid, for deciding the issue in

                      question, this Court would be required to interpret the order

                      earlier passed by the National Green Tribunal, Kolkata in O.A.

                      No. 164 of 2016/EZ. The jurisdiction to deal with the same vests

                      solely with the Hon'ble Supreme Court and not with us in view

                      of the provisions of <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_6">Section 16</a> of the Act and, therefore, on this

                      ground also, we see no reason to make any indulgence into the

                      matter.
