JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR (CHAIRPERSON):
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">       In the present Appeal, the following short but interesting

questions of law and public importance have arisen for

consideration of the Tribunal:
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">2.     Whether   on   its   true   construction   and    scope,   a

pelletization plant would fall under Entry 3(a) (Metallurgical

industries) (ferrous and non-ferrous) of the Schedule to the

Environmental      Clearance   Regulations,   2006      (for   short

'Regulations of 2006').
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">3.     Eschew of unnecessary details, the precise facts giving

rise to the present Appeal are that the Appellant is a company

registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 1956 having its Office at



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                   2</span>
 Lotus Corporate Park, Western Express Highway, Goregaon

East, Mumbai. The company is involved in the business of

manufacturing of pellets for the 'stand alone' iron ore

pelletization plant in Orissa. The plant is of 0.6 MTPA

capacity. The company had applied for 'Consent to Establish'

the plant which was granted by the State Pollution Control

Board, Orissa (for short 'the Board') on 17th November, 2008.

Having established the plant and for making it operational, the

company applied for 'Consent to Operate' under the provisions

of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and

the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. The

Board issued 'Consent to Operate' to the company after which

the company started its regular operation. According to the

company, since the year 2010, the Board had been issuing

'Consent to Operate' every year under both the above said

Acts. The consent was last issued on 10th, April, 2013 which

was valid till March, 2014.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">4.    The company had plans of expanding its activity and

enlarging the capacity of the plant from 0.6 MTPA to 2.1 MTPA

and to establish one sponge iron unit, iron ore washery, steel

melting shop and captive power plant. It is the own case of

company that it required Environmental Clearance from the

Ministry of Environment and Forest, New Delhi (for short 'the

MoEF').    Resultantly,       the   company      would     require

Environmental    Clearance      under   the   provisions   of   the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                  3</span>
 Regulations of 2006. It is the case of the company that this

existing pelletization plant was a 'stand alone' plant for which

the company was not required to take Environmental

Clearance. However, in view of the proposed expansion, the

company applied for obtaining Environmental Clearance on

2nd May, 2012 to the MoEF. The Application was placed before

the Expert Appraisal Committee (for short 'the EAC') as

constituted under the Regulations of 2006. While considering

the application of the company, primarily founded on the

expansion programme, the EAC in its meeting held on 10-11th,

June, 2013 observed that even the 'stand alone' pelletization

plant did not have Environmental Clearance under the

Regulations of 2006 and therefore, deferred the consideration

of the proposed expansion. The principal ground for such

deferment was that the existing 0.6 MTPA iron ore pelletization

plant is running without obtaining prior Environmental

Clearance. In the minutes, it was also observed that the

matter should be dealt with by MoEF in accordance with its

Office Memorandum dated 12th December, 2012. These

minutes of the EAC were put on the website of the MoEF from

where the Applicant came to know about the meeting.

Thereafter, the company made a detailed representation to the

MoEF on 24th September, 2013, 7th October, 2013, 7th

November, 2013 and 13th November, 2013. In all these

representations the company put forward different grounds

taking a clear stand that a 'stand alone' pelletization plant


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                               4</span>
 would not be covered under the Regulations of 2006 and the

company was not required to take the stated Environmental

Clearance. In their representation dated 24th September, 2013,

the company also referred to a decision of the MoEF in the

meeting held on 19-20th December, 2013 which had taken a

decision somewhat on similar lines. The relevant extract of the

said minutes reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      1) Ministry may send a communication to all the State
      Pollution Control Boards/ Pollution Control Committees
      stating that the iron ore pellet plants are falls under S.
      No. 3(a) [Primary Metallurgical Industries] under
      category 'A' of the Schedule 3 of EIA Notification, 2006
      and requires Environmental Clearance (EC) from MoEF.
      The iron ore pellet plants which are operating within
      their jurisdiction without obtaining EC may be advised
      to regularize their statutory approvals by applying to
      MoEF for the grant of EC in accordance with the
      procedure stipulated in the EIA Notification 2006 within
      a time frame of six months.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      2) Ministry may take a holistic view regarding
      applicability of EC for the iron ore pellet plants which
      are under operation with the valid consents as there is a
      conflict of opinion regarding applicability of EC for pellet
      plants between SPCBs and MoEF.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      3) Further, action taken against M/s ASL in respect of
      their violation may be viewed by the Ministry as there is
      a conflict of opinion regarding applicability of EC for
      pellet plants between SPCBs and MoEF.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_12">5.   The company took a stand that it has been noticed by

the Committee also that there is a conflict of opinion regarding

applicability of the Regulations of 2006 on iron ore pellet

plants between the State Board and the MoEF. It was also

noticed that even the other State Boards like Chhattisgarh,

Jharkhand etc. have been granting 'Consents to Establish'


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                 5</span>
 and to 'Consent operate' to the 'stand alone' pelletization

plants within their jurisdiction without requiring them to

obtain Environmental Clearance under the Regulations of

2006. Such plants were running for years together. In the case

of the company, it was asked to regularize the said statutory

approvals and take Environmental Clearance in accordance

with the Regulations of 2006 within a period of six months.

The company received a letter dated 12th December, 2013

whereby the company was asked to make their representation

before the 14th EAC to be held on 19th - 20th December, 2013 at

New Delhi. The Company made a representation before the

EAC of the MoEF. During the course of the meeting on 19th -

20th December, 2013, the representative of the company was

informed that no adverse stand would be taken against the

Appellant as the Committee was of the view that there was a

conflict of the opinion regarding inclusion of 'stand alone' iron

ore pellet plant under Entry 3(a) of Schedule to the

Regulations of 2006. The company also received a letter dated

12th December, 2013 which according to the company was

ante dated. Vide this letter, the company was asked to stop

the production in its plant on the ground that the company

had   not   obtained   Environmental    Clearance    under   the

Regulations of 2006. However, this letter was dispatched on

26th December, 2013 and was received by the Appellant on 3 rd

January, 2014. According to the company, the letter dated

12th December, 2013 was in conflict with the assurance given


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                6</span>
 in the EAC meeting that the company would be granted six

months time to take Environmental Clearance in terms of the

Regulations   of   2006.   The   impugned   Order   dated   12th

December, 2013 reads as under:

<p id="p_14">6.   The company thus, is aggrieved from the above Order

dated 12th December, 2013, passed by the Respondents

herein, as well as the decision of the EAC as contained in the

minutes of the meeting dated 19th - 20th December, 2013

wherein    the   company    had     been   called     upon   to    take

Environmental     Clearance   for    the   existing    'stand     alone'

pelletization plant and to stop its production and wherein the

Application for Environmental Clearance with reference to the

Expansion Plan of the company had been deferred.


</p><p id="p_15">7.   While challenging the above stated proceedings and

Orders, the Appellant company also stated that it is ready and

willing   to   obtain   Environmental      Clearance     under      the

Regulations of 2006 as it would be an integral part of the

Expansion Plan that is required to be set up in furtherance to

the proposal submitted by the company. However, the

 company raised the question for consideration of the Tribunal

that if the Expansion Plan is given up by the company and it

continues with the 'stand alone' pelletization plant, whether

the Environmental Clearance under terms of Regulations of

2006 is required or not.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">8.   The legality and correctness of the above Order dated

12th December, 2013 is challenged by the Company before the

Tribunal, primarily on the ground that a 'stand alone' iron ore

pelletization plant is not covered under Entry 3(a) of the

Schedule to the Regulations of 2006. Further, that the process

of pelletization does not amount to/cannot be construed as

primary metallurgical activity in as much as it does not involve

any metallurgical process. Furthermore, according to the

appellant the process of pelletization is a green and clean

process and is an excellent method of consuming iron fines

which were either being exported, or being lost in emissions.

The company calls the process of pelletization as merely an

agglomeration of iron ore by using binding agents as there is

no extraction of metals, no beneficiation and no change in

chemical parameters. Thus, it was not obligatory on the part

of the company to seek Environmental Clearance for their

'stand alone' pelletization plant and the impugned Order

passed by the Respondents is not sustainable in law and is

arbitrary.

</pre><p id="p_20"> 10. From a perusal of the Object and Reasons of the

Environmental Protection Act, 1986 (for short 'the Act of

1986'), it is clear that the legislature noticed that some major

areas of environmental hazard were not covered, that there

existed uncovered gaps in the areas of major environmental

hazards and that there were inadequate linkages in handling

the matters of industrial and environmental safety by the

existing laws dealing directly or indirectly with environmental

matters. It was also a matter of concern for the legislature that

there was rapid decline in environmental quality. Thus, the

legislature felt the need for a general legislation which led to

the enactment of the Act of 1986. <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_6">Section 3</a> of Act of 1986

empowers the Central Government to take all such measures

as it deems necessary or expedient for the purpose of

protecting and improving the quality of environment and

preventing, controlling and abating environmental pollution.

These measures could relate to any or all of the matters stated

under <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_7">Section 3(2)</a> of the Act of 1986. Similarly, <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_8">Section 5</a> of

Act of 1986 which opens with a non-obstante clause but is

subject to the provisions of the Act, empowers the Central

Government to issue directions in writing to any person,

officer or any authority and such person, officer or authority

shall be bound to comply with such directions. The directions

which could be issued are of very wide magnitude including

closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry, operation or

process. It has empowered the Central Government to issue


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                               11</span>
 directions with regard to the stoppage or regulation of supply

of electricity or water or any other service to the industry.

Under <a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_9">Section 6</a> of the Act of 1986, the Central Government,

by Notification in the Official Gazette can make rules in

respect of all or any of the matters referred to in <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_10">Section 3</a> of

the Act. Such rules could provide standards of quality of air,

water, soil, maximum allowable limits of concentration of

various environmental pollutants including noise and also

provide the procedure and safeguards for the handling of

hazardous substances etc. <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_11">Section 25</a> of the Act of 1986 vests

the Central Government with the power to make rules to carry

out the purpose of this Act. Such rules are to be laid before

the Parliament in accordance with the procedure prescribed

under <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_12">Section 26</a> of the Act of 1986. In exercise of the powers

conferred by <a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_13">Sections 6</a> and <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_14">25</a> of the Act of 1986, the Central

Government framed rules, called the Environmental Protection

Rules, 1986 (for short 'the Rules of 1986'). In terms of Rule 5

thereunder,   the   Central   Government    has   to   take   into

consideration the factors stated in Rule 5 (1), while prohibiting

or restricting the locations of industry and carrying on of

process and operation in different areas. In terms of Rules 5(2)

and 5(3)(a), the Central Government is required to follow the

procedure prescribed, before it could put prohibition or

restriction on the location of the industry and carrying on of

processes and operations in an area. It is expected to prepare

a draft notice in that regard, invite objections and after


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                12</span>
 considering such objections, the Government could issue a

final notice, unless following of such procedure is dispensed

with by the Central Government in public interest as

contemplated under Rule 5(4) of the Rules of 1986.


</p><p id="p_21">11. On 18th May, 2006, the Union Cabinet approved the

National    Environmental      Policy   and       the   procedure    in

accordance with which environmental clearances need to be

granted. The Government prepared a draft Notification under

Rule 5 (3) of the Rules of 1986, for imposing certain

restrictions and prohibitions on new projects or activities or on

the expansion or modernization of existing projects or

activities, based on their potential environmental impact being

undertaken in any part of India unless prior Environmental

Clearance    has   been     accorded    in    accordance    with    the

Notification. Copies of this Notification were published and

were made available in the public domain inviting objections

from the public. The objections and suggestions were received

and considered by Central Government whereupon it issued a

final   Notification   as   Regulations      of   2006.   Under     this

Notification, all the projects as specified in the Schedule were

required to take Environmental Clearance. Application for

Environmental Clearance had to be considered and dealt with

in accordance with procedure prescribed in the Regulations of

2006.

<p id="p_22">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                      13</span>
</p><p id="p_23"> 12. As is evident from the very opening paras of the

Regulations of 2006, they were framed primarily with the

intention of preventing and controlling pollution, resulting

from the industrial activity of the scheduled industries and

projects. Potential environmental impacts from such projects

and industries were of prime consideration while dealing with

the applications filed for seeking Environmental Clearance.

The Tribunal has to examine the cumulative impact of the

object of the Act of 1986, the Rules of 1986 and the

Regulations of 2006 while considering the ambit, scope and

meaning of an Entry existing in the Schedule to the

Regulations of 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">13. First and foremost, we must examine as to how an Entry

in a social welfare legislation like the Act of 1986 should be

interpreted and what principles of interpretation are to be

applied while dealing with such an Entry. We may at this

stage refer to a recent judgment of the Tribunal of "Haat

Supreme Wastech Pvt. Ltd. v State of Haryana, 2013 All (I) NGT

Reporter (2) (DELHI) 140", where the Bench of the Tribunal was

concerned with interpreting another Entry of the same

Schedule i.e. Entry 7(d) of the Schedule to the Regulations of

2006-"Common hazardous waste treatment, storage and

disposal facility." It will be useful to notice the following

discussion from the said judgment:
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">      "<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">The Act</a> of 1986 and the rules afore-referred, in
      particular Rules of 1998, are socio-welfare legislations


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                            14</span>
 as they have triple objects: firstly, they are welfare
legislations in as much as they mandate the State to
provide clean and decent environment. Secondly, they
provide for remedies which could be invoked by different
stakeholders and even by any aggrieved person and
thirdly, the consequences of violating the environmental
provisions including punitive actions. Thus, while
interpreting the relevant provisions, these concepts have
to be appropriately considered by the Tribunal. The
object    of     these    provisions   being   wholesome
environment, the rule of reasonable constructions in
conjunction with the liberal construction would have to
be applied. While dealing with a social welfare
legislation, the provisions and the words therein are to
be given a liberal and expanded meaning. Of course,
liberal construction does not mean that the words shall
be forced out of their natural meaning but they should
receive a fair and reasonable interpretation so as to
attain the object for which the instrument is designed
and the purpose for which it is applied. Both the object
and purpose of an Act in relation to its application are
thus, relevant considerations for interpretation. The
Courts have also permitted departure from the rule of
literal construction so as to avoid the statute becoming
meaningless or futile. In the case of <a href="/doc/27215/" id="a_16">Surjit Singh v.
Union of India</a> (1991) 2 SCC 87 and Sarajul Sunni
Board v. Union of India AIR 1959 SC 198, the Supreme
Court has also held that it is not allowable to read
words in a statute which are not there, but where the
alternative allows, either by supplying words which
appear to have been accidentally omitted or by adopting
a construction which deprives certain existing words of
all meaning, it is permissible to supply the words. It is
also a settled cannon that in case of a social or
beneficial legislation, the Courts or Tribunals are to
adopt a liberal or purposive construction as opposed to
the rule of literal construction.
</p>
<p id="p_28">These well-known principles of interpretation have to be
applied, but with caution. Construction favorable to
achieve the purpose of enactment but without doing
violence to the language is of paramount consideration.
In the case of <a href="/doc/712469/" id="a_17">Shivaji Dayanu Patil &amp; Anr. v. Vatschala
Uttam More</a> (1991) 3 SCR 26a, the Supreme Court while
dealing with a beneficial provision of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_18">Motor Vehicles
Act</a>, 1939 held as under:
</p><p id="p_29">"It is thus evident that <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_19">Section 92-A</a> was in the nature of
a beneficial legislation enacted with a view to confer the
benefit of expeditious payment of a limited amount by
way of compensation to the victims of an accident


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                        15</span>
       arising out of the use of a motor vehicle on the basis of
      no fault liability. In the matter of interpretation of a
      beneficial legislation the approach of the courts is to
      adopt a construction which advances the beneficient
      purpose underlying the enactment in preference to a
      construction which tends to defeat that purpose."

</p><p id="p_30">            The doctrine of reasonable construction implies
      that the correct interpretation is the one that best
      harmonizes the words with the object of the statute.
      Lord Porter in Bhagwan Baksh Singh (Raja) v Secretary
      of State, AIR 1940 Privy Council 82, stated: "right
      construction of the Act can only be attained if its whole
      scope and object together with an analysis of its wording
      and the circumstances in which it is enacted are taken
      into consideration." The Tribunals will also keep in mind
      that the application of a given legislation to new and
      unforeseen things and situations broadly falling within
      the statutory provisions is within the interpretative
      jurisdiction of the courts. In the case of Charan Lal Sahu
      v Union of India, AIR 1990 SC 1480, the Hon'ble
      Supreme Court while dealing with the provisions of the
      Bhopal Gas leak disaster and directing the government
      to give interim relief to the victims as a measure in
      articulate premise from the spirit of the Act, declared
      this approach to the interpretation of the Act as
      constructive intuition which in the opinion of the court
      was a permissible mode of viewing the acts of the
      Parliament.
</p>
<p id="p_31">    Keeping in view the legislative intent, object of the Act and

the Rules framed thereunder and the purpose sought to be

achieved, recourse to any of the above doctrine would be

appropriate. Certainly, it is the obligation of the respective

governments to prevent and control pollution on one hand and

provide clean environment to the public at large on the other.

The industrial development cannot be permitted to ignore

environmental interests and damage the ecology or ambient

environmental quality irretrievably. The units of plants which

violate the prescribed standards and cause serious pollution,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                               16</span>
 are to be dealt with strictly in accordance with the prescribed

penal or other consequences which may even include the

closure of a unit. The rules primarily provide a regulatory

regime that is required to be adhered to for the purposes of

permissive industrial activity. All these regulatory regimes

whether relating to municipal waste, hazardous waste or bio-

medical waste, owe their allegiance to the substantive

provisions and object of the Act of 1986. Reasonable

construction is intended to provide a balance between the

industrial development and the environment. Principle of

'constructive intuition' would also have its application to the

provisions   of   the   Act,   the   Rules   and   particularly   the

Notification of 2006 in relation to dealing with the entries

provided in the Schedule. The liberal construction rule would

help in giving a purposeful meaning and interpretation to the

provisions of the Act and the Rules for attainment of the basic

object, i.e. cleaner environment.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
    From the above discussion, it is clear that to an Entry of

the Schedule of a social welfare legislation, the principle of

reasonable and/or liberal construction should be adopted to

ensure that the object and purpose of the Act is undefeated by

such interpretation. Most suitable interpretation would be one

which would further the cause of the Act and ensure

prevention and control of pollution rather than provide escape

 route to the industry from taking anti-pollution measures and

complying with the provisions of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_33">
</p><p id="p_34">14. As far as the Entry 3(a) of the Schedule to the

Regulations of 2006 is concerned, another reason for the

Tribunal to adopt a liberal or wider interpretation of it is that

the process of pelletization is that of a low grade iron in our

country, that is not set for great use.      Large capacity for

pelletization and beneficiation is aimed at utilizing the lower

grade iron ore and are presently under way.       The Standing

Committee on Coal and Steel of the Lok Sabha vide its 38th

Report vide primarily examined the review of export of iron ore

policy and observed: "we seek pelletization as a necessary form

of upgrading the existing low quality ore". This clearly shows

that pelletization is a process adopted for upgradation of low

quality iron ore to make it fit for use in the process of making

steel finished products.     It is thus only a stage of the

composite and complete process of making final steel products

from the iron extracted from the mines.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">15. As noticed above, pelletization is a part of a larger

process of manufacturing or making steel items for human

consumption or otherwise and is a process which acts as the

feeder to the further process for extraction of iron and steel

from iron ore and no other purpose.         It certainly causes

serious pollution and thus requires to be checked and

controlled at the very threshold.     There is nexus between

 carrying on the process of pelletization and causing pollution.

Thus, it gives rise to environmental issues which must be

dealt with in accordance with law.    The vision of the Act of

1986 would come into place once such nexus is established

and substantial questions in relation to environment arise. In

the case of Kehar Singh v State of Haryana, 2013(1) - All India

(NGT) Reporter 556, the Tribunal took a view that the cause of

action must have nexus to such disputes which relates to the

issue of environment / substantial question relating to

environment or any such proceeding to trigger the prescribed

period of limitation and held that cause of action must be read

in conjunction with and should take colour from the

expression 'such dispute'. 'Such dispute' must be one which

is relatable to environment.      In that case, the Tribunal

concluded that publication of Section 14 Notification under

the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_20">Land Acquisition Act</a> would not trigger the limitations in

terms of Section 14 of the NGT Act. Similarly in the present

case, when direct nexus between the carrying on of the

business and resultant pollution is established and the

process in its entirety is covered under the Entry, then such

Entry, i.e. Entry 3(a) of the Schedule to the Regulations of

2006 would receive a wider connotation and would take within

it the process of pelletization as part of primary metallurgical

activity.   Of course the matter would be different and the

Entry may not receive such interpretation if pelletization was

not an integral part or was in no way relatable to the entire

 process of making steel. Further, the process of pelletization

results in consequential environmental impact as far as

pollution is concerned but both these factors are conspicuous

by their very absence in the technical and scientific material

placed before us.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">16. Process of pelletization is gaining momentum in the steel

industry as it helps in refining the ore for removal of

impurities. But it is a direct source of environmental pollution.

The pellets are used only for extraction of metal either through

blast furnace or reduction process. The process of pelletization

enables iron ore fines into "Uniformed Sized Iron Ore Pellets"

that are convenient to be charged. These pellets with their

high uniform mechanical strength and high abrasive strength

increase production of iron by 25 % to 30 % with same

amount of fuel. The Tribunal is expected to examine the

cumulative environmental impact of this activity on the

environment which has to be environment-centric, being part

of the entire metallurgical process than a mere stand alone

activity. The purpose of subjecting such an industry to obtain

Environmental Clearance is to ensure prevention of pollution

and also that higher and prescribed standards of anti-

pollution measures are maintained in the interest of the

environment in general rather than being case specific.

have attained serious dimensions and the Courts and

 Tribunals need to adopt an approach which does not

encourage industrial or other polluting units to avoid legal

framework within which they ought to operate on the strength

of mere technicalities. If on true and reasonable construction

of an Entry, the industry or unit is covered under the

Schedule then it is obligated to comply with the prescribed

law. In this backdrop now, let's revert to Entry 3(a) Column 2

of the Schedule to the Regulations of 2006 which contains the

expression 'metallurgical industries'. This expression ex facie

contains two different concepts. One is 'metallurgical' and the

other is 'industries'. Metallurgy is a process in itself which the

industry is to adopt. In common parlance, metallurgy is a

science that deals with procedures used in extracting metals

from their ores, purifying and alloying metals and creating

useful objects from metals.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">18. According to McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science &amp;

Technology, 10th Edition - (Malestrom), "metallurgy" is a

technology and science of metallic materials. Metallurgy as a

branch of engineering is concerned with the production of

metals and alloys, their adaptation to use, and their

performance in service. As a science, metallurgy is concerned

with the chemical reactions involved in the processes by which

metals are produced. This is primary metallurgical process.

The winning of metals would have been of little value without

the ability to work them for different uses. Thus, the wined

 metal has to be converted into different forms of metal for

different uses. The process involved in converting raw metal

into usable metallic form through changing its physical and

chemical properties is called secondary metallurgical process.

<p id="p_46"> 20. Now, we may examine the meaning of industry in general

and with specific reference to the case in hand. <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_21">Section 2(j)</a> of

the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, defines 'industry' as any

business, trade, undertaking, manufacture or calling of

employers and includes any calling, service, employment,

handicraft or industrial occupation or avocation of workmen.

This definition was amended and stood substituted by Act 46

of 1982 whereby 'industry' means any systematic activity

carried on by co-operation between an employer and his

workmen for the production, supply or distribution of goods or

services with a view to satisfy human wants or wishes,

      words used in the definition are very wide in their
      import and even so its latter part purports to provide an



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                              23</span>
 inclusive definition. The word "undertaking" according
to Webster means" anything undertaken; any business,
work or project which one engages in or attempts, an
enterprise ". Similarly, " trade " according to Halsbury,
in its primary meaning, is " exchange of goods for goods
or goods for money ", and in its secondary meaning it is
" any business carried on with a view to profit whether
manual or mercantile, as distinguished from the liberal
arts or learned professions and from agriculture ";
whereas " business " is a wider term not synonymous
with trade and means practically " anything which is an
occupation as distinguished from a pleasure The word
"calling" again is very wide; it means`one's usual
occupation, vocation, business or trade"; so is the word
"service" very wide in its import. Prima facie, if the
definition has deliberately used words of such wide
import, it would be necessary to read those words in
their wide denotation; and so read, Hospitals cannot be
excluded from the definition.
</p>
<p id="p_53">It is, however, contended that, in construing the
definition, we must adopt the rule of construction
noscuntur a sociis. This rule, according to Maxwell,
means that, when two or more words which are
susceptible of analogous meaning are coupled together
they are understood to be used in their cognate sense.
They take their colour from each other, that is, the more
general is restricted to a sense analogous to a less
general. The same rule is thus interpreted in " Words
and Phrases " (Vol. XIV, P. 207): " Associated words take
their meaning from one another under the doctrine of
noscuntur a sociis, the philosophy of which is that the
meaning of a doubtful word may be ascertained by
reference to the meaning of words associated with it;
such doctrine is broader than the maxim Ejusdem
Generis." In fact the latter maxim "is only an illustration
or specific application of the broader maxim noscuntur
a sociis ". The argument is that certain essential
features or attributes are invariably associated with the
words " business and trade " as understood in the
popular and conventional sense, and it is the colour of
these attributes which is taken by the other words used
in the definition though their normal import may be
much wider. We are not impressed by this argument. It
must be borne in mind that noscuntur a sociis is merely
a rule of construction and it cannot prevail in cases
where it is clear that the wider words have been
deliberately used in order to make the scope of the
defined word correspondingly wider. It is only where the
intention of the Legislature in associating wider words
with words of narrow significance is doubtful, or

      can be useful applied."

<p id="p_54">21. In relation to the expression 'industry' appearing in the

<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_24">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947 and Allied Acts, the Courts have

taken a view that it should receive liberal construction as it

falls in a socio welfare legislation and is intended to achieve

the larger public interest relating to workmen.


</p><p id="p_55">22. Having examined the meaning of the expressions used in

Column 2 of the Schedule to the Regulations of 2006, we may

now examine column (3) of Entry 3(a) of the said Schedule. It

describes that metallurgical industry could have two kinds of

functions. One as a Primary Metallurgical industry and the

other is as a secondary metallurgical industry. Thus, it is

necessary to know what exactly both these expressions mean.


Primary Metallurgical Process

Primary metallurgical process refers to the production of metal

from ore, which includes, ore extraction, ore beneficiation,

pelletization or sintering and metal extraction.


Secondary Metallurgical process

Secondary metallurgical process refers to production of alloys

from ingots and to recovery of metal from scrap and salvage.

The process includes casting, molding, forging alloy making,

re-rolling etc. It includes processes like melting, giving aimed

shape to the final output, through forming, poring liquid metal

and alloys to the mold cavity and forging.

</p><p id="p_57"> 23. The      process   of   "primary   metallurgy"   involves    the

processing of iron ore to hot metal or sponge iron and the

further treatment to crude steel. Regarding energy and

emission-optimization in the steel industry, the exploratory

focus concentrates on the issues of reduction and steel

metallurgy. The results of the research activities are used for

the   enhancement      of   existing   processes     and   for   the

implementation of new technologies. Further application areas

are characterization and evaluation of raw materials and

reducing agents for the various processes of iron making.


</p><p id="p_58">24. At this stage, we may also deal with the material on

record or otherwise that throw some light as to whether or not

pelletization forms part of primary or secondary metallurgy.

The Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India

has   prepared     Technical     EIA    Guidance      Manual     for

Metallurgical Industry in August, 2010. This deals both with

ferrous metal industries and non-ferrous metal industries.

Upon the study of this manual it emerges:

<p id="p_59">In the same manual, pellet plant is described as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">      Pellet plant

      Pellet plant, an alternative to sinter plant, will utilize
      iron ore fines to produce BF grade pellets to be used in
      blast furnace. The process involves drying of the ores
      (from 8-10% to less than 1% moisture), grinding to 45
      micron size, feed preparation by adding binders and
      moisture, green pelletization and induration (heat
      hardening).
</blockquote>
<p id="p_60">The Experts have also described process of pelletization and
pollution thereof as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">      Prior to the formation of pellets, water is added to the
      fine iron ore, to adjust the moisture content to
      approximately 9%, and the ore is mixed with small
      amounts of binding agents such as bentonite
      (approximately 0.5%) and fluxes such as limestone,
      olivine and dolomite (1-5%). These agents give the
      pellets the prerequisite physical and metallurgical
      properties required for further processing. Mixing takes
      place in continuously operating drum. On an industrial
      scale, green pellets are formed either in pelletizing discs
      or drums. These pellets are then hardened. The pellets
      are then endured at 850 to 1000ºC then cooled. The
      process of pelletization enables converting Iron Ore
      Fines into "Uniformed Sized Iron Ore Pellets" that is
      convenient to be charged. Pellets with their high,
      uniform mechanical strength and high abrasive strength
      increase production of sponge iron by 25% to 30% with
      same amount of fuel. The pellets so manufactured are
      used only for iron extraction and not for any other
      purpose and hence, it is a part of iron metallurgical
      process.

<p id="p_61">25. As an essential corollary to the above discussion, now, it

has to be now examined if the 'stand alone' activity of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                               27</span>
 pelletization   can   be   a   source   of   pollution   and   cause

substantial environmental hazards.
</p>
<p id="p_62">Pollution in Pelletization

The main pollution sources in pelletization plant are the

handling of raw material, wind-box, exhaust emission, cooler

and cold screen. The Cleaning of gases generated from

pelletization plant is the most difficult task. The wind-box

exhaust is a primary source of particulate matter mainly iron

oxides, sulphur oxides, carbonaceous compounds, aliphatic

hydrocarbons and       chlorides. Generally, cyclone cleaner,

electrostatic precipitator (ESP), wet scrubbers and bag filters

are installed to control pollution. However, the ESP is not

efficient to reduce hydrocarbons, which may include dioxin

and furan gases. The treatment of scrubbed matter is also very

essential. Thus, this part of iron metallurgical process is a

polluting activity.
</p>
<p id="p_63">
</p><p id="p_64">26. From the above discussions, it is evidently clear that the

expression 'metallurgical industry' has been used by the

legislature as words of wide import and thus, it would be

necessary to read those words in their wide denotations. It

must be given a meaning which would enlarge its scope with

the primary object of preventing and controlling pollution in

terms of the prescribed law. The primary metallurgical

industry would thus take within its ambit the activity of

pelletization which is one of the stages in the entire process




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                                  28</span>
 from the point of extraction of iron ore till its conversion into

the final product that is to be consumed by human beings

and/or used for their benefit. It is also evident and in fact, can

hardly be disputed that activity of pelletization is carried out

only to ensure that the impurities in the metal ore are reduced

and it is then used for extracting metal from the ore by the

process that the industry may adopt. Except this, per se, the

process of pelletization has no other object to achieve.

Furthermore, undoubtedly, the process of pelletization is a

source of serious pollution and is required to be stopped by

anti-pollution devices under the law in force. The company

has also raised a contention that though, pelletization (pellet

plants) may be flowing broadly with the process steps which

are to be taken for the process of steel making, since there is

no refining and no change in chemical properties and it is only

an iron ore agglomeration, it would fall under category B-2.

This contention does not impress us. It is needless to note that

even according to the company, pelletization is one of the

processes of making steel. Iron and steel industry comprises

the preparation of raw materials, agglomeration of fines in the

sinter plant, feeding of burden to blast furnace, manufacturing

of coke in coke ovens, conversion of pig iron to steel, making

and shaping of steel, granulation of slag, recovery of chemicals

in by-product plant etc. All the above mentioned processes

add to air, water, solid waste and noise pollution. Experts

requires greater checks and restrictions to ensure prevention

of pollution.

that on one hand, there is divergence of views between the

State Board and the MoEF while, on the other hand, MoEF

 itself had earlier taken the stand that the stand-alone

pelletization plant does not fall under the Entry 3(a) of the

Schedule to Regulations of 2006. This argument is sought to

be substantiated with reference to certain documents that

have been placed by the applicant on record.         Reliance is

placed upon the letter dated 8th December, 2000 written up by

the MoEF to the Member-Secretary of the Andhra Pradesh

Pollution Control Board stating that the matter had been

examined in the Ministry and it is to be informed that as an

activity, pelletization will not fall under Schedule 1 of the EIA

Notification of 1994 for grant of Environmental Clearance.

The Expert Committee of the State Pollution Control Board,

Odisha in its meeting dated 7th April, 2014 had also observed

that the process of pelletization does not involve metal

extraction or extensive chemical changes and should not be

categorized as primary metallurgical process. Reliance is also

placed upon the Office Memorandum dated 27th March, 2014

issued by the Ministry of Steel, Govt. of India, clarifying that

pelletization is only a burden preparation process prior to

actual metal extraction and therefore would not fall under the

head 'primary metallurgical industry'. It needs to be noticed

that a contrary view has been expressed in some of the other

documents placed on record.         The Reconstituted Expert

Appraisal Committee (Industry) in its meeting 19th - 20th

December, 2013, in relation to the appellant before the

Tribunal had opined that the pelletization plant cannot be

 permitted to operate without taking environmental clearance

from the Ministry.      In fact, after detailed deliberations, the

Committee recommended that the Ministry should send a

communication      to     all   the   State   Pollution   Control

Boards/Committees, stating that the iron ore pellet plant falls

under Entry 3(a) (Primary Metallurgical Industry) of the

Schedule to the Regulations of 2006 and comes under

category 'A' which requires Environment Clearance from the

MoEF. It was also recommended that the Ministry may take a

holistic view regarding the applicability of Environmental

Clearance for the iron ore pellet plants which are under

operation.   The State Pollution Control Board, Orissa in its

report dated 3rd May, 2014, while specifying elements of

serious air pollution arising from the operation of pelletization

plants, recommended for the inclusion of such item in the

Schedule of 2006 separately.           Relevant extract of the

Resolution reads as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_25">      i) Iron ore pelletization is the process of converting
      iron ore fines into iron ore pellets.

 considered view that a 'stand alone' pelletization plant would

require Environmental Clearance under the Regulations of

2006. The Ministry after consulting the expert bodies, even the

experts of the Central Pollution Control Board, representative

of CII, Director, Metallurgical Laboratory and Experts of the

MoEF Appraisal Committee, issued a letter dated 11th April,

2014. The relevant extract of the said letter which has a direct

bearing on the matter in issue before us, is as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">      "2. The comments of Ministry of Steel have been
      examined. The Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests, has
      notified the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA)
      Notification, 2006 vide S.O. 1533 €, dated 14th
      September, 2006 under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_25">Environment (Protection)
      Act</a>, 1986. Following the introduction of this EIA
      Notification 2006, the MoEF, with a view to rationalizing
      the granting environmental clearances and for
      implementing the various provisions of the New EIA
      Notification 2006 by various stakeholders - regulators,
      project proponents, Expert Appraisal Committees at
      both Central State Level, SEIAAs, etc, had prepared
      Sector specific EIA Manuals. The EIA Manuals for
      various sectors listed to the Schedule of the Notification
      were got prepared through various sector specific Expert
      Committees. The various Sectoral Expert Committees
      examined the various Sectoral issues, including
      environmental issues, requirements of the sector
      concerned vis-à-vis the EIA Notification 2006. In regard
      to Metallurgy Sector also, the MoEF had constituted
      Core and peer Committees drawing experts from Central
      Pollution Control Board, Representative of CII, Director,
      National Metallurgical Laboratory and Expert Members
      of the MoEF's Expert Appraisal Committee (Industry)
      dealing with environmental clearances pertaining to
      Metallurgy Sector. The Final EIA Manual for the
      Metallurgy Sector states that the environmental impacts
      of Pellet plants whether they are 'stand alone' or part of
      an Integrated Steel Plant are severe in terms of air and
      water pollution and solid wastes generated etc. Details
      of this have been covered in various chapters of the EIA
      Manual, which is available on the Ministry website.
      Thus, the sector specific EIA manual on Metallurgical
      Industry indicated that pellet plants, whether they are
      stand alone or part of an Integrated Steel Plant fall

       within the purview of the metallurgical industry
      requiring prior environmental clearance under the EIA
      Notification, 2006.

<blockquote id="blockquote_28">      3. Further, the Ministry has constituted the Expert
      Appraisal Committee (Industry) comprising of subject
      matter experts under the EIA Notification, 2006 for the
      appraisal of the Industry sector projects for granting
      environmental clearances. The EAC (Industry) has
      always been of the view that the stand alone iron ore
      pellet plants fall under S. No. 3(a) in Primary
      Metallurgical Industries under category 'A' of the
      Schedule of EIA Notification, 2006 and requiring an
      Environmental Clearance (EC) from MoEF. Several ECs
      for such Stand-alone Iron Ore Pellet Plants have
      accordingly been apprised by the EAC(Industry) and on
      the basis of their recommendations, ECs have been
      accorded by MoEF in the past. In its recent meeting
      held on 19th-20th December 2013, the Expert Apprisal
      Committee (Industry) of the MoEF has reiterated its
      stand-Alone Pellet Plant require an EC under the EIA
      Notification 2006.

<blockquote id="blockquote_29">      4. In view of above, it is to inform that this Ministry is
      of the view that the stand-alone iron ore pellet plants
      fall under S.No. 3(a) in Primary Metallurgical Industries
      under Category 'A' of the Schedule of EIA Notification,
      2006 and therefore require prior Environmental
      Clearance (EC) from MoEF."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_69">29. As is evident from the very language of the letter dated

11th April, 2014, the Ministry has taken a considered view in

regard to the various aspects of the matter in issue with

definite emphasis on the environmental impact of pelletization

plants. We have already noticed various technical literatures

placed by the parties before us or otherwise, that clearly show

that the process of pelletization is a serious air pollutant.

There is a definite and increasing trend in this process to

purify the iron ore and to convert it into fine iron ore pellets

which are to be then used for the purposes of manufacturing/




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                                              34</span>
 making of varied steel items. The Regulations of 2006 is a

Notification of wide spectrum to make it mandatory for the

specified    project and    industries       to   seek   Environmental

Clearance in the interest of the environment. The said

Notification having been issued under the provisions of the Act

of 1986 has to be read and construed with reference to the

provisions    of   the   said   Act,   its   objects     and   purposes.

Compliance to the provisions of the Regulations of 2006 is

independent of compliance to other environmental laws in

force. The legislature in its wisdom has placed this additional

obligation upon the project/industry/unit which are seriously

polluting industries, to ensure environmental protection. As

per the law stated in the case of Kehar Singh (supra), precept

to provide interpretation is to examine true nexus between the

environmental pollution and the prevention and control

thereof, in terms of the statutory provisions. We may examine

Entry 3(a) of the Schedule to the Regulations of 2006 even

with the aid of 'Doctrine of Purposive Construction'. The law

has been enacted with the object of prevention and control of

pollution. The intent of Entry 3(a) is to cover the entire process

of metallurgical industry and to prevent and control the

pollution of various kinds that arises from such process. This

was the mischief that was sought to be checked. There should

be higher standards of checking environmental pollution by

the industries involved in primary or secondary metallurgical

processes.

<p id="p_70">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                                                      35</span>
</p><p id="p_71"> 30. The MoEF has been vested with the powers to issue

directions, specify measures and even frame regulations for

carrying out the object and purposes of the Act of 1986. In a

sense, it is the Ministry that is required to perform expert

functions under the provisions of the         said Act. After

considering various aspects and consulting various experts in

and outside the Ministry, it has come to the conclusion that

Entry 3(a) would cover pelletization plants and they would be

required to take Environmental Clearance. Besides the fact

that it is the declared interpretation by the body vested with

such powers, even we as a Tribunal consisting of Expert

Members would have no hesitation in accepting the said view

for the reasons afore-stated. The Learned Counsel appearing

for the Applicant while relying upon the Judgment of the

Supreme Court in the case of Ram Chandra Mawa Lal and

others v State of Uttar Pradesh and others, 1984 [Supp] SCC 28

contended that the conflict between the laws i.e. the State

Board opinion and MoEF should be resolved by giving

precedence to the State Board opinion being the State subject.

We do not think this contention has any merit. Firstly, there is

no conflict between the Central and the State law and as such

the case of Ram Chandra Mawa Lal (supra) has no application

what so ever to the facts of the present case. Here we are

concerned with the opinion expressed by State Boards and the

final view taken by the MoEF. Having considered various



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                              36</span>
 aspects we are unable to find any inconformity in the final

view taken by the MoEF holding that Entry 3(a) takes in its

ambit pelletization plants as well.
</p>
<p id="p_72">     We may usefully refer to the Judgment of the Bombay

High Court in the case of Shankar Raghunath Jog v Talaulicar

and Sons Pvt. Ltd, 2011 (5) All Maharashtra Law Reporter 803,

where the Court took the view that "it is settled law that for

the purposes of interpretation of the statute, the entire statute

has to be read in its entirety. The purpose and the object of

the Act must be given its full effect. Furthermore, in the case

of the present nature involving environmental issues, the

principles of purposive construction must come into force.

Considering the said aspects, Para III of the said EIA

Notification, 1994 would have to be construed with reference

to the context vis-à-vis the other paras of the said Notification

of 1994 so as to make it consistent with the purpose and

object of the said Act of 1986." It may be noted here that the

Notification of 1994 was substituted by the Regulations of

2006.
</p>
<p id="p_73">31. In light of the above discussion, this Tribunal has no

hesitation in holding that pelletization is a process which

squarely falls under the head "primary metallurgical industry".

As such the industries carrying on the process of pelletization,

even as a stand alone project, would be required to seek

Environmental Clearance in terms of the Regulations of 2006.

Having returned this finding, we cannot set aside or quash the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                                               37</span>
 Order dated 12th December, 2013 and the proceedings of the

EIA Committee taking that view. However, we would direct and

grant liberty to the Appellant before the Tribunal to seek

Environmental    Clearance      even   for    the     'stand    alone'

pelletization plant under the Regulations of 2006 as a 'stand

alone' or part of the comprehensive expansion plan of the

Appellant. Such application should be filed within one month

from today and shall be disposed of by the MoEF as far as the

'stand alone' pelletization plant is concerned, within three

months thereafter. Upon grant of such clearance, the unit

would operate in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_74">
</p><p id="p_75">32. In view of the findings afore recorded, it is necessary for

the Tribunal to issue a direction to MoEF and all the State

Pollution Control Boards to take steps immediately, requiring

the stand alone pelletization plants to obtain environmental

clearance from the concerned authorities.           Let copy of this

judgment be circulated by the registry to the Secretary, MoEF

and Member Secretaries of all the State Pollution Control

Boards and Pollution Control Committees.
</p>
<p id="p_76">
</p><p id="p_77">33. For the fact that MoEF has now taken the view that

stand   alone   pelletization    plants      would    also     require

environmental clearances, which has been accepted by this

Tribunal, it will be open to the MoEF/ State Pollution Control

Boards to examine the possibility, whether such units should

be permitted to operate during the interregnum of applying for

 environmental clearance and grant/refusal of the same by the

competent authorities in accordance with law.


</p><p id="p_78">34. Needless to notice that such requests to operate during

interregnum should only be considered if the units are found

otherwise complying with the terms and conditions imposed

by the concerned Board / Committees for establishment /

operation of such unit.
</p>
<p id="p_79">
</p><p id="p_80">35. Resultantly, we find no merit in this appeal. The same is

dismissed, however, with the above directions and while

leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
