<p id="p_1">PER BHAVNESH SAINI, J.M. :
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">            This appeal filed by the assessee is directed

against the order of learned Commissioner of Income

Tax(Appeals), Shimla dated 4.9.2014 for assessment year

2010-11,      challenging      the   order    of   the   learned   CIT

(Appeals) in allowing registration under <a href="/doc/1199969/" id="a_1">section 12A</a> of

the Income Tax Act inspite of the fact that the receipts

of the assessee are in contravention to the amended

provisions of <a href="/doc/544757/" id="a_2">section 2(15)</a> of the Income Tax Act.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           2</span>




</p><p id="p_4">2.           Briefly, the facts of the case are that the assessee

challenged the order of the Assessing Officer before the

learned CIT (Appeals) in ignoring the order of the I.T.A.T.,

Chandigarh Bench dated 28.8.2009 in ITA No.74/Chd/2009

wherein the registration of the assessee under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_3">section 12AA</a>

of the Act was           restored and, therefore, the assessee was

entitled for all benefits available under <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_4">sections 11</a> and <a href="/doc/1843082/" id="a_5">12</a>

of the Act.     It was further stated that the Assessing Officer

has denied the benefits merely on the ground that the above

decision of the Tribunal has been challenged in the Hon'ble

H.P. High Court, which is pending for adjudication.                             The

Assessing Officer, therefore, added the entire surplus to the

declared income of the assessee and framed the assessment

accordingly.        The assessee was constituted for a period of

three years        and renewed from time to time by the State

Government         under       the    Water      (Prevention     &amp;    <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control    of

Pollution)    Act</a>       with    the    main      object    of   performing      the

delegated power and function to provide for the prevention

and   control      of    water       pollution      and   the   maintaining      or

restoring of wholesomeness of water.                        The assessee filed

return of income and claimed refund.                        The assessee was

granted registration under <a href="/doc/1199969/" id="a_7">section 12A</a> of the Act which was

subsequently        withdrawn.                The    withdrawal       order     was

challenged by the assessee before the I.T.A.T. Chandigarh

Bench,       who        vide     order        dated       28.8.2009     in      ITA

No.74/Chd/2009 allowed the                appeal      of the assessee.        The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       3</span>




assessee was informed that the said order is sub-judice as

the department has filed an appeal before the Hon'ble H.P.

High    Court,     which    is    pending    for    adjudication.        The

Assessing Officer required the assessee to show cause as to

why    its   entire   income     be   not   taxed   as   per   the   normal

provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_8">Income Tax Act</a>.              The assessee submitted

that the issue of cancellation of registration as well as on

merits, addition on account of accumulation, etc. has been

decided in their favour by the I.T.A.T., Chandigarh Bench as

well as by the learned CIT (Appeals) for assessment year

2009-10.       The order of the learned CIT (Appeals) has been

challenged by the Assessing Officer before the                   Tribunal,

which is pending.          The Assessing Officer, however, in the

assessment order held that the assessee was not carrying

out the activities for which registration under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_9">section 12AA</a>

had been granted.          The excess of income over expenditure

was    considered     as   income     and   addition     was   accordingly

made.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.           The   assessee      submitted    before     the   learned   CIT

(Appeals) that the I.T.A.T., Chandigarh Bench has already

decided the appeal of the assessee in ITA No.74/Chd/2009

wherein registration has been restored.                    Therefore, the

assessee is entitled for deduction under <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_10">sections 11</a> and <a href="/doc/1843082/" id="a_11">12</a>

of the Act.        The submissions on merits were also made.

The learned CIT (Appeals) following the order of the Tribunal

in ITA No.74/Chd/2009 decided the issue in favour of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                          4</span>




assessee and held that the assessee would be treated as

registered under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_12">section 12AA</a> of the Act.


</p><p id="p_7">4.            After hearing the rival submissions we do not find

any merit in the appeal of the Revenue.                         The Revenue has

raised    only     ground    that      the    learned        CIT     (Appeals)    has

allowed registration under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_13">section 12AA</a> of the Act.                              This

issue has      already      been    considered          in    detail   by I.T.A.T.,

Chandigarh         Bench    in   the    case       of   the     assessee    in    ITA

No.74/Chd/2009, against which the appeal of the Revenue

is pending before the Hon'ble High Court.                            Similarly, the

I.T.A.T.,     Chandigarh      Bench      in    ITA      No.835/Chd/2012           for

assessment         year    2009-10       vide      order       dated     16.4.2013

dismissed the departmental appeal by following the same

order of the Tribunal in ITA No.74/Chd/2009.                             Therefore,

there    is   no   infirmity     in    the    order      of    the     learned    CIT

(Appeals) in following the order of the Tribunal through

which the assessee was conferred the registration under

<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_14">section 12AA</a> of the Act and consequentially the assessee

would be entitled for deduction under <a href="/doc/1321037/" id="a_15">sections 11</a> and <a href="/doc/1843082/" id="a_16">12</a> of

the   Act.         Merely    because         the   departmental          appeal    is

pending in Hon'ble High Court against the order of the

Tribunal, is no ground to take different view at the stage.

We do not find any infirmity in the order of the learned CIT
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     5</span>




(Appeals).        The departmental appeal has no merit and is

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.           In   the   result,   the   appeal   of   the   Revenue   is

dismissed.
