</pre>
<p id="p_1">(Judgment delivered by the Bench)

       This   application   is   filed   challenging     the   order   in   Preceeding   No:   T-
7/YNPCB/F.19425/MMN/Compl/2011-1 dated 13.09.2011 of the Chairman, Tamil Nadu
Pollution Control Board (R-1), whereunder the applicant was directed, while exercising provision
under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">section 31A</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as amended in
1987, directing the concerned authority to stop the power supply to the unit of the applicant
with immediate effect. This was preceded by an order of even dated 13.09.2011, asking the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           Page 2 of 4</span>
NGT/CKS/Judg/29-03-2012/17:30
 applicant to close down the unit with immediate effect. There is no necessity of going through
all the details.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        The only controversy arisen in this matter is as to whether the location of the unit falls
within CRZ or not .When the matter came up for hearing on 4th January, 2012 the following
order was passed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   ''The appellant, Party in person has drawn our attention to the rejoinder
                   and the letter dated 15.12.2011 issued by the Member Secretary, Tamil
                   Nadu State Coastal Zone Management Authority and Director of
                   Department of Environment, Chennai which states that as per CRZ
                   Notification 2011 promulgated on 6th January 2011, vide para 1 (ii) CRZ
                   shall apply to the land area between HTL to 100 m or width of the creek
                   whichever is less on the landward side along the tidal influenced water
                   bodies.
</blockquote>



<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                   The width of the creek was not indicated anywhere. On the other hand,
                   the certificate issued by the Civil Engineer and Licenced Surveyor of the
                   Corporation of Chennai dated 27.12.2011 indicates that the width of the
                   canal (Creek) is 23.3 metres. Once the notification says 100 metres from
                   the HTL Line or width of the creek whichever is less, the order passed on
                   15.12.2011 appears to be wrong. Therefore, we are of the opinion that
                   the Member Secretary Tamil Nadu State Coastal Zone Management
                   Authority and Director, Department of Environment, Chennai shall be
                   added as a party to the proceeding as R-8. The fact as to whether the
                   industry is polluting or not also appears to have not been examined.</blockquote>




<p id="p_3">                   The registry shall issue notices to R-8, indicating that the matter is
                   posted on 19th January, 2012 for consideration. The R-8 shall make his




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                 Page 3 of 4</span>

                 own arrangements for appearance either personally or through a
                counsel on 19th January 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                Post the matter on 19th January, 2012 for further hearing.''




        Thereafter the matter was examined by none other than Chairperson of TNPCB and passed
order on 28.03.2012 in his File No. T7/TNPCB/F.19425/MMN/Comp/2012-1, wherein the direction
issued earlier to close down the industry and stop electricity supply was revoked with immediate effect
and the unit shall comply with all the conditions stipulated in the Consent Orders. Further by an order of
even dated 28.03.2012 The Chairman, TNPCB directed to the Assistant Environmental Engineer,
TNGEDCO (TNPCB), Chennai, Tamil Nadu to restore power supply to the applicant unit with immediate
effect. Thus no cause of action remains to be adjudicated.
</p>
<p id="p_5">The party (applicant) who is present in the court in person also stated that the license of the unit has
been renewed on 01.03.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_6">Recording the above events the matter is closed. No cost.
