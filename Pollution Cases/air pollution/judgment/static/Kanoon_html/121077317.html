<p id="p_1">1.             The present Application was originally filed as
Public Interest Litigation (PIL) No.44 of 2011, in the
Hon'ble High Court of Judicature of Bombay, Bench at
Nagpur, which was transferred to this Tribunal vide High
Court order dated October 9th, 2013. The present
Application has been filed by five residential Colony
Societies,            seeking      to   ventilate    their   long   standing
grievances                regarding      improper       and     unscientific
operations at the Bhandewadi Municipal Solid Waste

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                           3</span>
(J) Appln. No. 32(THC) of 2013
 (MSW) dumping yard complex resulting in serious air and
water pollution, posing a serious health hazard to the
large and dense population, residing in the vicinity of said
plant. The Applicants submit that area of Bhandewadi
was reserved for MSW dumping yard since 1966. The
subsequent development plans (DP) also show the area as
compost yard. The Corporation of City of Nagpur (NMC) is
utilizing said area for dumping of entire solid waste
generated in the city. As a matter of fact, the Respondent
No.2, i.e. NMC was expected to provide necessary
processing and treatment plant for the solid waste and
operate the same scientifically so that operations would
not create pollution and health hazard. It is case of the
Applicants that the Respondent No.2- NMC and its
contractor             -         Respondent     No.7,    have    not      provided
adequate machinery and plant for the said purpose and
are not operating entire process of MSW management in
scientific manner, in compliance with the Municipal Solid
Waste (M&amp;H) Rules, 2000, hereinafter referred as MSW
Rules.          The        Applicants,        therefore,   claim     that    such
unscientific operations of MSW management by the
Respondent No.2 and Respondent No.7, is causing air
pollution, odour nuisance, pollution of water, soil and
groundwater, besides the adverse health impact on the
nearby residents. The Applicants submit that they have
regularly            approached         the     Authorities      including     the
Respondent No.2 - NMC, Respondent No.5- MPCB and
the Respondent No.6, the Collector, pointing out such
nuisance and pollution, however, the Authorities have
failed to take necessary corrective measures to control air
and water pollution.
</p><p id="p_2">2.             The         Applicants     further       submit     that    though
Nagpur City generates about 800 MT of MSW daily, the
processing and treatment was provided only to 600 MT.
Further recycling plant provided at MSW facility was

(J) Appln. No. 32(THC) of 2013
 gutted          in fire thereby reducing treatment capacity
significantly. The Applicants, therefore, submit that such
improper               and         unscientific         operations       of      MSW
management by the Respondent No.2, and Respondent
No.7, are continued in spite of regular complaints to the
Authorities and also several Notices issued by the
Regulatory Authority i.e. the Respondent No.5.
</p><p id="p_3">3.             The          Applicants        further       submit       that     the
Respondent No.2-NMC is also operating Slaughterhouse
activities at the same location directly discharging
untreated effluents in Nagpur Municipal Corporation
area. It is claimed that the Respondent No.5 MPCB has
issued          letters,          Notices    and    in     spite   of    that,    the
Slaughterhouse                     operations       are      being       conducted
irregularly in unscientific manner.
</p><p id="p_4">4.               The Applicants further submit that though the
MSW Rules provide for buffer zone of no development to
be maintained around landfill site and it is desirable that
minimum 500 mtrs buffer area should be marked in the
development plan, the Respondent Nos.3 and 4, have
failed to provide this buffer zone and thereby are causing
significant residential growth in areas surrounding the
dumping yard, which ultimately results in exposing large
population directly to the air pollution and odour
nuisance             caused         due     to   the      dumping       yard.    The
Applicants further submit that the Respondent No.2 -
NMC            had          appointed         the    National        Environment
Engineering                Research         Institute     (NEERI)       to    suggest
improvements in the MSW management of the city and as
per newspaper reports such report has been submitted
with        several              recommendations          including      developing
disintegrated MSW facilities in different areas of the city.
The Applicants have, therefore, prayed for following:

thereto development plan for the city was prepared and
accordingly, action for development and improvement of
the city was taken. It is submitted that in Bhandewadi
and in surrounding area, sewerage treatment as well as
MSW treatment are being undertaken since past more
than fifty (50) years. These lands were earlier outside city
limits when acquired by the Respondent No.4 for the
aforesaid purpose. And therefore it is the case of the
Respondent-2                     that when residential habitation was
developed in the vicinity of this area, the habitants were
completely aware of the fact that the present site was and
is being used for specific purpose of sewage treatment
and solid waste treatment and disposal. Respondent No.2
further submits that they have already erected MSW
processing plant at Bhandewadi and have obtained
appropriate authorization from the Maharashtra Pollution
Control Board. It is claimed by the Respondent No.2, that
this MSW processing plant is operating satisfactorily and
therefore, allegations of air pollution, water pollution, bad
odour, are denied by the Respondents. In paragraph 10 of

to say that recycling plant was destroyed due to fire.
However, the details of fire incident, losses and also effect

Respondents.
</p><p id="p_14">9.             Respondent-2              further    submitted    a    detailed
affidavit on March 24, 2014, so as to show recent status
of the MSW plant. The status of present sewage
treatment, MSW processing and Slaughterhouse pollution
can be gathered from the same. Respondent No.2,
submits that the Corporation area is generating about
800 MT/D of MSW. The Corporation has been granted
authorization by the MPCB under the MSW (M &amp; H)
Rules,          2000,            for   its    MSW   processing       plant   at
Bhandewadi, which is valid till 30th April, 2017. The
Corporation has awarded work of MSW processing and
disposal to M/s Hanjer Biotech Energies (P) Ltd (Nagpur)
by following due process of tendering from April 15th,
2009. This work order is for twelve (12) years, of which,
first two (2) years were for construction and development
activity and remaining ten (10) years are for operation
and maintenance of site at Bhandewadi till 2021. The
contractor was manufacturing compost, RDF, Plastic
pellets etc. The remains of MSW processing which was of
no use, was regularly shifted to SLF as per the norms.
When an effort was made to increase plant's capacity to
600 MT/D, incident of fire took place in the plant area on
14.2.2012 due to which the Plastic and Recycling unit
and part of segregation unit including machinery were
totally         destroyed.             This   incident   severally    affected
functioning of the said plant. It is the contention of
Respondent-2, Corporation that they had directed the
operator to restore the plant to its sanctioned capacity on
priority, however, the operator has not been able to
restore the plant to its original capacity. It is claimed by

(J) Appln. No. 32(THC) of 2013
 the Respondent No.2, that compost unit and RDF unit
are now functional, whereas the Plastic unit is yet to be
restored. The Respondent No.2, further submits that due
to non-segregation of waste, two (2) other departments
i.e. composting section as well as RDF section are also
impacted. The incoming waste is, therefore, dumped in to
available landfill in keeping with Rule-6 of the Schedule-
II, of the MSW Rules, 2000, wherein it is permissible to
dump unprocessed waste into the landfill site during the
disruption period and therefore, it is claimed by the
Respondent No.2, that presently about 200 MT/D of MSW
is treated and the balance of about 600 MT/D mixed
MSW is dumped into the landfill site. Therefore, there is
no pollution caused due to the MSW management.
</p><p id="p_15">10.            The Respondent No.2, admits that the MPCB has
time        and         again    issued   notices/directions   through
communications dated 6.9.2010, 21.12.2010, 18.4.2011,
22.3.2012, 17.5.2013 etc. and claims that all of them
have been duly complied by the Corporation and the
operator, which is evident from the fact that MPCB has
not taken further action on these notices/directions. The
Respondent No.2, further claims that due to consistent
follow up by the Corporation with the Operator, the
Operator has now started taking steps to restore
processing plant to its sanctioned capacity and the
operator has brought new machinery at the site to
increased processing capacity from 200 MT/D to 400
MT/D. Respondent No.2, further submits that they have
submitted Bank Guarantee of Rs. 1 crore to the MPCB for
compliance of various pollution control norms.
</p><p id="p_16">11.            Respndent-7, the Operator of the MSW facility
has also filed an affidavit which is basically in line with
the affidavit of Respondent-2 Corporation, and therefore,

the Corporation is generating about 400 MLD of sewage,
presently one sewage treatment plant of 100 MLD
capacity is in operation since October 2001, however, due
to hydraulic issues, the plant is not running to its full
capacity and presently only 70 to 80 MLD sewage                 is
being treated. The Corporation has awarded the work of
augmentation of this STP from 100 MLD to 200 MLD
recently. Further, the Corporation is constructing 130
MLD capacity STP at Bhandewadi for MAHAGENCO.
Further, there is proposal to transport 24 MLD of sewage
to the STP at MIHAN and therefore, the Corporation will
have a capacity to treat about 354 MLD of sewage in
coming years which will reduce water pollution.

inadequate treatment provided for only about 80 MLD
sewage out of total generation of sewage of about 400
MLD from the city area. MPCB has claimed to have time
and again issued warning Notices, Show cause Notices
and directions under the provisions of the above Acts and
Rules, however, it is claimed by the MPCB that in spite of
its       best         efforts,   NMC   has   not   complied   with
environmental norms. MPCB has further submitted that
in view of continuance of non-compliances by the
Respondent No.2, the Respondent Board is in process of
initiating stringent action against NMC. The Regional
Officer of MPCB, Nagpur, is said to be in process of
collecting samples as per the provisions of Law from
leachate section and also, prosecution Notices issued and
based on non-compliances, a decision of filing of
prosecution against NMC, is being considered. The earlier
two (2) affidavits of MPCB show that only about 200
MT/D of MSW is being processed and disposed of out of
total 800 MT/D and remaining MSW is dumped on the
site in an unscientific manner, without segregation
processing and disposal at the secured landfill site.
Surprisingly, third affidavit clearly mentions that only 5%
MSW is being processed at the time of visit on March

               Respondents for effective pollution control in
               Bhandewadi area?
</p><p id="p_31">17.            It is an admitted fact that NMC area is generating
about 800 MT/D of MSW. NMC is disposing the MSW
generated in the city at a designated area at Bhandewadi,
having total area of about 450 acres, which is located on
fringes of the city since 1960s. The MSW Rules have been
notified in the year 2000 and as per the Rules, a specific
timeframe up to 2003, was given to the Municipal Bodies
to develop scientific MSW management facilities. It is an
admitted fact that NMC has not adhered to this time limit
and only in 2008, tenders were called and operator was
appointed for developing the MSW facility. This facility
started its phase-wise operation in May, 2010 and in
June,2011 about 450 MT/D of MSW was processed and
also, some of the waste accumulated at the site was
collected together for its scientific closure. It is brought
on record that NMC has created a facility of Secured land
Fill (SLF) in the area of 23 acres and also created closure
site at the dumping yard with a footprint of 25 acres
which            is       now    covered   with   green   vegetation.
Subsequently, somewhere in 2011-12, there was a fire
incident and the waste processing plant was damaged.
Consequently, only 200 MT/D of MSW is being processed
and balance 600 MT/D, is disposed of either in secured
landfill site without any segregation or is dumped in the
premises. It is claimed by MPCB that even this 200 MT/D
is not regularly treated as during many visits processing
plant was partially or completely shut down due to power
failure. The Respondent No.2, makes a statement that
they are pursuing with the operator i.e. the Respondent
No.7, for reinstallation of the machinery so that the plant
is operated as per the tender conditions and only in

 March, 2014, some machinery is arrived at the site for
the purpose. When a specific inquiry was made, it was
submitted that one more assembly line of machinery for
200 MT/D capacity is being reinstalled and thereafter,
there will be a processing for about 400 MT/D. The
Respondent Nos. 2 and 7, have cited many reasons for
such a late reinstallation and have further submitted that
they are planning a new project based on viability gap
funding, which will be submitted to the Govt. of India for
funding. Considering the above, it is found that the
Respondent 2 and Respondent-7 are not operating the
MSW processing and treatment plant in compliance with
the MSW Rules and thereby causing pollution.

country is one of the neglected area in the urban
development process. As per the report on Performance
Evaluation of Sewage Treatment plants under NRCD
published by CPCB (2013), most of the cities in the
country do not either have adequate sewage treatment
capacity or that the installed capacity is also not being
operated properly. Most of major states have less than
20% of their sewage duly treated. This is not a good
scenario for developing country like India, as untreated
sewage is having significant environmental impacts and
financial burden, including health impacts, effects on
agriculture,               groundwater                pollution,         surface       water
pollution, besides greenhouse emissions and therefore, it
is high time that urban development should necessarily
prioritize the sewage collection and treatment system.

 give priority to sewage treatment to ameliorate the
negative impacts of untreated sewage, particularly in view
of dwindling fresh water sources. It is true that most of
the present sewage treatment plants are energy and
capital/recurring cost expensive and also, require skilled
operations. However, with new technologies, use of
appropriate technology and adoption of new financial
recovery models recurring cost of such treatment can be
reduced on principle of reuse and recycle. Nagpur City
was one of the first Cities which have tied up with power
generation Company to provide its treated sewage for
cooling purpose thereby commercializing the sewage
treatment. However, presently, out of 400 MLD swage
generation, only 70 to 80 MLD is being treated and
another 130 ML/D may be treated from next year. NMC
could not give any time frame commitment for balance
quantity of sewage. It is also mentioned that this
untreated sewage is finally discharged directly in                       'Nag'
river, which ultimately drifts to Goshikhurd Dam. This is
not at all happy state of affairs from environmental stand
point of view.

therefore gone through the documents filed with the

samples are not meeting the prescribed norms. More
importantly,               the     critical   parameter    of   BOD      (limit

mind, we had asked MPCB to submit the details of air

some information in its last affidavit, and noted that
MPCB has done ambient air monitoring, related to MSW
operations at the project site, total 4 times since 2010, of
which 3 samples are of 2013. The results indicate that
the RSPM values are ranging from 307-627 microgm/m3.
Though RSPM is specifically not referred in MSW Rules,
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, 2009
prescribe the RSPM norms at &lt; 100 microgm/m3. It is
also noted that during entire pendency of this petition,
MPCB has not carried out ambient air quality monitoring

complainant's residential areas. MPCB could have used
scientific air quality monitoring techniques using specific
air quality markers, for assessing the contribution of
MSW operations on ambient air quality in the vicinity.
MPCB is the specially created scientific and technical
organization under environmental laws, and is expected
to deal with public grievances in most appropriate
scientific manner, and therefore we expected MPCB to
come with complete information on ambient monitoring of
water and air, so that the impact assessment could have
been possible. The MSW Rules provide for a definite
monitoring frequency of environmental parameters and
plant performance, and cast the responsibility of such
monitoring on MPCB. However, MPCB has failed to
adhere to such prescribed frequency and also process of
monitoring.                In the absence, of such data, we find it
difficult to assess the damages.

though this is also challenged by MPCB. By a simple
arithmetic, considering claim of the Respondent Nos. 2
and 7 that 200 MT/D MSW is processed and 200 MT/d is
inert waste, it is seen that about 400 MT/d MSW is
disposed of without any treatment and processing in an
unscientific manner, since the date of fire i.e. February

making the entire quantity contaminated. So, even with a
very conservative estimate about 12000 MT/d MSW is
disposed unscientifically causing pollution. The sewage
treatment is also at @ 70 MLD against the generation of
400 MLD. The STP performance is also not consistent
and complying at all times. The slaughterhouse does not
have ETP and is being operated without pollution control
systems. These are tale telling facts and circumstances. It
is obvious that such operations occurred as a result of
improper management of such plants by the Respondent
Nos. 2 and 7. The operations of MSW facility, STP and
slaughterhouse in the present state itself are of such
nature that no separate proof for of "negligent act" on
part of the Respondent Nos.2 and 7 is required to be
adduced. This is a case in which Principle of Res ipsa
loquitur is applicable. We have no hesitation, therefore, in
holding that the Respondent Nos.2 and 7 are committing
a gross negligence which has resulted into present state
of MSW facility. Further, we also hold that Respondent
No.2 is not operating the STP operations and also
slaughterhouse operations scientifically as per pollution
control norms. Both the above acts of Respondent Nos.2
and 7 are resulting into discharge of environmental
pollutants              in       the   environment   and   also   in   the

environmental regulations in the urban development
scenario in the country, and when the Country is
experiencing the rapid urbanization, these rules are very
important to maintain hygienic environment in the city
area. The Rules envisage a structured approach to this
complex social and technical problem, and therefore have
identified two specific authorities under the rules. Under
Rule 5 of the said Rules, the Secretary- in charge of
Urban development ministry in the state is the overall
Supervisory Authority for Metropolitan cities and District
Magistrate for all cities in respective districts. The SPCBs
are also responsible for grant of Authorization, and

expected to have significant impacts in the surroundings
due to odour pollution, air pollution and water/soil
pollution. Considering these aspects, the MSW Rules, 200
have         provisions          related    to    nearby    habitation      and
development. The Schedule-III has two relevant clauses
which are reproduced below for clarity:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">          1. The landfill site shall be away from the habitation
               clusters,          forest         areas,     water      bodies,
               monuments.....

<p id="p_50">              However, these clauses relate to site selection, as
a part of specifications for the Landfill sites, and the
Authorities are required to examine its applicability and
relevance during the operation stage of the Landfill. It has
already been submitted by the Respondent No.4, that
there is no buffer i.e. no-development zone shown in the
revised DP of Nagpur. Moreover, it is averred that
development of such a buffer zone is likely to get some
opposition from the local residents, as their development
rights will be affected. We are also aware of the difficulty
that if the MSW facilities are strictly operated as per the
Rules, there will not be any need of buffer zone. However,
considering the present status of MSW management at
Nagpur, we are skeptical as to when and how the MSW

necessary that the Authorities shall examine whether the

can be identified, as per the provisions of Law.

secured landfill site and it was informed by the concerned
officers of Respondent No.2, that the original secured
landfill capacity was of about seven (7) years period,
considering intake of about 600 MT/D of MSW, that will
be processed and reused and only about 200 to 250
MT/D will find its way to secure landfill site. They further
informed that with the present scenario about 600 MT/D
MSW is now dumped in secured landfill, life of secured
landfill will be considerably lowered. The Tribunal also
inquired about the action taken by the Respondent No.2,
against the operator i.e. the Respondent No.7, for non-
complying with the contractual obligations to treat 800
MT/D of MSW and it was informed that NMC has
penalized him and has also issued Notices.                When
persistently inquired about the nature and scale of the
penalty, it was reluctantly informed by officers of the
Respondent No.2 that penalty of Rs.5,000/- or so has
been imposed on the operator. Considering the fact that
nonperformance of obligations by the operator is resulting
in disposal of about 600 to 800 MT/D MSW every day in
complete violation of directions of the Apex Court, Hon'ble
High Court, MSW Rules and other Environmental Laws
the penalty is only a paper scare. We fail to understand
the rationale of NMC in charging such penalties and
letting the operator free in spite of grave contractual
violations.

the provisions of Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a>s and is expected to
perform a scientific and technical role in implementation
of environmental regulations. The MSW rules specifically
mandate MPCB to monitor the environmental quality in
view of MSW facility operations. <a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_10">Section 17</a> of Water

the mandate of SPCBs, which clearly shows the scientific
and        technical functions of the Board besides the
enforcement                      responsibilities.   Considering   these
provisions in mind, we called upon the MPCB to submit
environmental quality data related to MSW facility
operations to assess the environmental impacts. Being a
special scientific organ created under environmental
statues, MPCB is expected to assist this Tribunal with
scientific data, analysis and research. However, in this
case, we regret to note absence of scientific support
through data and information made available by MPCB.
We therefore feel it necessary that the MPCB shall
develop its capacity in environmental monitoring and
assessment with emphasis on research based, latest
scientific and analytical tools, as envisages in <a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_13">Section 17</a>
