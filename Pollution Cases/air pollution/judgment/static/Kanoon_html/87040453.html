respondent No.1 Ministry of Environment (MoE) and the respondent

No.2 Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to ensure that the treated sewage water

flowing into the water bodies conforms to the designated best use

standards and meets the Guidelines set up by the Central Pollution

Control Board (CPCB) (impleaded as respondent No.3), direction is also

sought against the DJB to regularly monitor the flow of treated water

 from the various Sewerage Treatment Plants (STPs) and to submit report

to this Court from time to time.

been filed on behalf of MoE, DJB and the respondent No.4 Delhi

Pollution Control Committee (DPCC).

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       (i)     that CPCB was constituted under the Water (Prevention and

               <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 to promote cleanliness of

               streams and wells in different areas of the States and for

               which purpose it lays down standards for a stream or wells,

               collects and compiles data relating to water pollution and

               devises measures for prevention and control of pollution and

               relating to disposal of sewage and sewage effluents;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (ii)    that CPCB has carried out sample testing of the STPs in

               Delhi and has also fixed the best designated use standards

               for streams;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       (iii)   that the responsibility of maintaining the standards fixed by

               respondent No.3 CPCB is of the respondent No.2 DJB;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">        (iv)   that the STPs are in abysmal state of inefficiency and

              inadequacy as is evident from the colour and foul smell that

              emanates from the treated water which is discharged into the

              water bodies and which is unfit to support any plant, animal

              or marine life or even for irrigation;

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       (v)    that the report of CPCB of the year 2003 gives details of

              STPs etc.;

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       (vi)   that of 3267 million liters of sewage generated everyday,

              capacity exists only for treating 2330 million liters per day

              day;

       (xvi) owing to insufficiency and inefficient treatment, the water

</blockquote><p id="p_11"> 4.     MoE in its counter affidavit has stated that STPs are being operated

by respondent No.2 DJB and monitored for treated waste water quality by

the DPCC.
</p>
<p id="p_12">5.     DJB in its counter affidavit has pleaded that the treated effluent

may be used for all non-potable purpose i.e. irrigation, horticulture,

washing, cooling and industrial use; that the treatment depends on the

intended use of the treated effluent; that for enhancing the quality

standard of treated effluent, the cost of treating sewage becomes

expensive exponentially; that however to avoid pollution of ground water

and harm to plants, animals and aqua life, it is not advisable to recharge

ground water or water bodies with treated sewage because of the

standards maintained of the STPs; the treated effluent is discharged into

flowing water i.e. drains / rivers so that due to self natural process, the

treated effluent further improves its quality - that is why discharging

treated effluent in water bodies like ponds, lakes etc. is never

recommended; that the Supreme Court has already taken up the matter in

W.P.(C) No.725/1994 and DJB has submitted its Action Plan for

improving the quality of river Yamuna through the project of "Laying of

Interceptor Sewer along three major drains for abatement of Pollution in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C) No.1762/2012                                              Page 5 of 9</span>
 river Yamuna" and which work is to be completed by the year 2014 and

which will ensure that all untreated sewage flowing into the natural

stream will be intercepted and conveyed to the nearest STPs for proper

treatment. DJB has however admitted that the total sewage generated is

680 mega gallon per day while the treatment capacity is only of 513.4

mega gallon per day, to be increased to 618.4 mega gallon per day by

December, 2012 and 730.4 mega gallon per day by the year 2014. It is

stated that the conditions of Singapore cannot be compared with Delhi.

Along with the counter affidavit, analysis reports for the different months

of the year 2012 have been filed and which are stated to be as per the

prescribed standards.
</p>
<p id="p_13">6.     We have considered the matter. The reliefs claimed in the writ

petition are threefold. Firstly, that the treated sewage flowing into the

water bodies conforms to the standards prescribed therefor; secondly, for

the STPs to meet the Guidelines set up by CPCB and lastly for

monitoring of the STPs.
</p>
<p id="p_14">7.     As far as the last of the three reliefs is concerned, DPCC has

admitted that it is continuously monitoring the 24 STPs. Vis-à-vis the

second relief, though the petitioner on the basis of the reports of the year
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">W.P.(C) No.1762/2012                                               Page 6 of 9</span>
 2003 has contended that the STPs do not meet the prescribed standards

but DPCC on the basis of the reports of the year 2012 has shown the

STPs to be compliant therewith. DPCC in its counter affidavit has further

assured to continue monitoring the STPs in future also.

</p><p id="p_15">8.     That brings us to the first of the aforesaid reliefs.              The

apprehension of the petitioner is that the treated sewage water flowing

into the water bodies does not conform to the prescribed standards.

However DJB in its counter affidavit has made a distinction between

water bodies as ponds and lakes on the one hand and a river on the other

hand and pleaded that while discharge of treated sewage into river

Yamuna is seized of by the Supreme Court, treated sewage water is not

prescribed to flow into the water bodies as ponds and lakes.

</p><p id="p_16">9.     The Supreme Court being seized of the matter qua discharge of

treated sewage into river Yamuna, it is not for this Court to entertain the

petition qua the same. As far as the discharge of treated sewage into

other water bodies is concerned, as aforesaid, it is the stand of DJB that it

is not advisable to so discharge treated sewage into such water bodies. It

is rather further stated that wherever treated sewage water is found to be



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">W.P.(C) No.1762/2012                                                Page 7 of 9</span>
 flowing into the water bodies as ponds and lakes, complaint thereof is

made.
</p>
<p id="p_17">10.     In view of the said stand, qua the said relief, we dispose of the writ

petition with the following directions:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">        A.    We direct the DPCC to, from time to time check / monitor

              all the STPs to ensure functioning thereof as per prescribed

              standards and upon finding any defect / deficiency therein or

              upon finding treated sewage therefrom to be not conforming

              to prescribed standards, immediately bring the same to

              notice of DJB.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">        B.    We direct DJB to operate the STPs as per prescribed

              standards and to immediately upon receipt of any complaint

              from DPCC or otherwise, rectify the defects.

        C.    We direct DPCC as well as DJB to ensure that treated

              sewage from STPs is not discharged into water bodies as

              lakes / ponds etc., unless the same is compliant with

              prescribed standards.</blockquote><p id="p_18">
