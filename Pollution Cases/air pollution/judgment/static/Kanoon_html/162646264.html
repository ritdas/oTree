JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON)

</p><p id="p_13">1. The applicant and others, social activists, challenge the

construction of the road from Vitthalwadi to National Highway-4


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                 2</span>
 bypass, which is being constructed under the Draft Development

Plan on the ground that the Draft Development Plan has not been

approved by the State Government, no permission from Irrigation

Department has been taken and the road touches the Vitthalwadi

Temple and its surrounding areas which are Grade I Heritage

Buildings and even permission from Archaeological Department has

not been taken. This construction, according to the applicants, is

bound to cause massive environmental, ecological and social

damage. The construction of the road is being carried out in the

river bed i.e. within the "blue line". Thus, the applicants pray that

the on-going construction work should be stopped immediately and

the respondents; any other person or agencies should be restrained

from dumping any debris or construction material; the entire debris

and soil dumping should be directed to be removed and finally the

boundaries of the river should be expressly defined and marked by

the local government in conjunction with Irrigation Department and

the Archaeological Department.
</p>
<p id="p_14">2. We may now notice the facts in brief that give rise to the

institution of this application. As already stated, the applicants

claim to be socially motivated persons who have studied the project

of construction of the road from Vitthalwadi to National Highway-4

bypass. As a result of this study, according to the applicants, the

Pune Municipal Corporation (for short 'Corporation') extended its

boundary in the year 1997. In this process, for expansion, 23

villages were included in the new limits of the said Corporation.

Vitthalwadi is one of such villages. The Development Plan of Pune


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                    3</span>
 city was finalised and approved by the State Government in the

year 1987, but these 23 villages were not part of the approved

Development Plan. A fresh draft plan was prepared for the said 23

villages. The draft development plan was published under Section

28(4) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act (for short

'MRTP Act') and was submitted to the State Government in terms of

Section 30 of the MRTP Act. The location where the road is being

constructed comes under the draft Development Plan. The proposed

construction is that of 30 metre wide road connecting Vitthalwadi to

National Highway-4 bypass exactly in Mutha river bed.        At        a

distance of 7 km from the construction site is a dam upstream. No

sanction of the Government, more particularly of Irrigation

Department, had been obtained prior to starting of the construction

of the said road. The construction is not even in accordance with

the Draft Development Plan. In modification No.4.06 of the Draft

Development Plan, it is clearly stated that "10 m. green belt and 30

m. road have been deleted and only 24 m. wide road is proposed

with 36 m. river protection belt" (for short 'RPB'). It is the allegation

of the applicants that in the Draft Development Plan, the width is

shown as 24 m. whereas the actual width of the road being

constructed is 30 m. showing clearly that the road is being

constructed with 6 m. more width which is in violation of the Draft

Development Plan. There is a reservation of 36 m. wide RPB

between the proposed road and the perennial flow of the river. This

has been shown in green colour in the Draft Development Plan but in

actual situation at the site, the respondents have shifted the road to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                        4</span>
 the RPB while it was expected to be constructed beyond the RPB.

Another specific averment has been made by the applicants that on

both sides of the river, there is a low lying part of the basin shaped

river bed on both sides which is actually a submersible land that

submerges when discharge is released from Khadakwasla Dam,

which is a dam that provides water to the entire city of Pune. The

very purpose of RPB reservation is to accommodate the discharge

from the dam and to protect the city from floods. This purpose gets

completely defeated by dumping debris on the low lying portion of

the river bed to elevate the level of the road. The respondents,

according to the applicants, are constructing the road within the

Mutha river bed itself and have elevated the level of the road by 20

ft. to 30 ft. by way of illegal dumping rubble and earth and tens of

thousands of truckloads of debris and soil are dumped right in the

river bed for elevating the road. As a result, there has been

reduction of the width of the river Mutha by about 55% and it is

bound to result in increased floods in the surrounding densely

populated residential areas during rainy season. The proposed road

shown in Exh.B.20, is stated to be touching Vitthalwadi Temple and

the surrounding structures are a few hundred years old ancient

structures built during Peshwa era and have been classified as

Grade I Heritage Buildings. It was imperative for the respondents to

obtain clearance    from the Archaeological Department before

commencing the construction but no such permission/approval

was sought. Irrigation Department of the State of Maharashtra have

also not granted any permission to the respondents to construct the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                     5</span>
 said road. In fact, the applicant No.1 had made an application on

20th March, 2012 under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_1">RTI Act</a> and collected

information from the Dy. Superintending Engineer, Pune Irrigation

Circle, who informed that construction of the road along Mutha

river from Vitthalwadi to National Highway No.4 was under progress

and that Irrigation Department had not given any approval. This

shows clear violation of law. According to the applicants, the cross

sectional drawing of Mutha river bed, prepared by the Corporation,

Respondent No.1, itself shows the possible damage to the river flow.

According to the analysis of the cross section of Mutha river bed,

there is a reduction in the width of the river from 291 m. to 131 m.

i.e. by 55%, which certainly reduces the water carrying capacity of

the river drastically and ultimately raises flood levels very steeply

during discharge from Khadakwasla dam in rainy season. Further,

it is the case of the applicants that during the rainy season in 2011,

the flood water also flowed beyond the road under construction and

this clearly shows that the road is not beyond the river bed but is

well within the river bed i.e. on submersible land strangulating

Mutha river.    The applicants claim to be citizens not opposed to

development of Pune city, suggested that it would have been much

wiser and prudent on the part of the        respondent    if   it   had

planned the road elevated on RCC pillars instead of constructing it

by earth filling. This would have certainly minimised the damage

that has already occurred to the river cross section, water carrying

capacity of the river and riparian zone but still would have

facilitated the traffic. Thus there would be the least risk of flooding


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                      6</span>
 the residential area on either side of the river. The storm water that

flows to Mutha river from hilly area would have flown to the river

with minimal obstruction thereby reducing the risk of flooding the

residential localities. It is noticed that the entire storm water from

the hills, parallel to the river, flows to Mutha river from the right

side through the densely populated residential areas. Thus, the

construction    of   the   road    is   bound    to   form   a   continuous

obstruction/barrier to the natural flow of the river, thereby

increasing storm water stagnation in the thickly populated

residential areas.       The applicants, with some emphasis, have

raised two specific grounds - one that the road is being constructed

by the respondents into the river bed (i.e. blue line) and secondly

huge dumping of debris have caused destruction of the riparian

zone along the Mutha river. Both these cause environmental,

ecological and social damages, and therefore, the applicants

claimed the prayed reliefs.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        3. We have now to examine the response of various

respondents in the pleaded case of the applicant. Respondent No. 4

the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (for short 'MPCB'), has

filed a very short reply primarily stating that most of the pleaded

facts    and   grounds     are   required   to   be   answered    by   other

respondents and particularly by Respondent No. 1 and Respondent

No. 3. However, it is stated that the board is granting consent to

establish and consent to operate the project which are engaged in

industrial operation, processing or establishment which are likely to

discharge sewage of affluent and establish and operate an


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                           7</span>
 industrial plant as defined under the provisions of Air (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_16">     4. This project of constructing a road connecting Vitthalwadi

and NH-4 bypass is an activity for which consent is needed.

Respondent No. 1 has not applied for grant of such a consent. The

probable reason stated is non-generation of domestic and industrial

effluents, emission of air pollutants from the Industrial plant and

non-requirement of Environmental Clearance (for short 'EC'). It is

averred that the EIA Notification, 2006 (for short 'the notification')

the construction of highway including construction of National

Highway and expansion of National Highway greater than 30 km

with additional right of width within 20 m involving land acquisition

and passing more than one State requires EC from the MoEF. Thus,

such State highway construction and expansion require EC from

the SEIAA. The project is not covered under the River Valley Project.

The Board in any case is not an appropriate/expert body to carry

out such assessment and grant such clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_17">     5. It is the case of Respondent No.4 that with an intention to

know the exact situation at the site, the field officer of Respondent

No.4 visited the site in question on 27th January, 2013. During the

visit, it was observed by him that the construction of the road was

in progress and nearly 40% of the work had been completed.

However, in view of the orders of the Tribunal and the fact that

permission of Irrigation Department had not been obtained, the

construction work of the road had been stopped. The field officer

also noticed that the construction of the road was being carried out


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                     8</span>
 by elevating the level by way of dumping rubble and earth. However,

an attempt was made to clarify at a subsequent stage that no

rubble, earth or any other polluting matter was being dumped at

the river bed. Keeping in view this situation, Respondent No.4 had

called for information and details of construction plan from

Respondent No.1. It may also be noticed here that the Board had

carried out ambient air quality monitoring tests at the spots decided

by the Board for the project in question. The results of such

analysis are at Annexure D to the reply filed by the Board. From

these results, it appears that the ambient air quality was in excess

of specified parameters.
</p>
<p id="p_18">     6. While averring that the project may not require EC, it is

stated that, it is for the MoEF, Government of India, to take final

decision in that regard. The stand of Respondent No. 3, the

Irrigation Department, Government of Maharashtra, according to its

reply, is that they have not given any permission for construction of

the road in Mutha River bed connecting Vitthalwadi and NH-4

bypass. It is averred that 24 m wide road has been constructed in

private land but not in river bed. The proposed connecting road is

constructed on the right side of the river in the low lying area. The

ground level on the right side of the river is low as compared to the

left of the river and flood water spreads primarily on the right side

of the river. The flood discharge of Khadakwala Dam is 97980

cusecs and considering free catchment area on downstream of

Khadakwala Dam, the estimated flood would be 1 lakh cusecs. As

per cross section of river side provided by Pune Municipal


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                    9</span>
 Corporation, the estimated peak flood will pass with high flood level

of 554.90m to 554.70m. The cross section area of the river would be

reduced by the said construction as there would be dumping of

debris and earth.
</p>
<p id="p_19">     7. The Additional City Engineer had applied for the issue of

NOC regarding construction of road vide letter dated 23th

September, 2010, and after getting information for these proposals,

the Divisional office had recommended to the Superintendent

Engineer, Pune Irrigation Department, vide letter dated 22th March,

2011 for getting the permission. But according to this affidavit

dated 4th March, 2013, neither permission had been granted nor

any NOC issued by Respondent No. 3 in favour of Respondent No.1

<p id="p_20">     8. Respondent No. 1 stated that permission was likely to be

granted and in fact it was in the process of being granted for

construction of the road by Respondent No. 3. Finally, the Chief

Engineer filed an additional affidavit on 23rd April, 2013, specifically

averring that both the certificates, NOC for construction of the flood

protecting bund and road from Vitthalwadi to NH-4 bypass were

issued in favour of Municipal Corporation, Pune, after approval

from the Chief Engineer. One of the controversies raised was that a

Government circular dated 2nd September, 1989, was issued by the

Deputy Secretary, Government of Maharashtra, that in such matter

NOC cannot be issued for construction on the blue line/river bed.

Certain clarification with regard to this circular was put forward.

On 15th April, 2013, Respondent No. 3 had issued NOC for the

 project in favour of Respondent No. 1 which is annexed as R-1 in

the affidavit dated 23rd April, 2013. This was a conditional NOC

had placed on record a copy of the letter dated 15th May, 2012

issued by Assistant Executive Engineer, Pune Irrigation Circle,

Pune, stating that no permission from the Irrigation Department

had been obtained. Even, the Chief Engineer of the Respondent No.

stated that they have not granted any permission to Respondent No.

2013, we had directed the Chief Engineer of Respondent No. 3 to be

present in Court to clearly put forward the stand of the Department.</blockquote><p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">     10. Respondent No. 1 has filed an independent reply. It is the

case of Respondent No. 1 that in the revised Development Plan for

Pune Municipal Corporation, old boundaries had been sanctioned

by the Urban Development Department vide letter dated 5th

January, 1987. The inclusion of 38 villages has been incorporated

in the Pune Municipal Corporation limits by the same department

vide their resolution dated 19th September, 1997. However, the

State Government of Maharashtra issued another resolution

deleting 15 villages in whole and 5 villages in part from Pune

Municipal     Corporation   boundary      vide    resolution   dated   17th

November, 2007. According to this respondent, the road from

Vitthalwadi    to   NH-4    bypass   is   being     constructed   as   per

development plan approved by the Government of Maharashtra vide

its resolution dated 15th May, 2008. The width of the road is 24 m


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                         12</span>
 to 18 m and not 30 m as stated by the applicant. It is claimed that

construction of the road had been undertaken only after taking into

consideration the river ecosystem by not affecting river bed

adversely. The road from Vitthalwadi to NH-4 bypass is being

constructed to a width of 24 m and beyond the river protection belt

as per sanctioned Development Plan. It is averred that while

construction of the road, the Municipal Corporation is also

constructing RCC protection wall on both sides of the proposed

road to prevent flooding of the low lying area adjacent to the

proposed road and there is no permanent dumping of debris in the

river belt. The excavated material is proposed to be lifted from the

site during the course of construction. As a result of construction of

the road, there shall be no reduction in the width of river bed and

the averments made by the applicant are therefore stated to be

incorrect.
</p>
<p id="p_23">     11. The Pune Municipal Corporation obtained NOC from the

Archaeological Department vide letter dated 15th April, 2011. In that

letter, it was stated that the NOC for construction of the work had

been given subject to the condition that PMC would be responsible

for safe relocation of the Archaeological remains and adequate care

would be taken to ensure that any kind of damage would not be

caused to the Vitthal Mandir.     PMC also decided to connect the

proposed Vitthalwadi to NH 4 to Sinhagad Road at a location before

the Vitthalwadi temple complex, as per the sanctioned Development

Plan as alternative route to the alignment originally planned from

existing bridge to Sinhagad Road. Thus the construction of the road


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                    13</span>
 would not have any effect on Vitthalwadi temple complex or area

adjacent to the complex.
</p>
<p id="p_24">     12. Reference is also made to the letter dated 20th March, 2012

of the Assistant Superintending Engineer, Irrigation Circle, Pune,

wherein it has been stated that after study of the cross section of

the river, duly prepared by Pune Municipal Corporation (for short

'PMC'), the said cross section would be capable to accommodate the

discharge of flood control line. On certain assumptions, the letter

also recorded that the road constructed, using the silt from the river

bed, passes mostly through the private owner's land. The PMC had

submitted the land acquisition proposal of the said land to the

office of the Land Acquisition Officer No.1, Pune. Considering the

above, it is proved that most of the land area under the said filling

was outside the authoritative river bed area. Significantly, it was

also noticed in this letter that till date the permission had not been

given by Irrigation Department. The work of the said road was still

in progress by PMC.
</p>
<p id="p_25">     13. It was also averred that the spread of flood water in the low

lying area cannot be termed as river bed or width of the river itself.

During the rainy season, the storm water discharged from various

natural streams cannot find its way to the river when the river is

flowing in high discharge level, which is normally observed at

several locations at the junction of two or more rivers, particularly

during monsoons. It is the case of Respondent No.1 with some

emphasis that construction of an elevated road on pillars and

beyond the river bed would involve unnecessary and extraordinary


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                    14</span>
 high expenditure to Respondent No.1, which would ultimately be a

liability on public exchequer. Construction of the road would help

in overcoming problem of the suburban area beyond the proposed

road. Construction of the road does not give rise to the issues raised

by the applicant, like environmental, ecological and that of social

damage. According to Respondent No.1, the road would also

significantly help in reducing traffic load on Sinhagad Road and

would save time and fuel of the population located between the river

and Sinhagad Road. It is expected that BRT Bridge, once

implemented on Sinhagad Road shall raise public transport

commuting from 8-9% to 32-35% bringing change in life style and

commuting pattern of the citizens.
</p>
<p id="p_26">     14. This Respondent thus has prayed that the project may be

continued as delay in completion of the project will have serious

financial repercussions.
</p>
<p id="p_27">     15. The applicant during the course of the hearing had filed a

rejoinder to   the   reply filed   by different respondents, more

particularly Respondent No. 1. In this rejoinder, it was averred that

there was complete prohibition on carrying out any activity in the

flood line area as it is a prohibited zone. It was also averred that by

the proposed cross section of the river, the elevated road during

flood is likely to cause serious damage to the interest of the people

and is also likely to reduce the width of the river. The width of the

river would likely be reduced at some sections by 55%. It was

reiterated that the Irrigation Department did not grant permission

to Respondent No. 1. In its letter dated 20th March, 2012, it has


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                     15</span>
 specifically stated that work of the road from Vitthalwadi to NH-4

along the Mutha Road was being done by PMC and much of the

portion of the said road covers the privately owned land and did not

come inside the river bed. The said road had not been approved by

Irrigation Department. To this rejoinder, the Respondent No. 1 was

directed to file additional reply vide our order dated 21st March,

2013. This additional reply was filed by Respondent No. 1 on 3rd

April, 2013.
</p>
<p id="p_28">     16. Besides reiterating the facts already stated in its pleadings,

Respondent No.1, in its reply/affidavit to the rejoinder, has

emphasised that the road is being constructed on a private land

and not on the river bed. Further, the low lying area will get

submerged in the rainy season or during floods. The area near the

river bank gets submerged due to rains in the catchment area as

well as due to natural stream on the Sinhagad Road side that joins

the river through the bridge already constructed on the proposed

road. The cross section area of the river after construction of the

proposed road on river bank is adequate to accommodate the flood

discharge of 100000 cusecs (red line). According to the respondent,

Irrigation Department has clearly supported this fact that the

maximum flood discharge at red line can be accommodated in the

cross section of the river. The drainage system is ready for flow of

storm water due to removal of silt and there is increase in the depth

of the river bed by 1.5 to 2.0 metres along with width relatively.

Hence the river flow capacity has been increased and the averment

made to the contrary by the applicant is incorrect. The respondents


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                     16</span>
 also claim that they have increased the cross sectional area as well

as water carrying capacity of the river. The modified cross section of

the river can accommodate the water during the floods. Besides all

this, the road is stated to be constructed in the larger public

interest and for public convenience at a low cost.   The    grievance

of the applicant is that Respondent No.1 has started construction of

the 30-metre wide and 2.35 km. long road in the river bed

connecting Vitthalwadi to NH-4 bypass and has resultantly raised

the following apprehensions to the environment and ecology of the

area in question: Shifting of pollution from city to river; Massive

dumping of construction material will cause hindrance in flow of

the river leading to deterioration of environment, loss of property

and human life;     Violation of development Plan; Obstruction in

natural storm water flow leading to flash floods; Environment and

ecological damages; and Destruction of Grade-I Heritage. Besides

above, the applicant also raised the grievance that No Objection

Certificate (for short the 'NOC') from Irrigation Department as well

as the Archaeological Survey of India had not been taken and the

project was being carried out with ulterior motive and particularly

with the intention to hurt the environment under the garb of public

interest. We have already noticed that these apprehensions are

being refuted by the respondent who claimed that all necessary

permissions were received; they were not required to take

environmental clearance either from the Ministry of Environment

and Forests (for short 'MoEF') or the State Environmental Impact

Assessment Authority (for short 'SEIAA') of Maharashtra. The


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                    17</span>
 project is intended to (i) serve a public purpose of reducing traffic

congestion on Sinhagad Road, (ii) save the Dam, (iii) reduce fuel

consumption, and (iv) consequently reduce vehicular pollution. In

nutshell, it is going to serve a public purpose. By providing an

alternative road, the traffic on the existing road shall be reduced

significantly. Speed, a primary element in traffic engineering, has a

wide range of environmental, economic and safety consequences.

Improved    safety,    fuel    consumption,   pollution   emission    and

associated vehicular related cost component would be major

considerations for environmental and economic considerations of

the road projects. The environment and ecology at large shall be

benefited by construction of this road due to reduced pollution level

in   the   city   of   Pune.    The   deficiencies,   discrepancies   and

disadvantages of this road project have been highlighted by the

applicant, while on the other its economic and environmental

advantages and the continuation of the project in accordance with

law is emphasised by the respondent. But even then, the expected

economic and environmental benefits need to be considered against

the expected environmental damage apprehended by the applicant

and that is where the need for deriving a balance arises. The

Tribunal is, therefore, expected to consider whether it is possible to

derive a balance between the apprehended environmental and

ecological damage on the one hand and the need for construction of

the road with its economic advantages on the other. Answer to this

question would depend on a number of factors which we shall now

proceed to discuss. First and the foremost, we have to examine


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                       18</span>
 whether Respondent No.1 was required to take environmental

clearance from the Central Government (MoEF) or the State

Government (SEIAA). It cannot be disputed if the Respondent was

required to take environmental clearance from any of these

authorities, then the project could not commence without grant of

such clearances. Another undisputed fact is that in the present

case, admittedly Respondent No.1 has not taken clearance from any

of the referred authorities. Thus, if this question is answered in the

affirmative, then the application of the applicant must succeed. If it

is answered in the negative, then we must proceed to examine other

aspects of this case. Regulation 2 of EIA Notification of 2006 makes

it obligatory upon the respondent to seek environmental clearance

from either the Central Government (MoEF) if the project falls under

category 'A' and from the SEIAA if it falls under category 'B'. The

Schedule to the said notification refers to paragraphs 2 and 7 of the

notification for enlisting the projects or activities requiring prior

environmental clearance. The entry 7(f) deals with the projects

relating to highways. The other entry reads as under:</p><pre id="pre_2">

</p>
<p id="p_31">

</p><p id="p_32">     17. It is obvious that the project, being in a State, would fall

under category 'B' if it relates to a State Highway. It is not averred

by the applicant that the construction of this road is a part of the

State Highway. It is clear from the record that the project in

question relates to 2.3 km long of 24 m. wide road from Vitthalwadi

to NH-4 bypass. In other words, it is just a local road connecting

two points while the one end meets the bypass of the State

Highway. 'Highway' under the Control of National Highways (Land

and <a href="/doc/151348/" id="a_3">Traffic) Act</a>, 2002 means a National Highway declared as such

under <a href="/doc/133170/" id="a_4">Section 2</a> of the National Highways Act, 1956 and includes

any Expressway or Express Highway vested in the Central


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                                    20</span>
 Government, whether surfaced or unsurfaced, and also includes (i)

all lands appurtenant to the Highway, whether demarcated or not,

acquired for the purpose of the Highway or transferred for such

purpose by the State Government to the Central Government; (ii) all

bridges, culverts, tunnels, causeways, carriageways, etc. as stated

in that definition. The State Highways on that analogy would mean

all the State Highways which are so declared in accordance with

law. No records have been placed before us to show that this road

has been declared as a State Highway in terms of any law in force.

'Road' simpliciter would mean a way or a passage.

</p><p id="p_33">     18. From the records before the Tribunal, it is clear that the

road project is not a State Highway in fact and in law. As already

noticed, it is not even the case of the applicant that it is a State

Highway. This being the undisputed position, the question of

seeking environmental clearance from SEIAA in terms of Regulation

2 read with Entry 7(f) of the Schedule to Notification of 2006 would

not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_34">     19. The other objection raised by the applicant is with regard

to non-grant of NOC for construction of the proposed road by the

Archaeology and Museum Directorate of Maharashtra Government.

According to the applicant, this permission is essential for the

reason that Vitthalwadi temple and its surrounding structures are

ancient and protected monuments and the grant of permission is a

sine qua non for commencement of the project work. It is

undisputed that Vitthalwadi temple was constructed during Peshwa

era and is a protected monument. Further, it is not disputed that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                                  21</span>
 the project in question is in a very close vicinity to this monument,

and therefore, it requires clearance of the Archaeology Department.

On   6th   December,   2010,   Respondent      No.1    approached      the

Archaeology Department for grant of an NOC. After raising certain

queries, finally, vide their letter dated 15th April, 2011, the

Directorate   of    Archaeology     and     Museums,         Maharashtra

Government,    granted    conditional     permission   for    taking   up

construction of the road as per the project. The condition imposed

was that it should protect the old remains and care to be taken not

to damage Vitthalwadi temple while widening the road, which shall

be the responsibility of Respondent No.1. In the present application,

there is no challenge before us to the grant of such NOC. Once

there is no challenge to the permission dated 15th April, 2011, there

is no need for us to go behind such grant of permission but

certainly the Tribunal will have to ensure that Respondent No.1

strictly adheres to the conditions imposed by the said Department

in its letter dated 15th April, 2011. Except to this extent, we need

not deliberate on this issue any further. In the facts of the case, the

contention raised by the applicant is without merits.

</p><p id="p_35">     20. Now we shall deal with the next contention raised on

behalf of the applicant that Irrigation Department has not granted

any permission to Respondent No.1 to carry out the road project at

all and in any case on the river bed or the blue line area. Further,

the contention is that even if such permission has been granted at

any subsequent stage to the filing of the present application, even

then it has not been granted by the competent authority, as in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                        22</span>
 terms of the circular dated 21st September, 1989, issued by the

State of Maharashtra, the construction below red line in the river

bed is prohibited.
</p>
<p id="p_36">      21. This contention of the applicant can safely be dissected

into two parts. First relates to the factum of granting or otherwise of

the   permission     by   Irrigation    Department     of   the   State   of

Maharashtra, while the other relates to competence and correctness

of such permission, if issued. As far as the first part-point of fact is

concerned, there is no dispute that at the time of institution of the

present application, no permission whatsoever had been granted by

the Department of Irrigation to Respondent No.1. There also cannot

be any dispute to the fact that the work of the project had been

commenced by Respondent No.1 without having been granted any

such permission. It is only when the counsel appearing before the

Tribunal had stated that no such permission had been granted.

However, during the pendency and hearing of the application, it was

stated by the counsel appearing for Irrigation Department that the

authorities   concerned     were       considering   the    application   of

Respondent No.1 for grant of permission. We may notice that it was

vide letter dated 23rd September, 2010 that an application had been

moved for seeking permission of the Department. Vide letter dated

20th March, 2012, Irrigation Department had noticed that no

permission had been given by them for the road project from

Vitthalwadi to NH-4 bypass, which was in progress. Even thereafter,

by the Executive Engineer, Khadakwasla Irrigation Division, Pune,

to Respondent No.1. The NOC was conditional and we have already

reproduced the same above. As the matter stood at the time of final

arguments, the NOC for construction of the project was issued only

on 15th April, 2013. It is not understandable as to how Respondent

No.1 started the work of the project without seeking such

permission when admittedly, it was mandatory for Respondent No.1

to do so.

<p id="p_37">     22. Be that as it may, the fact of the matter is that as of now,

Irrigation Department has granted NOC to Respondent No.1. Thus

the matter has to proceed further from that stage. The latter part of

the submission of the counsel for the applicant relates to non-

construction in the prohibited zone and who was competent to vary

the said restriction and if so, to what extent? The circular dated 21 st

September, 1989 was issued by the Assistant Secretary, Irrigation

Department, Government of Maharashtra. This circular related to

issuance of necessary instructions in connection with demarcation

of flood lines, the guidelines in respect of flood zone and respective

flood lines and use of land in the flood zone in Chapter 8 of the

Dam Safety Manual, 1984. This circular importantly noticed that

the flood lines are of two types - blue line which prohibits the

construction in an area due to probability of flood during any year;

and red line shows water level upto which flood can occur during

any year depending upon rainfall, but generally 1 in 100 years. The

contour line deciding the boundary of prohibitive zone on both

 banks of the river is called blue line, while the contour line deciding

the boundary of restricted zone on both banks of the river is called

red line. Construction of controlled nature could be done below the

red line but excluding the prohibitive zone considering the flood

situation in the area. The relevant part of the said circular can be

referred to as follows:

provisions    of   the    Manual   and   the   circular   issued   by   the

Government, the Chief Engineer and any other officer of Irrigation

Department is not vested with the powers to vary the terms of the

said circular. To counter this, Respondent No.1 and the State have

relied upon Appendix 42 of Maharashtra Public Works Manual,

showing administrative and financial powers in terms of which the

Chief Engineer possesses full powers in regard to technical sanction

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                                         25</span>
 of original works classified under all major heads. The Safety

Manual, according to the respondent, is prepared for Irrigation

Department for preparedness for dealing with emergency situations

of the Dams and as per the circular dated 8th October, 2007 issued

by Irrigation Department, Government of Maharashtra, regarding

issuance of NOC for establishment of townships, it is the

requirement to assess the hazardous potentiality of floods to nearby

habitations in the vicinity of the river and the Chief Engineer is

competent to issue NOC, who is also the Canal Officer under the

Maharashtra Irrigation Act, 1976.
</p>
<p id="p_40">     24. From the bare reading of the above circular dated 21st

September, 1989, it is clear that the main river bed and the area on

both the banks of the river required to carry the controlled

discharge from the Dam and the catchment area below the Dam,

which is the prohibited zone. The line deciding the boundary of this

prohibited zone on both banks of the river is called the blue line.

The prohibited zone requires that no construction can be raised in

that area. The blue line thus is the end of that river bed upon which

no construction can be permitted. This circular had been issued by

the competent authority in the State Government and it admits of

no delegation. Two aspects are very clear - one that the circular has

been issued by the Assistant Secretary concerned on behalf of the

Government without any power of delegation and secondly, the

circular does not admit of any exceptions. In these circumstances,

the only way to get over the restriction of the circular is that the

competent authority in the Government had to withdraw or modify


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                                   26</span>
 the circular. The Chief Engineer of Irrigation Department admits the

above position. However, he claims to have the authority to issue

the NOC for construction of the road including the blue line on the

strength of the Maharashtra Public Works Manual (Appendix 42).

Vesting of financial and administrative powers for the works stated

under the Maharashtra Public Works Manual is one thing and

cannot be stretched to the extent of empowering the said Chief

Engineer to overrule or render ineffective a circular issued by the

competent authority in the State in exercise of his executive powers.

The Chief Engineer is not vested with the power to vary the terms of

the circular, and that too to the extent of violation. The powers

stated to be vested in the Chief Engineer relate to the execution of

the   works   that   are   awarded   by   the   Department.     These

administrative and financial powers are, therefore, primarily

intended to regulate the affairs of Irrigation Department including

execution of the works awarded. We are unable to contribute to the

views advanced on behalf of Irrigation Department that it had the

power to render the circular dated 21st September, 1989 otiose.

</p><p id="p_41">      25. Another facet of this aspect is that the circular had been

issued by way of guidelines in respect of flood zone, respective flood

line and use of land in the flood zone. It was read in conjunction

with the Dam Safety Manual. It was issued with the intention to

prevent heavy damage that may occur along the river due to heavy

rain and flood water during monsoon. It was also to prevent undue

interference with the flow of the river and the ecology of the area in

question. The floods result from heavy rains or from release of water


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                                    27</span>
 from the Dam; it is stated to be so close to the site where the road

was being constructed. It is to prevent damage to persons and

property on the one hand and protect environment on the other.

Both these purposes are being interfered with by issuance of NOC

by the Chief Engineer, which apparently was not within his

competence. In our considered view, it would have been appropriate

for the Chief Engineer to refer the case to the Secretary concerned

including   the   Secretary    (Environment)     before   making    his

recommendations and requesting them to modify the circular

accordingly. Thus, it should have been left in the wisdom and to the

decision of the authorities concerned and there was no justification

for the Chief Engineer to exceed his power, particularly in the

manner in which it had been done in the facts of the present case.

This aspect has to be examined in the light of the fact that

Respondent No.1 had applied for obtaining the NOC from Irrigation

Department on 23rd September, 2010. This permission was not

granted until 15th April, 2013. For all this long period, Irrigation

Department had taken a stand that they would not grant

permission for the project in question. In fact, vide their letter dated

20th March, 2012, they had even written that no NOC had been

issued by Irrigation Department and the work of the project was in

progress, which obviously meant that the construction of the

project was being carried out in an unauthorised and illegal

manner. It is not clear why this sudden change of mind took place

when the matter was pending before the Tribunal and was being

vehemently argued by the parties by raising their respective

 contentions. The cumulative effect of the above circular and the

correspondence referred to above is that until 15th April, 2013, no

permission had been granted by the authorities of Irrigation

Department for commencement of the work of the project and the

construction work being carried out by Respondent No.1 of the

project in question was not in accordance with law.

Ecology and Sustainable Development with reference to the facts

and circumstances of the present case:
</p>
<p id="p_42">     26. Despite the fact that the Chief Engineer of the Irrigation

Department was not competent to negate the circular dated 21st

September, 1989 issued by the State Government of Maharashtra,

and had any competence to issue NOC permitting construction even

on the blue line and also keeping in mind that more than 40% of

the work of the project had been completed without even any

permission from the Department of Irrigation and other competent

authorities, still we have to examine as to whether this development

(i.e. the completion of the project) should be permitted in the larger

interest of development or not. If the answer to the above be in

affirmative, then subject to what conditions further work of the

project should be permitted. From the above facts and the records

before us, it is clear that Respondent No.1 had not obtained either

the SEIAA clearance or clearance from Archaeological Department.

It had also not obtained NOC from Irrigation Department before it

commenced the work of the project. Clearance by Archaeological

Department was granted on 15th April, 2011 and NOC by Irrigation

Department was given on 15th April, 2013. It is not in dispute before

 us that more than 40% work of the project has been completed on

which large public funds have been spent. The Tribunal has either

to direct demolition of the road already constructed with a further

direction that the project be abandoned and no further construction

be carried out or to permit completion of the project subject to

certain specific conditions while protecting the environmental

interest to the extent possible with reference to the facts and

circumstance of the present case. This is where the judicial

discretion of the Tribunal is to be exercised while striking a balance

between development      on    the    one   hand    and    environmental

protection on the other. Developmental and environmental needs

have to be seen in complement to each other and not in

antagonistic terms. We must keep in mind that development can

take place only when there is earth left for the purpose. Inclusive

development     would   not   be     possible    without   emphasis   on

environmental protection. The Tribunal cannot overlook the fact

that the world is facing the harmful consequences of global

warming and depletion of resources. Environmental conservation

has become a topic of global significance. Such matters are of

paramount relevance in a developing economy like ours as

environmental    degradation       drastically   offsets   improvements

achieved for economic prosperity, apart from having serious

implications of distributive justice. One school of thought states

that it is not about environment versus economy, not a trade-off

between unemployment and pollution and certainly not about

picking up one over the other. We need both the environment and

 the   economy    and   such    conditions   must   be        created   that

development takes place without affecting and causing irretrievable

damage to the environment. Both must thrive.

<p id="p_43">      27. <a href="/doc/1223975/" id="a_5">In Susetha v. State of Tamil Nadu</a> AIR 2006 SC 2893, the

Supreme     Court   observed   that   the   doctrine    of     sustainable

development is not an empty slogan. It is required to be

implemented taking the pragmatic view and not on ipse dixit of the

Court. Following the same principle, it cannot more so be applied

on an administrative authority or a Corporation vested with the

statutory obligation of providing environmental protection to the

residents under its jurisdiction. Sustainable development means

that the richness of the earth's bio-diversity would be conserved for

future generations by greatly slowing or if possible halting

extinctions, habitat and ecosystem destruction, and also by not

risking significant alterations of the global environment that might -

by an increase in sea level or changing rainfall and vegetation

patterns or increasing ultraviolet radiation - alter the opportunities

available for future generations. Sustainable development has been

defined in many ways but the most frequently quoted definition is

from the Brundtland Report which states as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">               "Sustainable development is development that meets
          the needs of the present without compromising the ability of
          future generations to meet their own needs. It contains
          within it two key concepts:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">                  The concept of needs, in particular the essential
                     needs of the world's poor, to which overriding
                     priority should be given; and
                  The idea of limitations imposed by the state of
                     technology and social organisation on the
                     environment's ability to meet present and future
                     needs."
</blockquote>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                                         31</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">      28. The concept of sustainable development is rooted in this

sort of systematic thinking. It helps us to understand ourselves and

our world. The problems we face are complex and serious - and we

can't address them in the same way we created them.</blockquote><p id="p_44">

</p><p id="p_45">     29. While applying the concept of sustainable development,

one has to keep in mind the "principle of proportionality based on

the concept of balance. It is an exercise in which courts or tribunals

have to balance the priorities of development on the one hand and

environmental protection on the other. So sustainable development

should also mean the type or extent of development that can take

place and which can be sustained by nature/ecology with or

without mitigation. In these matters, the required standard now is

that the risk of harm to the environment or to human health is to

be decided in public interest, according to a 'reasonable person's

test. (Refer Research Foundation for <a href="/doc/548962/" id="a_6">Science and Technology and

Court, while referring to the principles of balance inbuilt in the

concept of sustainable development, elaborated the principles as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">           "228. I have referred to the aforesaid pronouncements
           only to highlight that this Court has emphasized on
           striking a balance between the ecology and
           environment on one hand and the projects of public
           utility on the other. The trend of authorities is that a
           delicate balance has to be struck between the
           ecological impact and development. The other
           principle that has been ingrained is that if a project is
           beneficial for the larger public, inconvenience to
           smaller number of people is to be accepted. It has to
           be respectfully accepted as a proposition of law that
           individual interest or, for that matter, smaller public
           interest must yield to the larger public interest.
           Inconvenience of some should be bypassed for a larger
           interest or cause of the society. But, a pregnant one,
           the present case really does not fall within the four
           corners of that principle. It is not a case of the land
           oustees. It is not a case of "some inconvenience". It is
           not comparable to the loss caused to property. I have
           already emphasized upon the concept of living with
           the borrowed time of the future generation which
           essentially means not to ignore the inter-generational
           interests. Needless to emphasize, the dire need of the
           present society has to be treated with urgency, but,
           the said urgency cannot be conferred with absolute
           supremacy over life. Ouster from land or deprivation of
           some benefit of different nature relatively would come
           within the compartment of smaller public interest or
           certain inconveniences. But when it touches the very
           atom of life, which is the dearest and noblest
           possession of every person, it becomes the obligation
           of the constitutional courts to see how the delicate
           balance has been struck and can remain in a
           continuum in a sustained position. To elaborate,
           unless adequate care, caution and monitoring at every
           stage is done and there is constant vigil, life of "some"
           can be in danger. That will be totally shattering of the
           constitutional guarantee enshrined under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_11">Article 21</a> of
           the Constitution."</blockquote><p id="p_46">




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                                                       33</span>
</p><p id="p_47">      30.   The above stated principles illustratively demonstrate

that judicial balance of both these concepts would not permit

undue significance being attached to either of them at the cost of

the other. The concept of sustainable development in essence

admits to balance the scale between the quantity of development

and the quality of environment. The earlier school of thought was

that development and ecology are opposed to each other but with

the passage of time and development of law, this concept has

undergone a tremendous change and is no longer acceptable and

now prevails the doctrine of 'sustainable development'. The

principle of sustainable development takes within its ambit the

application   of    the     'principle    of     proportionality'       and    the

'precautionary     principle'.   In   other      words,    one   must,        while

permitting development, not only ensure that no substantial

damage is caused to the environment but also take such preventive

measures which would ensure no irretrievable damage to the

environment even in future on the premise on intergenerational

equity. All these principles have to be examined and applied on the

touch stone of "reasonable person's test''. As already indicated, we

are a developing country, and therefore, have to take somewhat

liberal   approach towards development               but    certainly    not    by

compromising       the    environmental        interest.   The   precautionary

principle can be explained to say that it contemplates that an

activity which poses danger and threat to environment is to be

prevented. Prevention is better than cure. It means that the State

Governments and the local authorities are supposed to anticipate


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                                                                 34</span>
 and then prevent the causes of environmental degradation. The

likelihood of danger to the environment has to be based upon

scientific   information,   data   available   and   analysis   of   risks.

Ecological impact should be given paramount consideration and it

is more so when resources are non-renewable or where the end

result would be irreversible. The principle of precaution involves

anticipation of environmental harm and taking measures to avoid it

or to choose the least environmentally harmful activity. Again it is

based on scientific uncertainty.
</p>
<p id="p_48">     31. The Supreme Court had the occasion to explain the

principle of precaution and the burden of proof in environmental

cases. In some elaboration, in the case of <a href="/doc/764031/" id="a_12">A.P. Pollution Control

Board v. Prof. M.V. Nayudu</a> (1999) 2 SCC 718, after discussing

various judgments, the Supreme Court concluded that:

     that case, Kuldip Singh, J. stated as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_27">     36. It is to be noticed that while the inadequacies of science
     have led to the 'precautionary principle', the said
     'precautionary principle' in its turn, has led to the special
     principle of burden of proof in environmental cases where
     burden as to the absence of injurious effect of the actions
     proposed, is placed on those who want to change the status
     quo (Wynne, Uncertainty and Environmental Learning, 2
     Global Envtl. Change 111 (1992) at p. 123). This is often
     termed as a reversal of the burden of proof, because
     otherwise in environmental cases, those opposing the
     changes would be compelled to shoulder the evidentiary
     burden, a procedure which is not fair. Therefore, it is
     necessary that the party attempting to preserve the status
     quo by maintaining a less-polluted state should not carry the
     burden of proof and the party who wants to alter it, must
     bear this burden. (See James M. Olson, Shifting the Burden

     appropriate to place the burden of proof on the person or

     run by regulatory inaction are in some way "ascertain but
     non-negligible", then regulatory action is justified.. This will
     lead to the question as to what is the non-negligible risk'. In
     such a situation, the burden of proof is to be placed on those
     attempting to alter the status quo. They are to discharge this
     burden by showing the absence of a 'reasonable ecological or

     result would be that if insufficient evidence is presented by
     them to alleviate concern about the level of uncertainty, then

some cases, it may also be applicable to anticipate damage to

environment while taking the aid of precautionary or preventive

 obligation upon the Tribunal to examine the sustainable and

planned development with a greater caution and with special

protection to the environment. A Bench of this Tribunal, in case of

Suresh Bhai Keshav Bhai Wagankar v. State of Gujarat, in

application No.65 of 2012 decided on 9th May, 2013, while

referring to the principles stated by the Supreme Court in the case

of Research Foundation for <a href="/doc/18451466/" id="a_15">Science and Technology and Natural

Resource Policy v. Union of India &amp; Anr</a>. (2005) 10 SCC 510,

explained the precautionary principle in the context of different

facts and circumstances and held that the precautionary principle

of sustainable development provides for taking protection against

specific   environmental   hazards    by   avoiding    or   reducing

environmental risks before specific harms are experienced.


</p><p id="p_51">     33. Another doctrine that needs to be noticed at this stage is

the doctrine of public trust. This doctrine is more an affirmation of

State power to creation of public property for public purpose. It is

an affirmation of the duty of the state to protect the people's

common heritage of streams, lakes, marshlands and tidelands,

surrendering that right of protection only in rare cases when the

abandonment of that right is consistent with the purposes of the

trust.
</p>
<p id="p_52">
</p><p id="p_53">     34. Now let us revert to the facts of the present case. 2.35 km

long road is sought to be constructed with the width of 24 metres,

connecting Vitthalwadi to NH-4 bypass. This road is being

constructed certainly at some portion in the river bed i.e. the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                                                    37</span>
 prohibited zone (blue line). So far as the construction of the bridge

touching or beyond the red line is concerned, there cannot be any

serious objection to its construction. However, when it touches the

blue line or falls in the prohibitory zone i.e. the river bed, even

inside the blue line, serious objections have been raised by the

applicant in this regard. Annexure 2/1 filed by Respondent No.3 is

the corrected map placed on record. It shows the flow of the river,

river bed, blue line and the red line. Between the blue line and the

red line, there are structures in existence like Atharva Terace

Apartments, River View Residency Apartments on the one hand

while Puja Park, Nimraj Nagar, Gayatri, Radhakrishna, Kudale

Patil, Anand Park, Jal Tarang, Shrm Saffale, Jal Vihar, Jal Pugan,

Sham Sundar Apartments on the other, which are structures on

or even inside the blue line. Major part of the high rise road is

being constructed inside the blue line and to a large extent in the

river bed. During the course of hearing, we were informed that the

Sham Sundar Apartments/structure has been issued notice by

Respondent No.1 for demolition on certain grounds.


</p><p id="p_54">     35. The red line, as reflected in this Annexure is the highest

flood level 1 in 25 years. Between the red and the blue lines,

various structures belonging to different societies have been

raised. Alignment of the high rise road apparently appears to be in

violation of the circular and is an apparent infringement of

environment and ecology. Construction of the high rise road

without elevated pillars in the river bed is bound to cause drastic

degradation of the environment as well as obstruct the natural

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                                    38</span>
 flow of the river, particularly during monsoons. The alignment of

the existing road has been shown in yellow colour which ends at

Slab Drain on the one side and near the boundary wall at point

0+400. The high rise road from 0+450 point to 1+750 point is

totally aligned in the river bed and much inside the blue line. Of

course, the width of the road is 25 metres, as reflected in

Annexure 2/1, filed by Respondent No.3. If the high rise road on

the river bed is constructed entirely or even on a major part

thereof by concrete and not on elevated pillars, it is bound to

result in serious environmental disadvantages like :


</p><p id="p_55">  (a) Narrow river passage/flood plain which would obviously

     result in adversely affecting the civilisation during floods in

     the river.
</p>
<p id="p_56">  (b) Obstruction in flow of storm water/rainy water from

     drains/nullahs and the flow shall enter the other side of the

     proposed elevated road, thereby cause flooding in the area.

</p><p id="p_57">  (c) Insufficiency of cross drainage at appropriate locations.

</p><p id="p_58">  (d) Dredging of even two km. in the river will not protect floods

     and damage to the ecology as it would become a pool of water

     unless or until a proper gradient in downstream is provided.


</p><p id="p_59">     36. Besides this, it is very important to avoid environmental

damage and in the interest of ecology, flood plains are maintained

properly. As the flood plains provide important ecological services

like ensuring flow in streams for most of the year through

modulation of the river-discharge by conserving huge flow of water


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                                    39</span>
 derived from peak flow and storm run off during the rainy season

and releasing it gradually; recharge the ground water and improve

its quality, besides flood plain produce resources like fodder, fuel

and timber. Also these provide breeding and feeding ground for

fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds and other living creatures in

addition to improving water quality through retention and

transformation of nutrients and other chemicals. These services or

benefits would be adversely affected by any encroachment of the

flood plains. In the present case, the total flood plain proposed to

be encroached is 2.35 km.
</p>
<p id="p_60">
</p><p id="p_61">     37. These, amongst others, are a few disadvantages of the

project in question besides there being logistic deficiencies like

lack of permission or grant of improper permission. The need for

the project is sought to be justified on the ground of larger public

interest i.e. providing an alternative route to the commuters as

well as to reduce vehicular pollution. It is expected to solve public

transportation problem of about 5 lakh citizens who rely on the

Sinhagad Road, as their main connectivity by the arterial road to

the city. It is likely to reduce travel time as well as pollution level.

On the contrary, the applicant's main contention is that besides

causing   degradation    of   the   environment,    the   intention   of

Respondent No.1 is to help the property grabbers unauthorisedly

by reclaiming the land, falling even within the red/blue line and to

give them undue advantage. In fact, the real intention of the

respondent is to construct the road by compacting and earth

filling and to facilitate selected private land owners to reclaim the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                                       40</span>
 river bed up to the road by converting no development zone inside

the flood plain into residential zone. Of course, this allegation has

been refuted by Respondent No.1. It is also argued on behalf of

Respondent No.1 that raising construction on elevated pillars

would prove much more expensive than its construction by

compacting and earth filling. This argument does not impress us.

If the Corporation-authorities have taken a decision to take up the

project in public interest, then it must also bear its cost and

higher cost, if necessary and also unavoidable in the larger

environmental interest. The authorities cannot be permitted to

cause irreversible damage to the environment and ecology of the

area and even expose the inhabitants of the vicinity to undue flood

risks on the ground that the project is being taken up in public

interest merely for providing an alternative road and for reducing

the vehicular pollution. Firstly, Respondent No.1 has not placed

any scientific data or analysis on record before us in support of its

contention, even for the sake of arguments, that there would be

reduction in environmental pollution and great convenience will

accrue to the public by reduction in the travel time. Applying the

principle of proportionality, even if an alternative route is

provided, still the balance would tilt in favour of environment and

we would still require Respondent No.1 to carry out the project

subject to such conditions which would strive equitable balance

between the development on the one hand and the environment on

the other. If Respondent No.1 is of the firm view, and particularly

in view of the NOC dated 15th April, 2013 having been issued by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                                                    41</span>
 Irrigation Department, to carry out the project, then it has to be

subject to such stringent conditions as would protect the

environment and ecology as well as greater public interest by

preventing floods etc. Keeping in view the above rival contentions

and the facts of the present case, normally, we would have

accepted the petition and prohibited carrying out the project any

further with the specific demolition of the part of the road. The

road can be raised by elevated pillars in the area that will fall

within the blue line or inside the blue line. The construction of

elevated pillars at that stage would neither obstruct the flow of the

river nor narrow the flood plain. Furthermore, it will also help the

storm or drain water to freely join the river during larger part of

the area.

<p id="p_62">
</p><p id="p_63">     38. However, keeping in mind the public interest, that by

imposition of certain conditions, environmental and ecological

interests can be safeguarded, we would permit Respondent No.1 to

complete the project. Accordingly, we impose the following

conditions subject to which the project could continue:


</p><p id="p_64">  (a) The interim order dated 4th January, 2013 and subsequent

     interim orders shall stand vacated and Respondent No.1

     would be permitted to carry out and complete the project of

     building only 24 metre wide road from Vitthalwadi to NH-4

     bypass as shown in Annexure R-2/1 strictly and subject to

     the conditions stated hereinafter.
</p>
<p id="p_65">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                                                    42</span>
</p><p id="p_66"> (b) Respondent No.1 shall make every effort to realign the road

  to bring it as far as possible closer to and beyond the blue

  line, right from chainage of 0+400 to 1+750 of Exh. Annexure

  2/1. It shall ensure to extend the least part of the project in

  the river bed/blue line.
</p>
<p id="p_67">(c) The road/project shall be constructed on elevated pillars

  alone in the area that falls within the blue line.

</p><p id="p_68">(d) We direct Respondent No.1 to remove the debris dumped at

  the present site and shift the same to the red line by

  following 1 in 25 years rule.
</p>
<p id="p_69">(e) A massive plantation should be undertaken on both sides of

  the river, also in the no-development zone by Respondent

  No.1 as well as the State Government of Maharashtra.

  Adequate protective measures should be undertaken to

  prevent flooding and submerging of the residential area along

  the proposed road.
</p>
<p id="p_70">(f) The conditions imposed by the Chief Engineer, Irrigation

  Department, vide his NOC dated 15th April, 2013 shall

  mutatis mutandis be part of the present directions. The same

  shall be read in aid and not in derogation to the conditions

  stated in this order.
</p>
<p id="p_71">(g) As already noticed and highlighted during the course of the

  hearing, a large number of structures have come up at and

  even inside the blue line of the river Mutha. Respondent No.1

  itself has issued notice to some of such structures for

  demolition. Thus, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                                                43</span>
      the case, we further direct that Respondents No.1, 3 and 4

     shall    take    appropriate   steps    against   unauthorised

     constructions, if any, raised on and inside the blue line and

     pass order of demolition or such other order as is permissible

     in accordance with law. We also direct the said authorities to

     ensure    that   no   encroachment     is   permitted   and   no

     construction in future is permitted on and inside the blue

     line of the river Mutha.
</p>
<p id="p_72">
</p><p id="p_73">     39. The imposition of the above conditions is necessary in the

interest of environment and ecology. It is better to take

precautions at this stage, even at the cost of additional expenses

rather than to face floods, disaster, loss of person and property

and irreversible damages to ecology and environment. The

precautionary principle, which is a part of the law of the land now

and is a Constitutional mandate in terms of Articles 21, 48A and

51A(g) of the Constitution of India, that require the State to

safeguard and protect the environment and wild life of the

country. It is expected of Respondents No.1 and 3 to anticipate

and then prevent the causes of environmental degradation.

Furthermore, no public interest would suffer by imposition of the

above conditions. If the conditions imposed under this order are

found to be onerous by the State, particularly Respondent No.1,

then they can even give up the project on river Mutha as an

alternative road on the other side of the river has already been

constructed to provide the connectivity. In the event the

Department decides to give up the road project, it shall be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                                    44</span>
 incumbent on it to remove all debris from within the blueline that

has been used to create the high rise road segment. It is stated to

be a 100 ft. wide road on the left bank of the river Mutha giving

connectivity with the same bypass. Thus, in the present case,

Respondent No.1 has options and alternatives available to it while

ensuring that both the public interest and the environment do not

suffer.
