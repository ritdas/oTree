    after 31st March, 2017, despite repeated notices, respondent

    No. 2 vide communication dated 29th November, 2017 granted

    last opportunity of seven days to the petitioner to apply for

    renewal of consent to operate the hotel, but fact remains that


    no steps whatsoever were taken by the petitioner to get

    necessary permission from the Pollution Control Board, as a




    consequence of which, respondent No. 3 in compliance to





    directions issued by respondent No. 2 disconnected the power

    supply of the hotel being run by petitioner.

    that sullage and sewerage generated from the Hotel Bye Pass





    Dhaba Dhalli near Tunnel Shimla-12, is        properly connected

    with M.C. Sewerage line and leading to STP Dhalli. Learned

    Counsel further     contends that the petitioner has already





    complied with all necessary codal formalities for renewal but

    despite repeated requests, no steps are being taken by the

    Pollution Control Board to renew the consent to operate the

    hotel. He further contends that due to disconnection of the

    electricity, the petitioner is incurring huge loss and, as such,


    necessary directions may be issued to respondent No. 2 to

    renew the consent to operate the hotel.
