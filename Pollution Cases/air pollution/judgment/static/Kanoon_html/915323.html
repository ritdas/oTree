ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 


 

<p id="p_1">		By
way of the present appeal under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_1">Section 378</a> of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2"> the Code</a>  for short), the appellant   Gujarat
Pollution Control Board ( the Board  for short) has questioned
the legality and validity of the impugned judgement and order of
discharge dated 11th October, 1992 passed by the learned
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad in Criminal Case No.1707 of
1989.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_2">2.		The
facts of the case briefly summarised are that the Assistant Law
Officer of the appellant-Board lodged a complaint in exercise of the
powers conferred upon him against the respondents -  original
accused. The respondent No.1   Vadalia Metal Corporation is a
partnership firm and respondent Nos.2 to 6 are its partners and
respondent No.7 is its manager. It is alleged in the complaint lodged
by the Board that the respondents - original accused, who are engaged
in the business of manufacturing the cold roll stainless steel sheets
and are using heat roll stainless steel plates as raw material, are
required to use water in the manufacturing process and without
obtaining any approval from the appellant-Board, they are discharging
trade effluent without any treatment. It is also alleged that a
notice dated 25th May, 1988 was served upon respondent
No.1 and its partners by Registered Post A.D., informing them to
maintain the parameters of the trade effluent, as required under the
law, as they are discharging the effluent without giving them
treatment. On 2nd June, 1989, the officers of the
appellant-Board visited the factory premises of respondent No.1 and
serving the notice under <a href="/doc/490311/" id="a_3">Section 21(3)(a)</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp;
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 ( the Act  for short) upon
respondent No.7   Manager, who was present at that time, a sample
of the effluent discharged by respondent No.1 was taken in his
presence and was sent for analysis. Accordingly, the analyst analysed
the sample and sent the report dated 17th May, 1989 to the
appellant-Board, a copy of which was also sent to respondent No.1 on
2nd June, 1989. As the analysis report revealed that the
respondents-original accused have not maintained the parameters which
were informed to them by the Notice dated 25th May, 1988
and have continued to discharge polluted trade effluent in
contravention of the instructions and conditions of the Notice dated
25th May, 1988, the complaint came to be lodged against
them alleging that the respondents-accused have committed the offence
under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_5">Sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_6">44</a> of the Act and appropriate punishment may be
imposed upon them. On the basis of the aforesaid complaint being
lodged, it came to be registered as Criminal Case No. 1707 of 1989. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_3">2.1		The
learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate has considered the material and
evidence adduced by the complainant-Board and having not found
sufficient material, he did not frame the charges and came to the
conclusion that there is prima facie nothing on record to
establish that the accused have committed the alleged offence under
<a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_7">Sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_8">44</a> of the Act and ultimately, passed the impugned
judgement and order discharging the accused persons.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_4">2.2		It
is against this judgement and order, the present appeal has been
preferred by the appellant-Board on various grounds inter alia
that the learned Magistrate has erred in discharging the accused
persons for the offence under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_9">Section 44</a> of the Act and has not
followed the provisions of <a href="/doc/1568411/" id="a_10">Section 245</a> of the Code. It is also
contended that while taking the evidence or deciding as to whether
the charges are required to be framed against the accused persons,
the learned Magistrate has failed to appreciate the evidence adduced
by the prosecution and has wrongly discharged the accused. It has
also been contended that while taking the evidence for the purpose,
the learned Magistrate  is required to consider as to whether any
prima facie case has been made out or not. It has also been
contended that the learned Magistrate has assumed that the inspection
report has not stated the details and therefore, it cannot be
believed.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_5">3.		Mr.
</p><p id="p_6">Yogesh Lakhani, learned Counsel for the appellant, has referred to
the material and evidence on record and has submitted that at the
stage of framing of the charge only prima facie case is
required to be seen. He submitted that the learned Magistrate ought
to have followed the provisions of <a href="/doc/1568411/" id="a_11">Section 245</a> of the Code and while
recording the evidence, ought to have considered the material
produced by the appellant-Board as sufficient and ought not to have
discharged the respondents-accused persons. He submitted that the
learned Magistrate has failed to appreciate the provisions of law and
particularly, he has not appreciated that only prima facie
case was required to be seen on the basis of the material and
evidence produced. He submitted that the learned Magistrate has
wrongly and erroneously observed that the Board has failed to produce
any evidence.  He also submitted that the learned Magistrate has also
failed to consider the analysis report prepared by the analyst and
has erroneously recorded the order of discharge. However, he fairly
conceded that the report does suffer from some defects as,
admittedly, it is not clear as to whether the sample collected was
sealed or not and it is also not reflected in the report. Similarly,
the parameters or criteria are also not clearly reflected. He also
conceded that the view expressed by the learned Metropolitan
Magistrate in the impugned judgement and order recording discharge
cannot be said to be perverse or cannot be said to be suffering from
illegality or manifest error of law in ignoring the relevant material
on record.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_7">4.		Mr.
</p><p id="p_8">K. P. Raval, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, has also referring
to the material and evidence on record, conceded that as stated by
the learned Counsel, Mr. Y. S. Lakhani, the impugned judgement and
order recording discharge of the accused persons cannot be said to be
perverse.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_9">5.		On
appreciation and scrutiny of the evidence and in light of the
submissions made by the learned Counsel, Mr. Y. S. Lakhani, for the
appellant, it is required to be appreciated that whether the impugned
judgement and order recording the discharge of the accused persons is
perverse and whether it calls for any interference by this Court.
From the scrutiny of the evidence, it appears that the notices were
served upon the respondents-original accused and thereafter, the
Officer of the appellant-Board visited the premises of respondent
No.1 and collected the sample in presence of respondent No.7-Manager.
On close scrutiny of the evidence, it appears that admittedly, no
seal was applied on the sample collected for analysis and it has been
discussed and reflected in the impugned judgement and order by
specifically recording that there is no mention about the fact that
the sample was sealed. Further, the parameters or criteria for the
purpose of comparison are also not produced by the appellant-Board,
which is also referred to and reflected in the impugned judgement.
Admittedly, the complaint has been lodged by the appellant-Board with
regard to non-treatment of the trade effluent discharged by
respondent No.1-original accused firm, alleging commission of the
offence under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_12">Sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_13">44</a> of the Act. The provisions thereof
make it clear that it has to be established by the Board with regard
to non-compliance thereof, meaning thereby, when the samples are
taken by the Board or its officers, which are tested in its own
laboratory and the report is also prepared by its own officer, then,
why so much of discrepancies crept in while following the procedure
and not complying with the provisions of the Act. As discussed, the
very basis for framing the charges for the prima facie case
itself were not fulfilled. Therefore, though the learned Counsel, Mr.
Lakhani, has submitted that only the prima facie case is
required to be seen, but, in the facts of the present case even for
prima facie case with regard to the alleged breach or
non-compliance of the provisions of the Act, the same is required to
be established on the basis of the sample collected, its analysis
report and the parameters or criteria on the basis of which it could
be compared as to whether there is any breach or violation of the
norms.  Admittedly, when no such parameters or criteria  have been
produced and the report itself suffers from some defects, the Board
cannot be said to have produced sufficient material and evidence to
make out even a prima facie case. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_10">6.		Another
facet of the argument with regard to non-compliance of <a href="/doc/1568411/" id="a_14">Section 245</a> of
the Code also cannot be accepted as when there is no sufficient
material to establish even the prima facie case, as discussed
above, the charges could not be framed. It is only if on the basis of
the material produced, the involvement or ingredients for the
offences are prima facie made out, the charges could be framed
and thereafter, it could be decided on merits at the trial. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_11">7.		It
is in these circumstances, on appreciation and scrutiny of evidence
on record, it would be evident that the view taken by the learned
Magistrate, recording the discharge, cannot be said to be perverse,
but, possible and this Court is in agreement with the conclusions
arrived at and therefore, it may not be necessary to elaborate on
this aspect and scrutinise the evidence threadbare, as observed by
the Honourable Apex Court in its judgement in the case of <a href="/doc/131360/" id="a_15">State
of Karnataka vs. Hemareddy &amp; Anr</a>., reported in AIR
1981 SC 1417.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_12">8.		Moreover,
in light of the judgement of the Honourable Apex Court in the case of
<a href="/doc/585040/" id="a_16">State of Goa vs. Sanjay Thakran &amp; Anr</a>.,
reported in (2007) 3 SCC 755,
wherein it  has been clearly observed, referring to the scope of
interference by the appellate court, that the appellate court can
review the evidence and interfere with the order of
acquittal/discharge only if the approach of the lower court is
vitiated by some manifest illegality or the decision is perverse and
the court has committed a manifest error of law and ignored the
material evidence on record.  In the facts of the present case, it
cannot be said that there is any  such manifest illegality or error
of law or that the learned Metropolitan Magistrate has ignored the
material and evidence on record.
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_13">9.		Therefore,
in view of the discussion made hereinabove, the impugned judgement
and order dated  11th October, 1992 passed by the learned
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad in Criminal Case No.1707 of
1989 is possible, reasonable and on appreciation of evidence, broadly
the conclusion arrived at is just and proper and therefore, this
Court is not inclined to interfere with the discharge of the accused
persons recorded by the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate.
Therefore, the impugned judgement and order passed by the learned
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate recording discharge of the accused is
hereby confirmed and the present appeal is required to be dismissed.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_14">10.		In
the result, the present appeal hereby stands dismissed.
