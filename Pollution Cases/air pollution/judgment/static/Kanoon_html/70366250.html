Mehinder Singh Sullar, J. (Oral)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">              On account of the fact that as the identical question of law and facts

are involved, therefore, I propose to decide the above indicated petitions, by virtue

of this common judgment, in order to avoid the repetition. However, the relevant

facts and material, which need a necessary mention for the limited purpose of
          CRM Nos.13202 of 2010 alongwith 3 connected petitions             -2-

deciding the core controversy, involved in the instant petitions, recapitulated from

main petition (1) CRM No. M-13202 of 2010 titled as "N.S.Brar, PCS, Ex-

Administrator, Municipal Council, Abohar Vs. Punjab Pollution Control

Board, Nabha Road, Patiala", would be referred in subsequent part of this

judgment for ready reference in this context.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.            Tersely, the facts, culminating in the commencement, relevant for

deciding the present petitions and emanating from the record, are that the

complainant-respondent Punjab Pollution Control Board (for brevity "the

complainant-Board") filed a criminal complaint (Annexure P3) against the

petitioners-accused for the commission of offences punishable under Sections 24

to 26 read with <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_1">Sections 43</a>, <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_2">47</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1577175/" id="a_3">48</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter to be referred as "the Act").

</p><p id="p_3">3.            The case set up by the complainant-Board in the complaint, in brief

in so far as relevant, was that the Municipal Council (for short "the MC"), Abohar

did not instal any sewage treatment plant to treat the sewage discharge and since it

has constructed a disposal work for collection and pumping of the sewage/sullage

of the city for further discharging into the lined channel, so, it has violated the

provisions of the Act and committed the indicated offences. As the petitioners-

accused were stated to be directly responsible, therefore, they are liable to be

prosecuted for the pointed offences. Inter-alia, in the background of these

allegations, the complainant-Board filed the criminal complaint (Annexure P3)

against the petitioners-accused for the commission of the offences in question.

</p><p id="p_4">4.            Taking cognizance of the impugned complaints, the petitioners-

accused were summoned to face the trial by the Magistrate, vide impugned

summoning orders.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.            Aggrieved by the initiation of criminal prosecution, the petitioners-

accused preferred the instant petitions to quash the impugned complaints and
             CRM Nos.13202 of 2010 alongwith 3 connected petitions                   -3-

summoning orders, inter-alia on various grounds in general and absence of

sanction to prosecute them under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_5">Section 197</a> Cr.PC in particular, invoking the

provisions of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_6">Section 482</a> Cr.PC, .
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.              During the course of preliminary hearing, a Coordinate Bench of

this Court (Nirmaljit Kaur, J.) passed the following order on May 6,2010:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "It is contended that earlier a complaint filed under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_7">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_8">25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_9">26</a>
     read with <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_10">Sections 43</a>, <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_11">47</a> and <a href="/doc/1577175/" id="a_12">Section 48</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of
     Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 was dismissed on 27.10.2003 by the Chief Judicial
     Magistrate, Ferozepur for want of prosecution. The restoration application was
     also dismissed. The petitioner was not made a party in that complaint. Thereafter,
     a second complaint was filed on the basis of same set of allegations but this time,
     the present petitioner was added as respondent No.3, whereas, the present
     petitioner remained as Administrator only for a period of three years i.e. From
     25.03.2008 to 14.03.2008 and the complaint is of the year 2009 and concerns the
     sample collected on 07.07.2000 and from 16.04.2001 to 03.07.2002. It is further
     stated that the petitioner is a public servant and sanction under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_14">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C,
     which is mandatory, has not been obtained.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            Notice of motion for 26.07.2010.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            Meanwhile, further proceedings qua the present petitioner shall remained
     stayed."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">7.              At the very outset, it is not a matter of dispute that all the petitioners-

accused are/were public servants at the relevant time and the complainant-Board

did not obtain any sanction from the competent authority to prosecute them under

<a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_15">Section 197</a> Cr.PC.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.              Above being the position on record, now the short and significant

question, though important that, arises for determination in these petitions is, as to

whether the petitioners-accused (public servants) can be prosecuted without

sanction or not?
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.              Having regard to the rival contentions of learned counsel for the

parties, to my mind, the answer must obviously be in the negative.

</p><p id="p_10">10.             As is evident from the record that, according to the complainant-

Board, the petitioners-accused have violated the provisions of the Act while
          CRM Nos.13202 of 2010 alongwith 3 connected petitions             -4-

discharging their official duties. What cannot possibly be disputed here is that

petitioner N.S.Brar, PCS, remained Administrator of the MC Abohar for a short

period. He is presently posted as Sub Divisional Magistrate, Mansa and Davinder

Kumar Goyal was the Executive Officer, whereas the remaining petitioners were

also public servants at the relevant time. Once it is claimed that the petitioners-

accused have violated the provisions of the Act while discharging their official

duties, in that eventuality, they are legally entitled to the umbrella of protection

under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_16">Section 197</a> Cr.PC in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.            As indicated earlier that since no sanction has been obtained to

prosecute the petitioners-accused, so, no cognizance could be taken and they

cannot be summoned to face the trial for the offences in question, in view of the

law laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in cases <a href="/doc/675074/" id="a_17">Rakesh Kumar Mishra vs. State of

Bihar and others</a> 2006(1) RCR (Criminal) 456 and <a href="/doc/1809946/" id="a_18">Raghunath Anant Govilkar

vs. State of Maharashtra and others</a> 2008(1) RCR (Criminal) 1042.

</p><p id="p_12">12.            Faced with the situation, the learned counsel for the complainant-

Board acknowledged the legal position and fairly submitted that the impugned

complaints &amp; summoning orders be quashed with the permission to complainant-

Board to file fresh complaints after obtaining the requisite sanction to prosecute

the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_13">13.            In the light of aforesaid reasons, the instant petitions are partly

accepted. Consequently, the impugned complaints and summoning orders are

hereby quashed in this relevant direction.
</p>
<p id="p_14">14.            Needless to mention that the complainant-Board would be at liberty

to file fresh complaints on the same cause of action after obtaining the requisite

sanction under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_19">Section 197</a> Cr.PC to prosecute the petitioners-accused.
