been taken by order dated 3/7/2015 (Annexure-P/2) passed in
Cri. Case No. 434/15 by JMFC Gohad, district Bhind (M.P.) against
the petitioner,who happens to be the Managing Director of the
Cadbury India Ltd. (now known as Mondelez India Foods Private
Limited), which is a company registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_5">Companies Act</a>
having its headquarters at Mumbai and factory at Malanpur
Industrial Area, district Bhind.

<p id="p_8">2.      The respondents by the complaint in question alleged
offences punishable under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_6">Sections 43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_7">44</a> and <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_8">49</a> of the Act on

the allegation of contravention of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_9">sections 24</a>,<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_10">25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_11">26</a> of the Act
of exuding untreated industrial effluent. The court of competent
criminal jurisdiction has taken cognizance by issuing summons
against three persons including the petitioner herein, impleaded
as accused of the said complaint.
</p>

<p id="p_9">2.1   Pertinently, other two accused impleaded in the complaint
were Company itself and one Jai Kumar Nair, Vice President of the
said company.
</p>

<p id="p_10">3.    Shri Surendra Singh, learned Senior Advocate alongwith
Shri Saurabh Agrawal, counsel for the petitioner has raised
singular ground of challenge to the said complaint by contending
that the petitioner being Managing Director of the said company
was not the person in day-to-day control of the affairs of the
factory of the company from where the industrial effluent is
alleged to have been discharged. In continuation, it is alleged that
when one of the accused namely Jai Kumar Nair, Vice President of
the said company had been appointed as Factory Manager w.e.f.
1/4/2014 by resolution vide Annexure-P/7 of the Board of
Directors of the said company dated 23/5/2014 then, there was
neither   any   occasion   nor   any   lawful   authority   with   the
respondents to implead the petitioner as an accused in the
complaint. In support of his submission, learned counsel placed
reliance on the decisions in the cases of <a href="/doc/1860649/" id="a_12">Pepsico India
Holdings (P) Ltd. v. Food Inspector &amp; another</a> (2011) 1
SCC 176 (para 50), <a href="/doc/50504/" id="a_13">Girdhari Lal Gupta v. D.H. Mehta &amp;

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3      Mcrc.No.13107/15</span>

other hand contends that the petitioner being Managing Director
of the company was very much in charge and responsible for day-
to-day affairs of the company and its business and therefore he
cannot wriggle out of the clutches of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_15">section 47</a> by shifting liability
to any other person.
</p>

<p id="p_12">4.    Learned counsel for the rival parties are head.
</p>

<p id="p_13">5.    In the present case, the factual matrix discloses that the
incident is said to have taken place on 14/8/14. The impugned
complaint, Annexure-P/1, filed by the respondent describes the
said company in para 1 followed by para 2 containing the factum
that the company was issued environmental clearance under
<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_16">sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_17">26</a> of the said Act vide letter dated 22/8/2013
subject to fulfillment of two conditions mentioned therein.
Thereafter para 3 describes facts which gave rise to the cause of
action to the effect that on 14/8/2014 the employees of Water
Pollution Control Board on inspection found industrial untreated
effluent flowing from the drains and also detected food oil and
polluted water including chemicals in the tank, which impelled the
inspecting team to take samples and send them to laboratory for
examination. Paras 4 and 5 relate to chemical examination by the
laboratory which found the effluents to be polluted. Finally, para
7 of the complaint alleges that in view of above cause of action,
offence under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_18">sections 43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_19">44</a> and <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_20">49</a> of the Act has been
committed by the accused-petitioner which is endorsed by the
prayer to the JMFC to punish the accused.
</p>

<p id="p_14">5.1   Noticeably, there is not even a whisper in the complaint
that the alleged offence has been committed with the consent or
connivance and/or due to neglect of the Director, Manager and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 4      Mcrc.No.13107/15</span>

Secretary or any other persons of the company.
</p>

<p id="p_15">5.2    At this stage, it would be appropriate to reproduce the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_21">section 47</a> of the Act as under:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "47. OFFENCES BY COMPANIES.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (1) Where an offence under this Act has been
      committed by a company, every person who at the
      time the offence was committed was in charge of,
      and was responsible to the company for the
      conduct of, the business of the company, as well
      as the company, shall be deemed to the guilty of the
      offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and
      punished accordingly:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section
      shall render any such person liable to any punishment
      provided in this Act if he proves that the offence was
      committed without his knowledge for that he exercised
      all due diligence to prevent the commission of such
      offence.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section
      (1), where an offence under this Act has been
      committed by a company and it is proved that the
      offence has been committed with the consent or
      connivance of, or is attributable to any neglect
      on the part of, any director , manager, secretary or
      other officer of the company, such director, manager,
      secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to be
      guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be
      proceeded against and punished accordingly."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_16">5.3    Bare reading of <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_22">section 47(1)</a> of the Act indicates that the
person who is in charge of and responsible to the company for
the conduct of the business of the company, as well as company,
shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to
be proceeded against for the contravention of the provision of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5      Mcrc.No.13107/15</span>

said Act. The said section carves out an exception by way of
proviso that the said person mentioned in <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_23">Section 47(1)</a> shall not
be liable to be proceeded against if he is able to establish that the
offence was committed without his knowledge or that the same
was committed despite the said person exercising due diligence to
prevent the offence.
</p>

<p id="p_17">5.4   Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_24">section 47</a> qualifies sub-section (1) by
employing a non-obstinate clause providing that the penal
provision nonetheless shall be attracted if consent, connivance or
neglect is attributed to the Director, Manager, Secretary or any
other officer of the company


5.5   In the instant case, the company by its resolution dated
23/5/14 (Annexure-P/7) has appointed Mr. Jai Kumar Nair as
Factory Manager w.e.f. 1/4/14 and has expressly conferred upon
said Shri Jai Kumar Nair inter alia the powers to comply with
provisions of different enactments including the provisions of the
Act. The relevant portion of the said resolution dated 23/5/14,
Annexure-P/7 is reproduced below:-

        matters and things as may be necessary or expedient
        for the aforesaid purposes. "
</blockquote>

<p id="p_18">5.6    From the above, it is crystal clear that Mr. Jai Kumar Nair
w.e.f. 1/4/14 was in charge and in control of the day-to-day
affairs of the factory belonging to the company.
</p>

<p id="p_19">5.7    The power vested upon Mr. Jai Kumar Nair was that of an
"occupier" as defined in <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_31">section 2(d)</a> of the said Act. <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_32">Section 2(d)</a>
being relevant is reproduced below:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">           "2[(d) "occupier", in relation to any factory or
      premises, means the person who has control over the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  7       Mcrc.No.13107/15</span>

      affairs of the factory or the premises, and includes, in
      relation to any substance, the person in possession of
      the substance."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_20">5.8    The liability upon any person apart from the persons
mentioned in <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_33">section 47(1)</a> of the Act can be fastened only when
the complaint contains express allegation of presence of
ingredients of element of consent, connivance or neglect on the
part of Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer of the
company. In the instant case, the impugned complaint in question
is bereft of any such allegations against the petitioner who is
Managing Director of the company. Moreover, the complaint
further does not allege that the petitioner being Managing
Director    was   in   charge    of   day-to-day    affairs   of   the
factory/company in question.
</p>

<p id="p_21">5.9    Thus, arraying of the petitioner as an accused in the
complaint is uncalled for and unlawful. This court in this respect
draws support from the law laid down by the Apex Court in the
case of Pepsi Food India Ltd. (supra) which in para 50
observed thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">       "50. As mentioned hereinbefore, the High Court
       erred in giving its own interpretation to the decision
       of this Court in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd.'s case
       (supra), which was reiterated subsequently in several
       judgments, some of which have been indicated
       hereinabove, and relying instead on the decision of
       Rangachari's case (supra), the facts of which were
       entirely different from the facts of this case. It is now
       well established that in a complaint against a
       Company and its Directors, the Complainant has to
       indicate in the complaint itself as to whether the
       Directors concerned were either in charge of or
       responsible to the Company for its day-to-day
       management, or whether they were responsible to
       the Company for the conduct of its business. A mere
       bald statement that a person was a Director of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                               8      Mcrc.No.13107/15</span>

     Company against which certain allegations had been
     made is not sufficient to make such Director liable in
     the absence of any specific allegations regarding his
     role in the management of the Company."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_22">5.10 Further assistance can be drawn from the observations
made by the Apex Court in para 6 in the case of Girdhari Lal
Gupta (supra). Para 6 reads thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">     "6. What then does the expression "a person in-
     charge and responsible for the conduct of the affairs
     of a company mean" ? It will be noticed that the
     word 'company' includes a firm or other association
     and the same test must apply to a director in-charge
     and a partner of a firm in-charge of a business. It
     seems to us that in the context a person 'in-charge'
     must mean that the person should be in over all
     control of the day to day business of the company or
     firm. This inference follows from the wording of
     <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_34">Section 23C(2)</a>. It mentions director, who may be a
     party to the policy being followed by a company and
     yet not be in-charge of the business of the company.
     Further it mentions manager, who usually is in
     charge of the business but not in over-all-charge.
     Similarly the other officers may be in charge of only
     some part of business."

<p id="p_23">5.11 Further inspiration may also be drawn from observations
made in paras 18, 19 and 20 by the Apex court in the case of
Puja Ravinder Devidasani (supra), which read thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">     "18. In Girdhari Lal Gupta Vs. D.H. Mehta &amp; Anr.
     (1971) 3 SCC 189, this Court observed that a person
     'in charge of a business' means that the person
     should be in overall control of the day to day
     business of the Company.

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">     19. A Director of a Company is liable to be convicted
     for an offence committed by the Company if he/she
     was in charge of and was responsible to the
     Company for the conduct of its business or if it is
     proved that the offence was committed with the
     consent or connivance of, or was attributable to any
     negligence on the part of the Director concerned

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">             20. In other words, the law laid down by this Court
             is that for making a Director of a Company liable for
             the offences committed by the Company under
             <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_35">Section 141</a> of the N.I. Act, there must be specific
             averments against the Director showing as to how
             and in what manner the Director was responsible for
             the conduct of the business of the Company."

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">       6.    From the above, it is evident that the petitioner who is
       Managing Director of the Factory as per allegation made in the
       complaint neither falls within the term "every person" mentioned
       in <a href="/doc/95018/" id="a_36">section 47(1)</a> nor can be made an accused under <a href="/doc/1660170/" id="a_37">Section 47(2)</a>

<blockquote id="blockquote_20">       7.    Before parting, it would not be out of place to mention that
       the prosecution is not remedy-less. It is always open to the

       Kumar Nair who being occupier has control over the affairs of the
