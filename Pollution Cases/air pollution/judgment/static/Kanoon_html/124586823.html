past by way of a Writ Petition (PIL) No.194 of 2011, decided by
this very Bench vide judgment and order dated 9th May 2012,
by which this Court held that, so long as the environmental
clearance is not granted by the Central Government in favour
of the MPSEZ for creation of infrastructural facilities on the
land so allotted and consequent to such permission such
facilities have been actually created by the allottee, the lessor
cannot lease out the right of enjoyment of the infrastructural
facilities to its lessee.

clear pronouncement of this Court about the right of creation
of infrastructural facilities over the land allotted by the MPSEZ

nos.10 to 21 have continued to operate their respective units
in flagrant violation and disregard of the Environmental Impact

down by this Court in Writ Petition (PIL) No.194 of 2011.

<p id="p_29">      It has been averred in the petition that the public hearing

issued a show-cause notice to the MPSEZ in connection with
the violation of the provisions of the CRZ Notification, 1991. Till
this date, the mandatory prior environmental clearance has
not been granted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests

pursuant to the preparation of Environmental Impact
Assessment      (EIA)   study   including    Environment
Management Plan, a public hearing for the project was
conducted on 5.10.2010. Subsequent to the public
hearing, the EAC-respondent no.3, constituted by MoEF,
in its meeting held on 16th-17th April 2012
recommended the proposal for clearance of SEZ project
after receipt of the information as stipulated during the
said meeting. The respondent no.8 submitted the
requisite details to MoEF as sought for in the meeting of
EAC.

and order dated 9.5.2012 by this Hon'ble Court, after due
compliance with the minutes of the meeting dated 16th-

further considered by the EAC at its meeting on 4th-5th
June 2012. EAC in its meeting held on 4th-5th June 2012
recommended the proposal of the respondent no.8 for
environmental and CRZ clearance with the conditions as
stipulated in the said meeting of EAC held on 4th-5th
June 2012. The said minutes are available on the official
website of MoEF which is within public domain and is a

MoEF was required to consider the recommendations of
EAC and convey its decision to the respondent no.8
within 45 days of the receipt of such recommendations of
EAC. No decision of MoEF was communicated to the
respondent no.8 within 45 days of the receipt of the
aforesaid recommendations of EAC. MoEF, in terms of
paragraph 8(ii) of the said notification, has neither
disagreed with the recommendations of EAC nor has
requested EAC for its reconsideration and no such
intimation in this respect has been received by the
respondent no.8. As no decision of MoEF was
communicated to the respondent no.8 within 45 days of
the receipt of the recommendations of EAC, the
respondent no.8, in terms of paragraph 8(iii) of the said
notification, proceeded that the environment/CRZ
clearance sought for has been granted by MoEF in terms
of the final recommendations of EAC dated 4th-5th June
2012 and corrections made on 9th-10th July 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_41">9. At this juncture, it would be material to place on record
the guidelines dated 29.4.2009 issued by MoEF for time
bound issue of environmental clearances. The said
guidelines were issued to remove the general perception
that there are delays in processing of the proposals after
their recommendations by EAC. Under the said
guidelines, necessary instructions were issued that final
view for environmental clearance is required to be taken
within 15 days of the recommendations of EAC and that
the environmental clearance thereafter would be
displayed on MoEF's website immediately. The
respondent no.8 based on the said notification and the
guidelines dated 29.4.2009 proceeded that it has been
granted necessary environmental/CRZ clearance in terms
of final recommendations of EAC dated 4th-5th June 2012

on 4th-5th June 2012, stipulated that there shall be no

to the respondent no.8, MoEF addressed letter dated
26.10.2012 to Gujarat Coastal Zone Management
Authority (GCZMA) seeking details about the factual
position about the SEZ area falling outside CRZ area.

The respondent no.8 through the said letters once again
reiterated that it will carry out only the permissible
activities in the CRZ area as per the CRZ notification as
applicable. Government of Gujarat, Forests and
Environment Department through Member Secretary,
GCZMA vide its letter dated 9.1.2013 provided necessary
details to MoEF as sought for by MoEF vide its letter
dated 26.10.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_44">12. In light of the aforesaid facts, I state and submit that
the respondent no.8 has been granted requisite
environmental/CRZ clearance for its SEZ and that the
judgment and order dated 9.5.2012 passed by this
Hon'ble Court would not be applicable as sought to be
contended by the petitioners in their petition. I state and
submit that the petitioners have suppressed the EAC
recommendations dated 4th-5th June 2012 and 9th-10th
July 2012 though the said documents are within public
domain. In the circumstances, I submit that the petition
is required to be dismissed with exemplary cost.
</p>
<p id="p_45">13. Without prejudice to the aforesaid, I state and submit
that the authorities have not considered that there is any
bar either under the said notification or otherwise for an
individual unit, being setup within the SEZ, to operate,
even if it has obtained requisite environmental clearance
and/or consent/authorisation from the Pollution Control
Board, till the time the SEZ is granted environmental
clearance. I submit that it is not even the case of MoEF
that any individual unit cannot operate within SEZ,
though having requisite environmental clearance and/or
consent from the Pollution Control Board, till the time
SEZ is granted environmental clearance. The same would
also be evident from the stand of MoEF taken before this
Hon'ble Court during the course of hearing of Writ
Petition (PIL) No.194 of 2011. On the contrary, MoEF has
granted environmental clearances to the individual unit/s
to be setup in the SEZ though the environmental

clearance for the said SEZ was pending before it. The
same would be evident in the case of Dahej SEZ, near
Bharuch, Gujarat, developed by Gujarat Industrial
Development Corporation (GIDC). One of the units within
the Dahej SEZ, namely, M/s.Indofil Chemicals Company
was granted environmental clearance by MoEF on
19.8.2008 while MoEF had granted environmental
clearance for Dahej SEZ to GIDC only on 17.3.2010
during which time it is learnt that the aforesaid unit was
carrying out its manufacturing activities. From the
aforesaid, it appears that there may be several other
such environmental clearances which may have been
granted by MoEF. The respondent no.8 is not aware of
the same, and that the MoEF would be in a better
position to clarify the position in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_46">14. I state and submit that the respondent nos.10 to 21
have setup or are in the process of setting up the units or
have proposed to setup their units within the SEZ of the
respondent no.8 pursuant to the relevant permissions
being granted to them by the respondent no.5 under the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/160644534/" id="a_2">Special Economic Zone Act</a>, 2005 and
the rules framed thereunder. The said units would be
required to obtain necessary consent/clearance from the
appropriate authority based upon the nature of their
activities. The only relief for an individual unit, which
requires environmental clearance for its project under
the said notification, is that the said individual unit would
be exempted from public hearing in cases where the SEZ
as a whole has undergone public hearing. I submit that
the appropriate authorities would not have granted
consents and/or clearances to the individual units if there
would have been any bar to give such consent and/or
clearance in the absence of environmental clearance
being granted to SEZ. In light of the aforesaid, I submit
that the present petition is not maintainable and is liable
to be dismissed. Even otherwise, the present petition is
not maintainable in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_3">National

operation, pursuant to environmental/CRZ clearances
granted to it earlier by MoEF, is not the infrastructure

<p id="p_48">     Thus, from the aforenoted stance of the respondent no.8

deemed environmental clearance in terms of clause 8 of the
Environmental          Impact   Assessment       Notification,    2006.
Therefore, according to the respondent no.8 - MPSEZ, the
position has completely changed on grant of the deemed
environmental clearance, which was not the position when this
Court decided the Writ Petition (PIL) No.194 of 2011.
</p>

<p id="p_50">     In such circumstances referred to above, according to the
respondent no.8 - MPSEZ, the Writ Petition (PIL) No.21 of 2013
need not be entertained and should be rejected only on the
ground that in view of the deemed environmental clearance
the respondent nos.10 to 21 can operate their respective units
within the Special Economic Zone.
</p>

<p id="p_51">     II. Stance of the Respondent Nos.10 to 21 :

<p id="p_52">     By and large the stance of the respondent nos.10 to 21,
i.e. the unit holders, is the same as that adopted by the
respondent no.8 - MPSEZ. In addition to the grant of the
deemed environmental clearance, the stance of the respective
unit holders is that they are operating within the SEZ since
2008 and, by now, they have invested crores of rupees in the
development of their projects.
</p>

<p id="p_53">     According to the respondent nos.10 to 21, the provisions

of the EIA Notification make it abundantly clear that the
environmental clearance is required to be obtained by only
those projects which are listed in the Schedule thereto and not
otherwise. According to them, if a SEZ does not get an
environmental clearance, that by itself would not be a bar for
setting up of an industrial unit inside the SEZ if the unit itself
has the necessary environmental clearance for its project.
</p>

<p id="p_54">     The sum and substance of the stance of the respondent
nos.10 to 21 is that each one of them have obtained the
necessary permission to setup their units from the Gujarat
Pollution Control Board under the provisions of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, the Air

<p id="p_55">     All the units operating within the SEZ have received the
consent and authorisation under the provisions of the Water

available to the petitioners.
</p>

<p id="p_58">     It is also the stance of the respondent nos.10 to 21 that
the petitions should not be entertained on the ground of delay
and laches. According to them, the units are in operation past
almost more than five years and the petition has been filed in
the year 2013. Such being the position, the principle of delay
and laches would also be applicable to the petition filed in
public interest.

<p id="p_59">     In the circumstances referred to above, the respondent

recommendations of Board of Approval in respect of the

<p id="p_63">5. So far as the contention of the petitioners to the effect
that the front doors are kept closed and all cosmetics
exercise undertaken by the respondent nos.10 to 21 from
outside, is not correct, inasmuch as the fact is that the
production of goods and its subsequent clearance from
the SEZ area takes place through the "Entry and Exit
Gates" as prescribed under the SEZ Act and Rules. It
appears that the petitioners are not having clear idea
about the functions of the units situated in the SEZ area.

</pre><p id="p_66">As far as the order dated 9.5.2012 of the Hon'ble High
Court of Gujarat in PIL No.194/2011 is concerned, it does
not stop functioning of all the running units. Hence the
inference drawn while forming the above contention is
not only wrong but also misleading. The said order dated
9.5.2012 is as under and the same was in respect of two
units i.e. Alstom Bharat Forge Power Ltd. being
respondent no.10 to the PIL No.194/2011 and Kalyani
Alstom Power Ltd. being respondent no.11 to the PIL
No.194/2011 :

        undertake any further construction work, whether
        preliminary or otherwise, till the MPSEZ is granted

        extent is allowed."

<p id="p_67">The said order dated 9.5.2012 is applicable to the
abovenamed units. However, the respondent no.5
immediately on receipt of the said order dated 9.5.2012
issued directions to the Developer/Co-Developer and
Units to comply with the order in full and stop the
construction activities immediately. The contention that
the Central and State Authorities have illegally and
unconstitutionally allowed or by turning their attention
away permitted respondent nos.10 to 21 to setup their
respective units within MPSEZ, put up construction
thereupon and thereafter do business from the very
respective units, is not correct as the respondent no.5
immediately took the steps to implement the order of the
Hon'ble High Court and directed the affected parties i.e.
respondent no.10 and respondent no.11 of the PIL

<p id="p_69">     IV. Submissions on behalf of the Petitioners:
</p>

<p id="p_70">     Mr.Anand Yagnik, the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners, submitted that it is only after the counter was filed
by the respondent no.8 MPSEZ to his petition, his clients learnt
that the environmental impact assessment committee had
recommended to the Ministry of Environment and Forests,
Government of India, to grant environmental clearance in
terms of Clause 8 of the Notification, 2006, subject to certain
terms and conditions, but as the Ministry of Environment and
Forests failed to consider such recommendations by the
Experts Appraisal Committee within the stipulated period of
time, by the deeming fiction provided in Clause 8, a deemed
clearance is said to have been granted in favour of the MPSEZ.
</p>

<p id="p_71">     According         to    Mr.Yagnik,      the   question     of   deemed
environmental clearance has arisen in view of the failure on
the part of the regulatory authority, namely, the Ministry of
Environment        and      Forests,   to    respond   to    and     take    an
appropriate decision upon the recommendations of the Expert
Appraisal Committee within a period of 45 days.
</p>

<p id="p_72">     Mr.Yagnik submitted that such a failure is conscious and
mala fide only with a view to benefit the respondent no.8
MPSEZ in seeking the environmental clearance.
</p>

<p id="p_73">     Mr.Yagnik submitted that in such a serious matter the

respondent no.1 - Ministry of Environment and Forests,
Government of India, has not thought fit even to file a formal
reply so as to make its stance clear before the Court.
</p>

<p id="p_74">     Mr.Yagnik submitted that the deeming fiction so far as
the grant of environmental clearance on expiry of 45 days
from the date of the recommendations of the EAC is
concerned, would apply only in cases in which the project or
the activity undertaken is strictly in accordance with law. In the
present case, according to Mr.Yagnik, there has been a
flagrant violation and disregard of the terms of the Notification,
2006, and in such circumstances, the respondent no.8 cannot
take shelter of the deemed clearance said to have been
granted in their favour.
</p>

<p id="p_75">     Mr.Yagnik submitted that the whole defence of the
respondent no.8 and the other unit holders as regards the
grant of deemed environmental clearance is completely
misconceived because not only the respondent no.8 MPSEZ
but the individual unit holders have violated the terms of the
Notification, 2006 by proceeding ahead with the development
in the absence of any environmental clearance. In short, the
sum and substance of Mr.Yagnik's submissions is that having
committed the illegality the same would not get condoned by a
fiction of law, which provides for a deemed environmental
clearance.
</p>

<p id="p_76">     Mr.Yagnik submitted that the essence of EIA Notification
is that unless a prior environmental clearance is granted, the
project proponent has no right to put up any construction
whatsoever on the land of the proposed project. In the present

case, the respondent nos.10 to 21, on the strength of the so-
called leasehold rights conferred by the respondent no.8
MPSEZ in the absence of any environmental clearance granted
in their favour, proceeded to complete their individual projects
and are operating the same full-fledged past five years. At this
stage, now they cannot take the shelter of the deemed
clearance by a fiction of law.
</p>

<p id="p_77">      Mr.Yagnik submitted that the issue which he has raised in
the petition has been substantially answered by this Court in
its decision rendered in the case of Ranubha Rajmalji Jadeja
and others v. Union of India and others, Writ Petition (PIL)
No.194 of 2011 decided on 9th May 2012.
</p>

<p id="p_78">      Mr.Yagnik submitted that from the language of the
Minutes dated 5th June 2012, it appears that the EAC had no
idea that the respondent no.8 MPSEZ had substantially
undertaken the work of development and construction to
provide infrastructure to the individual unit holders within the
SEZ and that the MPSEZ had already made allotment of plots
on lease, and on the strength of such leasehold rights, the
respondent nos.10 to 21 had fully developed their individual
plots by putting up the construction. According to Mr.Yagnik, if
the   recommendations      are      final,   then   only    in      such
circumstances, the question of grant of deemed environmental
clearance would arise in the event the regulatory authority
fails to respond and take a decision within 45 days thereafter.
</p>

<p id="p_79">      Mr.Yagnik would submit that the Minutes of the meeting
does not suggest that the recommendations are final and this
could be clarified only by the EAC of the Ministry of

<p id="p_80">     Mr.Yagnik laid much stress on the fact that the Ministry of
Environment and Forests, Government of India, thought fit to
appoint Sunita Narain Committee on 14th September 2012 in
view of the complaints received from the Kheti Vikas Sewa
Trust regarding severe impact upon the environment safety
and integrity in MPSEZ committed by M/s.Adani Port and
Special Economic Zone Limited.
</p>

<p id="p_81">     In such circumstances, the respondents should not be
permitted to take shelter of such a deemed environmental
clearance as that would frustrate the very object of seeking a
prior environmental clearance before undertaking any work of
construction on the Special Economic Zone.

09/10.07.2012 both of which were available on the official

petitioners approached this Court on the premise that APSEZ
did not have an environmental clearance, it was duty bound to
disclose that the EAC had recommended the project and the
requisite period under Clause 8(i) and (ii) had already expired
resulting in environmental clearance being granted to APSEZ
for its SEZ in terms of EIA Notification, 2006 before the petition
was filed, particularly when the petitioners appear to be
otherwise        very     well   informed.          They    knew   about      the

<p id="p_106">       When the public hearing under the EIA Notification, 2006
was conducted, the villagers were very much aware that units
were being established and had even sought information in

mentioned about the existence of 20 units. These proceedings
were with the EAC when it recommended environmental
clearance in respect of SEZ.

<p id="p_107">       At the EAC meeting held on 16/17.04.2012, presentation
was made by APSEZ in which it was highlighted that certain

was also clearly demarcated in the map tendered before the
EAC.

environmental clearance is required for establishing their units
in the SEZ under EIA Notification, 2006.

Court in Part-IV of its judgment in Writ Petition (PIL) No. 194 of
2011 dated 09.05.2012, the Union of India was supporting its
letter dated 25.10.2011 addressed to the petitioners of Special
Civil Application No.2621 of 2013 that no environmental
clearance was required for their unit to be established in the
SEZ and that the Union had nothing more to say in the matter.
</p>

<p id="p_110">     MoEF has itself granted environmental clearance to units
in Andhra Pradesh Special Economic Zone on 08.06.2009 and
05.08.2011 before environmental clearance was granted to the
said SEZ on 13.02.2012 and the said units were even
established before environmental clearance to the SEZ.
Similarly, MoEF granted environmental clearance to a unit in
Dahej SEZ on 19.08.2008 before the environmental clearance
was granted to the said SEZ on 17.03.2010. Even projects
within this SEZ were granted clearance by MoEF prior to
environmental clearance to the SEZ itself.

(1)     The entire premise of the petitioners' contention is
</pre><p id="p_112">        based on an assumption that an application would
        get "deemed clearance" under Clause S(iii) of the
        EIA Notification, 2006 if the regulatory authority
        (MoEF) does not decide within the stipulated period.
        This is incorrect. The fiction created under Clause
        8(iii) is not that the application as made by a project
        proponent is deemed to be granted, but that the
        recommendations of the EAC, after scoping and due
        appraisal,          whether        approving        or     rejecting     the
        proposal, are to be treated as the decision of the
        regulatory authority, which is a different matter
        altogether.
</p>

<p id="p_113">(2)     There          is    no    provision/condition              in   the     EIA
        Notification, 2006 to the effect that the deeming
        provision would be inapplicable on account of the
        commencement of construction prior to grant of
        environmental clearance. Reading such a condition
        into the EIA Notification, 2006 would amount to
        legislating which is impermissible.
</p>

<p id="p_114">(3)     Such a condition cannot be read in by an analogy
        with case law relating to deemed permission, but
        has       to    be    supported            by   a   provision      in    the
        notification,         since      the fiction is           not that the

        without scrutiny, but that the recommendations of
        the expert body - EAC, made after due appraisal,

(4)     The principle of "reading down" a provision would
</pre><p id="p_115">        not apply in the present case since the same would
        be applicable only for the purpose of saving the
        provision from being declared                  ultra vires the
        Constitution or the parent statute or for the purpose
        of bringing it in conformity with the parent statute,
        which is not the case here. In any case, in the
        absence of a challenge to the provision, there
        cannot be any question of reading it down.
</p>

<p id="p_116">(5)     Similar        provisions        exist    in    environmental
        legislations, including <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_27">Section 25(7)</a> of the Water
        (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_28">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974,

        2(V)      of   the   Environment         Impact    Assessment
        Notification, 1994. Therefore, a deeming provision
        is not unknown to environmental legislation.
</p>

<p id="p_117">(6)     The scheme of the EIA Notification, 2006 indicates a
        very comprehensive procedure entailing application
        of mind at every stage by persons equipped with
        the necessary expertise for deciding whether an
        SEZ project deserves environmental clearance, as
        also the importance of time bound decision making
        in this regard at every stage. The scheme therefore
        indicates the rationale and reasonableness of the

        automatic shelving of the application or would

        particularly since the Hon'ble Court is considering

<p id="p_119">(8)     The judgments on deemed permission cited by the
        petitioners are clearly distinguishable. In all those

        the statute, in other words the subject matter of

             under law and there is no fault or bad faith that can

clearance" under Clause 8(iii) of the EIA Notification, 2006 if
the regulatory authority (MoEF) does not decide within the
stipulated period. This is incorrect. The fiction created under
Clause 8(iii) is not that the application as made by a project
proponent       is     deemed   to     be        granted,   but    that     the
recommendations of the EAC, after scoping and due appraisal,
whether approving or rejecting the proposal, are to be treated
as the decision of the regulatory authority which is a different
matter altogether.
</p>

<p id="p_144">     There is no provision/condition in the EIA Notification,
2006 to the effect that the deeming provision would be
inapplicable on account of the commencement of construction
prior to grant of environmental clearance. Reading such a
condition into the EIA Notification, 2006 would amount to
legislating which is impermissible.
</p>

<p id="p_145">     Such a condition cannot be read in by an analogy with
case law relating to deemed permission, but has to be
supported by a provision in the notification, since the fiction is
not that the application as made is deemed to be granted
without scrutiny, but that the recommendations of the expert
body - EAC, made after due appraisal, are treated as if the
same is the decision of the regulatory authority.
</p>
<p id="p_146">     The principle of "reading down" a provision would not
apply to the present case since the same would be applicable
only for the purpose of saving the provision from being
declared ultra vires the Constitution or the parent statute or for
the purpose of bring it in conformity with the parent statute,
which is not the case here. In any case, in the absence of a

challenge to the provision, there cannot be any question of
reading it down.
</p>

<p id="p_147">     Similar provisions exist in environmental legislations,
including <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_39">Section 25(7)</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_40">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, proviso to <a href="/doc/172061753/" id="a_41">Section 21(2)</a> of the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_42">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as well as
Clause    2(V)         of   the   Environment         Impact   Assessment
Notification, 1994. Therefore, a deeming provision is not
unknown to environmental legislation.
</p>

<p id="p_148">     The scheme of the EIA Notification, 2006 indicates a very
comprehensive procedure entailing application of mind at
every stage by persons equipped with the necessary expertise
for deciding whether an SEZ project deserves environmental
clearance, as also the importance of time bound decision
making in this regard at every stage. The scheme therefore
indicates the rationale and reasonableness of the provisions.
Therefore, there is no justification for reading something into
the notification by holding that the deeming clause is not
applicable to certain cases.
</p>

<p id="p_149">     The very authority which has issued the EIA Notification,
2006 has treated the project/activities inside the SEZ distinctly
from the SEZ itself. In the case of the Dahej SEZ, the MoEF
granted    environmental clearance                 to one Indofil Organic
Industries Ltd. situated in the Dahej SEZ on 19.8.2008, much
prior to the grant of environmental clearance to the Dahej SEZ
itself on 17.3.2010. Even in the present case, the Thermal
Power Plant, the CETP and Township and Area Development
Project, which are all situated inside the SEZ, have been

granted       environmental   clearance        and   are   carrying      on
activities.
</p>

<p id="p_150">      The very authority which has issued the EIA Notification,
2006 has itself not interpreted it to mean that a breach thereof
would warrant automatic shelving of the application or would
render     the      deeming   provision        inapplicable.   Such      an
interpretation by the very authority issuing the notification is
entitled to be given weight particularly since the Court is
considering the interpretation of a subordinate legislation of
that authority itself and not the interpretation of a parent
statute on the basis of an interpretation of an administering
authority.
</p>

<p id="p_151">      The nature of the alleged illegality is not such as would
warrant non-consideration of the application for all time to
come, for the following reasons :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_23">      i. The clearance is sought for an SEZ which is essentially
      an industrial estate, with little pollution potential of its
      own and grant thereof does not give an unbridled licence
      for units to be set up in the area since they also have to
      comply with the requirements of the environment laws
      individually.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_24">      ii. The construction of the Thermal Power Plant (TPP),
      CETP and social infrastructure in the SEZ has been
      undertaken with appropriate environment clearances
      which have not been challenged.</blockquote><pre id="pre_13">

did     not       have   the      required         clearance   and      the
representation was to the contrary as evidenced by the
lease deeds. The authorities have at no point of time ever
conveyed any objection to the activities undertaken by
the units for setting up their industry. The Units have
applied for and obtained permission for setting up Unit in
SEZ      from     the    Development         Commissioner        and    No
Objection Certificate and Consolidated Consent from
GPCB as applicable.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_152">iv. The illegality as held by this Court is in the Units
commencing construction prior to the clearance being
granted to the SEZ. The Units have otherwise been set up
in accordance with the necessary permissions and in
accordance with law. A distinction must be drawn
between commencement of construction without the SEZ
having permission at that stage and a Unit set up without
requisite approvals at all, and the consequences of both
cannot be the same.
</p>

<p id="p_153">v. The nature of the illegality is such that public purpose
will not be sacrificed if it is impliedly regularised by
granting the clearance.

<p id="p_154">vi. In any case, the requirement of prior clearance is by
subordinate         legislation    and       the     interpretation     and

</p>

<p id="p_156">     The EIA Notification, 2006 provides for a comprehensive
procedure leading upto the recommendation by the EAC.
Clause 7(11) provides that the EAC is required to determine
comprehensive Terms of Reference (TOR) addressing all
relevant environmental concerns for preparation of an EIA
Report. Thereafter, as per Clause 7(111), a public consultation
has to take place during which the concerns of the local
affected persons and others having a plausible stake in the
environmental impact of the project are to be ascertained. The
final EIA Report is to be prepared pursuant to the completion of
public consultation and this is to be submitted to the EAC by
the applicant. Thereafter, the EAC is required to carry out
appraisal of the project in terms of Clause 7(IV), which means a
detailed scrutiny of the application, final EIA Report, outcome
of public consultations, etc. After detailed scrutiny, the EAC
has to make its recommendation to the regulatory authority
either or grant or for rejection of environmental clearance.
</p>

<p id="p_157">     In the present case, the aforesaid process has been
followed over a period of 3 1/2 years starting from January 2009
when the TOR was determined, public consultations during
October 2010 record of which was sent to MoEF, submission of
Rapid     Environment    Impact          Assessment      Report        and

details/information sought by EAC in May 2012 and thereafter,
the recommendation of the EAC on 4/5.6.2012.
</p>

<p id="p_158">     At no stage the entire proceeding culminating in the
EAC's recommendation has been challenged on any ground.
Nor has the same been challenged or questioned in the
present petition. There is no fault found in regard to the
decision making process. Therefore, the EAC's decision is not
open to challenge in the present petition.
</p>

<p id="p_159">     Assuming that the EAC's decision is open to challenge on
merits, the EAC is constituted by the Central Government
under Clause 4(h) of the EIA Notification, 2006 and comprises
of professionals and experts with requisite expertise and
experience in certain fields/disciplines as more particularly
provided in Appendix VI of the EIA Notification, 2006.
Therefore, the decision of the EAC is a decision of a expert
body. The Courts are not equipped with necessary expertise to
look into the issue of whether the decision of the EAC is
incorrect on merits, that is, whether the SEZ project deserves,
on merits, an environmental clearance or not.
</p>

<p id="p_160">     The petitioners have sought to contend that the EAC was
not cognizant of the fact that the respondent Units were
already constructed and were operational inside the SEZ and
certain other infrastructure facilities were also established and
hence its decision is based on incorrect and incomplete facts,
which therefore vitiates its decision. In this regard, the
respondents submit as under:

     i. This argument of the petitioners confuses the SEZ
     project with the individual projects of the Units situated
     inside the SEZ. The bar against construction is qua the
     SEZ       project/activity    and         not   the   independent
     projects/activities coming up inside the SEZ like those of
     the respondent Units. This is also the understanding of
     the very authority which has issued the EIA Notification,
     2006. [see the case of the Dahej SEZ and Indofil Organic
     Industries Ltd. Here also, environment clearance was
     granted to the Thermal Power Plant, the CETP and
     Township and Area Development Project, which are all
     situated inside the SEZ]



     ii. There is no provision in the EIA Notification, 2006 to
     the effect that construction carried out prior to grant of
     environmental clearance would result in rejection of the
     proposal of the project proponent. Therefore, the decision
     of the EAC cannot be vitiated on such a ground which is
     not available as per the provisions of the EIA Notification,
     2006.</blockquote>



<p id="p_161">     This petitioners' argument proceeds on a presumption
that the EAC was not aware of the construction inside the SEZ.
Such a presumption is not warranted in the absence of the
records and proceedings of the EAC and is not warranted even
in view of the following documents/facts on the record of the
present petition: (1) Development Commissioner's letter dated
30.7.2010, (2) representation dated 5.10.2010, (3) GPCB's

was aware of court cases, (6) the fact that respondent no.8
had made a presentation and submitted a map with the
location of the Units to EAC during its meeting dated
16/17.4.2012,            (7) MoEF's site visit on 6/7.12.2010,             (8) the
activities of some of the Units (for example the respondent
no.16 manufactures very huge boilers weighing hundreds of
tons, and the respondent no.18 has a warehouse and open
yard for storage of machinery and equipment) are such that it
is not possible to suggest that such activities can be carried
out otherwise than in an open manner, (9) the Units are
operating under their own independent permissions granted by
concerned authorities, (10) the other projects inside the SEZ
like   TPP,      CETP,      township      have       received    environmental
clearance.
</p>

<p id="p_162">       The petition primarily seeks an order restraining the
respondents' activities till environmental clearance is granted
to the SEZ. It does not question the legality and validity of the
decision of the EAC dated 4/5.6.2012 recommending grant of
environment clearance, or that of Clause 8(iii) of the EIA
Notification, 2006, or that of the deemed clearance to the SEZ
by virtue of the said Clause 8(iii).
</p>

<p id="p_163">       Going into the question of the correctness or otherwise of
the EAC's decision or the validity of the deemed clearance
would amount to changing/enlarging the scope of the petition
and travelling far beyond the pleadings.

<p id="p_164">       A    challenge        to   the    EAC's       recommendation         would

involve going into the records of the proceedings prior to the
recommendation made by the EAC and also EAC's own
records. Without this, the issue of validity of the EAC's
recommendation cannot be gone into.
</p>

<p id="p_165">      As per Clause 8(iii) of the EIA Notification, 2006, if the
decision of the MoEF (which is the regulatory authority) is not
communicated               within         the            period     specified,       the
recommendation of the EAC is deemed to be the decision of
the     MoEF.       In     the    present        case,       the    MoEF      has    not
communicated any decision in regard to grant/rejection of
environmental             clearance       to    the        SEZ     pursuant    to    the
recommendation of the EAC as contained in the minutes of the
EAC's      meeting         held    on      4/5.6.2012              and   9/10.7.2012.
Therefore, Clause 8(iii) of the EIA Notification, 2006 comes into
play and hence the recommendation of the EAC to grant
environmental clearance to the SEZ is deemed to be the
decision of the MoEF.

EIA Notification, 2006 without any foundation whatsoever for
doing so in the petition itself.

of   the       land        on   which     the      SEZ     is    established.          Such
ownership/leasehold rights are independent property rights of
the Developer which have no connection with environmental
laws and therefore, lease/sublease by the Developer of such
land or portions thereof in favour of other entities is not
subject to environmental laws. The Units are therefore legal
and validly in possession of their respective parcels of land and
have rights over the same.
</p>

<p id="p_169">         The EIA Notification, 2006                  does not bar establishment
and operation of Units in their respective plots even if the SEZ
itself    has      not      received     environmental           clearance.       If    the
individual Units operating inside an SEZ (which does not have
environmental              clearance)         have       obtained       all   necessary
permissions/consents, they would be in the same position as
similar non-SEZ units operating outside an SEZ.

<p id="p_170">         The provisions of the SEZ Act provide that a person

the Development Commissioner concerned. Such proposal is
thereafter forwarded to the Approval Committee for its
approval.          If      approval      is     granted,         the      Development

granted by the Development Commissioner on a request of the
entrepreneur. It is also provided that the Letter of Approval
would be valid for 5 years, subject to further extensions, from
the date of commencement of production or service activity
and it shall be construed as a licence for all purposes related to
authorized operations. Thus, the said provisions demand
timely action on the part of the Units in regard to starting their
commercial actitivities.

<p id="p_171">       The present respondents (which are entities having no
connection with the respondent no.8) are Units situated within
the multi-product SEZ of the respondent no.8 situated at
Mundra, Kutch. The said respondents have been issued their
respective Letters of Approval by the respondent no.5 -
Development Commissioner for setting up their units and
carrying on their operations in the SEZ. The said respondents
have     executed        their   respective        agreements    with     the

closure/demolition of the said units.
</p>

<p id="p_179">      The case is required to be viewed in the context of the
fact that, if the units are closed/demolished, it would result in a
serious travesty of justice. This is because the consequence of
the   inability         or   default    of     the      Developer   in   obtaining
environmental clearance or the inaction of the authorities in
processing the Developer's application for environmental
clearance would solely fall on the units, which have started
after complying with all their requirements and which have
absolutely no say in the matter of environmental clearance of
the SEZ. Such a direction would therefore be extremely harsh
and inequitable.

2006 has been followed pursuant to which the EAC has
recommended             that   the    SEZ       be     granted    environmental
clearance. The MoEF having not taken a contrary decision
within the stipulated time, the said recommendation has
become the decision of the MoEF as per law. Even if it is held
that the deeming provision as per Clause 8(iii) of the EIA
Notification, 2006 would not apply in the present case, the fact
remains      that       the    EAC       has          recommended       grant      of
environmental clearance to the SEZ and hence demolition of
the units pending the decision of the MoEF would be unjust and

recommendations of the EAC as is also evident from the fact
that Clause 8(ii) itself mandates that 'the Regulatory Authority

<p id="p_210">     Clause 8(iii) is not a deeming fiction whereby upon expiry
of a particular period, the mere application for EC stands
automatically granted without any application of mind. Clause
8(iii) creates a deeming fiction only to give finality to the
recommendations of the expert body i.e. the Expert Appraisal
Committee which has considered the application for EC in
detail and has made the recommendation after following the
detailed stage wise procedure prescribed in Clause 7 and after
a thorough and detailed application of mind by the experts
comprising the EAC. Clause 8 (iii), therefore, only gives finality
to the recommendation of the expert body which has made its
recommendation on the basis of a detailed inquiry into the
same. Clause 8(iii) gives finality to the recommendations of the
expert body whose recommendations are even otherwise
mandated to be normally accepted by the Regulatory Authority
under Clause 8(ii).

substitute their opinion for an expert opinion. The Central

discretion but only guided discretion which discretion is based
upon the recommendations of EAC.</p><pre id="pre_18">

the Central Government has neither rejected nor accepted the

      evidence of violation of EC condition and non-
      compliance. It must also be recognized that the Company
      has bypassed environmental procedures in certain cases.
      The question before the Committee is to determine the
      future course of action. One option would be to
      recommend the cancellation of clearances, where
      procedures have been bypassed. In addition, legal
      proceeding could be initiated against non-compliance
      and violations of EC conditions. But it is also clear that
      these steps, however, harsh they may sound, are in the
      nature of being procedural and would only lead to delay
      without any gains to the environment and the people.
      The Committee is cognizant of the fact that large scale
      development has already been undertaken and it is not
      possible or prudent at this stage to halt or cease its
      operations. Therefore, the Committee has decided to
      recommend a different course of action, which is both
      intended to be an effective deterrent and also suggests

stipulated in Clause 8 of the EIA Notification having elapsed
and therefore, by virtue of Clause 8 (iii) of EIA Notification, the
recommendation by the EAC having been deemed to have
been accepted by MoEF, the petitioners bona fide believed and
continue to believe that the EC sought for Mundra SEZ is
deemed to have been granted by MoEF in terms of the EAC
recommendation. However, before acting further on the basis
that the EC had been granted, the petitioners thought it fit and
proper to first seek a clarification from the MoEF in this
respect. In view of the same, the petitioners sent a letter dated
11th October, 2012 to the MoEF inter alia drawing its attention
to the provisions of Clause 8(iii) of the EIA Notification and
requesting MoEF to advise the petitioners as to whether their
understanding of the said clause is correct and they can
accordingly proceed with the implementation of their Projects
and resume their construction activities. MoEF did not reply to
the letter and did not give any clarification as to whether EC is
deemed to have been granted to APSE2.
</p>

<p id="p_221">     It is the MoEF's responsibility to put APSEZ to terms and
ensure that APSEZ complies with them. However, the MoEF has
maintained an inexplicable silence. It has neither asked the
EAC to reconsider its recommendation nor has it granted the
EC. It is APSEZ's responsibility to ensure that EC is granted at
the earliest. It is on APSEZ's representations that the
petitioners leased the plots in the SEZ and invest money on it.
Therefore, APSEZ was bound to take all steps to get the EC
including seeking appropriate remedy before this Court,
however, it has not taken any such step. In this tussle between
the MoEF, who has to give the EC, and APSEZ, whose
obligation it is to get the EC, it is the petitioners who are stuck.</p><pre id="pre_20">

under Rule 5 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 read
with <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_50">Section 3</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the
Alstom Bharat Forge Power Limited had started construction of
its factory for the manufacturing of power plant equipments
within the SEZ. Manifold issues were raised in the said petition
but in substance the main issue was with regard to the
environmental clearance as required mandatorily under the
EIA Notification, 2006.
</p>

<p id="p_253">     After taking into consideration all the relevant aspects of
the matter, the question which was posed by us for our
consideration in the said petition was as under :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">     "Having heard the learned counsel for the respective
     parties and having perused the materials on record, the
     short question for our consideration in this petition is as
     to whether in the absence of any environmental
     clearance certificate granted in favour of the MPSEZ in
     terms of the Notification dated 14th September 2006
     issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests,
     Government of India, whether the unit proposed to be
     setup by respondent no.10 within the MPSEZ can proceed
     with the construction work or not irrespective of the fact
     as to whether respondent no.10 is obliged to obtain any
     independent environmental clearance for the project or
     not."</blockquote>


<p id="p_254">     We answered the aforesaid question by observing as
under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">     "Having regard to the mandatory nature of the environmental
     clearance and the object behind the Notification dated 14th
     September 2006, we have no doubt in our mind that
     respondent nos.10 and 11 could not have proceeded ahead
     with their projects. At the best, respondent no.8 - MPSEZ could
     have allotted the plots to the companies desirous of putting up
     their own units. In any case, the allottee of a plot (i.e. the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                            Page 72 of 186</span>

lessee) cannot proceed ahead with the construction of the unit
without the MPSEZ obtaining environmental clearance from the
Ministry of Environment and Forests.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_255">We are unable to fathom the idea that all the infrastructural
facilities which the MPSEZ is obliged to provide will have to be
taken care of by the individual allottees in the event if for any
reason the authority concerned refuses to grant environmental
clearance in favour of the MPSEZ. The MPSEZ has acquired
approximately 18000 hectares of land from the Government for
the purpose of developing a port, which is going to be one of
the Asia's biggest port. The Government has allotted
approximately 18000 hectares of land for the purpose of
developing a port. If the MPSEZ itself is not accorded
environmental clearance, then the question will be as to who
will develop the port and whether the port can be developed by
the allottees who have been allotted land by the MPSEZ. This
area of 18000 hectares includes 14 villages of Mundra Taluka
and the MPSEZ has to provide for infrastructural facilities on a
large scale, which include gardens, playgrounds, dwelling units,
hospitals, clinics, dispensaries, schools, colleges, market
places, hostels, hotels, restaurants, cafeterias, theaters,
auditoriums, libraries, public entertainments, clubs, public
utilities, service building and such other facilities, conveyances
and amenities as the MPSEZ may deem it necessary or
expedient for carrying out the objects of the MPSEZ and/or
Mundra SEZ. For any reason, if the environmental clearance is
not granted in favour of the MPSEZ, then how will the allottees
be able to provide for such infrastructural facilities or
infrastructure on their own, which the MPSEZ has agreed to
provide as per the terms of the agreement. One cannot forget
or overlook the fact that environmental clearance is required to
be obtained by the MPSEZ because it has the obligation of
providing the infrastructural facilities as referred to above and
while providing such infrastructure, it will definitely have some
impact on the environment and that is the reason why, after
extensive study of the entire project, the authority has to
decide as to whether environmental clearance must be granted
or not. Under such circumstances, it is very difficult for us to
accept the submission of Mr.Thakore that the individual
allottees will take care of the infrastructural facilities. However,
taking into consideration the infrastructural facilities which are
required on a port, it is humanly impossible for an individual
allottee or a unit holder to provide all such facilities on its own.
</p>
<p id="p_256">Over and above this, we are also of the view that if the MPSEZ
has already allotted plots to different companies for setting up
of the industrial plants and if such allottees have proceeded
ahead with construction of their individual plants in the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                         Page 73 of 186</span>

absence of any infrastructural facilities available at the port,
then that by itself will lead to a very disastrous situation.
</p>
<p id="p_257">When law requires a thing to be done in a particular manner,
the same must be done in the same manner or not done at all.
The law envisages that no construction, preliminary or
otherwise, can be undertaken without environmental clearance
and the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of
T.N.Govindavarman Thirumulkpad v/s. Union of India, reported
in (2002) 10 SCC 606, also holds that it is impermissible to
undertake construction of project before such a clearance,
therefore, there is no reason why we should permit respondent
nos.10 and 11 to go ahead with their project.
</p>
<p id="p_258">It appears to us that respondent nos.10 and 11 have taken this
issue very lightly. No doubt, being allottees they would be more
interested in going ahead with their venture. But, the question
is, at what cost. We cannot overlook the fact that public
hearing precedes environmental clearance. Law envisages that
before the environmental clearance is granted, the objections
in this regard must be considered by giving public hearing. One
cannot lose the sight of the fact that the persons who lodge
their objections or make suggestions before the committee are
not only entitled to get copies of the minutes of the meeting at
the public hearing, but ultimately if the Central Government
grants the environmental clearance, under S.11 of the National
Environmental Appellate Authority Act, 1997, they also have a
right to prefer an appeal to the Appellate Authority against the
order granting environmental clearance. <a href="/doc/105719283/" id="a_51">Section 11(2)</a> of the
said Act also defines "person" as any person who is likely to be
affected by the grant of environmental clearance or any
association of persons (whether incorporated or not) likely to
be affected by such order and functioning in the field of
environment. Therefore, grant of environmental clearance is
not just an empty formality but the authority has to threadbare
consider each and every aspect relating to the environment.
We have noticed that in the present case also, public hearing
had taken place and series of objections have been raised by
various people. We have also noticed that the objections are of
a very serious nature and cannot be brushed aside lightly.
</p>
<p id="p_259">Our attention has been drawn to the objections placed in
writing in this regard, which we would like to incorporate thus :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">        1. The project for which the public hearing is going on
        has already completed 75% of the construction activities.</blockquote>

        place. I am ready to show you the location where the
        construction activities are taking place without
        permission. The videography of the construction must be
        taken before the end of the public hearing and only then
        the public hearing must be concluded.
</p>

<p id="p_261">    2. The company has constructed parts of West port and laid
       a railway line on forest land without getting the
       necessary permissions. If the clearance has been
       obtained, then the company may produce the documents
       by the end of the public hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_262">    3. If the SEZ is given clearance, then the company will
       construct a boundary wall thereby blocking the
       fishermens' access to their traditional settlements. Also,
       there are several creeks which are important for
       fishermen, these will be rendered unusable. Nearly
       10,000 fishermen depend on traditional fishing and if
       their occupation is affected, then it will have a direct
       impact on their families. Why should the company be
       allowed to establish at the cost of the fishing community.
</p>
<p id="p_263">    4. The company is in possession of Government land meant
       for rehabilitation of displaced persons. The company has
       also taken possession of Gauchar lands. In Luni village
       there is no Gauchar land left at all. Nearly 5000 cattle
       depend on the Gauchar land and if the project is allowed
       then the animal husbandry in the area will be severely
       affected. What steps will the company take in this
       regard ?
</p>
<p id="p_264">    5. The company has taken possession of nearly 18,000 Ha.
       of land in the Mundra area. However, as per the central
       government notification, only 6472.8684 Ha. of land has
       been notified as SEZ. All the excess land in the
       possession of the company has to be given back to the
       Government and the lease must be cancelled. Why has
       the company acquired excess land ? Is the company
       ready to give the land back to the Government ?
</p><p id="p_265">    6. There are several temples and mosques within the SEZ
       area. If the SEZ is allowed then these monuments will be
       destroyed and also the access road to these areas of
       religious importance will be blocked. What steps will the
       company take in this regard ?
</p>
<p id="p_266">    7. The company has defrauded the public as well as the
       Government authorities. The company acquired forest

        Economic Zone and destroyed mangroves in the area. As
        per rules, the company is supposed to do compensatory
        afforestation in another area. But the company has given
        land near Kori Creek, which is under the control of the
        BSF and also it is an area which already has dense
        mangroves. No new mangroves are grown. What is the
        company's response to this ?
</p>
<p id="p_267">    8. The company says that it is being established so that
       industrial development can take place. For this, the
       annual tax subsidy given by the government to the
       Mundra SEZ amounts to nearly 1765.65 Cr. However,
       consider the fact that the Central and State Government
       announced a package of Rs.8,500 Cr. After Kutch
       earthquake. In just five years, so much development has
       taken place in Kutch. When the company is getting so
       many subsidies from the Government and there is no
       benefit for the public, how can this be called as
       development ?
</p>
<p id="p_268">    9. The Mundra coast has a vast intertidal zone. This area
       falls under CRZ I as per Government records. The
       company is filling such area with soil and using it for port
       backup/SEZ area and establishing industries over it. The
       hydrology of the area will be affected and the water that
       is blocked in this area will enter into other areas. What
       steps are being taken by the company to mitigate this ?
</p>
<p id="p_269">    10.Nearly 20 companies have already been established in
      the Mundra SEZ. Because of this, already the marine
      pollution is increasing. If the SEZ is permitted then more
      industries will be allowed and there will be significant
      impact on agriculture and animal husbandry. What is the
      response of the company to this issue ?
</p>
<p id="p_270">    11.The company has acquired land at a price of Rs.2 to
      Rs.10 from the state government and then sold it back to
      Government companies like IOC, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_52">IPC</a>L at exorbitant rates
      of around Rs.600/-. This is misuse of taxpayers' money

      should not be allowed.

<p id="p_271">    12.The Waterfront development project of the company
      was given environment clearance inspite of people's

        say in this regard ?

<p id="p_272">    13.The forest department has done afforestation and
      mangrove plantation at a cost of nearly 50 lakhs and now
      this area has been given to the Mundra SEZ. This is not
      acceptable. The Mundra SEZ must not be given
      clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_273">    14.There is significant horticulture in the area, which will be
      affected if the Mundra SEZ is allowed, therefore the
      Mundra SEZ should not be given Environmental
      Clearance.

<p id="p_274">    15.The company has not enclosed any ToR given by the
      MoEF for the EIA of the Mundra SEZ. No ToR compliance
      report has been submitted. It is not clear whether the EIA
      is complete or not.
</p>
<p id="p_275">    16.The EIA is based on data collected between 2006 and
      2008. However, several changes have taken place in the
      meantime. Why has the EIA report containing latest data
      not been submitted for the public hearing ?

<p id="p_276">    17.Eight CFS terminals are under operation without
      permission in the Mundra SEZ. The Kandla SEZ has also

      violations can be regularized. Will the company clarify in
      this matter ?

<p id="p_277">In view of the above objections, I demand that :

environmental clearance as required under the law, till date,
the same has not been conferred and notwithstanding such
fact, MPSEZ has already executed separate lease deeds in
favour of different units like respondent No.10.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_282">It appears from the Lease Deed executed between MPSEZ and
respondent No.10 that there is clear mention of the fact that
the Government of India has permitted MPSEZ, the Lessor, vide
a Letter of Approval dated April 12, 2006 to establish a Multi-
Product Special Economic Zone at Mundra and the Lessee, i.e.,
the respondent No.10, was desirous to take on lease a plot of
land in the processing area of the MPSEZ for setting up a unit
for manufacture of Turbine, Generator and other spares and
auxiliaries related to those products and also for providing
services of erection and commissioning of above mentioned
products. According to the terms of the lease-deed, the Lessee
is required to pay Annual Lease Rent at the rate of Rs.20 a
square meter payable annually in advance and the same shall
be escalated every five (5) years at the rate of twenty percent
(20%) and the first escalation of Annual Lease Rent shall be
made in the year 2015-16 with effect from 1st April 2015.
According to the terms of the lease, in addition to the Annual
Rent indicated above, the Lessee is also required to pay SEZ
maintenance charges at the rate of Rs.18/- a square meter per
annum for the maintenance and upkeep of all the
infrastructural facilities provided to the Land and the
determination of such amount of Maintenance charges shall be
done in an open and transparent manner and would be
reviewed by the Development Commissioner of Mundra SEZ.
According to the said term, any upward revision of the
Maintenance Charges with a maximum frequency of once a
year can be made unless a requirement of refurbishment due
to damages to infrastructure caused by natural or man made
factor arises. The said deed further provides that the Lessor
shall have right to charge fifteen percent (15%) towards
management and coordination of Mundra SEZ maintenance
and refurbishment as above. The deed further mentions that in
case of failure of the Lessee to pay the above Annual Lease
Rent or SEZ Maintenance Charge would make the Lessee a
defaulter and will give right to the Lessor to terminate the
Lease before expiry of the period mentioned therein.

<p id="p_283">In the Lease Deed, the Lessor covenants that it would comply
with all the terms and conditions from time to time which have
been mentioned in Letter of Approval under which it has been
permitted by the Government to establish Mundra SEZ. In
clause 3.4, it has been further asserted by the Lessor that it
has obtained all the required permissions and the

granting lease of the land to the Lessee and shall be
responsible to comply with all the required terms and
conditions and such permissions and approvals received from
the Government and shall keep such approvals and
permissions in force (to the extent necessary under applicable
Laws) and shall make all its statutory compliances to keep the
Lease in full force and effect during the entire term.
</p>
<p id="p_284">From the above clause of the Lease Deed, it is clear that the
Lease has been executed not only for enjoyment of the land
under the SEZ, but also for the purpose of giving infrastructural
facilities provided to the land for which separate maintenance
charge has been provided. It further appears that the Lessor
was conscious that it was required to comply with all the terms
and conditions from time to time which has been mentioned in
the Letter of Approval and it further asserted that it has
obtained all the required permissions and Governmental
Approvals as required in the name of Lessor and is also
responsible to comply with all the permissions and approvals
received from the Government and shall keep such approvals
and permissions in force to keep the lease in full force and
effect during the entire term.
</p>
<p id="p_285">It is an admitted fact that environmental clearance required to
be taken by the Lessor has been applied for but has not yet
been granted. Nevertheless, the Lessor has asserted the above
fact of getting permission and keeping such permission alive
during the subsistence of lease in favour of the respondent no.

<p id="p_287">I, therefore, find no substance in the contention of Mr Thakore
or Mr Joshi, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of
the respondent nos. 8 and 10 respectively that if in the long
run, no environmental clearance is given by the Central
Government, the separate unit holders would be to make
independent arrangements for infrastructural facilities by
taking separate permission of their own from the Central
Government because such provision is not indicated in the
lease deed. On the other hand, the Lease Deed casts a duty
upon the Lessor to provide for such facilities in lieu of rent and
maintenance charge.
</p>
<p id="p_288">I have already pointed out that the Lease is executed not only
for the enjoyment of the possession in the land but also for
enjoyment of infrastructural facilities to be arranged by the
Lessor and if required permission for such infrastructural

     facilities has not yet been given by the Central Government,
     the Lessor, in my opinion, was not even competent to create a
     Lease for the above purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_289">     I, thus, find substance in the contention of the petitioner that
     so long the Lessor itself is not vested with the right to have
     establishment of various infrastructural facilities by taking
     environmental clearance, it cannot confer the right of
     enjoyment of such facilities to its Lessee.
</p>
<p id="p_290">     It is now well known that Lease is a doctrine of separation of
     title from actual enjoyment of the subject matter. Before
     execution of a Lease in favour of a Lessee, the Lessor retains
     both the title and the right of enjoyment of the property. Once
     a Lease is executed, the Lessor retains only the title to the
     property but loses its right of enjoyment thereof by conferring
     the same in favour of its Lessee. According to the 2006
     Notification, in order to have such right of creation of
     infrastructural facilities over the land allotted, prior approval of
     the Central Government is necessary before making any
     construction and thus, without having acquired such right, the
     MPSEZ, the allottee from the Government, could not convey
     such right to its Lessee. In other words, a Lessee cannot have
     better right than that of his Lessor in the property. Law is also
     well settled that there cannot any valid Lease for enjoyment of
     a property, which is not in existence and not capable of being
     put into possession of the Lessee at the time of execution of
     the Lease.
</p>
<p id="p_291">     I, thus, find that so long the environmental clearance is not
     granted by the Central Government in favour of MPSEZ for
     creation of infrastructural facilities on the land so allotted and
     consequent to such permission, such facilities have been
     actually created by the allottee, the latter cannot lawfully lease
     out the right of enjoyment of the infrastructural facilities to its
     Lessee.
</p>
<p id="p_292">     I, consequently, agree with my learned Brother as regards the
     relief granted to the petitioner in this application ordered by His
     Lordship."
</p>

<p id="p_293">     Thus, from the above, it is evident that we took the view
that so long as the environmental clearance is not granted by
the Central Government in favour of the MPSEZ for creation of
infrastructural facilities on the land so allotted and consequent
to such permission such facilities have been actually created

by the allottee, the lessor cannot lawfully lease out the right of
enjoyment       of      the     infrastructural       facilities   to   its   lessee.
Accordingly, we allowed the petition restraining the two unit
holders against whom the petition was filed from proceeding
ahead in the implementation of their projects with a direction
that they shall not undertake any further construction work,
whether preliminary or otherwise, till the MPSEZ was granted
environmental clearance.
</p>

<p id="p_294">      At this stage, it may not be out of place to state that the
aforesaid judgment and order passed by us has attained
finality. Till this date, it remains in operation and during the
course of the hearing of the Special Civil Application No.2621
of 2013, Mr.Gopal Subramaniam, the learned senior advocate
appearing for the petitioners who were the respondents in the
Writ Petition (PIL) No.194 of 2011, made a statement at the bar
that his clients have accepted the verdict of this Court and
conceded to the proposition of law laid down by us.
</p>

<p id="p_295">      However, Mr.Subramaniam submitted that his clients had
to file a substantive petition only with a view to inform this
Court that since the MPSEZ has now obtained a deemed
environmental clearance, it would be open for his clients to
proceed with the construction in light of such deemed
environmental clearance, but still thought fit to first bring it to
the   notice      of     this    Court    about        the   so-called        deemed
environmental clearance before actually commencing with the
construction work as in the earlier petitions they were
restrained from putting up any construction.
</p>

<p id="p_296">      Therefore, the picture that emerges as on today is that as

against the law laid down by us in the Writ Petition (PIL)
No.194 of 2011 that if the MPSEZ itself has not been granted
environmental clearance under the EIA Notification, 2006 by
the Central Government, any unit setup within the MPSEZ as a
lessee of the MPSEZ could not have proceeded with the
construction work irrespective of the fact that such individual
unit was required to obtain separate environmental clearance,
the units i.e. the respondent nos.10 to 21 are now taking the
shelter of the deemed environmental clearance granted in
favour of the MPSEZ by a fiction of law.
</p>

<p id="p_297">     Whether such a deemed environmental clearance would
save the situation or not, is the moot question which we
propose to consider, but before we answer this question, we
deem it necessary to deal with the preliminary contentions
raised by the respondents as regards the maintainability of the
Writ Petition (PIL) No.21 of 2013.

<p id="p_301">     It was also sought to be contended that the petitioners
being the residents of the same village where the units have
been setup, would have been aware of the fact that the units
are being setup in the MPSEZ. The units have been setup since
2010 and thereafter been commissioned. It was also submitted
before us that in the earlier round of litigation being Writ
Petition (PIL) No.194 of 2011, the villagers had thought fit to
implead only two unit holders, more particularly when they
were aware that there are many units in operation within the
SEZ. Even the present petitioners were aware about the
various units in operation within the SEZ and such fact is
evident considering that a public hearing for environmental
clearance had taken place on 5th October 2010 and during the
public hearing, the villagers were aware of the fact that 20
units have been setup.
</p>

<p id="p_302">     As against the above, Mr.Yagnik submitted that the SEZ
is spread over in 18000 hectares of land covering more than
14 villages. It is more than 35 kms. in length in terms of the
available road. According to Mr.Yagnik, it was not possible for
the petitioners to know in which part of the entire SEZ the
activities were going on. Mr.Yagnik submitted that after the
pronouncement of the judgment in the Writ Petition (PIL)
No.194 of 2011, efforts were made to find out about the other
units in operation, and after a thorough inquiry, the villagers
have brought to the notice of this Court that there are other
units also operating within the SEZ without any environmental
clearance granted in favour of the MPSEZ.</p><pre id="pre_23">

<p id="p_304">     We are conscious of the fact that the principle of delay
applies even in cases of public interest litigations, but the rule
which says that the Court may not inquire into belated and
stale claims is not a rule of law, but a rule of practice based on
sound and proper exercise of discretion, and there is no
inviolable rule that whenever there is a delay, the court must
necessarily refuse to entertain the petition. Each case must
depend on its own facts. The question of delay is one of
discretion of the court to follow from case to case. There is no
lower limit and there is no upper limit. It will all depend on
what the breach of the fundamental right and the remedy
claimed are and how the delay arose. (see <a href="/doc/20762/" id="a_54">Ramchandra
Shankar Deodhar and others v. The State of Maharashtra and
others</a>, reported in AIR 1974 SC 259)


     We      are       dealing   with    a     very   important   issue     of
environment and the rights of the people who are likely to be
affected and, therefore, in such circumstances, we do not
deem fit to reject the petition on a plea of delay and laches.
</p>

<p id="p_305">     In the case before us, it is not in dispute that the
respondent nos.10 to 21 started their industrial units after
being put into possession by the lessor MPSEZ in the year 2008
knowing fully well that the lessor has not been granted                   the
environmental clearance by the Central Government as
required under the Notification, 2006. They continued with

their operations. In Writ Petition (PIL) No.194 of 2011, we held
that the unit holders as lessees could not have proceeded with
the construction of their plots in the absence of any valid
environmental clearance granted in favour of the lessor
MPSEZ. In such circumstances, the defence of delay do not
hold good. When the law requires a thing to be done in a
certain way, then it has to be done in that way and no other.
</p>

<p id="p_306">     Even though, there may be some doubt as to whether
delay and laches can deny the relief prayed for by the
petitioners in this petition, we are of the opinion that the unit
holders, if acted with the knowledge that they are violating the
provisions of law, then in such circumstances, even if there is
any inordinate delay in redressing the grievance, the relief to
set right the illegality should not be denied. The defence of
laches or inordinate delay is a defence in equity. In equity,
both the parties must come to the court with clean hands. The
equitable defence can be put up by a party who has acted
fairly and honestly. A person who is guilty of violating the law
or infringing or usurping somebody else's right cannot claim
the continued exercise of the usurped right.

<p id="p_307">     In the aforesaid context, we may refer to a recent
pronouncement of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/46771491/" id="a_55">Tukaram

position of law on the issue of delay. What was assailed before

resorting to any procedure prescribed by law. It was contended
before the Court that the delay and laches on the part of the
appellants had extinguished the right to put forth a claim. In
such     circumstances,    His    Lordship     made    the    following
observations in paragraphs 10, 11 and 12, which, in our
opinion, are very apt and helps the petitioners :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_39">       "10. The State, especially a welfare State which is
       governed by the Rule of Law, cannot arrogate itself to a
       status beyond one that is provided by the Constitution.
       Our Constitution is an organic and flexible one. Delay and
       laches is adopted as a mode of discretion to decline
       exercise of jurisdiction to grant relief. There is another
       facet. The Court is required to exercise judicial discretion.
       The said discretion is dependent on facts and
       circumstances of the cases. Delay and laches is one of
       the facets to deny exercise of discretion. It is not an
       absolute impediment. There can be mitigating factors,
       continuity of cause of action, etc. That apart, if whole
       thing shocks the judicial conscience, then the Court
       should exercise the discretion more so, when no third
       party interest is involved. Thus analysed, the petition is
       not hit by the doctrine of delay and laches as the same is
       not a constitutional imitation, the cause of action is
       continuous and further the situation certainly shocks
       judicial conscience.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">       11. The question of condonation of delay is one of the
       discretion and has to be decided on the basis of the facts
       of the case at hand, as the same vary from case to case.
       It will depend upon what the breach of fundamental right
       and the remedy claimed are and when and how the delay
       arose. It is not that there is any period of limitation for
       the Courts to exercise their powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_56">Article 226</a>, nor
       is it that there can never be a case where the Courts
       cannot interfere in a matter, after the passage of a
       certain length of time. There may be a case where the
       demand for justice is so compelling, that the High Court
       would be inclined to interfere in spite of delay.
       Ultimately, it would be a matter within the discretion of
       the Court and such discretion, must be exercised fairly
       and justly so as to promote justice and not to defeat it.</blockquote><pre id="pre_24">

</p>

<p id="p_316">     We shall now deal with the second preliminary objection
raised by the respondents as regards the doctrine of res
judicata and constructive res judicata.
</p>

<p id="p_317">     Mr.Dave, the learned senior advocate appearing on
behalf of the respondent no.8 MPSEZ vehemently submitted
that the Writ Petition (PIL) No.21 of 2013 is hit by the doctrine
of res judicata inasmuch as it could have been argued in the
earlier round of litigation before this Court that even if the
environmental clearance is granted it would not save the
situation for the unit holders because they had completed the
construction way back in the year 2008. In short, according to
Mr.Dave, in the judgment and order rendered by this very
Bench in Writ Petition (PIL) No.194 of 2011, it has been very
clearly observed that the two unit holders who were made
respondents shall not proceed further with any type of
construction till the   environmental clearance is obtained by
the lessor i.e. the MPSEZ. According to Mr.Dave, at that very
stage it should have been argued and it could have been
argued by the petitioners of Writ Petition (PIL) No.194 of 2011
that it would not make any difference whether environmental
clearance is now granted or not.</p><pre id="pre_25">

</pre><p id="p_318">      Thus, according to Mr.Dave, the doctrine of constructive
res judicata would apply in the present petition despite the fact
that the petitioners are different, but the question of law
remains the same which could have been raised but was not
raised in the earlier round of litigation.
</p>

<p id="p_319">      In this connection, we may refer to a decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1489340/" id="a_67">Forward Construction Co. v.
Prabhat Mandal</a>, (1986)1 SCC 100, wherein the Supreme Court
held that the principles of constructive         res judicata are
applicable to public interest litigation, particularly in view of
the Explanation VI to Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908: The Court observed thus :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_45">      "But it is only when the conditions of Explanation VI are
      satisfied that a decision in the litigation will bind all
      persons interested in the right litigated and the onus of
      providing the want of bona fides in respect of the
      previous litigation is on the party seeking to avoid the
      decision. The words "public right" have been added in
      Explanation VI in view of the new S.91 CPC and to
      prevent multiplicity of litigation in respect of public right.
      In view of Expln. VI it cannot be disputed that <a href="/doc/181903687/" id="a_68">Section 11</a>
      applies to public interest litigation not by way of a private
      grievance. It has to be a bona fide litigation in respect of
      a right which is common and is agitated in common with
      others."</blockquote>


<p id="p_320">      The aforenoted decision has been considered in a
subsequent judgment of a Bench of two Judges of the Supreme
Court in the case of <a href="/doc/229223/" id="a_69">V.Purushotham Rao v. Union of India</a>,
(2001)10 SCC 305, wherein the Supreme Court held thus :

     and the larger public interest which is being served.
     There cannot be any dispute that in competing rights
     between the public interest and individual interest, the
     public interest would override."</blockquote>


<p id="p_321">     Thus, from the above, it is evident that the question as to
whether the principles of constructive res judicata will apply in
the facts of a particular litigation instituted in public interest
will depend, inter alia, on the nature of the litigation, its impact
on the society and the public interest involved.

<blockquote id="blockquote_54">     "Res judicata debars a Court from exercising its

     against him, he would be estopped from raising the same

was in issue in the Writ Petition (PIL) No.194 of 2011 filed by

<p id="p_323">     In the present petition, the villagers other than the one
who had filed the earlier petition have come with a case that
the dictum of law laid down by this Court in Writ Petition (PIL)
No.194 of 2011 should equally apply to all other units which
are in operation as on today within the SEZ. In defence, the
lessor MPSEZ and the individual unit holders, namely, the
respondent nos.10 to 21 have come out with a case that there
is a deemed            environmental clearance as on today and,
therefore, there is no question of now restraining the unit
holders from operating their individual units.
</p>

<p id="p_324">     In this petition, we are considering the question, whether
there is a deemed environmental clearance and what would be
the effect of such a deemed                  environmental clearance, as
pleaded by the respondents in their defence. Thus, it could not
be said by any stretch of imagination that such issue was
directly and substantially involved in the earlier round of
litigation and has been finally decided by this Court.

<p id="p_325">     As a matter of fact, the petitioners herein had no idea or
knowledge of any deemed environmental clearance obtained

by the lessor MPSEZ and it is only when a reply was filed taking
up this contention that they realized that pursuant to the
recommendations made by the EAC, there is a deemed
environmental clearance as the Central Government failed to
pass any orders within a period of 45 days as stipulated in the
EIA Notification, 2006.
</p>

<p id="p_326">      Thus, we are not impressed by the submissions of
Mr.Dave that the petition is hit by the doctrine of res judicata
or constructive res judicata and we, accordingly, reject the
second preliminary objection as regards the maintainability of
this petition. On the other hand, the MPSEZ and the petitioner
of Special Civil Application No.2621 of 2013 who were parties
to the earlier proceedings are bound by our observations made
in Writ Petition (PIL) No.194 of 2011 decided on 9 th May 2012
and which has attained finality that so long the environmental
clearance is not granted by the Central Government in favour
of the MPSEZ for creation of infrastructural facilities on the
land so allotted and consequent to such permission, such
facilities have been actually created by the allottee, the latter
could not have lawfully leased out the right of enjoyment of
the infrastructural facilities to its lessee.

<p id="p_328">      The above takes us to deal with the third preliminary
objection raised on behalf of the respondents as regards the
lack of pleadings and relief prayed for in the Writ Petition (PIL)
No.21 of 2013. It has been stated that in the Writ Petition (PIL)
No.21    of    2013     there   is   no    prayer   to   set   aside     the
recommendations made by the EAC as regards the grant of

environmental clearance and also no prayer to declare that
there is no deemed environmental clearance in favour of the
lessor MPSEZ.
</p>

<p id="p_329">     In short, the objection is to the effect that the petition has
become infructuous and should be rejected because the
petitioners         are    unaware      of     the    fact   that   a   deemed
environmental clearance could be said to have been granted in
favour of the lessor MPSEZ.
</p>

<p id="p_330">     It is now well-settled that strict rules of pleading may not
apply to a public interest litigation if there is sufficient material
on record on the basis of which the Court may proceed. The
technicalities of the rules of pleadings cannot be made
applicable vigorously. Pleadings prepared sometimes on the
basis of incomplete information in a public interest litigation
should be considered having regard to the issue which is being
brought before the Court. It is now well-settled that even a
simple letter addressed by a citizen could be treated as a
public interest litigation and the Court may look into the same
by calling upon the respondents to explain.
</p>

<p id="p_331">     In the present case, there is no doubt that the petition
proceeds only on the footing that there are many units
operating within the SEZ as on today in the absence of any
environmental clearance granted in favour of the lessor MPSEZ
and, therefore, they should be restrained from operating their
units.

<p id="p_332">     It is only when the respondents appeared and filed their
counter that the petitioners realized that the EAC, in its

and July 2012 respectively, had discussed the issue of grant of
environmental            clearance     in    favour       of   the     MPSEZ        and,
accordingly, recommended to the Central Government to grant
such      environmental clearance. The Central Government,
having not acted on such recommendations within a period of
45     days     as       prescribed    in     the      Notification,     a   deemed
environmental clearance is said to have been granted in favour
of the MPSEZ by a deeming fiction.
</p>

<p id="p_333">       Ordinarily, a writ court should not grant relief to the
petitioner on a case for which there is no foundation in the
pleadings and which the other side is not called upon or had an
opportunity to meet. But, when the alternative case, which the
petitioner is able to make is not only admitted by the
respondents in their reply but is expressly put forward as an
answer to the complaint which the petitioner makes in the
petition, there would be nothing improper or illegal now giving
the petitioner the relief as prayed for in the petition. In the
present case, to meet with the petition of the petitioners, the
respondents have pleaded and put forward in defence the
deemed environmental clearance with necessary materials on
record.

</p>

<p id="p_336">     In the said case, the appeal before the Supreme Court
was on behalf of the original plaintiff and it arose out of a suit
for specific performance of a contract to sell a house belonging
to the defendants (second party) who had agreed to sell the
house to the plaintiff, but subsequently, resiled from the
agreement and sold the same to the defendants (first party)
who purchased it with notice of the contract.
</p>

<p id="p_337">     The suit was contested by both sets of defendants. The
second party defendants contended, inter alia, that they had
never agreed to sell their house to the plaintiff and the story of
a contract of sale as setup by the plaintiff was entirely false.
They admitted that they were in need of money and had
approached the plaintiff for a loan and the plaintiff had
advanced to them a sum of Rs.30,000=00 at the rate of 6%
interest per annum. According to the second party defendants,
it was entirely for facilitating the payment of interest due on
the loan and not in part performance of the contract of sale
that the plaintiff was put in possession of the same.
</p>

<p id="p_338">     The trial Judge dismissed the plaintiff's claim for specific
performance, but as the second party defendants admitted
that they had taken an advance of Rs.30,000=00 from the
plaintiff, a money decree was given to the plaintiff for such
sum against the defendants with interest at the rate of 6% per
annum from the date of the suit till realization.</p><pre id="pre_28">

High Court at Patna and the second party defendants also filed
cross-objections challenging the propriety of the money decree
that was passed against them.
</p>

<p id="p_340">     The High Court, vide its judgment, dismissed the appeal
of the plaintiff and allowed the cross-objections preferred by
the second party defendants. The High Court agreed with the
trial Judge in holding that the sum of Rs.30,000=00 was
advanced as a loan by the plaintiff to the second party
defendants. However, on the basis of the evidence on record,
the High Court reached to the conclusion that the money
decree granted against the second party defendants was not
warranted in law as no case of a loan was made out by the
plaintiff in the plaint and no relief was claimed on that basis.
The result was that the suit was dismissed in its entirety and a
decree for recovery of money that was made in favour of the
plaintiff by the trial Court was set aside. Against the judgment
passed by the High Court, the plaintiff came up in appeal
before the Supreme Court. In the aforesaid background, the

other prayer is not really material. A pltf. may rely upon
different rights alternatively and there is nothing in the
Civil P.C. to prevent a party from making two or more
inconsistent sets of allegations and claiming relief
thereunder in the alternative. The question, however,
arises whether, in the absence of any such alternative
case in the plaint it is open to the Ct. to give him relief on
that basis. The rule undoubtedly is that the Ct. cannot
grant relief to the pltf. on a case for which there was no
foundation in the pleading and which the other side was
not called upon or had an opportunity to meet. But when
the alternative case, which the pltf. could have made,
was not only admitted by the deft. in his written
statement but was expressly put forward as an answer to
the claim which the pltf. made in the suit, there would be
nothing improper in giving the pltf. a decree upon the
case which the deft. himself makes. A demand of the pltf.
based on the deft's own plea cannot possibly be
regarded with surprise by the latter and no question of
adducing evidence on these facts would arise when they
were expressly admitted by the deft. in his pleadings. In
such circumstances when no injustice can possibly result
to the deft., it may not be proper to drive the pltf, to file a
separate suit. As an illustration of this principle,
reference may be made to the pronouncement of the
Judicial Committee in <a href="/doc/1886825/" id="a_72">Mohan Manucha v. Manzoor
Ahmad</a>,70 I.A. 1 : (A.I.R. (30) 1943 P.C. 29). This appeal
arose out of a suit commenced by the pltf applt. to
enforce a mtge. security. The plea of the deft. was that
the mtge. was void. This plea was given effect to by both
the lower Ct. as well as by the P.C. But the P.C. held that
it was open in such circumstances to the pltf to repudiate
the transaction altogether and claim a relief outside it in
the form of restitution under<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_73"> S. 65</a>, Contract Art. Although
no such alternative claim was made in the plaint, the P.C.
allowed it to be advanced and gave a decree on the
ground that the resp. could not be prejudiced by such a
claim at all and the matter ought not to be left to a
separate suit. It may be noted that this relief was allowed
to the applt. even though the appeal was heard ex parte
in the absence of the resp."

Supreme Court, we reject the submission canvassed on behalf
of the respondents that the petition deserves to be rejected on
the ground of lack of proper pleadings and relief.
</p>

<p id="p_343">     Plea of Alternative Remedy :
</p>

<p id="p_344">     It was also sought to be contended that the petition
should not be entertained as there is an alternative remedy
available to the petitioners by approaching the National Green
Tribunal constituted under the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_74">National Green Tribunal Act</a>. We
are not impressed by such submission canvassed on behalf of
the respondents. It is true that the power of the High Court to
issue prerogative writs under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_75">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India is plenary in nature and cannot be curtailed by other
provisions of the Constitution of India or a statute, but the High
Courts have imposed upon themselves certain restrictions on
the exercise of such powers. One of such restriction that if an
effective and efficacious remedy is available, the High Court
would not normally exercise its jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_76">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution of India. But again this rule of exclusion of writ
jurisdiction on account of availability of an alternative remedy
does not operate as an absolute bar to entertain a writ petition
but is a discretion to be exercised depending upon the facts of
each case.
</p>

<p id="p_345">     In    an     appropriate    case,       inspite   of    availability     of
alternative remedy, the High Court may still exercise its
jurisdiction in atleast three contingencies : (1) where the writ
petition seek enforcement of any of the fundamental rights; (2)
where there is a failure of principles of natural justice; or (3)
where the orders or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction

<p id="p_379">  (5)           If the regulatory authority fails to communicate its

     or denied by the regulatory authority in terms of the final
     recommendations of the EAC.
</p>

<p id="p_380">     The emphasis is on the use of the words "the applicant
may proceed as if the environmental clearance sought for has
been granted or denied". It is evident that it is only on the
expiry of 45 days from the date of the recommendations of the
EAC that a deeming fiction comes into play due to failure on
the part of the regulatory authority to take appropriate
decision on such recommendations. On expiry of 45 days, it
would be permissible for the applicant to proceed as if the
environmental clearance sought for has been granted.
</p>

<p id="p_381">     Something else, that is of utmost importance is to
understand that the deeming fiction as provided in Clause 8 of
the EIA Notification, 2006 can only operate prospectively and
not retrospectively. That is to say, the deeming provision
would give rise to presumption that the clearance is granted
on the expiry of 45 days' period from the date of the
recommendations of the EAC in the absence of any order
passed by the Central Government.
</p>

<p id="p_382">     It is to be noted that what is to be deemed is a matter of
fact; there is a 'deeming fiction'. It is also to be noted that

     'sustainable development.' This is a development
     strategy that caters the needs of the present without
     negotiating the ability of upcoming generations to satisfy
     their needs. The strict observance of sustainable
     development will put us on a path that ensures
     development while protecting the environment, a path
     that works for all peoples and for all generations. It is a
     guarantee to the present and a bequeath to the future.
     All environmental related developmental activities should
     benefit more people while maintaining the environmental

<p id="p_385">     23. In a catena of cases we have reiterated that right to
     clean environment is a guaranteed fundamental right,
     May be in different context, the right to development is
     also declared as a component of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_85">Article 21</a> in cases like
     Samata v. State of Andhra Pradesh, (1997)8 SCC 191,

and in <a href="/doc/755959/" id="a_86">Madhu Kishore v. State of Bihar</a>, (1996)5 SCC 125.
</p>

<p id="p_386">24. The right to development cannot be treated as a
mere right to economic betterment or cannot be limited
to as a misnomer to simple construction activities. The
right to development encompasses much more than
economic well being, and includes within its definition the
guarantee      of    fundamental        human     rights.  The
'development' is not related only to the growth of GNP, in
the classic work - 'Development As Freedom' the Nobel
prize winner Amartya Sen pointed out that 'the issue of
development cannot be separated from the conceptual
framework of human right'. This idea is also part of the
UN Declaration on the Right to Development. The right to
development includes the whole spectrum of civil,
cultural, economic, political and social process, for the
improvement of peoples' well being and realization of
their full potential. It is an integral part of human right. Of
course, construction of a dam or a mega project is
definitely an attempt to achieve the goal of wholesome
development. Such works could very well be treated as
integral component for development.
</p>

<p id="p_387">25. Therefore, the adherence of sustainable development
principle is a sine qua non for the maintenance of the
symbiotic balance between the rights to environment
and development. Right to environment is a fundamental
right. On the other hand right to development is also one.
Here the right to 'sustainable development' cannot be
singled out. Therefore, the concept of 'sustainable
development' is to be treated an integral part of 'life'
under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_87">Article 21.</a> The weighty concepts like inter-
generational equity (<a href="/doc/1149168/" id="a_88">State of Himachal Pradesh v.
Ganesh Wood Products</a>, (1995)6 SCC 363, public trust
doctrine (<a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_89">M.C.Mehta v. Kamal Nath</a>, (1997)1 SCC 388)
and precautionary principle (Vellore Citizens, (1996)5
SCC 647), which we declared as inseparable ingredients
of our environmental jurisprudence, could only be
nurtured by ensuring sustainable development.

     powers to ensure sustainable development, it will
     become a barren shell. In other words, sustainable
     development is one of the means to achieve the object
     and purpose of the Act as well as the protection of 'life'
     under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_92">Article 21.</a> Acknowledgment of this principle will
     breath new life into our environmental jurisprudence and
     constitutional resolve. Sustainable development could be
     achieved only by strict compliance of the directions
     under the Act. The object and purpose of the Act - "to
     provide for the protection and improvement of
     environment" could only be achieved by ensuring the
     strict compliance of its directions. The concerned
     authorities by exercising its powers under the Act will
     have to ensure the acquiescence of sustainable
     development. Therefore, the directions or conditions put
     forward by the Act need to be strictly complied with.
     Thus the power under the Act cannot be treated as a
     power simpliciter, but it is a power coupled with duty. It
     is the duty of the State to make sure the fulfillment of
     conditions or direction under the Act, Without strict
     compliance, right to environment under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_93">Article 21</a> could
     not be guaranteed and the purpose of the Act will also be
     defeated. The commitment to the conditions thereof is an
     obligation both under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_94">Article 21</a> and under the Act. The
     conditions glued to the environmental clearance for the
     Tehri Dam Project given by the Ministry of Environment
     vide its Order dated July 19, 1990 has to be viewed from
     this perspective."

<p id="p_389">     A lot has been argued on the deeming fiction provided in
Clause 8 of the EIA Notification, 2006 and the deemed
environmental clearance said to have been granted in favour
of the MPSEZ. What is the effect of such a deeming provision
and what could be the legislative intent behind providing such
a deeming provision.
</p>

<p id="p_390">       The      word   "deemed"     is    used   in   various   senses.
Sometimes, it means "generally regarded". At other time, it
signifies 'taken prima facie to be', while in other case, it

means, 'taken conclusively'. Its various meanings are, - 'to
deem' is 'to hold in belief, estimation or opinion'; to judge;
adjudge; decide; considered to be; to have or to be of an
opinion; to esteem; to suppose, to think, decide or believe on
considerations; to account, to regard; to adjudge or decide; to
conclude upon consideration. (see Major Law Lexicon by
P.Ramanatha Aiyar, 4th Edition 2010 Vol.2)


     A deeming fiction is a supposition of law that the thing is
true without inquiring whether it be so or not, that it may have
the effect of truth so far as it is consistent with justice. A
deeming provision is made to include what is obvious or what
is uncertain or to impose, for the purpose of statute, an
ordinary construction of a word or phrase that would not
otherwise prevail but, in each case, it would be a separate
question as to that what object the Legislature has made on
such a deeming fiction.
</p>

<p id="p_391">     In this connection, we deem it necessary to consider few
precedents on the true meaning of the word 'deem' and
'deeming fiction'.
</p>

<p id="p_392">     In Consolidated Coffee Ltd. v/s. Coffee Board,
Bangalore, reported in AIR 1980 SC 1468, the purpose of the
word 'deemed' occurring in <a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_95">Section 5(3)</a> of the Central Sales
Tax Act, 1956 came for consideration. The issue that
emanated was whether a legal fiction had been created by use
of the word 'deemed'. It is fruitful to reproduce what has been
exposited by Their Lordships:

     of a statute an artificial construction of a word or phrase
     that would not otherwise prevail, but in each case it
     would be a question as to with what object the legislature
     has made such a deeming provision. In St. Aubyn and
     Ors. v/s. Attorney General, 1952 A.C. 15 at p.53 Lord
     Radcliffe observed thus:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">             "The word 'deemed' is used a great deal in modern
             legislation. Sometimes it is used to impose for the
             purposes of a statute an artificial construction of a
             word or phrase that would not otherwise prevail.
             Sometimes it is used to put beyond doubt a
             particular construction that might otherwise be
             uncertain. Sometimes it is used to give a
             comprehensive description that includes what is
             obvious, what is uncertain and what is, in the
             ordinary sense, impossible."

<blockquote id="blockquote_61">     In State of Tamil Nadu v/s. M/s. Arooran Sugars
Ltd., reported in AIR 1997 SC 1815, a Constitution Bench,
while dealing with the deeming provision in a statute, opined
that the role of a provision in a statute creating legal fiction is
well settled. Their Lordships referred to the decisions in East
End Dwellings Co. Ltd. v/s. Finsbury Borough Council,
1952 AC 109, Chief Inspector of Mines v/s. Karam Chand
Thapar, AIR 1961 SC 838, J.K. Cotton Spinning and

Corporation of India, AIR 1994 SC 1343 and Harish Tandon
v/s. Addl. District Magistrate, Allahabad, AIR 1995 SC
676, and came to hold that when a statute creates a legal
fiction saying that something shall be deemed to have been
done which in fact and truth has not been done, the Court has
to examine and ascertain as to for what purpose and between
which persons such a statutory fiction is to be resorted to and

thereafter the courts have to give full effect


        "6. ... It is a well known principle of construction that in
        interpreting a provision creating a legal fiction, the Court
        is to ascertain for what purpose the fiction is created, and
        after ascertaining this, the Court is to assume all those
        facts and consequences which are incidental or
        inevitable corollaries to giving effect to the fiction. But in
        so construing the fiction it is not to be extended beyond
        the purpose for which it is created, or beyond the
        language of the Section by which it is created..."</blockquote>


<p id="p_393">        From       the    aforesaid   pronouncements,     the    principle
discernible is that, it is the bounden duty of the court to
ascertain for what purpose the legal fiction has been created.
It is also the duty of the Court to imagine the fiction with all
real consequences and instances unless prohibited from doing
so. That apart, the use of the term deemed has to be read in
its context and further the fullest logical purpose and import
are to be understood. It is because in modern legislation, the
term deemed has been used for manifold purposes. The object
of the Legislature has to be kept in mind. (See Andaleeb
Sehgal v/s. Union of India and another, AIR 2011 Delhi 29
(FB))


        In the aforesaid context, we may also profitably state
that the language employed in Clause 8 of the EIA Notification,
2006 must be read in a holistic and purposeful manner. The
Court has a sacrosanct duty to understand the intention of the
Legislature while interpreting a provision.

expressed the view as follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_62">     "The dominant purpose in construing a statute is to
     ascertain the intention of the Parliament. One of the well
     recognised canons of construction is that the legislature
     speaks its mind by use of correct expression and unless
     there is any ambiguity in the language of the provision
     the Court should adopt literal construction if it does not
     lead to an absurdity. The first question to be posed is
     whether there is any ambiguity in the language used in
     Rule 40. If there is none, it would mean the language
     used speaks the mind of Parliament and there is no need
     to look somewhere else to discover the intention or
     meaning. If the literal construction leads to an absurdity,
     external aids to construction can be resorted to. To
     ascertain the literal meaning it is equally necessary first
     to ascertain the juxtaposition in which the rule is placed,
     the purpose for which it is enacted and the object which
     it is required to subserve and the authority by which the
     rule is framed. This necessitates examination of the
     broad features of the Act."</blockquote>

<p id="p_395">     In Reserve Bank of India v/s. Peerless General

     They are the bases of interpretation. One may well say if

     interpretation is best which makes the textual
     interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best

     have to be construed so that every word has a place and
     everything is in its place..."</blockquote>



<p id="p_396">     Bearing the aforesaid principles in mind, it is necessary
for us now to consider the object of such deeming provisions
provided by the Legislature in the EIA Notification, 2006.
</p>

<p id="p_397">     The environmental clearance process is required for 39
types of projects and covers aspects like screening, scoping
and evaluation of the upcoming projects. The main purpose is
to assess impact of the project on the environment and the
people and to try to minimize the same.
</p>

<p id="p_398">     The environmental clearance process has been a subject
of significant debate, particularly on how uncertainty in the
granting process affects the implementation period and costs
of the projects.
</p>

<p id="p_399">     Every provision of a statute is brought into by the
Legislature with a particular object in mind, and when a
provision requires a thing to be done in a particular manner
and charged the executive with the task of getting it done in
that fashion alone, the power under the provision has to be
exercised responsibly to ensure proper governance of matters
which have a direct bearing on the welfare of each and every
citizen individually and the society as a whole.
</p>

<p id="p_400">     It is also a settled law that whenever there are two


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">                           Page 118 of 186</span>



                                                                   118 of 189

possible interpretations, the one which subserves to the intent
of the Legislature is to be accepted. The object of the
Notification, 2006 is to assess impact of the plant project on
the environment and the people and to try to minimise the
same, and thus, the interpretation which upholds any such
scheme should be followed. Heydon's principle is now well-
recognized in interpreting any enactment. It lays down : the
courts must see (a) what was the law before making of the Act;
</p><p id="p_401">(b) what was the mischief or defect for which the law did not
provide; (c) what is the remedy that the Act has provided; and
</p><p id="p_402">(d) what is the reason of the remedy. It states that courts must
adopt that construction which suppresses the mischief and
advances remedy. (see <a href="/doc/436257/" id="a_96">Raipur Development Authority v.
Anupam Sahakari Gruh Nirman Samiti</a>, (2000)4 SCC 357)


     It appears to us that the object behind providing for such
a deeming fiction is to see that the project does not get
delayed, as a result of which, the project proponent may not
have to suffer hardship. This is precisely the reason why
Clause 8 of the EIA Notification, 2006 provides that the Central
Government should act on the recommendations of the EAC
within a period of 45 days; failing which, the applicant may
proceed as if the environmental clearance sought for has been
granted in terms of the final recommendations of the Expert
Appraisal Committee.
</p>

<p id="p_403">     Clause 8(3) of the EIA Notification, 2006 states that the
applicant may proceed as if the              environmental clearance
sought for has been granted. Thus, it is very evident that it is
only after the deeming fiction comes into play on the expiry of
the period specified in sub-para (1) of Clause 8 that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">                           Page 119 of 186</span>



                                                                     119 of 189

applicant gets a right to proceed ahead with the project and in
any case not before the grant of the same.
</p>

<p id="p_404">     It was sought to be contended very vociferously that the
term 'deemed clearance' in the facts of the case is a
misnomer. The fiction created is not that the application as
made by the project proponent is deemed to be granted, but
that the recommendations of the EAC after scoping and due
appraisal, whether approving or rejecting the proposal, are to
be treated as the decision of the regulatory authority, which is
a different matter altogether.
</p>

<p id="p_405">     It was also sought to be contended on behalf of the
respondents that the construction having been undertaken
prior to the grant/deemed grant of the clearance, could not be
termed as invalid because there is no provision in the
Notification, 2006 laying down that any breach by commencing
construction prior to clearance would invalidate the deemed
clearance. According to the respondents, reading in such a
condition would amount to legislating, which is impermissible.
</p>

<p id="p_406">     We are not impressed by such submission canvassed on
behalf of the respondents because if such submissions are
accepted, we will be doing violence with the terms of the
Notification and the very object with which such Notification
has been issued would stand frustrated. When the Notification
makes it very clear that it is only after the expiry of 45 days'
period it would be permissible for the applicant to proceed with
the project, then it necessarily implies that the applicant
cannot proceed with the project before the deeming fiction
comes into play. In taking such a view, it could not be said that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_124">                           Page 120 of 186</span>



                                                                120 of 189
         C/WPPIL/21/2013                             CAV JUDGEMENT



we are reading something in the Notification which would
amount to legislating. We have merely construed the plain
meaning and object of the Notification which makes it
abundantly clear that prior to the grant of             environmental
clearance, be it actual grant by the Central Government or by
a deeming fiction, no construction or any other activity could
be undertaken. Once the first part of the Notification makes
this very clear, then by any stretch of imagination, it cannot be
said that any construction or activity undertaken prior to the
grant      of    deemed   clearance     would   stand   automatically
validated.
</p>

<p id="p_407">        It was also sought to be vociferously contended on behalf
of the unit holders that the individual unit holders have
obtained clearance from the concerned authorities so far as
their part of the obligation is concerned before they started
operating the units. In view of such clearance and permission
being granted by the authorities, they proceeded ahead with
the construction on the premise that it was permissible for
them to put up the construction. It was also sought to be
argued that the units were not made aware at any stage that
the SEZ had not obtained the required clearance.
</p>

<p id="p_408">        We are not impressed even by such submission because
this issue has been set at rest by us while deciding the Writ
Petition (PIL) No.194 of 2011. In so many words we have held
that so long the environmental clearance is not granted by the
Central Government in favour of the MPSEZ for creation of
infrastructural facilities on the land so allotted and consequent
to such permission, such facilities have been actually created
by the allottee, the latter cannot lawfully lease out the right of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_125">                              Page 121 of 186</span>



                                                                    121 of 189

enjoyment of the infrastructural facilities to its lessees. We
have held in so many words that a lessee cannot have a better
right than that of the lessor in the property. Law is also well-
settled that there cannot be any valid lease for enjoyment of
the property, which is not in existence and not capable of
being put into possession to the lessee at the time of
execution of the lease.
</p>

<p id="p_409">     Therefore, the submissions that the unit holders have
been granted permission by the Development Commissioner
of the SEZ and GPCB is of no avail to the unit holders. Even if
they had obtained the permission from the other authorities,
then only after the grant of the               environmental clearance to
the lessee i.e. the MPSEZ, they could have setup their units on
the strength of the individual permission which has been

<p id="p_413">     Unfortunately, in the present case, the respondent no.1
Union of India, in its Ministry of Environment and Forests, has
taken this issue very lightly. We are at pains to state that in
such an important matter relating to environment and gross
violations of the EIA Notification, 2006, it has not thought fit
even to file a formal reply and clarify the matter. Time and
again we kept on inquiring during the course of the hearing of
the petition with the learned Assistant Solicitor General of India
as to what was the material considered by the EAC while
recommending the       environmental clearance to the Central
Government. We also kept on inquiring why the Central
Government kept quiet upon the recommendations of the EAC
and allowed the time period to expire so as to give effect to
the deeming provision under Clause 8 of the Notification. Till
the conclusion of the hearing of this petition, there was no
answer at the end of the Union of India. We were completely
bereft of the materials which the EAC must have taken into
consideration while making the recommendations for grant of
environmental clearance.

of the Notification, 2006 or the laws made by the Parliament.
The answer has to be in the negative. Considering the
mandatory nature of the environmental clearance, procedure
has   to     be         meticulously    followed.    Only    on    grant      of
environmental clearance any construction, preliminary or
otherwise, relating to setting up of the project can be
undertaken.        There      is   an    express     prohibition    that     'no
construction work, preliminary or otherwise, relating to setting
up of the project may be undertaken till the environment
and/or site clearance is obtained'.
</p>

<p id="p_415">      It is preposterous to suggest that such prohibition would
apply to the respondent no.8 MPSEZ as the developer of the
SEZ, but the same would not apply to the unit holders who are
put into possession by the lessor without any environmental
clearance.

       balance. The general public is becoming aware of the
       need to protect environment. Even though, laws have

       The legal position relating to the exercise of jurisdiction
       by the Courts for preventing environmental degradation
       and thereby, seeking to protect the fundamental right of
       the citizens, is now well settled by various decisions of
       this Court. The primary effect of the Court, while dealing
       with the environmental related issues, is to see that the
       enforcement agencies, whether it be the State or any
       other authority, take effective steps for the enforcement
       of the laws. The Courts, in a way act as the guardian of
       the people's fundamental rights but in regard to many
       technical matters, the Courts may not be fully equipped.
       Perforce it has to rely on outside agencies for reports and
       recommendations whereupon orders have been passed
       from time to time. Even though it is not the function of
       the Court to see the day to day enforcement of the law,
       that being the function of the Executive but because of
       the non-functioning of the enforcement agencies, the

     govern the grant of permissions under <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_111">Section 2</a> of the
     Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 as the same provides the
     road map to ecological protection and improvement
     under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_112">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986. The
     principles/ guidelines mentioned in the National Forest
     Policy, 1988 should be read as part of the provisions of
     the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_113">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 read together
     with the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_114">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980. This direction is
     required to be given because there is no machinery even
     today established for implementation of the said National
     Forest Policy, 1988 read with the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_115">Forest (Conservation)
     Act</a>, 1980. <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_116">Section 3</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act,
     1986 confers a power coupled with duty and, thus, it is
     incumbent on the Central Government, as hereinafter
     indicated, to appoint an appropriate authority, preferably
     in the form of regulator, at the State and at the Central
     level for ensuring implementation of the National Forest
     Policy, 1988.

through preservation, restoration of ecological balance
that has been adversely disturbed by serious depletion of
forests, conservation of natural heritage of the country
by preserving the remaining natural forests with the vast
variety of flora and fauna, checking soil erosion and
denudation in the catchment areas, checking the
extension of sand dunes, increasing the forest/tree cover
in the country and encouraging efficient utilisation of
forest produce and maximising substitution of wood.
</p>
<p id="p_443">(i.4.) Thus, we are of the view that under <a href="/doc/66315068/" id="a_117">Section 3(3)</a> of
the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the Central
Government should appoint a National Regulator for
appraising projects, enforcing environmental conditions
for approvals and to impose penalties on polluters.
</p>
<p id="p_444">(i.5.) There is one more reason for having a regulatory
mechanism in place. Identification of an area as forest
area is solely based on the declaration to be filed by the
user agency (project proponent). The project proponent
under the existing dispensation is required to undertake
EIA by an expert body/institution. In many cases, the
court is not made aware of the terms of reference. In
several cases, the court is not made aware of the study
area undertaken by the expert body. Consequently,
MoEF/State Government acts on the report (Rapid EIA)
undertaken by the institutions who though accredited
submit answers according to the terms of reference
propounded by the project proponent. We do not wish to
cast any doubt on the credibility of these institutions.
</p>
<p id="p_445">However, at times the court is faced with conflicting
reports. Similarly, the Government is also faced with a
fait accompli kind of situation which in the ultimate
analysis leads to grant of ex post facto clearance. To
obviate these difficulties, we are of the view that a
regulatory mechanism should be put in place and till the
time such mechanism is put in place, MoEF should
prepare a panel of accredited institutions from which
alone the project proponent should obtain the Rapid EIA
and that too on the terms of reference to be formulated
by MoEF."

        of interest. The Member Secretary (who, according
        to the 2006 notification, was supposed to be the
        Secretary) is involved in the processing, appraisal
        and approval of the EIA applications.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_78">        b. Lack of permanence in the Expert Appraisal
        Committees leads to lack of continuity and
        institutional memory leading to poor knowledge
        management.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_79">        c. Current EIA and CRZ clearances rely
        predominantly on the data provided by the project
        proponent and the absence of authenticated and
        reliable data and lack of mechanisms to validate
        the data provided by the project proponent might
        lead to
        subjectivity, inconsistency and inferior quality of EIA
        reports.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_80">        d. Though the EIA notification requires several
        documents like ToRs (for every project), minutes of
        public hearing meetings (for each project), EIA
        report (with clearance conditions) and self-
        monitoring reports to be put in public domain
        (predominantly on the website), this has not been
        done for lack of institutional mechanisms. This
        leads to a perception of lack of transparency in the
        processes.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_81">        e. Several studies have pointed toward the poor
        monitoring of the clearance conditions. Huge gaps
        in monitoring and enforcement of clearance
        conditions actually defeats the very purpose of
        grant of conditional environmental clearance."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_447">Hence, the present mechanism under the EIA Notification
dated 14.09.2006, issued by the Government with regard
to processing, appraisals and approval of the projects for
environmental clearance is deficient in many respects
and what is required is a Regulator at the national level
having its offices in all the States which can carry out an
independent, objective and transparent appraisal and
approval of the projects for environmental clearances
and which can also monitor the implementation of the
conditions laid down in the Environmental Clearances.</p><pre id="pre_33">

<p id="p_464">     The      Sunita   Narain      Committee      took    note     of    the
recommendations of the EAC made in its 113 th Meeting for the
proposed multi-product SEZ by the MPSEZ and recommended
in its report to the Central Government that it should
commission a comprehensive study on the cumulative impacts
of the projects, which have already been granted clearance.
Such study, according to the Committee, should be used to
assess and mitigate the impacts in the region. The Committee
noted various irregularities like cases of procedural lapses,
blocking of creeks, destruction of mangroves, flyash utilization
and disposal. The Committee recommended for effective
deterrence for non-compliance and remedial measures.
</p>

<p id="p_465">     It was argued that the Sunita Narain Committee report is

<p id="p_467">"7.2. Recommendation for effective deterrence for non-

</p>
<p id="p_468">In the Committee's assessment there is incontrovertible
evidence of violation of EC condition and non-compliance. It
must also be recognized that the Company has bypassed
environmental procedures in certain cases.
</p>
<p id="p_469">The question before the Committee is to determine the future
course of action. One option would be to recommend the
cancellation of clearances, where procedures have been
bypassed. In addition, legal proceeding could be initiated
against non-compliance and violations of EC conditions. But it
is also clear that these steps, however, harsh they may sound,
are in the nature of being procedural and would only lead to

delay without any gains to the environment and the people.
The Committee is cognizant of the fact that large scale
development has already been undertaken and it is not
possible or prudent at this stage to halt or cease its
operations.
</p>
<p id="p_470">Therefore, the Committee has decided to recommend a
different course of action, which is both intended to be an
effective deterrent and also suggests the way for future
remedial action to improve the environment.
</p>
<p id="p_471">Given this the Committee recommends the following:
</p>

<p id="p_472">7.2.1 MoEF should impose a substantial deterrent for
noncompliance and violations through the creation of
an Environment Restoration Fund.
</p>
<p id="p_473">The Committee is aware that it is practically difficult to assign
tangible and intangible costs to non-compliance and violations.
However, the inability to quantify these costs should not deter
us from setting precedence for the future. This will only result
in the issue remaining unresolved and conflicted and will delay
action to improve the environment and the livelihoods of
people.
</p>
<p id="p_474">Considering the scale of the project, the Committee would
recommend that the Environment Restoration Fund should be
1 per cent of the project cost (including the cost of the thermal
power plant) or Rs 200 crore, whichever is higher.
</p>
<p id="p_475">The Environment Restoration Fund should operate under the
chairmanship of the Secretary, MoEF and be used specifically
for remediation of environmental damage in Mundra and also
for strengthening the regulatory and monitoring systems.

<p id="p_477">     It appears that the Sunita Narain Committee was also
cognizant of the fact that large scale development has already
been undertaken and, therefore, it was not possible or prudent
at that stage to halt or cease its operation. This is suggestive
of the fact that such developments have taken place in the
absence of any prior environmental clearance.
</p>

<p id="p_478">     Thus, in our view, although by a deeming fiction the
environmental clearance could be said to have been granted in
favour of the respondent no.8 MPSEZ, yet it is too late in the
day to contend that whatever illegality has been committed
stands    cured        or   rectified    by     such   grant   of   deemed
environmental clearance.
</p>

<p id="p_479">     Very curiously we may take note of the submission
canvassed on behalf of the respondents that the judgment
rendered by us in Writ Petition (PIL) No.194 of 2011 dated 19th
May 2012 does not lay down that the developer cannot
sublease the land as the observations that the developer was
not entitled to sublease the land is found only in the supporting
view taken by one of us (His Lordship Bhaskar Bhattacharya,
CJ.). It was submitted that the finding in the judgment
rendered by J.B.Pardiwala, J. is to the effect that the developer
could have allotted the plots to the companies desirous of
putting up their units. In such circumstances, it was submitted

that the said judgment dated 9th May 2012 contains two
contrary views on this issue and, therefore, it may not be
considered to be an authority for the proposition that the
allotment or lease of the plot is impermissible in law.
</p>

<p id="p_480">     We are afraid, we are not impressed by such submissions
as it appears that the same has been canvassed as a last effort
to salvage the situation. The observations made by one of us
J.B.Pardiwala, J. that at the most the developer could have
allotted the plots would not mean and could not have been
construed by the respondents to convey that the allottees
could develop the plots and put up construction on the same.
That is not the substance of the judgment. What was sought to
be conveyed was that at the most there could be allotment to
a particular person interested to setup an industry in the SEZ.
His Lordship Bhaskar Bhattacharya, CJ. clarified in no uncertain
terms that so long the environmental clearance is not granted
by the Central Government in favour of the MPSEZ for creation
of infrastructural facilities on the land so allotted and
consequent to such permission, such facilities have been
actually created by the allottee, the later cannot lawfully lease
out the right of enjoyment of the infrastructural facilities to its
lessees.

<blockquote id="blockquote_87">     "The question is, what is the true construction of the 35th
     section of the Act of Parliament which is before us, and,
     when we have got at the true construction, what is the
     application of it to this case? With regard to the
     construction of this section, a great many Courts have
     considered it, and a great many judges have had
     different opinions about it. That being so, this Court
     expressed a hope, as we were told that several cases
     were going to the House of Lords, that the House of Lords
     would construe the whole section, so that we might know
     what their view of the true construction was. The House
     of Lords heard the cases, and did not give judgment at
     once, but considered the matter carefully, and four of the
     learned judges in the House of Lords gave judgment.
     Now we know that each of them considers the matter
     separately, and they then consider the matter jointly,
     interchanging their judgments, so that every one of them
     has seen the judgments of the others. If they mean to
     differ in their view, they say so openly when they come
     to deliver their judgments, and if they do not do this, it
     must be taken that each of them agrees with the
     judgments of the others."</blockquote>

clearance       the       units    were        even         established        before    the
environmental clearance was granted in favour of the SEZ. It
was also brought to our notice that the Ministry of Environment
and Forests granted environmental clearance to a unit in Dahej
SEZ on 19th August 2008 before the environmental clearance
was granted to the said SEZ on 17th March 2010. According to
Mr.Thakore, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent
no.8 - MPSEZ, even the projects within this SEZ were granted
clearance by the Ministry of Environment and Forests prior to
the environmental clearance to the SEZ itself. We are of the
opinion that this by itself would not help the respondents
because there is nothing on record to indicate as to how and in
what     circumstances             such        environmental            clearance        was
granted.      This       by     itself    is    not        sufficient   to     justify   the
commencement of the construction and the project even
before      EAC          made     its     recommendations                for    grant      of
environmental clearance to the Ministry. At least one thing is
clear from the examples relied upon by Mr.Thakore in both the
cases, i.e. in Andhra Pradesh SEZ as well as in Dahej SEZ,
there was environmental clearance by the Ministry itself to the
units. Here, in the present case, all that has been obtained by
the individual unit holders is the permission or consent from
the GPCB and other authorities. Beside this, the Union would
have been the right respondent to explain about the Andhra
Pradesh SEZ and the Dahej SEZ, but it has chosen to remain
quiet and failed to assist the court in this regard in any
manner.

Mr.Yagnik, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners of
Writ Petition (PIL) 21 of 2013, in support of his submissions :
</p>

<p id="p_487">      In Gram Panchayat Navlakh Umbre (supra) which was a
Public     Interest       Litigation,        the       challenge       was     to    the
environmental clearance granted to the respondent for setting
up a 355 MWs combined cycle power project. The Court took
note of the fact that on 14th September 2006 the Ministry of
Environment and Forests, Union of India, issued a Notification
in exercise of powers, inter alia, conferred by <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_126">Section 3</a> of the
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 stipulating a requirement
of a prior environmental clearance for setting up new projects
or activities and for the expansion or modernization of existing
projects    or     activities      falling    within      the    purview       of    the
notification. The power project in that case was falling in
category B-1 of the Schedule of the Notification.
</p>

<p id="p_488">      The Court also took note of the deeming provision,
stating that its concept was an integral part of the Notification
dated      14th         September       2006.          The     Court,       thereafter,
exhaustively            considered        various            stages        which      an
environmental           clearance      has     to      undergo.       The     principal
argument before the Bench on the part of the respondent was
that it had received deemed permission for project on the
basis of the recommendations that were issued by the SEAC.
The      Court     took      the     view          that      since    it     held    the
recommendations of the SEAC to be invalid and contrary to
law, the basis on which the submissions of deemed permission
had been urged would have no foundation whatsoever. The
Court criticized and expressed its concern about the manner in
which both the SEAC and SEIAA had proceeded to grant

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_148">                                     Page 144 of 186</span>



                                                                                     144 of 189
      C/WPPIL/21/2013                                CAV JUDGEMENT



clearances without application of mind in breach of the specific
conditions of the Notification dated 14th September 2006. The
respondent had carried out development work at the site
without prior          environmental clearance. The Court also took
notice of the fact that its attention was drawn repeatedly by
the petitioner to their grievance that even without an
environmental clearance, the respondent had proceeded with
the work at the site in breach of the Notification dated 14th
September 2006.
</p>

<p id="p_489">     In the aforenoted factual background, the Court made the
following observations which, in our opinion, fortifies the
submissions of Mr.Yagnik that the respondent nos.10 to 21
cannot take shelter of the deemed environmental clearance.
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_88">     "The issue as to whether an applicant for environmental
     clearance has acted in breach of the condition which
     prohibits work prior to the receipt of environmental
     clearance is a material consideration in determining
     whether environmental clearance should be granted. A
     project proponent who seeks an environmental clearance
     under the law must demonstrably act in accordance with
     law. There is a serious allegation of a breach by the sixth
     respondent which resulted in the issuance of a notice to
     show cause by MPCB. That issue cannot be disassociated
     from the grant of an environmental clearance and a
     clearance could not have been granted without a
     definitive conclusion, arrived at in accordance with the
     principles of natural justice, on the issue of breach."

permission would be deemed to have been granted. The
Supreme Court took the view that a legal fiction must be
construed having regard to the purport and object of the
Act for which the same was enacted."
</p>
<p id="p_491">The Court made the following observations in para 44 :
</p>

<p id="p_492">"There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that an owner of
a property is entitled to enjoy his property and all the
rights pertaining thereto. The provisions contained in a
statute like the 1994 Act and the building bye-laws
framed thereunder, however, provide for regulation in
relation to the exercise and use of such right of an owner
of a property. Such a regulatory statute must be held to
be reasonable as the same is enacted in public interest.
Although a deeming provision has been provided in sub-
section (1) of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_127">Section 247</a> of the 1994 Act, the same will
have restricted operation. In terms of the said provision,
the period of sixty days cannot be counted from the date
of the original application, when the building plans had
been returned to the applicant necessary clarification
and/or compliance of the objections raised therein. If no
sanction can be granted, when the building plan is not in
conformity with the building bye-laws or has been made
in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the laws,
in our opinion, the restriction would not apply despite the
deeming provision."
</p>
<p id="p_493">"What is discernible from the observations made by the
Supreme Court in para 44 is that although the law may
have provided the deeming provision but if the building
plan itself is not in conformity with the building bye-laws
or in contravention of the provisions of the Act or laws,
then in such circumstances, the deeming provision would
not help the person placing reliance on the same. At this
stage, it may not be out of place to state that the
respondents have placed strong reliance on the decision
of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1240185/" id="a_128">Live Oak Resort (P) Ltd. v.

             construction had been started in terms of the
             building plan as also the rules which were
             applicable at the relevant point of time. The
             question which arose for consideration therein was
             as to whether a subsequent amendment to the
             rules, in respect of additional FSI shall have any
             effect on the sanctioned building plan, it was
             contended that keeping in view the environmental
             question, the same will have not.

             opinion, cannot be said to have any application
             whatsoever. The submission of Mr. Ganguli that
             despite expiry of the period of sanction of the
             development plan by the State under the 1977 Act,
             the same should be held to be extended, in our
             opinion, cannot be accepted."</blockquote>


<p id="p_494">     From the above, it could be said that if the initial action is
illegal, that is, if the foundation goes then the superstructure
would fall. In the present case also, once we hold that the
construction in the absence of          environmental clearance is
absolutely illegal, then the same by itself would not get
regularized with the aid of the deeming provision.

not be a free licence to make use of the same defeating the
object with which such provision is made. The Supreme Court
made the following observations as under :

     months from the date of the receipt of the application
     excluding the time as specified taken thereunder. But the
     condition is that land should be used for raising
     commercial crops but not for industrial purposes or for
     building purposes. Deemed permission would not be a
     free licence to use the land for any other purpose
     defeating the object of the grant. The public policy
     behind the grant is to augment agricultural production so
     as to enable the tiller of the soil economic empowerment
     and social and economic justice assured in the Preamble
     to the Constitution of India and Articles 38 and 46 to
     minimise inequalities in income and status. The State
     distributes under <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_130">Article 39(b</a>), its material resources to
     subserve the said purpose. Having obtained the grant or
     permission, the grantee-appellants cannot convert the
     land into non-agricultural use as well as for building
     houses. The sale of government land for nominal amount
     was for the avowed constitutional purposes. After the
     conversion, sale of the lands for building purposes would
     be a windfall. Obviously, the public purpose of the grant
     and the constitutional goals would be defeated by this
     method of circumvention. The Government, therefore, is
     justified in cancelling the grant. Under the above
     circumstances, the Government was entitled to revoke
     the grant in respect of the entire extent of land."</blockquote>


<p id="p_496">     <a href="/doc/970587/" id="a_131">In    Mansingbhai   Kahalsingbhai      v.   Surat    Municipal
Corporation</a>, AIR 2001 Guj. 44, the issue before the Division
Bench of this Court was, whether the construction work carried
out by the petitioners of that case was in accordance with the

application for permission to construct was submitted on 7th

petitioner is over, it is necessary that unless and until
notice is given to the City Engineer, the proposed date of
commencement to erect a new building, the petitioners
could not have commenced construction work. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_132">Section
263</a> and Rule 3 of Chapter XII refers to deeming
provision. Reading the aforesaid provision assuming that
the deeming provision is applicable for construction
which is otherwise legal even then one has to give notice
of commencement of work and only thereafter the work
of erection of a building can be commenced. After
completion of building within one month thereafter notice
is required to be given in writing of completion
accompanied by a certificate. Law also prohibits
occupying the building in absence of any permit or
occupation certificate issued to use the building. In the
instant case, there is a flagrant violation of these
provisions. No notice has been given and yet we find that
persons have occupied the building. This speaks volume
about the intention of the petitioners. The Court while
exercising jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_133">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India has to bear in mind that persons
who are coming to the Court with clean hands and those
who have acted in accordance with law are required to
be assisted and not the persons who are committing
breach of provisions of law."
</p>

<p id="p_498">"Thus, it goes without saying that deemed permission
means that a person is erecting building after the expiry
of the period mentioned in Rule 3 strictly in accordance
with Rules, bye-laws etc. It is required to be emphasised
here that when a person moves the Commissioner for
permission of erection of a building, the person
concerned knows the Rules and Regulations and Bye-
laws with regard to Building Regulations. It is for him to
carry out the construction as per the Building Regulations
and Bye-laws and particularly keeping in mind the FSI.
The person who constructs the building as per the Rules
and Regulations can say that he has constructed the
building as per the requirement of law but not otherwise.
The deemed permission can be said to have been
attracted in case where a person has carried out
construction in accordance with the existing Rules, Bye-
laws and Building Regulations and not otherwise. It is
required to be noted that likewise the case of Calcutta
Municipal Corporation before the Apex Court, Rule 3 of

      C/WPPIL/21/2013                           CAV JUDGEMENT



     Chapter XII of Appendix IV of the Act provides that if
     within 30 days there is no disapproval, subject to the
     Rules one may commence the work of erection of a
     building but not so as to contravene any provisions of the
     Act or any Rule or bye-laws. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_134">Under the Act</a> before the
     commencement, notice is required to be given as
     contemplated in Chapter XII of Appendix IV. In our
     opinion, therefore, one has to submit a plan for erection
     of a building keeping in mind all the Building Regulations
     and if any one constructs contrary to that, the same
     being illegal must be demolished. The suggestion made
     by the petitioners that whatever type of the plan is
     submitted and for which no intimation is given within
     thirty days then the person is deemed to have been
     granted permission has no merit. If such a view is taken,
     it will be for the benefit of wrong doers only who will
     carry out the construction and will transfer the
     building/flats and innocent purchasers would be in
     difficulty. Under the circumstances, if one constructs
     building in contravention of the Rules and Regulations
     and Bye-Laws then he is a wrong doer and even if
     permission is not granted because of connivance or
     negligence of the Officer, shelter of deeming provision
     cannot be made available to him. Learned single Judge
     was justified in arriving at the conclusion that the
     deemed permission cannot be inconsistent with the Rules
     and Regulations and no deemed permission can be
     against the relevant Rules and Regulations."

Mody, AIR 1964 SC 345. In the said decision of the Supreme

Sections 36(2) and 36(3) of the Gujarat Secondary Education
Act, 1972. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_137">Section 36(2)</a> provides for a deeming fiction that if
the authorized officer fails to communicate its decision within
the prescribed 45 days' period to the Manager, the action
proposed shall be deemed to have been approved. Under
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_138">Section 36(3)</a> of the Act, in the context of suspension pending
inquiry, the failure to communicate ratification of such
suspension by the authorized officer within the period of 45
days would result into suspension ceasing to have any effect
on the expiry of such period. In the facts of that case, the court
observed that in case of action of termination of service of an
employee by a school management previous permission was
contemplated           and   subsequent          ratification    was       also
contemplated in suspension pending enquiry, but in both the
cases deemed fiction would come into operation on the expiry
of this 45 days' statutory period from the date of the receipt of
the concerned proposal or action of suspension. The court
observed that in case of suspension, such suspension would
cease to have effect on the expiry of 45 days' period. The
Court took the view that a fiction must have full statutory
operation and there would not be any question of waiver or
any extension or enlargement of a statutory period by
unilateral action of the management or even by any waiver or
consent.

would be the position if the construction would have been
completed prior to the expiry of 60 days as laid down by

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_143">Section 193(4)</a> of the Act. Whether, in such circumstances, the
person who wanted to put up the construction could have
relied upon the deeming provision, and secondly, in the said
case the construction was admittedly put up after the statutory
period was over i.e. 60 days. If that be so, then with a view to
give true meaning and effect to the deeming provision, the
court was justified in holding that it would not make any
difference between an express sanction and a sanction which
is in law deemed to have been given. In short, what we want to
convey is that an illegality already committed would not be
saved by a grant of sanction, which is in law, deemed to be
granted.

State of Rajasthan and others</a>, (1996)2 SCC 449, has been
relied upon to once again explain the deeming fiction provided
by any provision of law. In the facts of that case, the Supreme
Court observed that in view of the deeming provision under the
Explanations, although the goods which were produced or
manufactured at an intermediate stage and consumed or
utilised for the manufacture of another commodity in a
continuous process would be deemed to have been removed
from    such       place   or   premises       immediately        before       such
consumption or utilisation. The Court said that it was well
settled that a deeming provision was an admission of the non-
existence of the fact deemed. Therefore, in view of the
deeming provision under the Explanations, although the goods
which were produced or manufactured at an intermediate
stage and, thereafter, consumed or utilised in the integrated
process for the manufacture of another commodity were not
actually removed, they had to be regarded as having been
removed. In the said case, the State of Rajasthan had issued a
notification      under    Section    7(1)         of   the   Rajasthan        Town
Municipalities Act, 1951, informing the public that, in exercise

the limits of the Kota Municipality so as to include therein the
village of Raipura and it invited objections thereto. However, it
was not followed by a final notification. In the case of the

limits of the Kota municipality to include it, but it had also not
been proceeded by a notification inviting objections of the
public thereto. Later, another notification was published in
1960, whereby the village of Ummedganj was excluded from
the limits of Kota Municipality. The provisions of the Rajasthan
Municipalities Act, 1959 in regard to the delimitation of the
municipalities         and   the   procedure         in   that   behalf      were
substantially similar to the one contained in the 1951 Act. The
provisions of <a href="/doc/11187870/" id="a_147">Sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/75233928/" id="a_148">7</a> of the 1959 Act and the earlier
provisions of the 1951 Act in the same behalf were, therefore,
not met in the case of either the village of Raipura or the

the statute book unamended when the Kota Municipal Limits
(Continued Existence) Validating Act, 1975 was passed.
<a href="/doc/18809355/" id="a_151">Section 3</a> of the Validating Act provided that, notwithstanding
anything contained in <a href="/doc/11187870/" id="a_152">Sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/75233928/" id="a_153">7</a> of the 1959 Act or in any
judgment, decree, order or direction of any court, the villages
of Raipura and Ummedganj should be deemed always to have
continued to exist and they continue to exist within the limits
of the Kota Municipality to all intents and fall all purposes. In
the aforesaid facts of the case, the court took the view that the
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_154">Validating Act</a> required the deeming of the legal position that
the villages of Raipura and Ummedganj fell within the limits of
the Kota municipality and not the deeming of facts from which
that legal consequence would flow. The court observed that
when a fact is to be deemed, its consequences and incidents
are also to be deemed, that is to say, what follows from the
deemed facts is also to be deemed.

should be carried to its logical conclusion. There cannot be any
debate with the principle of law explained by the Supreme

facts of that case. In that case, the project in question was a
mega project which was in the larger public interest of the
State of Karnataka. A Public Interest Litigation was filed by an
organization challenging the Framework Agreement (for short,
'FWA') on the ground that the land which was being acquired
was in far excess than what was required for the project. It was

argued before the High Court of Karnataka that the land
requirement in Schedule 1 of the FWA was highly exaggerated
and would illegally create huge profits for Nandi Infrastructure
Corridor Enterprises Ltd. (for short, 'Nandi'). The Supreme
Court took notice of the fact that the project was earlier
challenged by one H.T.Somashekar Reddy on the same
grounds on which the subsequent public interest litigation was
filed before the High Court. In the earlier round of litigation, the
Karnataka High Court had held that the Government had not
acted arbitrarily in entering into an agreement with the
respondent no.2 and the agreement was not illegal as being
opposed to public policy. The court had also held that the
agreement in no manner contravened any constitutional
provision or existing enactments. Accordingly, the petition was
rejected by the High Court.

<p id="p_513">     It appears that thereafter once again with respect to the

between the Government of Karnataka and Nandi was a result

land than what was required for the project had been acquired
by the State Government, and whether it was open to it to
raise such a plea.

Government of Karnataka, Under Secretary, Department of

Code of Civil Procedure for certain offences which came to be
notice of the Supreme Court as a result of the affidavits filed
by them.
</p>


<p id="p_515">     The State of Karnataka came up in appeal before the
Supreme Court and mainly contended that the second petition
filed before the High Court was hit by the principles of res
judicata since the issue of excess land was 'directly and
substantially in issue' in the first round of litigation. The
Supreme Court, in order to appreciate such contentions,
looked into the prayers made in the previous public interest
litigation as compared to the prayers made in the subsequent
petition. The Supreme Court noticed that the prayers in both
the petitions were substantially the same. The Supreme Court,
thereafter, considered, whether there was any fresh cause of
action for filing a second petition, and on the basis of the
materials on record, came to the conclusion that the very FWA
that was uphold earlier was impugned for the second time. The
Supreme Court, thereafter, considered that the issue of excess
land was specifically raised in the first round of litigation which
was decided by the High Court in favour of the State
Government and, therefore, the same issue could not have
been raised for the second time.
</p>


<p id="p_516">     Thus, the Supreme Court, on the basis of the materials on
record, came to the conclusion that the cause of action, the
issues raised, the prayers made, the reliefs sought in first

appellant State Government that the judgment in the first
round of litigation operated as a res judicata for the questions
raised in the second petition.
</p>


<p id="p_517">     In    the     aforesaid   background,       the   Supreme         Court
observed that the High Court failed to consider the principle
and philosophy behind Explanation IV to Section 11 of the
Code of Civil Procedure which prevents the abuse of the
process of the court.
</p>


<p id="p_518">     During the course of hearing of this petition, a lot of
emphasis was put on para 39 of this decision. In para 39, the
Supreme Court has referred to a decision in the case of
Greenhalgh v. Mallard, reported in (1947)2 All ER 255, wherein
Somervell, L.J. observed thus :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_94">     "I think that on the authorities to which I will refer it
     would be accurate to say that res judicata for this
     purpose is not confined to the issues which the Court is
     actually asked to decide, but that it covers issues or facts
     which are so clearly part of the subject matter of the
     litigation and so clearly could have been raised that it
     would be an abuse of the process of the Court to allow a
     new proceeding to be started in respect of them."</blockquote>


<p id="p_519">     In our opinion, this decision which has been relied upon
to fortify the defence of res judicata is of no avail to the
respondents because it could not be said that the issues raised

Government decided not to conduct such tests upon the
opinion of the expert bodies concerned, then the Court should
not advice the Government to go for such tests unless mala

or the authority concerned, after due consideration of all the
viewpoints and full application of mind, had taken a decision,
then it was not appropriate for the Court to interfere. The Court
observed that such matters must be left to the mature wisdom
of the Government or the implementing agency. The Court also
observed that if the situation demands, the Courts should take
only a detached decision based on the pattern of the well-
settled principles of administrative law. If any such decision
was based on irrelevant consideration or non-consideration of
material or was thoroughly arbitrary, then the Court will get in

reforested as a part of the reclamation plan. It further stated
that the indigenous and native people were satisfied with the
credentials of M/s.Lafarge as the company was providing
health care facilities, drinking water facilities, employment for
local youth, construction of village roads, employment for
school teachers, scholarship programme for children, etc. The
Court also took notice of the fact that the issue of mining was
thoroughly discussed with the Village Durbar by the members
of the HPC who visited the site and that the community was in
agreement to allow M/s. Lafarge to continue mining.

appreciate how this decision would help the respondents

In our view, a deemed      environmental clearance cannot be

relied on to fortify the submission as regards the petition being
hit by the doctrine of res judicata.
</p>

<p id="p_530">     In that case, the issue before the Supreme Court was,
whether the principle of constructive res judicata could be
invoked against a writ petition filed by the appellant who was
the proprietor of a firm under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_163">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India. The appellant had been assessed to sales-tax for the
year 1957-58 under the Madhya Pradesh Sales Tax Act, 1950.
The appellant had challenged the validity of the said order of
assessment by a writ petition filed by him in the High Court of
Madhya Pradesh. The High Court dismissed the writ petition,
and by special leave, the appellant came before the Supreme
Court. Before the Supreme Court, it was strenuously contended
that where a citizen seeks for redress from the High Court by
invoking its high prerogative writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_164">Article 226</a>
of the Constitution of India, it would be inappropriate to invoke
the principles of res judicata against him. It was argued that
the appellant had been exposed to the risk of paying a large
amount by way of sales-tax and penalty when the said liability
had not been lawfully incurred by him and the impugned order
was contrary to law. The Supreme Court held that there could
be no doubt that the fundamental rights guaranteed to the
citizens are a significant feature of our Constitution and the
High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_165">Article 226</a> were bound to protect those

fundamental rights. The Court held that there could also be no
doubt that if a case was made out for the exercise of its
jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_166">Article 226</a> in support of the citizens'
fundamental rights, the High Court would not hesitate to
exercise that jurisdiction. But, at the same time, the Supreme
Court observed that the question as to whether a citizen
should be allowed to challenge the validity of the same order
by successive petitions under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_167">Article 226</a>, cannot be answered
merely in the light of the significance and importance of the
citizens' fundamental rights. The Court observed that the
general principle underlying the doctrine of res judicata was
ultimately based on considerations of public policy. One
important consideration of the public policy is that the
decisions pronounced by courts of competent jurisdiction
should be final, unless they are modified or reversed by the
appellate authorities.
</p>

<p id="p_531">     On the facts of the case, the Court refused to interfere
with the order passed by the High Court and dismissed the
appeal, holding that the second writ petition filed by the
appellant in the High Court was barred by constructive res
judicata.
</p>

<p id="p_532">     This decision of the Supreme Court explaining the
principles of constructive res judicata is of no avail to the

industries, applied for allotment of 500 acres of land for its
three      projects.      After   considering       the   application,     the
Committee decided to allot 175 acres of land to the Company
at Rs.92/- per sq.meter. The Karnataka Government, vide its
order dated 16th May 1995, cleared three projects of the
Company          involving   investment        of   Rs.663.56   crore.     The
respondents therein, describing themselves to be the social
workers, filed a writ petition by way of a public interest

land to the Company, inter alia, on the grounds that : (a) the
land to the other entrepreneurs was sold at the rate of Rs.
3,80,000=00 per acre whereas it was sold to the Company at
the rate of Rs. 3,72,324=00 per acre; (b) the allotment was
contrary to the regulations and, therefore,                  arbitrary and
unreasonable; (c) the allotment was made without inviting
applications and without notifying the availability of land to the
general public; and (d) the exercise of power was mala fide

action in the circumstances of the case. The Court held that
the appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court and in

proceedings in the form of a writ petition cannot enlarge the
scope of the inquiry at a belated stage. The Court held that in
the absence of any specific allegation of mala fide against any

such an alleged statutory provision which safeguards, as spelt
out by the Supreme Court, would render the State action to be
arbitrary in all cases. The Court further held that the writ

<p id="p_549">     We are quite mindful that the Supreme Court in
T.N.Godavarman (supra) has taken the view that however
genuine a cause brought before the Court by a public interest
litigant may be, the Court has to decline its examination at the
behest of a person, who, in fact, is not a public interest litigant
and whose bona fides and credentials are in doubt.           At the
same time, the Supreme Court also took the view that in a
given exceptional case where bona fides of a public interest
litigant are in doubt the Court may still examine the issue
having regard to the serious nature of the public cause and
likely public injury by appointing amicus curiae to assist the
Court, but under no circumstances with the assistance of a

case of T.N.Godavarman (supra) the Delhi Development
Authority     (DDA)          had     proposed          the    development        of
international hotels complex on 315 hectares of land situated
in the Vasant Kunj area after the said area was identified in the
master plan for Delhi 2001 for urban use. The said area under
the earlier master plan of 1962 was identified as a green area
but later on there was a change of user to urban area under
the master plan of 2001. The DDA planned to develop the said
area for construction of hotels, convention centers etc. Before
the Supreme Court IAs were filed relating to acceptability of
the report given by the Expert Committee relating to the
alleged     violation        of    the   environmental         norms    by     the
respondents. It was submitted before the Supreme Court that
DDA had proceeded on a bona fide impression that all the
requisite clearance had been obtained by it.                       It was also
submitted that there was no question of it acting in a mala fide
manner or irregular manner. The Court noted that the lands
were allotted by DDA according to the notification dated 27 th
January 1994, wherein for the first time a provision for
obtaining environmental clearance by the Central Government
before undertaking any new project listed in Schedule 1 to the
Notification was issued. The notification did not relate to the
new construction projects and as such did not apply to them
was the stance of the respondents which was accepted by the
Supreme Court.           The Supreme Court noted that the auction
was conducted by the DDA, thereafter the project was
undertaken and huge investments had been made with the
sanction of the building plans they had applied for. The Court
also noted that the Expert Committee after public hearing had
made the recommendations with certain stipulation. It clearly
stated    that         the   project      could        be    recommended        for

environmental clearance.      The Supreme Court observed that
the confusion arose because the DDA all throughout had given
an impression to the parties participating in auction that all the
requisite clearances had been obtained.        If such parties had
the slightest of the idea that such clearances were not
obtained by the DDA, they would not have invested such huge
sums of money.         The Court observed that the stand that
wherever the constructions have been made unauthorizedly
demolition is the only option would not apply in the case
before it, more particularly, when the parties unlike, where
some private individuals or private limited companies or firms
being allotted to them made contraventions, are corporate
bodies and institutions and, therefore the question of there
having indulged in any malpractice in getting the approval or
sanction did not arise.
</p>

<p id="p_552">     In our opinion, this judgment is of no avail to the
respondents, more particularly, the unit holders because by
relying on this decision the unit holders have made an attempt
to convince the Court that it is the respondent no.8 MPSEZ who
is responsible for all the confusion and violation of the terms of
notification dated 14th September 2006.        By relying on this
decision, it is also sought to be argued that if they would have
known that unless and until the environmental clearance is
granted in favour of lessor i.e. the developer of the SEZ the
lessees would have no right to put up a brick of a construction.
In our opinion, this is a last ditch effort on the part of the unit
holders to salvage the situation. It may not be out of place to
state at this stage that they themselves are not clear as
regards their stance. In one breath they submit that they had
a right to proceed with the construction on the strength of their

1956 SC 110,              has been relied upon in support of the
submission that when the legislature entrusts to an authority
the power to pass an order in its discretion and order passed
by that authority in exercise of that discretion is, in general,
not liable to be interfered with by an appellate authority unless
it can be shown to have been based on some mistake of fact or
misapprehension of the principles applicable thereto.                      In the
said case, the Supreme Court was dealing with an appeal filed
against the judgment of the High Court of Kolkata affirming the
order of the Municipal Magistrate whereby he had dismissed an
application filed by the appellant under Section 366 of the
Kolkata       Municipal     Act,   1923        for    demolition    of    certain
constructions on the ground that they had been erected
without       previous     permission        of      the   authorities   and     in
contravention of the prescriptions laid down in the building
rules. In the said case, the Supreme Court took the view that

taken for an order for demolition of the building under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_176">Section

are of formal or trivial character, in which case the imposition

they are serious or likely to affect adversely the interests of

demolition.       It appears that it was argued on behalf of the
Corporation that they had received a complaint from the public
and since the public complained about unlawful construction, it
was decided to demolish the building. In such circumstances,
the Supreme Court observed that whether there had been a
complaint from the public or not would not as such be material
for deciding the question, though if there was one, it would be
a piece of evidence in deciding whether the interests of the
public had suffered by reason of the breaches. The Court also
took the view that nearly five years had elapsed since the
building was completed and, therefore, in such circumstances,
while dismissing the appeal filed by the Corporation, the Court
held that after lapse of such a time, an order of demolition was
not called for in the interest of the public.
</p>

<p id="p_554">     In our opinion, this decision is also of no avail to the
respondents as the same was in the facts of that case and was
a case of solitary building alleged to have been constructed in
violation of the provisions of the Kolkata Municipality Act. The
Supreme Court took the view that five years had elapsed and
only because the public complained about the same by itself
would not be a ground to demolish the building, if demolition
was not the only resort available to the Corporation.

were holding the land in excess of the limit prescribed under

surrendered land the trees were fruit bearing trees.             The
dispute related to the amount payable in respect of the fruit
bearing trees standing on the land which were surrendered by
the appellant. The number of trees was not in dispute. The
amount payable for the land vested in the government and the
amounts had been paid. With regard to the amount payable
for the fruit bearing trees a commissioner was appointed, who
submitted a report regarding the number of fruit bearing trees
and other trees standing on the land so surrendered.             The
Commissioner of Land Reforms, Urban Ceiling, Hyderabad,
directed the District Collector to issue necessary instructions

that there is nothing in the notification of 2006 to even

environmental clearance.          In our opinion, although there
cannot be any dispute with regard to the proposition of law
explained by the Supreme Court yet we have dealt with this
aspect in details and have taken the view that plain reading of
the notification itself makes it clear that it is only after the
expiry of 45 days that it would be permissible to start with the
project on the strength of deemed environmental clearance.
However, if before the deemed environmental clearance
comes into force the project is already undertaken then it
could definitely be said to be in violation of the terms of
notification       and   subsequent        grant   of    the     deemed
environmental clearance would not save the situation.

furnace. The main contention before the Court was that the
construction work was carried out by the industry without
obtaining the environmental clearance and thereby had
violated the provisions of law. In the facts of that case, the
Court posed a question as to whether the pipe manufacturing
breach also required environmental clearance if the industry
had obtained clearance for the blast furnace.                  The Court
observed that indisputably the industry had applied for the
environmental clearance from the Central Government only in
support of the project of blast furnace and, therefore, the
procedure contemplated for the grant of clearance under the
notification of 1984 was followed in support of blast furnace
covered under item 13 of the schedule to the said notification,
and not in respect of any other item falling in that schedule
including item 28 of "foundries". The Court also took the view
that the public hearing was also in support of the blast furnace
for which the application was made.                 The clearance of the
project of blast furnace could not have been treated as a
clearance granted for any breach other than of the blast
furnace.     In the facts of that case, the Court reached to the
conclusion that the clearance granted by the authorities in
support of the blast furnace could not have been treated as
ex-post facto clearance and, therefore, there was no question
of demolition of the construction made for the blast furnace
project.

recorded by us in details.

<p id="p_564">     Since we have taken the view that the plea of deemed

operating their units in the absence of a valid environmental
clearance from the Central Government. Such being the
position, we reiterate the principle explained by us in our
judgment dated 9th May 2012 rendered in Writ Petition (PIL)
No.194 of 2011, which has attained finality and which has been
accepted by the petitioner of Special Civil Application No.2621
of 2013, that according to the EIA Notification, 2006, in order
to have such right of creation of infrastructural facilities over
the land allotted, prior approval of the Central Government is
necessary before making any construction, and without having
acquired such right, the MPSEZ, the allottee from the
Government, could not have conveyed such rights to its
lessee. In other words, a lessee cannot have a better right then
that of a lessor in the property. There cannot be any valid
lease for enjoyment of a right in a property at the instance of
MPSEZ before obtaining        environmental clearance because
such a right was not in existence in its favour, and
consequently, not capable of being transferred to the lessee at

Ministry of Forests and Environment, should look into the
matter closely and, more particularly , the aspects which we
have highlighted in this judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_567">     We are of the view that the Central Government should
take a decision of its own as to whether environmental
clearance should be granted in favour of the MPSEZ, and if yes,
then on what terms and conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_568">     In the aforesaid view of the matter, we hold that it is not
possible for us to give a declaration as prayed for by the
petitioner of Special Civil Application No.2621 of 2013, and
accordingly, the same is rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_569">     The Writ Petition (PIL) No.21 of 2013 is allowed to a
certain extent. The Central Government is directed to take a
decision of its own so far as the issue of grant of environmental
clearance is concerned considering the position prevailing as
on date and also the aspects which have been highlighted by
us in this judgment, within a period of thirty days from the date
of this judgment without fail.
</p>
<p id="p_570">     While taking into consideration the issue of grant of
environmental clearance, it would be open for the Central
Government to even take into consideration the Sunita Narain
Committee report as discussed in our judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_571">     Till such appropriate decision is taken by the Central
Government, there shall not be any further activity in the form
of construction etc. including the functioning of the units in the
area in question.

reason to stay our judgment. The prayer is, therefore, rejected.
However, certified copy of this judgment be given today, if
applied for.</p><pre id="pre_40">

         C/WPPIL/21/2013                             ORDER



     This matter has been mentioned by Ms.Amrita Thakore,

the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent

nos.11,16,18 and 21, for correction of a typographical omission

appearing in our order dated 13th January 2014, by which we

dispose of a Public Interest Litigation along with a Special Civil

Application by a common judgment.
</p>


<p id="p_578">     Our attention has been drawn to the fact that while
recording the submissions on behalf of the respondent
nos.11,16, 18 and 21 under the heading 'VII', we have wrongly
recorded the name of Mr.Mihir Thakore as the learned senior
advocate appearing on behalf of those respondents. Ms.Amrita
Thakore submits that in fact she engaged Mr.Mihir Joshi as her
senior for appearing on behalf of the respondent nos.11,16 and
21 and she alone appeared on behalf of the respondent no.18.
</p>

<p id="p_579">     We, therefore, modify our aforesaid order to this extent
that the name of Mr.Mihir Joshi should be substituted in place
of Mr.Mihir Thakore under the heading 'VII' on page 40 of our
judgment by deleting the respondent no.18 and Ms.Amrita
Thakore should be shown to be the learned advocate alone on
behalf of the respondent no.18.
</p>

<p id="p_580">     Our order dated 13th January 2014 is modified only to the
extent indicated above.</p><pre id="pre_41">
