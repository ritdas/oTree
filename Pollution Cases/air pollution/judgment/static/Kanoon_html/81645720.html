S.K.Mishra, J.             This misc. case arises, out of the writ petition No.31672 of 2011, wherein the

         petitioner has prayed that the Court should issue appropriate writ to the opposite parties for

obtained sitting criteria clearance certificate from the Collector and District Magistrate. The

unit has obtained consent to establish (NOC) from the PCB but the application for consent

to operate has not been considered due to pendency of W.P.(C) No. 1713 of 2011.

              In case of M/s Mahalaxmi Stone products, it has obtained the sitting criteria

clearance certificate from the Collector and District Magistrate. The order of consent to

operate issued in favour of the unit has been renewed by the PCB vide letter no.

              In case of M/s Panchalingeswar Stone Crusher, the unit has neither obtained

the sitting criteria clearance certificate from the Collector and District Magistrate nor has

taken consent to establish/operate from the PCB. The unit is operating without taking

pollution control measures.

              In respect of M/s Sri Aurobinda Stone Crusher, the unit has obtained sitting

criteria clearance certificate from the Collector and District Magistrate. The order of

consent to operate issued in favour of the unit has been renewed by the Pollution Control

Board vide letter no.2059/Con-409, dated 07.06.2011.

              In case of M/s Maa Mangala Stone Crusher, the unit has obtained sitting

criteria clearance certificate from the Collector and District Magistrate. Though the unit has

obtained consent to establish (NOC) from the PCB, but has not taken consent to operate.

This unit is not in operation.

              The counter affidavit further reveals that, in respect of M/s Nandighosha

Stone Crusher, the said unit has obtained sitting criteria clearance certificate from the

Collector and District Magistrate. The unit has obtained consent to establish (NOC) from

the PCB, but has not taken consent to operate. The unit has started commercial

              The counter affidavit further indicates that in respect of M/s Saraswati Stone

Crusher, the unit has obtained sitting criteria clearance certificate from the Collector and

District Magistrate. The unit has obtained the order of consent to operate from the PCB

vide letter no.2088/CON-1840 dated 02.12.2011.

certificate from the Collector and District Magistrate and though the unit has obtained

consent to establish (NOC) from the PCB, the same has not taken consent to operate till

date. The unit has not taken pollution control measures.

3.            In view of these undisputed facts, this Court comes to the conclusion that an

interim direction should be given to the PCB to take appropriate action in this matter.

              <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">Section 31-A</a> of the AIR (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981
provides as follows:-
                                                       4

                       " 31A. Power to give directions - Notwithstanding anything
                      contained in any other law, but subject to the provisions of this Act
                      and to any directions that the Central Government may give in this
                      behalf, a Board may, in the exercise of its powers and performance
                      of its function under this Act, issue any directions in writing to any
                      person officer or authority, and such person, office or authority shall
                      be bound to comply with such directions.

                      Explanation - For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby declared
                      that the power to issue directions under this section includes the
                      power to direct -

                      (a)    the closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry,
                             operation or process; or

                      (b)    the stoppage or regulation of supply of electricity, water or
                             any other service."

        4.            Since the Board has the power to give appropriate directions to the Stone

        Crusher Units mentioned above, it is hereby directed in the interim that it should give

        appropriate directions for closure of the units, who have not obtained the necessary

        clearance certificate from the Pollution Control Board for operating stone crushers and

        those who have also not taken pollution control measures effectively within four weeks from
