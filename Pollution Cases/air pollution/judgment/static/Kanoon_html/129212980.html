             Dated this the 31st day of January, 2013


                           JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     M/s. Nilambur Traders (the petitioner in WP(C) No.

11393/2012) and M/s. Fathima Rubber and Industries (belonging

to the petitioners in WP(C) No. 12763/2012) are two industrial

units engaged in the production of skim crepe (rubber). Both the

units possess special licence issued by the Rubber Board to deal

in rubber in the State of Kerala.            Ext.P1 in WP(C) No.

11393/2012 and Ext.P4 in WP(C) No. 12763/2012 are the

consent to operate the industrial units issued by the Kerala State

Pollution Control Board (the Board for short). The consent to

operate issued under the provisions of The water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, The Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">The Environment (Protection)

Act</a>, 1986 were admittedly valid till 30.06.2012. But the consent

so granted was revoked by Ext.P8 order dated 28.04.2012 in WP

(C) No. 11393/2012 and Ext.P19 order dated 04.05.2012 in WP

(C) No. 12763/2012 by the Board. It is so done on the basis of a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>

WP(C) No. 11393 &amp; 12763 of 2012




circular issued by the Board to revoke the consent already

granted to agencies engaged in the procurement of serum from

latex centrifuging units for processing. The units in question

who were engaged in procuring serum from latex centrifuging

units for processing were neither put on notice nor heard in the

exercise. The units who were issued with the consent to operate

by the Board were entitled to be heard before the consent was

revoked uniliaterally when it was valid and current. No reason is

also stated in Ext.P10 circular in WP(C) No. 11393/2012 as to

why the consent already granted to the units engaged for

procuring serum should be revoked with immediate effect.

</p><p id="p_2">     2.     The action of the Board in unilaterally revoking the

consent already granted on the basis of a circular issued behind

the back of the units is in short violative of the principles of

natural justice. The petitioners ought to have been heard before

the consent to operate granted is revoked on the basis of any

circular issued by the Board. The circular should also reflect the

reasons as to why the agencies hitherto engaged in the

production of skim crepe (rubber) should be abruptly shut down.

WP(C) No. 11393 &amp; 12763 of 2012




I quash Ext.P8 order in WP(C) No. 11393/2012 and Ext.P19

order in WP(C) No. 12763/2012 and direct the Chairman of the

Board to reconsider the issue of renewal of consent. Ext.P10

circular in WP(C) No. 11393/2012 (marked Ext.P21 in WP(C) No.

12763/2012 also) is also quashed for the reasons already stated.

The Chairman of the Board or the appropriate authority shall

issue a fresh circular governing the field after hearing the

petitioners also. The needful shall be done within a period of

one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.    The right to run the industrial units in question would

be dependent on the orders to be passed afresh by the Chairman

of the Board in compliance with the directions in this judgment.

</p><p id="p_4">      The Writ Petitions are disposed of.
