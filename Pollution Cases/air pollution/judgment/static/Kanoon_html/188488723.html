13   21-08-2013                  Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, State of

                  Bihar, Patna Municipal Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the

                  PMC), Bihar State Pollution Control Board (hereinafter referred to

                  as the Board) and the Union of India.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                 2. It is a Public Interest Litigation highlighting the

                  failure of the PMC to establish incinerator plant for solid waste

                  management over 80 acres of acquired land though garbage

                  generated in the city of Patna is being deposited over the land

                  causing constant public nuisance which is also likely to lead to an

                  epidemic like situation for those who have raised their houses in

                  the vicinity of the acquired land, are facing great difficulty as it is

                  difficult for them to manage their affairs in the midst of garbage.

                  Appreciating the gravity of the situation, this Court called upon

                  the counsel for the parties to indicate as to why the incinerator

                  plant has not been raised over the acquired land. In this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court CWJC No.20570 of 2012 (13) dt.21-08-2013                        2</span>




             connection, it is pointed out by the learned counsel for the parties

             that land acquisition proceeding for acquisition of 80 acres of land

             for establishing incinerator plant for solid waste management

             project, destruction of garbage was completed on 29.09.2008.

             Possession of the acquired 80 acres of land was handed over to the

             PMC on 16.06.2009. Having taken possession PMC requested the

             Board under application dated 8.10.2009 with required fee to

             organize public hearing so as to enable the Board to issue

             necessary authorization after seeking clearance from the Ministry

             of Forest and Environment, Government of India. In the light of

             the request of the PMC, Board organized public hearing on

             6.3.2011 and submitted recommendation to the Ministry of Forest

             and Environment, Government of India on 8.4.2011 followed by

             reminders dated 13.07.2011 and 28.06.2012. Till the date of filing

             of this Public Interest Litigation i.e. 1.11.2012 or even thereafter

             until today it is not known as to what happened to the

             recommendation made by the Board to the Ministry of Forest and

             Environment dated 8.4.2011 and the two reminders dated

             13.07.2011 and 28.06.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                             3. In the light of the aforesaid factual details this

             Court called upon the counsel for the State, AAG- III to confirm

             whether the land acquisition proceeding indicated the purpose of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Patna High Court CWJC No.20570 of 2012 (13) dt.21-08-2013                            3</span>




             the acquisition i.e. establishment of incinerator plant for solid

             waste management project, which fact he confirmed.

</p><p id="p_4">                             4. In the light of the fact that the land acquisition has

             been made to establish the incinerator plant for solid waste

             management project, there cannot be any going back from the

             position that 80 acres of land has been acquired to establish the

             incinerator plant. The plant can be established only after obtaining

             necessary clearance from the Ministry and authorization from the

             Board. The grant of clearance and authorization by the Ministry

             and the Board is a public duty which they are required to

             discharge within reasonable time.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                             5. From the facts narrated above, it is quite evident

             that the statutory authorities established by the State Government

             under Patna Municipal Corporation Act or the Union of India

             under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Pollution Control Act</a> have failed to discharge their legal

             duty within a reasonable time. In the instant case, land acquisition

             proceeding having been completed on 29.09.2008 it is high time

             that the authorities ought to have established such plant.

             Authorities having failed to establish incinerator plant because of

             inaction on their part, which is likely to cause serious situation in

             the city, we call upon the Chief Secretary, Government of Bihar to

             interact with the Urban, Revenue Secretary, Government of Bihar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">      Patna High Court CWJC No.20570 of 2012 (13) dt.21-08-2013                       4</span>




                  and the Secretary, Ministry of Forest and Environment,

                  Government of India to ensure that the necessary clearance from

                  the Ministry of Forest and Environment, Government of India as

                  also the Board is issued within two weeks from today.

</p><p id="p_6">                                  Put up after two weeks, but it is made clear that if

                  necessary clearance is not obtained within the time aforesaid, this

                  Court will have no option but to stay further deposit of garbage

                  over the lands in question.</p><pre id="pre_2">
