that has been filed in Court today it is submitted that the Consent to Operate

for the period from 30.12.2016 to 31.03.2021 has been granted to the

petitioner.   Copy of the grant of consent dated 30.12.2016 has been

enclosed. It is submitted that show cause notice was issued by the petitioner

since he failed to make clarifications sought in its application for consent to

operate. It is submitted that the petitioner thereafter made clarification on

the portal which had been accepted and consent till 31.03.2021 has

accordingly been granted to the petitioner - Unit. Therefore, the petitioner

now has no cause of action to maintain the present petition and it has

become infructuous.
</p>
<p id="p_7">              Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that

keeping in view the consent to operate, granted to the petitioner-Unit till

31.03.2021 he does not press the petition and may be disposed of as

infructuous, however, he submits that the Board authorities may not harass

him.

consent to operate has been granted to the petitioner-Unit till 31.03.2021

and the petitioner himself states that he does not press the petition further,

nothing survives in the present petition and the same is accordingly,

dismissed as having been rendered infructuous.</p><pre id="pre_2">
