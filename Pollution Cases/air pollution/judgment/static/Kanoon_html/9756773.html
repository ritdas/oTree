<p id="p_9">                  Counsel for the petitioner is directed to serve two copies of the writ

         petition upon the Assistant Solicitor General of India having his office at

         Jharkhand High Court, Ranchi, within two days from today.

       I.A. No. 4322 of 2018

                  So far this interlocutory application is concerned, learned counsel for

the petitioner submits that the application for renewal of consent to operate under the

provision of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, is pending before the respondent No. 1 since

24.08.2017 and the application dated 24.08.2017 is contained at Annexure-18 to the

supplementary affidavit but till date no final order has been passed. He further submits

that the consent to operate was valid till 31.12.2017 and much prior to that they have

already filed application along with necessary fees and all formalities on their end has

been completed. He submits that on one hand the application has been kept pending and

on other hand, the petitioner is facing difficulty in running its Unit. He submits that it is

not open to the Respondents to keep the matter pending for an indefinite period although

under the provisions of the aforesaid Acts, the application has to be disposed of within a

period of four months.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                  Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment passed

by the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Patna decided in case of Ramco Industries

Ltd. Vs. the Bihar State Pollution Control Board and Ors., passed in C.W.J.C. No.

421 of 2017 and has referred to para-42 of the said judgments and submits that the

interim order may be granted in terms of para-42 of the said judgment.

</p><p id="p_11">                  Upon this counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent Nos. 1 and 2

submits there is no difficulty in taking decision on the application which has been filed

by the petitioner and she has received instructions that a final decision on this

application can be taken within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy

of this order. However, she could not dispute the fact that the Unit of the Petitioner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                               3</span>




cannot be made to suffer on account of non-disposal of their application which is

pending since 29.08.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                  After hearing counsel for the parties and after considering the materials

on record, this Court finds that admittedly the consent which was granted to the

petitioner expired on 31.12.2017 and the application for consent was made on

24.08.2017 but no order has been passed on the same till date and accordingly, as on

date, the consent to operate is not available to the petitioner. This Court finds that the

petitioner cannot be made to suffer on account of non-action on the part of the

respondent-Board. Accordingly, this Court directs the respondent-Board to take a final

decision on the application filed by the petitioner as back as on 24.08.2017, within a

period of four weeks from the date of receipt/ production of a copy of this order and

bring the order which may be passed on record by filing an affidavit.

</p><p id="p_13">                  Considering the submissions made by the counsel for the parties, this

Court grants interim order to the extent that till the next date the petitioner be allowed to

operate under the supervisory regulatory control of the respondent-Board, who may

carry out periodical checks as to the adherence by the petitioner to the aforesaid

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Pollution Control Act</a>s.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                  Resultantly, I.A. No. 4322 of 2018 stands allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_15">W.P.(C). No. 1873 of 2018

                  The counsel for the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 prays for and is allowed

four weeks time to file counter-affidavit. From perusal of letter dated 18.12.2017 at

Annexure-7, it appears that a letter has been issued by the Jharkhand State Pollution

Control Board to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Govt. of

India, New Delhi, that one show-cause was issued as back as in the year 2012 but final

outcome is not known to the Jharkhand Pollution Control Board. In view of the letter, it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                             4</span>




has become necessary to add the Union of India, through Ministry of Environment,

Forest and Climate Change, Government of India, as respondent in this case.

</p><p id="p_16">                  The newly added respondent, Union of India may file their counter-

affidavit within a period of four weeks.
