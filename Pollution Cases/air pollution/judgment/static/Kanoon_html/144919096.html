           HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHUTOSH KUMAR
   ORAL JUDGMENT
   (Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)

     Date : 11-09-2018


                From the counter affidavit filed by the Pollution
   Control Board, it appears that the Pollution Control Board
   has identified those factories who are running illegally and
   without approval of the Pollution Control Board and that in
   some cases even the closure notices have been issued.
 Patna High Court CWJC No.17409 of 2016 dt.11-09-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           2/3</span>




       However, after issuance of closure notices, it appears that
       no further steps have been taken to actually close down
       those factories which are running illegally and without
       obtaining any approval of the Pollution Control Board.
</p><p id="p_21">                    In the earlier round of litigation while disposing of
       C.W.J.C. No. 6934 of 2016 dated 25.07.2016 the Division
       Bench of this Court directed the District Magistrate, Gaya
       to ensure that the factories, in question are closed
       forthwith unless Bihar Pollution Control Board directs or
       permits for running all the factories. The Division Bench
       also directed the Bihar Pollution Control Board to find out
       any other factory in the district of Gaya, is being running
       without necessary approval/consent/permission of the
       Bihar Pollution Control Board. Despite above, the illegal
       factories       which       are     being       run   without    necessary
       approval/consent/permission of the Bihar Pollution Control
       Board. Once the closure notices are issued and thereafter
       as per the closure notice, if the factories are not closed in
       that case the State Pollution Control Board as well as the
       District Magistrate are required to see that all those
       factories being run illegally and being run without
       necessary         approval/consent/permission            of     the   Bihar
       Pollution Control Board are actually closed.
</p><p id="p_22">                    We give further two weeks time to the District
       Magistrate, Gaya as well as the Bihar State Pollution
              Patna High Court CWJC No.17409 of 2016 dt.11-09-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                         3/3</span>




                    Control Board to take steps to close those factories being
                    run illegally in the district of Gaya, which are being run
                    without necessary approval/consent/permission of the
                    Bihar State Pollution Control Board.
</p><p id="p_23">                                 List this matter on 25th of September, 2018.
                                 It is further observed that if any of the factory is
                    being         run        illegally         without   obtaining   any
                    approval/consent/permission of the Pollution Control Board
                    in that case the prosecution is to be launched against such
                    factory owners as per the provisions of the Air (Prevention
                    and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.

                    per the provisions of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of
