<p id="p_9">        It is submitted by Mr. Mukherjee, learned
Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners
that first batch of Assembly Election schedule in West
Bengal during the current year is going to be held on
18th April, 2011 for 54 seats in North Bengal
consisting of Constituencies in Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri,
Uttar     Dinajpur,   Dakshin       Dinajpur   and   Malda
Districts.
</p>

<p id="p_10">        It is submitted that the Secondary and Higher
Secondary Examinations conducted by West Bengal
Board of Secondary Education and West Bengal
Council      of    Higher     Secondary        Examination
respectively, will be over by 8th April, 2011 and,
therefore, reasonable relief is sought by way of a
direction from this Court to relax the impugned
notification and permit the political parties from using
loudspeaker in open area, so as to hold political
meetings, otherwise political parties will not be able to
reach its voters in the aforementioned constituencies.
Therefore, they may be permitted to hold election
meetings by using loudspeakers in open area during
the daytime and preferably between 10-00 hours and
20-00 hours.
</p>

<p id="p_11">        It is submitted that though the examinations
conducted by West Bengal Board and Council             are
over, but the examinations conducted by the Central

                     AST 138 of 2011

Board and Council will over by 13th April, 2011 and
there will be hardly any time left for canvassing and
reaching       the   people    by   holding   public   election
meetings and, therefore, the Court should pass
appropriate orders in the matter.
</p><p id="p_12">      Mr. Kallol Basu, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of West Bengal Pollution Control Board has
placed before us a written suggestion of the Board. Let
the same be taken on record.
</p>

<p id="p_13">      Learned counsel submits that considering the
exigency of the circumstances, the Court may pass
appropriate orders in the matter. In this respect our
attention has been drawn to an order dated 20th
November, 1997 passed in C.O. 4303 (W) of 1995 [Om
Birangana Religious Society vs. State of West Bengal &amp;
Ors.] as also various provisions of Air (Prevention &amp;
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment
(Protection)    Act</a>,    1986    read   with   Noise    Pollution
(Regulation &amp; Control) Rules, 2000.
</p>

<p id="p_14">      Learned counsel submits that the impugned
notification has been issued keeping in mind the
decision of this Court and the said rules and
regulations. He submits that considering this as an
exception, the respondents suggest that the Court
may permit the use of loudspeakers in open area,
subject to statutory provisions and rules for a
reasonable time keeping in mind the interest of
students who are appearing for the examinations,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                        4</span>
                AST 138 of 2011

conducted by Central Board of Secondary Education
and Indian Council of Secondary Education, which
will not be over till 13th April, 2011.
</p>

<p id="p_15">      Nobody       appears     on   behalf    of   Election
Commission of India, respondent no.10 herein, at the
time of hearing. In our view, the respondent no.10
should take a call in the matter and come up with
certain guidelines as part of its code of conduct, while
conducting elections in various States by focussing its
attention to the welfare and interest of students
community,      who      are    required      to   undergo
examinations throughout the year and particularly
when they are appearing in the Annual Examinations,
such blatant use of microphones in open space are
bound to invade their privacy for substantially
affecting their studies and future in life.
</p>

<p id="p_16">      We could have finally disposed of this petition
by passing the orders, which we now propose to pass
by way of interim order as we want the respondent
no.10 to address us on the said issue.
</p>

<p id="p_17">      Therefore, we are keeping this petition pending
with a direction to the respondents and particularly
respondent no.10, to file their respective affidavit-in-
opposition by way of response on or before the next
date of hearing.
</p>

<p id="p_18">      Taking into consideration the exigency of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                        5</span>
                AST 138 of 2011

circumstances that the Assembly elections, which are
going to be held in the State, shall commence from
18th April, 2011 for 54 seats in North Bengal in about
six Districts, we pass the following interim order,
which shall be applicable to all Constituencies
excepting Darjeeling Town.
</p>

<p id="p_19">      We,    therefore,   direct   the   respondents   i.e.
Department of Environment, Government of West
Bengal and West Bengal Pollution Control Board to
permit the political parties and candidates who are
contesting elections for Assembly in North Bengal
except Darjeeling town, to hold public meetings by
using loudspeakers / microphones in open ground
area subject to statutory rules and regulations
governing the subject between 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. with
effect from 9th April, 2011 till 16th April, 2011.
</p>

<p id="p_20">      We make it clear that this interim order should
not be treated as a precedent for future as it has been
passed considering the exigency of the circumstances
for the purpose of enabling the political parties and
candidates who are contesting the Assembly Elections
and restricted to the Constituencies as aforesaid in
North Bengal.
</p>

<p id="p_21">      The matter be now listed after summer vacation
i.e. on 24th June, 2011 to enable the parties to file
their respective affidavits, so that the petition can be
finally disposed of.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                       6</span>
<p id="p_22">               AST 138 of 2011



     Let photostat plain copy of this order duly
countersigned by the Assistant Registrar (Court) be
given to the learned counsel for the parties on usual
undertaking.
