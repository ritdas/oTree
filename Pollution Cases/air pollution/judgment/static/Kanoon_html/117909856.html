:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">[Order of the Court was made by The Hon'ble Chief Justice]
        This Writ Petition is directed, inter alia, against the dumping of
garbage in the vicinity of the new municipal building of Usilampatti
Municipality.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2. As recorded in our order dated 08.11.2017, the District Collector
has, by an order dated 18.05.2017, allotted the land to the Municipality in
Survey No.87 measuring 5.25.5 Hectares for construction of a dumping yard. We 
are informed that construction of dumping yard has now commenced and the  
completion should take six months.
</p><p id="p_3">        3. By our order dated 08.11.2017, we observed that garbage cannot be
allowed to be dumped and allowed to accumulate in the vicinity of the new
municipal building for six months. We directed that the dumped garbage be
removed and dumped in some vacant uninhabited area and destroyed.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4. A report has been submitted by the fourth respondent, being the
Commissioner, Usilampatti Municipality. In the status report, it is stated
that garbage is being dumped on the land in question for over 70 years. It is
submitted that pursuant to our order, the Revenue Divisional Officer allotted
an abandoned quarry in S.No.519/6 measuring 0.66.5 Hectares in 
Thottappanayakkanur for dumping of garbage. The garbage dumped near the  
municipal office was loaded in lorries for dumping at Thottappanayakkanur
village. However, the garbage could not be dumped there by reason of stiff
opposition from the villagers. The respondent authorities shall try and
identify some other vacant land, where there is no habitation and where the
garbage can be dumped.  
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5. Pending identification of such spot and/or completion of the dumping
yard under construction, the Municipal authorities shall cordon off the area
which is presently used as a dumping yard by erection of high fencing by
means of a tin shed. Steps shall also be taken for solid waste management,
and for recycling of the waste materials, removal of foul odour, spread of
diseases and  prevention of  pollution by reason of dumping of the garbage.
</p>        
<p id="p_6">        6. The Status report of the Commissioner, Usilampatti Municipality is
signed by the Manager of Usilampatti Municipality. The irregularity shall be
cured and a fresh report duly signed by the Commissioner, Usilampatti
Municipality, shall be filed on or before 07.12.2017.
</p>        
<p id="p_7">        7. The Writ Petition is disposed of. No costs. Consequently, connected
Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
