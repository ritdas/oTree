(Sri.R.G.Kolle, AGA for respondents 1 and 3
 Sri.N.K.Gupta, Advocate for respondents 4 to 6)


      These Writ Petitions are filed under Articles 226 and
227 of Constitution of India praying to issue to writ of
certiorari quashing the order all dated 28.8.2012 passed by
respondent No.2 vide Annexures - C to C4 respectively.


       These Writ Petitions coming on for preliminary hearing
this day, Dr.Jawad Rahim, J., made the following:-


                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioners are proprietary concerns engaged in

running stone crushing units under licenses issued by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               4</span>


competent authority arrayed in these writ petitions as

respondent no.3.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    It is not in dispute the petitioners are licensees and

the licenses are valid to run the stone crushing units.     In

this writ action they have sought a writ of certiorari to

quash the closure notices bearing     the following reference

numbers:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      a)   No.PCB/MIN/SC/CO/UIN/35/2012-13/876,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      b)   No.PCB/MIN/SC/CO/UIN/35/2012-13/924,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      c)   No.PCB/MIN/SC/CO/UIN/35/2012-13/931,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      d)   No.PCB/MIN/SC/CO/UIN/35/2012-13/905 and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      e)   No.PCB/MIN/SC/CO/UIN/35/2012-13/907,

all dated 28.8.2012 vide Annexures-C to C4 issued under

<a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_1">Section 31(A)</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution

Act</a>, 1981, by the 2nd respondent . They also seek issuance

of a writ of mandamus to direct the 3rd respondent

(competent authority under the Act) to consider their

applications filed on 7.12.2012, 8.11.2012, 7.11.2012,

7.11.2012 and 7.11.2012        vide Annexures-D to D4 to

permit them to operate their crushing units pending

consideration of the applications, and consequential reliefs.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                5</span>


<p id="p_4">3.    These   writ petitions   and several other       petitions

seeking similar relief are listed for consideration and we

have heard learned counsel, Sri Hanumanthareddy Sahukar

for the petitioner, Sri R.G.Kolle, AGA, who accepts notice on

behalf of respondents 1 and 3 and the learned advocate

who accepts notice for respondent no.2.


</p><p id="p_5">4.     The contextual facts manifesting from the averments

in the writ petitions and the submissions of the learned

counsel for the petitioners and respondents leaves no scope

for doubt that this writ action is similar to the writ action of

similarly placed owners of crushing units in which questions

raised in this writ petition were considered in detail in

W.P.41069/12 disposed of by the Division Bench of this

court on 21.11.2012 quashing the closure notice issued by

the   Karnataka    Pollution   Control   Board    arrayed    as

respondent no.2 in that writ petition and issuing a writ of

mandamus to permit the petitioner therein to continue

stone crushing activity till its application for re-locating the

unit to a safer zone was disposed of by the competent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     6</span>


authority,   i.e.   Deputy    Commissioner        (respondent   no.3

arrayed in that writ petition).
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">5.     We are satisfied the orders impugned in that writ

petition, grounds against it and the relief sought are the

same as in this writ action. Therefore, we cannot summon

ourselves to take a different view but to follow the decision

of the Division Bench in W.P.41069/12 dated 21.11.2012 in

which, while rendition of the judgment, all facts and

circumstances       have     been       taken   into   consideration.

However, to avoid any doubt, we need to extract the core of

the judgment which is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">            'In the present case, by Gazette
         Notification dated 14.8.2012 safer zones in
         Haveri had been duly notified to the public.
         Section 3(3) of the Karnataka Regulation of
         Stone Crushers Act, 2011 (for short, 'the
         Act') permits a period of three months to
         existing stone crusher units to trans-locate
         themselves to safer zones. In this regard
         an application has to be filed with the
         Licensing Authority within a reasonable
         time.    Unfortunately, the Act does not
         prescribe this period. In the present case,
         the Petitioner applied to the Licensing
         Authority on 24.9.2012. It is not disputed
         that consequent upon the petitioner's
         application, the Licensing Authority till date
         has neither granted or refused the license
         under the provisions of the said Act. Since
         <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_3">Section 3(4)</a> of the Act prescribes an outer
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                7</span>

        limit of six months for shifting from the
        date of grant, it could be inferred that the
        application has to be made within three
        months of the requisite Gazetting of the
        safer zones.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">        2. In these circumstances, the petition is
        allowed by directing the respondents to
        permit the operation of the petitioner at
        the present site upt 23.12.2012 or till such
        time the application is considered and
        disposed of, by the Licensing Authority.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">        3. Learned counsel for the Karnataka State
        Pollution Control Board (for short 'the
        Board) submits that the petitioner did not
        apply for the consent of the Board on the
        expiry of the previous consent on
        30.6.2012. In normal circumstances, the
        contention would be well founded since no
        one is permitted to operate without current
        permission or consent.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">        4. In the circumstances of the present
        case, however, a piquant situation has
        arisen, inasmuch as the Pollution Control
        Board cannot grant permission to the
        petitioner to operate in its present site,
        since it must statutorily relocate to a safer
        zone as identified by the State. Needless
        to add that if and when the petitioner is
        granted a license to relocate to a safer
        zone, conditions under <a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_4">Section 6(9)</a> of the
        Act will have to e complied with as also the
        permission would have to be obtained from
        the Board.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">        5. With these observations, the petition is
        allowed and Annexure-H dated 5.9.2012 is
        quashed.'

</blockquote><p id="p_8">6.   Under        the       circumstances,         Annexures-C

to C4, all dated 28.8.2012 impugned in these writ petitions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               8</span>


issued by the 2nd respondent are quashed. In terms of the

order extracted above, these petitions are also allowed

directing the respondents to permit operation of the stone

crushing units of the petitioners at the present site till such

time their applications are considered and disposed of by

the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from

now, as ordered in that writ petition.     Rule issued and

made absolute.       In the circumstances, there shall be no

order as to costs.
