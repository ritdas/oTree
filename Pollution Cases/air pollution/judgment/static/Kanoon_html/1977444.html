(Per : HONOURABLE
MR.JUSTICE K.M.THAKER)
 

 


 

 


 


	With
the allegations that the flora and fauna in Arabian sea and Devka
river have been affected on account of the pollution caused by the
respondent No.4-company, the petitioner has preferred present
petition, as Public Interest Litigation.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_6">	However,
as the discussion would show, the allegations are without any
supporting facts, figures, details or any material whatsoever.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_7">	The
petitioner, a charitable trust at Junagadh, is registered under the
provisions of the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950. The members and the
beneficiaries of the petitioner trust are fishermen engaged in the
business of fishing in Arabian sea near Veraval. The petitioner has
averred in the petition that it has filed the petition on behalf of
and for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust and other
persons affected by the pollution caused by the respondent
No.4-company. The petitioner has made allegation to the effect that
the respondent No.4-company is discharging untreated industrial
effluent through open channel into the sea caused serious damage to
the environment in violation of the provisions under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment
Protection Act</a>, 1986; Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_3">Control) Act</a>, 1981. On such
allegations, the petitioner has prayed for below mentioned reliefs:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_8"> 15(a)	This
Hon'ble Court may be pleased to issue a writ of Mandamus or any other
appropriate writ, order or direction directing respondent no.1 to 3
to take immediate actions against respondent no.4 for violation the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986, the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_6">Control) Act</a>, 1981.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_9">(b)	This
Honourable Court may be pleased to issue appropriate writ, order or
direction restraining respondent no.4 from discharging untreated
industrial effluent or the effluent which does not meet with the
standard prescribed under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 into the Arabian Sea.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_10">(c)
	This Honourable Court may be pleased to issue appropriate writ,
order or dir5ection directing respondent no.4 to restore the
environmental damage caused by it in the manner that may be suggested
by respondent no.2.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_11">(d)	This
Honourable Court may be pleased to direct respondent no.4 to pay in
public law remedy an ad-hoc compensation of Rs.1 lakh to each person
engaged in the business of fishing who is affected by the pollution
caused by respondent no.4.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_12">(e)	Pending
admission and final disposal of the present petition, this Honourable
Court may be pleased to appoint a Committee of experts to submit a
report on the nature of pollution caused by respondent no.4, its
effects on environment and suggest the modes of checking
environmental pollution and restoring the environment damage caused
by respondent no.4. 
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_13">	In
response to the notice, the respondents have appeared and in their
respective affidavits in reply, the allegations have been denied. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_14">	Mr.
</p><p id="p_15">Asim Pandya learned advocate for Mr. H.L.Patel Advocates has appeared
for the petitioner and Mr. Meena, learned advocate has appeared for
the respondent No.2-Gujarat Pollution Control Board. Mr. J.K.Shah,
learned AGP, has appeared for respondent No.1-State of Gujarat and
respondent No.3-Collector, Junagadh and Mr. Sandip Singhi for Singhi
&amp; Company has appeared for the respondent No.4-company.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_16">	Heard
the learned counsel for the respective parties.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_17">	The
petitioner trust has alleged in the petition that the respondent
No.4-company discharges untreated industrial effluent through open
channel, which has caused degradation of soil quality and has
affected flora and fauna in the area and the marine life upto 15 to
20 Nautical Miles in the sea has come to virtual extinction. The
discharge of industrial effluent in the sea has polluted the sea
water. It has also been alleged that the plant of the respondent
No.4-company emits huge quantity of fly ash in the air which is
beyond permissible limit and contrary to the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air Act</a> and thereby, the
respondent No.4-company causes air pollution. It has also been
alleged that the untreated industrial effluent discharged in the
river also affected the quality of soil and that despite several
representations and complains made before the respondent authority,
any steps have not been taken against the respondent No.4-company. It
has been alleged that in the course of manufacturing activities
carried on by the respondent No.4-company, which is manufacturing
rayon and other products in its unit situate at Veraval, industrial
effluent in liquid and gaseous form is generated.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_18">	The
thrust of the petitioner's allegations in the petition and
submissions during the hearing was to the effect that the discharge
of industrial effluent in the sea has polluted sea water which causes
corrosion of the engines of the fishing boats of the members of the
petitioner trust and due to polluted water, the life span of fishing
nets reduce to great extent, which imposes huge burden on the
fishermen. Due to pollution, which effects the marine life, the
members of the petitioner trust are deprived of their catch of fish
and the fish yield in the area has reduced to such an extent that the
member of the petitioner trust have to travel farther away in their
boats to catch fish. The quality of
fish has also deteriorated and most of the people reject the fish
caught from the said area, which has resulted into reduction in
consumption and export of fish. It has been alleged that the
respondent No.4-company has, thus, snatched away the livelihood of
the members of the petitioner trust. The pollution caused by the
respondent No.4-company has also resulted into skin diseases and
health hazards. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_19">	At
the outset, we are constrained to note, particularly having regard to
the fact that the members and beneficiaries of the petitioner trust
are fishermen and the allegations in the petition   which has been
submitted as Public Interest Litigation   are with reference to the
effect which the alleged polluting activities of respondent
No.4-company have caused to the fishermen and their business of
fishing, that the petition is bereft of any relevant details, except
the allegations, which have been made without any supporting date.
Except the 3 news paper reports and 2 medical certificates which are
annexed to the petition and are accompanied by the copy of the
representations/complains made by the association of the fishermen,
the petition is baron and
it does not contain any material in support of the allegations.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_20">	The
petition does not give out the details of the effluent discharge nor
does it give out the details about the alleged gaseous  emission and
also does not give out even general idea about the alleged reduction
in marine life or the type of the adverse effect on the flora and
fauna. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_21">	Therefore,
notice to the Pollution Control Board was simultaneously issued who,
in due course, filed reply affidavit, to which we shall advert
hereafter. As noted earlier, the respondent No.4 has filed reply
affidavits and denied the allegations.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_22">	It
is claimed by the respondent No.4-company that its factory/plant is
situated in industrial zone at Veraval and it is engaged in
manufacturing viscose filament yarn, caustic soda and other allied
by-products. The company has also installed and commissioned a
captive power plant. The respondent No.4-company has claimed that it
has received and all-throughout it has held, the
consent/authorization granted by the respondent No.2-Pollution
Control Board under the provisions of  <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_9">Environment Protection Act</a>,
1986, Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and
Hazardous Waste (Management &amp; Handling) Rules, 1989 and the last,
amongst the series of consent orders granted by the respondent
No.2-Board, is the consent order issued vide letter dated 24.6.2009
which is valid till 31.3.2010 while the authorization is valid upto
November-2010. It has also claimed that it has been discharging the
treated effluent in accordance with the terms of the consent granted
by the respondent No.2-Board. The respondent No.4-company has also
claimed that as a measure of long
terms solution for discharge of treated effluent, the respondent
company was instructed by the respondent No.2-Board to lay pipeline
for discharging the treated effluent into deep sea and that in view
of such instructions, it has laid a closed pipeline with diffuser
system for discharging the treated effluent into the sea after
obtaining requisite statutory permission and consents. The said
pipeline is about 1.5 kms. in length and it has been commissioned
since November-2009.
</p> 


<p id="p_23">	It
has been further stated that the effluent generated from various
sections of its plants is treated in the effluent treatment plant
which has been installed and commissioned by the respondent
No.4-company so as to meet with the prescribed standards for effluent
discharge. The various equipments installed by the respondent company

	The
respondent company has claimed that the Pollution Control Board is
regularly inspecting the manufacturing unit and samples of the
treated effluent discharged by the company are regularly collected
and in the results, it is found that the treated effluent discharged
by the company meets with the parameters prescribed by the Pollution
Control Board. It has also claimed that the respondent No.4-company
undertakes bioassay test of the treated effluent which is the
relevant method for testing and determining the survival of fish. The
test is carried out by Junagadh Agricultural University and Fisheries
Research Station which is recognized as environmental laboratory by
the Central Pollution Control Board and the test results have
indicated that the treated effluent discharged from the factory meets
the bioassay test norms i.e. 90% survival of fish after 96 hours in
100% of the treated effluent. The copies of the analysis reports of
the Junagadh Agricultural University and the summary of the various
reports from the university is also placed on record by the
respondent No.-4company, which reads thus:-

	So
far as the allegations regarding fly ash and emission of effluent in
air are concerned, the respondent No.4-company has dealt with the
said allegation in para 7 of the reply affidavit and stated as
under:-
</p> 


<p id="p_41"> First
of all the coal/lignite is stored in the closed covered coal yard.
The closed covered coal yard helps to control particulate emissions.
Within the shed area water sprinkler system is installed to further
control the particulate emissions. The Respondent no.4 has also
installed dry fog based dust suppression system within the coal
handling plant to control sub micron particle of dust. From the coal
storage area the coal are taken through conveyer belt to coal crusher
plant within the factory premises. The Respondent no.4 has installed
bag filter system in coal crusher plant to control particular
emissions. From the coal crusher plant, the coal is fed to the boiler
combustion chambers for co-generation. Fly ash and bottom ash are
generated during the process of combustion in the boiler. The bottom
ash is drained through bottom ash cooler and conveyed to closed
bottom silos through pneumatic conveying system. The fly ash from the
combustion boilers is collected in three stages Electro Static
Precipitator and conveyed to fly ash silos through closed pneumatic
conveying system. The ash collected in the silos are, inter alia,
used by the group cement plant for manufacture of port land cement
and the fly ash is also utilized within the factory at Veraval for
manufacture of fly ash bricks which are used for construction purpose
within the factory premises. 
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_42">	It
may be noted that the aforesaid assertions by the respondent
No.4-company and/or any other details and material produced on
record, have not been controverted in any manner by the petitioner.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_43">	So
far as emission from the flue gas and process stake is concerned, the
respondent No.4-company has claimed that it has installed air
pollution control equipments which control the emission and keeps it
within the parameters prescribed by the Pollution Control Board. The
equipments comprising the air pollution control plant are as under:-

<p id="p_60">	It
is also stated that the Pollution Control Board is also regularly
taking samples from the chimneys-stacks and the analysis reports have
revealed that the emission have remained within prescribed
parameters. The respondent company has also claimed that during 2009,
an ambient air quality was examined by 3rd
party auditor namely, ATIRA and the reports by ATIRA have certified
that the respondent company is achieving prescribed parameters in
respect of ambient air (including RSPM also).
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_61">	The
respondent No.4-company has also stated in the affidavit that it
maintains in-house laboratory equipped with various equipments
for conducting pollution related analysis. The details of the
equipments in the laboratory and its photographs are annexed to the
affidavit. It is claimed that the monthly in-house analysis reports
are also forwarded to the Pollution Control Board. It has also
claimed that staff of about 15 personnel (engineers, chemists and
operators) is maintained exclusively for attending the different
treatment facilities installed and commissioned at the company's
factory at Veraval and it has also activated a cell/committee for
environment, health and safety management which plans, monitors and
executes the environment and safety related matters and that it has
also created a green belt area with about 35000 trees and plants
within the premises of the factory. The respondent company also
boosts that it has received awards for outstanding achievement in
environment management, excellence in energy management and
achievement in energy conservation and it has been granted ISO
9001:2000 (Quality Management System Standard), ISO 14001:2004
(Environmental Management System), OHSAS 18001:2007 (Occupational
Health and Safety Management System Standard), etc, the certificates,
which substantiate its submission that the respondent company is
meeting with and maintaining the environmental standards and
parameters. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_62">	None
of the details stated in the reply affidavit of the respondent
No.4-company and/or the contents annexed to the affidavit are
disputed or denied by the petitioner. Any counter affidavit,
controverting the details stated by the respondent No.4 company has
not been filed by the petitioner.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_63">	On
the other hand, the officer (environmental engineer) of respondent
No.2-Pollution Control Board has filed an affidavit. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_64">	In
its reply affidavit, the respondent No.2-Board has stated that
pursuant to the request by the respondent No.4-company for consent
under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">Water Act</a> and also for necessary
authorization, the respondent No.2-Board has granted consolidated
consent and authorization. It appears that the disposal point in the
sea, for discharging the effluent, was determined by the respondent
No.2-Board and upon instructions/advise by the respondent No.2-Board,
the respondent No.4-company has laid the pipeline upto the disposal
point and the trial runs for the discharge of effluent treatment
through the pipeline has already been undertaken. The respondent
No.2-Board has also stated in its affidavit that during the visit by
the officers it was noticed that all the units of the effluent
treatment plan ( ETP  for short)were in operation. The respondent
No.2-Board has also stated in its affidavit that the effluent is
discharged after treatment in the ETP and the same is being
discharged in the sea through the pipeline laid by the respondent
No.4-company. After drawing and testing the samples of waste water
and on the basis of the analysis report, the respondent No.2-Board
has stated in its affidavit that all the parameters were within the
prescribed and permissible limits. It has also been stated that the
samples of flue gas were also collected and the analysis reports have
confirmed that the parameters are within the prescribed and
permissible limits and that the air pollution prevention control
measurements were found in operation. Likewise, with reference to fly
ash, the respondent No.2-Board has, after having drawn the samples
and getting it tested, stated that except RSPM all other parameters
were found within prescribed and permissible limits including
parameters of the ambient air samples. So far as the norms pertaining
to RSPM is concerned, a show-cause notice was served. The respondent
No.2-Board has made reference of the visits taken by its officers in
February, April, June and October-2009 and that the samples taken
during those visits were found within prescribed and permissible
limits. With reference to the allegations about the effect on the
marine life, particularly with reference to fish, the respondent
No.2-Board has stated that :-
</p> 


<p id="p_65"> 8.	That
the last visit on 21/2/2009 of the unit concerning the complaint
received from the present petitioner's regarding the fish mortality
due to the discharge of affluent, no dead fishes were observed on the
seashore and on the bank of river. The collected wastewater sample
from the final outlet of the effluent treatment plant shows that all
the parameters are within the permissible limit. During all these
visits, no mortality of fish was observed by the officers of the
board. However, because ambient air quality RSPM was found to be
slighter higher than the prescribed limit, the regional officer has
been asked to carry out a vigorous monitoring of the industry to find
out the reasons for a higher RSPM. 
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_66">	After
its above referred affidavit (of January-2010), the respondent
No.2-Board made another affidavit in February-2010 wherein the
respondent No.2-Board has stated thus:-
</p> 


<p id="p_67"> 1.	I
am working with the respondent as an environmental engineer. In
pursuance of my last affidavit, we had carried out rigourous
monitoring of the unit in question and we have taken latest sample
reports under Air (Prevention and Pollution) 1981 and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_13">Water Act</a>. The
samples have been taken from exactly the same location from which the
earlier ambient samples were taken. Analysis report of Air
(Prevention and Pollution) 1981 and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_14">Water Act</a> dated 2/1/2010 are
annexed with this reply and marked as  Annexure  R1 .
</p>

 


 


 


<p id="p_68">2.	As
per the latest analysis report, all the parameters mentioned in the
consent and authorisation including RSPM are now within permissible
limits.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_69">3.	The
regional office, Junagadh has taken samples under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_15">Water Act</a> also.
Looking to the said sample report, it is now clear that all
parameters of effluent is well within permissible limits. A copy of
the latest analysis report as per the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_16">Water Act</a> is annexed with this
reply and marked as  Annexure  R2 . 
</p>
 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_70">	After
the aforesaid second affidavit of respondent No.2-Board, the
respondent No.4-company filed another affidavit in June-2010 wherein
the respondent No.4-company has, with reference to the allegations
that due to the discharged effluent, the fish in the sea and river
are adversely effected, mention the details about the bioassay test
and stated thus:-
</p> 


<p id="p_71"> 6.	That
the Junagadh Agricultural University, Fisheries Research Station,
Okha Port (an environmental laboratory recognized by Central
Pollution Control Board) had carried out Bio Assay test of treated
effluent in respect of survival of fish for the months of January to
May, 2010. The test results indicates that the final treated effluent
discharged from the factory of the Respondent No.4 meets the
requirements of Bio Assay Test norms i.e. 90% survival of fish after
96 hours in 100% of the treated effluent. The copies of the Analysis
reports of Junagadh Agricultural University for the months of January
to May, 2010 are annexed hereto as ANNEXURE   E (Colly.) 
 


 


 


	At
this stage, it deserves to be noted, and it is pertinent, that the
petitioner has not given any comparative data and/or placed any
material (except couple of news paper reports) from which it can be
ascertained that the effluent discharged by the respondent
No.4-company actually has had any adverse effect on the marine life
and flora and fauna in the area. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_72">	It
is equally pertinent that even after the affidavits by respondent
No.4-company and respondent No.2-Board, the petitioner has not come
out with any data from which one can make even educated guess about
the effect on marine life. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_73">	The
petition is devoid of any facts, figures and details and there is
complete absence of any material to substantiate the diverse
allegations made by the petitioner. Any facts or figures about the
alleged reduction in the fish yield and/or any material to support
the allegation that the marine life is on the verge of extinction or
that the emission in the air and/or  the effluent discharged is
having any hazardous effect on the health of people or soil and
potable water, etc. are not placed on record by the petitioner. It is
pertinent that any comparative figures or data pertaining to earlier
position vis-a-vis present position are also not placed on record
which may demonstrate atleast prima facie, that as compared to the
earlier position the marine life or the flora and fauna in the
surrounding area have been adversely affected and that has happened
as a result of the effluent discharged by the respondent
No.4-company.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_74">	Though
the petition did not contain any relevant details, which may persuade
the Court to carry the probe further, since the petition raised
environmental issue, with a view to ascertaining the factual aspects
and with a view to getting the correct and complete picture of the
fact - situation at the site and the surrounding area, notice to the
respondents was issued. In response to the notice, the respondent
No.2-Board and respondent No.4-company have, as mentioned above,
filed their reply affidavits. Even after the said reply affidavits,
the petitioner has not come out either with any counter affidavit
dealing with the assertions made in the said reply affidavits or with
any facts and figures to support its allegations or to controvert the
submissions of the respondent No.4-company. The reply affidavits, the
assertions made therein, the material produced on record along with
the said affidavits, have remained uncontroverted. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_75">	In
view of the details placed on record by respondent No.4-company and
having regard to the affidavits by respondent No.2-Board (which
corroborate the assertions of the company) coupled with complete
absence of any facts, figures, material of whatsoever nature from the
side of petitioner, the bald and unsubstantiated allegations by the
petitioner cannot be entertained, more so when any of the assertions,
details, facts, figures and material  placed on record by the
respondent No.4-company and/or respondent No.2-Board are not disputed
or controverted    much less countered by any data.   The  lack of
relevant facts and figures is highlighted by the absence of
counter/rejoinder affidavit. The relief as prayed for cannot be
granted for want of any material to substantiate the allegations. The
petition, therefore, fails
and deserves to be rejected. Accordingly, it is hereby rejected.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_76">	However
considering the fact that the respondent No.2-Board had to direct the
respondent No.4-company to lay the pipeline for discharge in the sea
and the discharge point had to be determined by the Board and since
the RSPM were, though only for a brief period, were noticed to be on
higher side, we feel it necessary to direct that :-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_77">(1)	At
least for next 3 years the respondent No.4-company shall get
Bio Assay  test conducted every 4 months . Thetreafter the said
test may be conducted as per the normal routine.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_78">(2)	The
respondent No.2-Board shall, in addition to its regular and statutory
inspections, additionally carry out surprise special visits and
inspections thrice in a year with special concentration on potential
of health hazard, the effect on the potable water and soil, emission
of gases in the air and discharge of effluent and their contents.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_79">(3)	During
the regular and statutory visits and the special visits, as
aforesaid, the respondent No.2-Board shall also specifically observe
(and this should be made regular feature) and note as to whether all
equipments of the air pollution control plant, effluent treatment
plant, etc. are effectively operating or not and whether they are
being properly maintained or not or they remain in shut down
condition.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_80">(4)	The
Factory Inspector is also directed to make monthly visits and prepare
report as to whether statutory requirements are being fulfilled or
not and whether the pollution control equipments are being
effectively run or not. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_81">	Since
the Factory Inspector is not party to the proceedings, the registry
shall forward a copy of this order to the office of Factory
Inspector, Veraval/Junagadh and Chief Inspector of Factory for
necessary action(s).
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_82">(5)	The
Junagadh Agricultural University, while conducting the Bio-Assay
test, may also endeavor to ascertain as to whether there is any
abnormal or cognizable reduction in the marine life in the area. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_83">(6)	If
at anytime any defect, or default or shortfall in compliance with or
breach of prescribed parameters by the respondent No.4 company is
noticed by any agency and/or if the effluent treatment/pollution
control equipments and the plants are found to be in
non-operating/closed mode and/or if it is found that the conditions
of consent/authorisation are not being diligently observed, then the
concerned and responsible authorities shall immediately take
appropriate corrective and penal action, as may be required,
including cancellation of consent/authorisation. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_84">(7)	A
copy of every inspection report along with the action taken report,
if any, shall be forwarded to the Collector. The Collector shall keep
overall supervision and give appropriate instructions, if and when
necessary to ensure compliance in all respect. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_85">	The
registry shall forward a copy of this order to the Collector,
Junagadh.
</p> 


<p id="p_86">	If
any special charges/fees for any of the aforesaid purpose are
required to be paid, the same shall be borne by the respondent
No.4-company.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_87">	With
the aforesaid observations and directions, the petition stands
disposed of. Notice discharged. No cost.
