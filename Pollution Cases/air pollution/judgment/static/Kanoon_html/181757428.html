<p id="p_1">                 As identical questions of law and facts are involved, therefore, I

propose to decide all the cases of petitioners-accused (developers), depicted in

Schedule A and those of subsequent vendees/transferees, mentioned in Schedule

B (attached herewith), by virtue of this common judgment, in order to avoid the

repetition. However, the relevant facts and material, which need a necessary

mention for the limited purpose of deciding the core controversy, involved in the

instant petitions, extracted from main petitions (1) CRM No. M-51514 of 2007

titled as "M/s Ansal Properties and Infrastructure Ltd. &amp; Ors. Vs. Haryana

State Pollution Control Board" of Schedule 'A' and (2) CRM No. M-880 of

2010 titled as "Arvinder S.Brara Vs. Haryana State Pollution Control Board"

of Schedule 'B', would be referred in subsequent part of this judgment for ready

reference in this context.

<p id="p_2">2.               Exhibiting the deep concern of degradation of environmental

indiscipline, adversely affecting the humanity at large, the United Nations

Organization (U.N.O.) convened an International Conference on human

environment w.e.f. 5th to 16th of June, 1972 at Stockholm, in which, the Indian

delegation led by the Prime Minister of India participated as well. Inter-alia, the

gist of the proclamation/resolution adopted in the Conference, in substance, is as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "1.    Man is both creature and moulder of his environment which gives him
     physical sustenance and affords him the opportunity for intellectual, moral,
     social and spiritual growth. In the long and tortuous evolution of the human
     race on this planet a stage has been reached when through the rapid
     acceleration of science and technology, man has acquired the power, to
     transform his environment in countess ways and on an unprecedented scale.
     Both aspects of man's environment, the natural and the man made, are
     essential to his well being and to the enjoyment of basic human rights - Even
     the right to life itself.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                   -3-</span>
<p id="p_3">CRM Nos. M-51514 of 2007 &amp; 880 of 2010 (alongwith connected petitions)

</p><p id="p_4">   2.   The protection and improvement of the human environment is a major
   issue which affects the well-being of peoples and economic development
   throughout the world, it is the urgent desire of the peoples of the whole world
   and the duty of all Governments.
</p><p id="p_5">   3. Man has constantly to sum up experience and go on discovering, inventing,
   creating and advancing. In our time man's capability to transform his
   surroundings, if used wisely, can bring to all peoples the benefits of
   development and the opportunity to enhance the quality of life. Wrongly or
   heedlessly applied, the same power can do incalculable harm to human beings
   and the human environment. We see around us growing evidence of man-made
   harm in many regions of the earth; dangerous levels of pollution in water, air,
   earth and living beings; major and undesirable disturbances to the ecological
   balance of the biosphere; destruction and depletion of irreplaceable resources;
   and gross deficiencies harmful to the physical, mental and social health of
   man, in the man-made environment; particularly in the living and working
   environment.
</p><p id="p_6">   A point has been reached in history when we must shape our actions
   throughout the world with a more prudent care for their environmental
   consequences. Through ignorance or indifference we can do massive and
   irreversible harm to the earthly environment on which our life and well-being
   depend. Conversely, through fuller, knowledge and wiser action, we can
   achieve for ourselves and our posterity a better life in an environment more in
   keeping with human needs and hopes. There are broad vistas for the
   enhancement of environmental quality and the creation of a good life. What is
   needed is an enthusiastic but calm state of mind and intence but orderly work.
   For the purpose of attaining freedom in the world of nature man must use
   knowledge to build in collaboration with nature a better environment. To
   defend and improve the human environment for present and future generations
   has become an imperative goal for mankind a goal to be pursued, together
   with, and in harmony with, the established and fundamental goals of peace
   and of world-wide economic and social development.
</p><p id="p_7">   To achieve this environmental goal will demand the acceptance of
   responsibility by citizens and communities and by enterprises and institutions
   at every level, all sharing equitably in common efforts. Individuals in all walks
   of life as well as organizations in many fields, by their values and the sum of
   their actions, will shape the world environment of the future. Local and
   National Governments will bear the greatest burden for large-scale
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                   -4-</span>
CRM Nos. M-51514 of 2007 &amp; 880 of 2010 (alongwith connected petitions)

     environmental policy and action within their jurisdictions. International co-
     operation is also needed in order to raise resources to support the developing
     countries carrying out their responsibilities in this field. A growing class of
     environmental problems, because they are regional or global in extent or
     because they affect the common international realm, will require extensive co-
     operation among nations and action by international organizations in the
     common interest. The Conference calls upon the Governments and peoples to
     exert common efforts for the preservation and improvement of the human
     environment, for the benefit of all the people and for their posterity."

</p><p id="p_8">3.              Sequelly, the assignment of 22nd April of every year as live clean and

live green Earth's (Mother's) Day by the UNO, is another step in this direction.

In order to fulfill the International commitment, the Parliament has amended and

introduced the Articles 48-A &amp; 51-A in the Constitution of India. Likewise, it

enacted The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for brevity

"the Act of 1974"); The Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (for

short "the Act of 1981"), <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">The Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and framed the

rules thereunder (hereinafter to be referred as "the Act of 1986 &amp; the relevant

rules").
</p>
<p id="p_9">4.              The matrix of the facts, culminating in the commencement, relevant

for disposal of the present petitions and emanating from the record, is that the

complainant-Haryana State Pollution Control Board respondent (in short "the

complainant-Pollution Board") claimed in the complaint (Annexure P20) that the

Central Government has issued the Notification dated 7.5.1992 (Annexure P5) and

imposed a prohibition/ban qua the activities/operations/processes as indicated

therein. Subsequently, the Ministry of Environment, Government of India issued

yet another Notification dated 29.11.1999 (Annexure P11), by means of which, the

powers to accord environmental clearance was delegated to the State Government.

The issuance of Aravali notification, all kind of directions, bans, restrictions and

prohibitions were duly published for the knowledge of general public, so that, no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                                 -5-</span>

one could involve in any prohibited activities, which may entail punitive action

under the said notifications. In view of Aravali Notification, an inspection

committee was constituted and as per the inspection conducted by the committee,

it revealed that M/s Ansal Properties and Infrastructure Limited, its sister concern

and officers (developers) (petitioners-accused in Schedule A) have developed a

complete Township in the name &amp; style of 'Aravali Retreat' with a total area,

approximately of 1200 acres of land after demolishing the Gairmumkin Mountain

(Pahad), situated within the revenue estate of village Raisina, District Gurgaon.

They have totally changed the nature of Gairmumkin Mountain (Pahad), carved

out individual farm houses in complete violation of the provisions of the Act of

1986 and sold the same to the subsequent vendees-accused-petitioners, in cases

mentioned in Schedule B. All that was claimed to have been done by the

petitioners-accused after the commencement of the Notification dated 7.5.1992

(Annexure P5). Consequently, show cause notices dated 15.3.2006 (Annexure P15)

&amp; 15.6.2007 (Annexure P18) were issued, to which, they filed the replies dated

28.3.2006 (Annexure P16) &amp; 7.7.2007 (Annexure P19), taking the false plea of

construction of Farm houses before the commencement of notification (Annexure

P5).
</p>
<p id="p_10">5.           Levelling a variety of allegations and narrating the sequence of

events in detail, in all, according to the Pollution Board that the land in question

was described as Gairmumkin Mountain (Pahad) in the revenue record. The

provisions of The Punjab Land Preservation Act (in short "the PLPA Act"), 1900

were applicable on reserved forest of land in dispute. The petitioners-accused (in

cases mentioned in Schedule A) have totally destroyed the Gairmumkin Mountain

(Pahad) and converted it into Farm houses in complete violation of the Aravali

Notification and illegally allotted to the petitioners-accused (in cases indicated in

Schedule B). Thus, they have degraded the Aravali Hills, damaged their fragile

ecology, after the commencement of notification (Annexure P5), did not comply,

violated the mandatory provisions of the Act of 1986, Aravali Notification and

rendered themselves liable to be prosecuted in this relevant direction. In the

background of these allegations, the complainant-Pollution Board filed the

complaint (Annexure P20) against all the petitioners-accused for the commission

of offence punishable under <a href="/doc/77055124/" id="a_4">section 15</a> read with <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_5">Section 19</a> of the Act of 1986 in

the manner depicted hereinabove.
</p>
<p id="p_11">6.            Taking cognizance of the complaint and considering the preliminary

evidence, the Presiding Officer, Special Environment//Trial Court summoned the

petitioners-accused to face the trial for the commission of the offences in question,

by virtue of impugned summoning order dated 14.8.2007 (Annexure P22).

</p><p id="p_12">7.            Instead of submitting to the jurisdiction of Special/Trial Court, the

petitioners-accused, in all the cases, straightway jumped to file their respective

petitions to quash the impugned complaints, summoning orders and all other

subsequent proceedings arising therefrom, invoking the provisions of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_6">section 482</a>

Cr.PC, leaving this Court in deep lurch to collect the grain from the bundles of

chaff and to think twice, as to what extent, the finding should be recorded with

regard to the controversy raised in the instant petitions, as the same would

naturally have the direct bearing on the real issues between the parties, to be

determined by the trial Court, during the course of trial. Be that as it may, but in

the interest of justice, the principle of "safety saves" has to be kept in focus, while

deciding these petitions. That is how I am seized of the matter.

</p><p id="p_13">8.            The case set up by the petitioners-accused, in brief in so far as

relevant, was that the PLPA Act is applicable to the State of Haryana, including the

land in litigation. The petitioners M/s Ansal Properties and Infrastructure Ltd. &amp;

others developed the area, measuring about 1200 acres in an around 1988-89,

made un-cultivable land (Banjar Qadeem) into cultivable land of village Raisina,

means of letters dated 14.5.1991 (Annexure P4), 29.6.1993 (Annexure P9) and

(Annexures P19/A to P19/C). It was alleged that the land in question was depicted

as Gairmumkin Farm houses in the revenue record (Jamabandi/Khasra Girdawari

notification (Annexure P5) are not applicable. The Director, Town &amp; Country

through the medium of letter dated 15.4.1998 (Annexure P10), as per the terms &amp;

conditions of the sample agreement dated 18.5.2000 (Annexure P12). The State

Government did not constitute a legal/valid committee under the provisions of the

Act of 1986. It was alleged that the Regional Officer of the Pollution Board issued

show cause notices (Annexures P15 &amp; P18) to the Company, to which, it filed the

replies (Annexures P16 &amp; P19), alleging that it had consciously developed the area

without applying for and obtaining the prior required sanction and environment

the provisions of notification (Annexure P5) were not applicable to their case. The

Patwari and report dated 7.9.2005 (Annexure R5) of the Tehsildar, the land in

litigation was recorded as Gairmumkin Mountain (Pahad). According to the

the then Halqa Patwari, illegally changed the revenue record and entered in the

Khasra Girdawari, the kind of land as Gairmumkin Farm houses, instead of factual

position of Gairmumkin Mountain (Pahad), immediately, he (Collector) directed

all the circle revenue officials to correct the entries in the Khasra-Girdwari of

Arvali Mountain as Gairmukin Mountain (Pahad), by means of               order dated

also adopted the same line of arguments as submitted on behalf of the developers.

However, additionally, they have submitted that assuming for the sake of

arguments, the developers have violated the provisions and committed the offences

in question, even then, the subsequent vendees/transferees cannot be prosecuted as

they are bona fide purchasers. Hence, they have sought the quashment of the

impugned complaints &amp; summoning orders in this relevant direction.

been issued by the Tehsildar, Director, Town &amp; Country Planning and other

irrelevant authorities, which require a legal proof. So, the impugned complaints

and summoning orders cannot be quashed on the basis of such unproved letters at

claimed that as all the petitioners-accused have committed the indicated offences,

therefore, no ground for quashing the impugned complaints and summoning orders

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "16. Before addressing the contentions advanced on behalf of the parties, it will
      be useful to notice the scope and ambit of inherent powers of the High Court
      under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_21">Section 482</a> of the Code. The Section itself envisages three circumstances
      under which the inherent jurisdiction may be exercised, namely, (i) to give effect
      to an order under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_22"> the Code</a>; (ii) to prevent abuse of process of Court; and (iii) to
      otherwise secure the ends of justice. Nevertheless, it is neither possible nor
      desirable to lay down any inflexible rule which would govern the exercise of
      inherent jurisdiction of the Court. Undoubtedly, the power possessed by the High
      Court under the said provision is very wide but is not unlimited. It has to be
      exercised sparingly, carefully and cautiously, ex debito justitiae to do real and
      substantial justice for which alone the court exists. It needs little emphasis that
      the inherent jurisdiction does not confer an arbitrary power on the High Court to
      act according to whim or caprice. The power exists to prevent abuse of authority
      and not to produce injustice."

They have completely failed to comply with and contravened the provisions of the

CRM Nos. M-51514 of 2007 &amp; 880 of 2010 (alongwith connected petitions)

more than one reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_59">30.           At the first instance, it is not a matter of dispute that since the

provisions of PLPA and <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_42">Forest Act</a>s are applicable and the land in dispute was

recorded as Gairmumkin Mountain (Pahad), so, the provisions of the Act of 1986

and Notification (Annexure P5) were fully applicable at the relevant time in the

present cases. Secondly, there are direct allegations in paras 10 to 18 of the

impugned complaint (Annexure P20) that the petitioners-accused (developers)

have changed the nature of the Mountain (Pahad), after developing the area

allotted to various other persons and the entire exercise was done after the issuance

of notification (Annexure P5). The show cause notices (Annexures P15 &amp; P18)

were issued to them. The committee was constituted. The mere fact that there is

some irregularity in formation of the committee, will not advance the cause of

petitioners-accused to quash the criminal prosecution, as contrary urged on their

behalf. The committee examined the matter and came to the conclusion that the

developers have changed the nature of the disputed land and developed the

infrastructure for the cluster of 630 Farm houses, out of which 108 Farm houses

had been constructed and allotted in violation of the provisions of Aravali

Notification by laying the roads, water supply, electricity, berms, barbed wires,

fencing and separate gates etc. after the commencement of the notification

(Annexure P5). Even the electricity connections were obtained by the allottees

after the issuance of this notification.
</p>
<p id="p_60">31.           Therefore, all the essential ingredients of the indicated offences are

complete. Moreover, the Hon'ble Apex Court in case <a href="/doc/1335621/" id="a_43">Rajesh Bajaj vs. State NCT

of Delhi and others</a> (1999) 3 SCC 259 has held that "it is not necessary that a

should state in so many words that the intention of the accused was dishonest or

CRM Nos. M-51514 of 2007 &amp; 880 of 2010 (alongwith connected petitions)

fraudulent. Splitting up of the definition into different components of the offence

to make a meticulous scrutiny, whether all the ingredients have been precisely

spelled out in the complaint, is not the need at this stage."

</p><p id="p_61">32.           Above-all, <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_44">Section 19</a> of the Act of 1986 posits that "no court shall

take cognizance of any offence under this Act except on a complaint made by the

competent person mentioned therein." The word "complaint" has been defined

under <a href="/doc/255245/" id="a_45">section 2(d)</a> of Cr.PC to mean that any allegation made orally or in writing to

a Magistrate, with a view to his taking action under this Code, that some person,

whether known or unknown has committed an offence.
</p>
<p id="p_62">33.           Meaning thereby, the direct allegations are assigned to the

petitioners-accused in the complaint (Annexure P20) &amp; other complaints that they

have violated the provisions of the Act of 1986 and committed the pointed

offences after the commencement of the notification (Annexure P5). The solitary

fact that the developers have informed the Director, Town and Country Planning

and other irrelevant authorities under the different Acts, before the issuance of the

said notification, is not at all a cogent ground to quash the impugned complaints

and summoning orders, because they have not obtained any requisite prior

approval/sanction from the competent authority and violated the provisions of the

Act of 1986, for which, they have been prosecuted.
</p>
<p id="p_63">34.           Similarly, the next feeble argument of learned counsel that since the

land in question was described as Gairmumkin Farm houses in the revenue record,

so, the petitioners-accused did not commit any offence, again lacks merit. Again, it

is not a matter of dispute that the land in dispute situated in village Raisina was

depicted as Aravali Gairmumkin Mountain (Pahad) in the revenue record from the

very beginning. Concededly, the developers have got changed the kind of land

from Gairmumkin Mountain (Pahad) to Gairmumkin Farm houses. If any Patwari

without any legal authority had made the stray entries in the Khasra Girdawari
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                                    -20-</span>
CRM Nos. M-51514 of 2007 &amp; 880 of 2010 (alongwith connected petitions)

(Annexure P6/T colly) for some consideration and for the reasons best known to

him, which were illegal &amp; without any authority and further carried out in the

column of Jamabandi (Annexure P6/T colly) and Aksh Sizra (Annexure P21), then,

such stray and illegal entries are non est, void and are not sufficient to hold that the

land in litigation was Gairmumkin Farm houses. Such entries deserve to be

outrightly ignored and kind of land in dispute (Gairmumkin Mountain (Pahad))

would remain the same for all intents and purposes in this relevant behalf.

</p><p id="p_64">35.           As indicated earlier, as soon as, this mistake was noticed, the

Collector, vide its letter dated 23.2.2006 (Annexure R6) directed all the circle

revenue officials to correct the Girdawari of Aravali Mountain as Gairmumkin

Mountain (Pahad) as per the spot. Hence, the mere stray and illegal entries made

by a Patwari in the revenue record against the factual position, cannot possibly be

termed to be sufficient to hold that the land in question was not Gairmumkin

Mountain (Pahad). No implicit reliance can be placed on such void and non-est

entries. In this manner, the observations in the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court

in Re: Construction of Park At Noida Near Okhla Bird Sanctuary v. Anand Arya &amp;

Another with <a href="/doc/1725193/" id="a_46">T.N.Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. 2011(1)

SCC 744, relied on behalf of petitioners-accused, are not at all applicable to the

facts of the present cases.
</p>
<p id="p_65">36.           Likewise, there can hardly be any dispute that the Acts of 1963 &amp;

1975 operate altogether differently in their respective domain/fields. The purpose,

aims, object, scope, jurisdiction, area, manner of operation, ambit, action and

remedies of these Acts are entirely different and are not at all relatable in any

manner to the provisions of the Act of 1986 and the notification (Annexure P5).

Therefore, the letters (Annexures P2, P3, P9, P10 &amp; P12-A) written by the

Director, Town &amp; Country Planning, Executive Engineer, Electrical Inspectorate,

Haryana etc. under the different Acts and the alleged clarification made by the

particularly when     it   is   not yet clear/proved      that   they were    legally

competent/authorized to issue such clarification in this respect.

</p><p id="p_66">37.           As is clear that in case <a href="/doc/1467402/" id="a_47">Harshendra Kumar D. v. Rebatilata Koley and

others</a> (2011) 3 SCC 351, relied on behalf of the petitioners-accused, the

complainants (therein) were interested in business relationship with Rifa

Healthcare (India) Pvt. Ltd. for the sale of bio-ceramic products. The

complainants, for the orders they had placed, issued demand drafts in favour of the

Company. The company did not deliver the products ordered by the complainants

and accordingly they asked the Company for return of their money. Accordingly,

for and on behalf of the Company, in discharge of the existing liability, an account

payee cheque was issued but the cheque was returned by the complainant's banker

on presentation with the endorsement "insufficient funds". The complainant then

sent legal notice asking the accused persons to pay the amount of cheque within 15

days from the date of the receipt of the notice but despite service of notice, no

payment was made. Thereafter, they filed the complaint under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_48">Sections 138</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_49">141</a>

<p id="p_67">38.           The principal contention canvassed was that the appellant (therein)

was appointed as Director of the Company on 27.8.2003. He resigned from the

directorship on 2.3.2004, which was accepted by the Board of Directors on that

day itself with immediate effect. The factum of his resignation was also recorded

CRM Nos. M-51514 of 2007 &amp; 880 of 2010 (alongwith connected petitions)

much after his resignation. So, on the peculiar facts and in the special

circumstances of that case, it was observed by the Hon'ble Apex Court that "it is

fairly settled now that while exercising inherent jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_50">Section 482</a> or

revisional jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_51">Section 397</a> of the Code in a case where complaint is

sought to be quashed, it is not proper for the High Court to consider the defence of

the accused or embark upon an enquiry in respect of merits of the accusations.

However, in an appropriate case, if on the face of the documents, which are

beyond suspicion or doubt, placed by the accused, the accusations against him

cannot stand, then those documents can be considered for the purpose of quashing

the criminal prosecution."
</p>
<p id="p_68">39.           Possibly, no one can dispute with regard to the aforesaid

observations, but, to me, the same would not come to the rescue of the petitioners-

accused in the present controversy. In the instant case, the petitioners-accused have

not produced any such public document, which is per-se admissible in evidence

and sufficient to quash the criminal proceedings under the Act of 1986. As

discussed hereinabove, the letters, purported to have been written by the other

irrelevant authorities, which, otherwise, require a legal proof, are not at all relevant

to decide the instant controversy between the parties to quash the criminal

prosecution at this initial stage. All the documents brought on record by the

petitioners-accused are alien/foreign to the instant controversy between the parties

under the Act of 1986 in this relevant connection.

<p id="p_69">40.           As to whether the Pollution Board has filed the false complaints

against the petitioners-accused, whether the developers have demolished the

Gairmumkin Mountain (Pahad) and converted it into Gairmumkin Farm houses

the Acts of 1963 and 1975, <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_52">Forest Act</a> or the Additional Director (Environment)

would be the effects of such clearance under the other Acts on the commission of

of 10 kilometers, all other conditions of Notification (Annexure P5) have been

violated or not and all other arguments, relatable to the appreciation of evidence

(now sought to be urged on their behalf), would be the moot points to be decided

during the course of trial by the trial Court, after receiving the respective evidence

of the parties. In case, the admissibility, validity &amp; genuineness or otherwise of

these documents and other relatable facts, which require determination by the trial

Court, are to be decided by this Court in the garb of petitions under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_53">section 482</a>

Cr.PC, then the sanctity of the trial would pale into insignificance and amount to

nullify the statutory procedure of trial as contemplated under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_54"> the Code</a> of Criminal

Procedure, which is not legally permissible.

ordinarily embark upon an inquiry whether the evidence in question is reliable or

not or whether on a reasonable appreciation of it the accusation would not be

sustained. To put it clear, it is the function of the trial Judge to do so. The High

Court must be careful to see that its decision in exercise of its power is based on

sound principles. The inherent power should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate

prosecution."

another cosmetic submission that in case, it is proved that the developers have

subsequent vendees/transferees cannot be prosecuted in that regard, as they are

somewhat attractive, but when it was legally and deeply analyzed, then, I cannot

</p>
<p id="p_72">43.          As is apparent that <a href="/doc/1879701/" id="a_57">Section 2(n)</a> of Cr.PC defines the word "offence"

to mean that any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in

force. The offence/Acts done also extend to illegal omissions (under <a href="/doc/1498946/" id="a_58">section 32</a>

IPC). The act of omission and offence have been defined under <a href="/doc/1235517/" id="a_59">Sections 33</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/886402/" id="a_60">40</a>

of IPC. <a href="/doc/177872/" id="a_61">Section 35</a> of IPC postulates that "whenever an act, which is criminal only

by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or intention, is done by

several persons, each of such persons who joins in the act with such knowledge or

intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him

alone with that knowledge or intention." According to <a href="/doc/615115/" id="a_62">sections 36</a> to <a href="/doc/1138600/" id="a_63">38</a> of IPC,

wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an

act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that

effect partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence. When an

offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally co-operates

in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or

jointly with any other person, commits that offence and they may be guilty of

different offences by means of that act.
</p>
<p id="p_73">44.          That being the statutory/legal position, the bare reading of these

provisions would go to show that where the element of a particular knowledge or a

particular intention enters in the composition of a crime, all the co-accused are

liable for the same offence. It provides that where several persons are concerned in

committing an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a

criminal knowledge and whosoever assists in the commission of such offence,

each of such persons, who joins in the act with such knowledge is liable for the act

in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with that knowledge. In

that eventuality, the criminal law only concerns to the result of the commission of

liable in this relevant behalf.
</p>
<p id="p_74">45.           As indicated hereinabove, the subsequent vendees have purchased

the offence proned Farm houses from the developers, after the commencement of

Notification (Annexure P5). Not only that, after the purchase even they did not

comply with and contravened the provisions of the Act of 1986 and the Aravali

Notification as well with impunity. They even did not obtain the requisite

permission from the competent authority under the relevant Act till today. In this

manner, all the rights and liabilities were also transferred to them for all intents &amp;

purposes. The acts committed by the subsequent vendees/transferees are so

intermingled and mixed with the same series of the acts and transactions, of the

offences committed by the developers and since the acts of these petitioners,

culminating into the offences, are still continuing, so, their cases cannot possibly

be segregated from the criminal offences committed by the developers. Therefore,

they cannot escape the criminal liability in any manner and are liable to be legally

punished, as contemplated under <a href="/doc/177872/" id="a_64">Sections 35</a> to <a href="/doc/1138600/" id="a_65">38</a> of IPC as well.

summoning them, again is not tenable. The perusal of the summoning order

(Annexure P22) would reveal that while taking cognizance of the complaint, the

trial court has duly considered all the relevant documents/evidence and then came

to the definite conclusion that prima facie, the accused have committed the offence

          an extra work ? The time has reached to adopt all possible
          measures to expedite the Court procedures and to chalk out
          measures to avert all (sic) causing avoidable delays. If a
          Magistrate is to write detailed orders at different stages, the snail-
          paced progress of proceedings in trial Courts would further be
          slowed down. We are coming across interlocutory orders of
          Magistrates and Sessions Judges running into several pages. We
          can appreciate if such a detailed order has been passed for
          culminating the proceedings before them. But it is quite
          unnecessary to write detailed orders at other stages, such as
          issuing process, remanding the accused to custody, framing of
          charges, passing over to next stages of the trial."

Court in case <a href="/doc/633700/" id="a_73">Shivjee Singh v. Nagendra Tiwary &amp; Ors</a>. 2010(7) SCC 578,

wherein the view taken in case <a href="/doc/92423/" id="a_74">Mohinder Singh v. Gulwant Singh</a> 1992(2) RCR

(Criminal) 134 was reiterated and observed (paras 11 &amp; 12) as under:-

</p><p id="p_78">          "11. The scope of enquiry under <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_75">Section 202</a> is extremely restricted
   only to finding out the truth or otherwise of the allegations made in the
   complaint in order to determine whether process should issue or not under
   <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_76">Section 204</a> of the Code or whether the complaint should be dismissed by
   resorting to <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_77">Section 203</a> of the Code on the footing that there is no sufficient
   ground for proceeding on the basis of the statements of the complainant and
   of his witnesses, if any. But the enquiry at that stage does not partake the
   character of a full dress trial which can only take place after process is
   issued under <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_78">Section 204</a> of the Code calling upon the proposed accused to
   answer the accusation made against him for adjudging the guilt or
   otherwise of the said accused person. Further, the question whether the
   evidence is adequate for supporting the conviction can be determined only
   at the trial and not at the stage of the enquiry contemplated under <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_79">Section
   202</a> of the Code. To say in other words, during the course of the enquiry
   under <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_80">Section 202</a> of the Code, the enquiry officer has to satisfy himself
   simply on the evidence adduced by the prosecution whether prima facie
   case has been made out so as to put the proposed accused on a regular trial
   and that no detailed enquiry is called for during the course of such enquiry."
   (emphasis supplied)
</p><p id="p_79">          12. The use of the word `shall' in proviso to <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_81">Section 202(2)</a> is prima
   facie indicative of mandatory character of the provision contained therein,
   but a close and critical analysis thereof along with other provisions
   contained in Chapter XV and <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_82">Sections 226</a> and <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_83">227</a> and <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_84">Section 465</a> would
   clearly show that non examination on oath of any or some of the witnesses
   cited by the complainant is, by itself, not sufficient to denude the concerned
   Magistrate of the jurisdiction to pass an order for taking cognizance and
   issue of process provided he is satisfied that prima facie case is made out
   for doing so. Here it is significant to note that the word `all' appearing in
   proviso to <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_85">Section 202(2)</a> is qualified by the word `his'. This implies that the
   complainant is not bound to examine all the witnesses named in the
   complaint or whose names are disclosed in response to the order passed by
   the Magistrate. In other words, only those witnesses are required to be

      examined whom the complainant considers material to make out a prima
      facie case for issue of process. The choice being of the complainant, he may
      choose not to examine other witnesses. Consequence of such non-
      examination is to be considered at the trial and not at the stage of issuing
      process when the Magistrate is not required to enter into detailed
      discussions on the merits or demerits of the case, that is to say whether or
      not the allegations contained in the complaint, if proved, would ultimately
      end in conviction of the accused. He is only to see whether there exists
      sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused."

</p><p id="p_80">               Hence, no illegality or procedural irregularity can be assigned to the

impugned summoning order (Annexure P22) as well, in this relevant context, as

(contrary) urged on behalf of all the petitioners-accused.

</p><p id="p_81">49.            Therefore, if the non-compliance of constitutional mandate,

directions, contraventions of mandatory provisions of the Act of 1986,

Notification (Annexure P5) and the totality of the facts &amp; circumstances oozing

out, from the record, as discussed hereinabove, are put together, then, to me, the

conclusion is inescapable and irresistible that prima facie it stands proved on

record that all the petitioners-accused have committed the indicated offences. If the

petitioners-accused have not stopped the pointed violations, adversely affecting the

environmental atmosphere and the criminal prosecutions are quashed at this initial

stage, then it will inculcate and perpetuate injustice to the public at large in general

and to the case of complainant-Pollution Board in particular respectively. The

Bench mark and essential ingredients for quashing the criminal prosecution at the

initial stage set out in Ch.Bhajan Lal, Som Mittal and Jeffery J.Diermeier's cases

(supra) are totally lacking in these cases. Thus, the contrary arguments of learned

counsel for all the petitioners-accused "stricto sensu" deserve to be and are hereby

repelled under the present set of circumstances, as the ratio of law laid down in the

aforesaid judgments "mutatis mutandis" is applicable to the facts of the present

cases and is the complete answer to the problem in hand.
