                      representations received from the public as well as the political

                      parties      stating    that     the    petitioners      company    had    caused

                      report was called from the Tahsildar, Radhapuram and the report

                      reveals that public nuisance is caused by the injuries/hazardous

                      activities    detrimental        to    public   health    and   safety    and    the

                      ponds across the villages by using containers and due to which,

                      drinking water bores and soil are being hugely polluted and hence,

                      the   2nd   respondent   and   others   sent   representations   to   the

                      concerned authorities and after knowing the real fact, the 1st

                      respondent has passed the impugned order and prays for dismissal

                      installed the factory after getting permissions from various

                      statutory bodies to govern the functioning of the factories. It is not

                      denied on the side of the respondents.

                      the first respondent has power to pass a conditional order under

                      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Section 133</a> (1) (ii) <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_8">Cr.P.C</a> against a person to desist him from

                      carrying on certain industrial activities, but the conditional order

                      cannot be passed as interim order and the first respondent should

                      be given an opportunity to the person against whom, the order is

                      made to accept the conditional order or to object the order. In this

                      as laid in<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_9"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure and hence, the impugned

                      order passed by the first respondent is liable to be set aside.

                      totally three Fish Processing Units in the Irukkanthurai Village,

                      Radhapuram Taluk, Tirunelveli District and due to the illegal above

                      industries, air, soil and water of Irukkanthurai Village is being

                      polluted and air of the locality to the radius of 15 Kilometres from

                      the Village has been polluted and there is pungent smell is being

                      spread by the above said companies and hence, the second

                      respondent and others sent representations to the first respondent

                      and others and only after considering their representations and

                      after coming to know about the irregularities committed by the

                      above companies, the first respondent passed the above order in

                      Na.Ka.A1/12172/2018 dated 09.01.2019 and when the health issues

                      are imminent, the first respondent is having ample power under

                      <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">Section 133(1)(b)</a> of the Cr.P.C to prevent the parties, who are all

                      causing disturbance to the public and on that ground, the first

                      Cr.P.C and first respondent passed only interim orders and hence,

                      above revision is liable to be dismissed and therefore, the impugned

                      order passed by the first respondent is to be confirmed.



</p><p id="p_13">                                9.The main contention of the revision petitioners is that

                      first respondent passed the impugned order on 09.01.2019 without

                      giving reasonable opportunity and hence, the impugned order was

                      passed as against the principles of natural Justice and therefore, it

                      is liable to be set aside.
