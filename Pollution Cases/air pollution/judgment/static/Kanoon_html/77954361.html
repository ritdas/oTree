</pre><p id="p_1">              Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dalip Singh, Judicial Member


</p><p id="p_2"> 1. Originally this Letter Petition was filed before the Hon'ble High Court of

     Rajasthan at Jaipur Bench which came to be registered as Writ Petition No.

     11800/2011 and notices were issued vide order dated 12.09.2011.

     Subsequently, vide Order dated 23.09.2013 the Writ Petition was transferred

     to the NGT, Central Zone Bench, Bhopal.

</p><p id="p_4"> 2. In his letter the petitioner alleged that the contaminated water was being

   supplied in the locality of Lalji Sand Ka Rasta where the Applicant resides

   in the walled city of Jaipur. It was further alleged that water gets

   contaminated as drinking water pipelines and sewage pipelines are laid in

   close proximity to each other and they get cracked due to corrosion resulting

   in contamination. It was alleged that this is a regular feature and complaints

   have been made at various levels resulting no consequent actions. It was

   alleged that due to consumption of contaminated water people are falling

   sick and few deaths have also been reported.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3. The Hon'ble High Court after hearing the matter on 10.09.2012, issued a

   direction for collection of water samples at various places for a period of

   seven (7) days to verify the facts as alleged in the petition.

</p><p id="p_6">4. The Hon'ble High Court was apprised that the work of replacing the

   pipelines was being executed and therefore the Hon'ble High Court sought

   the progress report with respect to the same.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5. After the Writ Petition was transferred to this Tribunal the Learned Counsel

   for Respondents were directed to submit the replies indicating the steps they

   have taken for effective sewage management and disposal in the city of

   Jaipur.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6. In response to the above, the Learned Counsel for the Rajasthan State

   Pollution Control Board has submitted the status report indicating that 4

   Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) have been installed and all 4 STPs are in

   operation. The details of the same are as follows:

      i. One Sewage Treatment Plant has been installed at Amber Road, Jaipur,
         the capacity of which is 27 MLD.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
     ii. The second Sewage Treatment Plant has been installed at Delawas
         which is known as Delawa-I, the capacity of which is 62.5 MLD.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                         Page 2 of 6</span>
     iii. The third Sewage Treatment Plant has been installed at Delawas which
         is known as Delawas-II, with a capacity of 62.5 MLD.
    iv. The fourth Sewage Treatment Plant has been installed at Jaisinghpura
        Khor, Jaipur, with a capacity of 50 MLD.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">7. In addition to the above, it was further stated that the Jaipur Development

   Authority (JDA) has also installed 3 STPs which are in operation details of

   which are as follows: -
</p>
<p id="p_12">      i. One Sewage Treatment Plant has been installed at Jawahar Circle,
         Jaipur, with a capacity of 1 MLD.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
     ii. Second Sewage Treatment Plant has been installed at Ramniwas
         Garden, Jaipur, the capacity of which is 1 MLD.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
    iii. Third Sewage Treatment Plant has been installed at Gajodhar Pura,
         Jaipur, the capacity of which is 30 MLD.
</p>
<p id="p_15">    Apart from the above, it is further stated :
</p>
<p id="p_16">       "That the Jaipur Development Authority is also installing sewage
       treatment plant at Central Park, Jaipur, the capacity of the above
       Sewage Treatment Plant is 1 MLD.

       Jaipur Development Authority at Ralawata, Jaipur and their
       capacity is 30 MLD the plant is under construction, besides this 1
       MLD plant is also under construction at Swarn Jayati Park
       Vidhyadhar Nagar, Jaipur which is also being installed by the
       Jaipur Development Authority."
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">8. A perusal of the above shows that the Action Taken Report submitted on

   03.03.2014 does not enumerate how much quantity of sewage is actually

   generated within the territorial jurisdictions of the Jaipur Municipal

   Corporation and the Jaipur Development Authority respectively so as to

   arrive at a conclusion about the adequacy of these steps which have been

   taken.
</p>
<p id="p_20">9. Shri Shivendu Joshi, Learned Counsel submitted that he would get the

   necessary information and place the same before the Tribunal and in case it

   is found that the capacity of the STPs installed by Jaipur Municipal

    Corporation &amp; Jaipur Development Authority is insufficient, the Rajasthan

   State Pollution Control Board shall take steps including those of issuing

   necessary directions under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_1">section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act,

   1986 as well as under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_2">section 33</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of

   Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_21">10. The Learned Counsel for the State of Rajasthan Mr. Sandeep Singh has also

   filed a factual report indicating therein that the entire work of replacing the

   'pollution prone pipelines' has been completed in so far as city of Jaipur is

   concerned details for which are given in Annexure 4. With respect to the

   walled city area under phase-I 27.40 km, under phase-II 24.80 km and under

   phase-III 45.10 km. of pipelines have been replaced. It is however

   mentioned in the statement of work completion that against 68.57 km of

   pipeline only 12.60 km of pipeline could be replaced. Shri Sandeep Singh

   shall file an additional Affidavit as to what steps the authorities intend to

   take to achieve the aforesaid target of 68.57 km. or whether it has already

   been completed.
</p>
<p id="p_22">11.We also find that in the factual report submitted today along with affidavit of

   Mr. Dinesh Sharma, Additional Chief Engineer, Public Health Engineering

   Department, Region Jaipur-II it has been stated as follows: -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "For about 10 months, no complaint in this regard was received
        from the area. Complaints No. 3 to No. 8, listed by the petitioner
        are dated 18.05.2011 and addressed to various authorities about
        polluted water in the taps for last one month. In complaint No. 9 to
        18, dated 10.06.2011, the complainant has alleged supply of
        contaminated water and also that samples taken at the site are
        changed. These allegations are baseless. The Senior Chemist,
        PHED, vide report No. 8930 dated 08.11.2011, has found that the
        samples taken in this area in the period from 09.05.2011 to
        14.06.2011 were satisfactory, The amount of residual chlorine in
        samples varied from 0.8 ppm to 1.5 ppm. The samples were also
        found satisfactory in the bacteriological examination (Annexure-2).
        As per the list, the complaints No. 19 to No. 24, dated 03.07.2011,
        have been addressed to various authorities again regarding
        contaminated water. All the news items that have published in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                          Page 4 of 6</span>
          news papers in this regard have reference to Shri Munna Lal Saini
         or Navyuvak Vikas Samaj Samiti, Lalji Sand ka Rasta, Chaura
         Rasat, Jaipur.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">         The quality of water in Jaipur City is regularly monitored by the
         field staff as well as the PHED Laboratory. Water testing reports
         for the period from 06.07.2011 to 05.10.2011 (18 reports) are
         available at Annexure-3. The water quality has been found
         satisfactory in all the 18 reports of this period. The water quality is
         regularly monitored in the area. Apart from supply from Ram
         Niwas Bagh pumping Station, water is also supplied from local tube
         wells. A very small quantity of very fine sand is present in the water
         pumped from the tube wells. This fine sand may be deposited in the
         distribution pipelines. When water is supplied at high pressure
         during regular hours, some fine sand may be seen in the water. The
         department has not added any sand in the water pipeline as alleged
         by the complainant."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_23">12. A perusal of the above goes to show that the grievance raised by the

   Applicant has been addressed by the Respondents and it is further stated that

   during the preceding 10 months no complaint has been received.

</p><p id="p_24">13. It has also been stated in para 6 of the factual report that steps for prevention

   of contamination of water and monitoring of same as well as the remedial

   measures wherever necessary, are also being taken from time to time. The

   reports for testing the samples for water quality, as directed by the Hon'ble

   High Court, have been filed at Annexure 5 according to which no adversity

   has been noticed.
</p>
<p id="p_25">14. Since the Applicant has not appeared before us even once as also on several

   dates before the Hon'ble High Court and even the amicus curie appointed by

   the Hon'ble High Court was permitted to withdraw from the case, we have

   no material to counter what has been stated before us by the respondents.

</p><p id="p_26">15. In view of the above, we are satisfied that no further directions are needed

   to be issued with respect to grievances raised by the applicant at this stage.

</p><p id="p_27">16. The two reports submitted today by the Learned Counsel of the State of

   Rajasthan as well as by the Learned Counsel for the Rajasthan State

   Pollution Control Board are ordered to be taken on record.
