<p id="p_1">ORDER
 

 S.B. Sinha, CJ  
 

</p><p id="p_2"> 1. This writ petition was taken up 
as a Public Interest Litigation on the basis 
of a letter dated 16-9-2000 written by a 
practising advocate in Vijayawada 
City addressed to the Honourable 
Chief Justice of this Court regarding 
the noise pollution created in the City 
of Vijayawada by reason of the use of 
Air Horns at their pitch by A.P. State 
Road Transport Corporation buses, 
lorries etc. 
 

</p><p id="p_3"> 2. The fact that there exists 
noise pollution in the City of Vijayawada is 
not in dispute. An affidavit, affirmed by 
Sri. B. Sreenivas, Sub-Inspector of Police 
on behalf


of respondents 1, 4 and 10 was filed 
contending that organised special camps were 
held to curb noise pollution with the 
assistance of A.P. Pollution Control Board 
and in the month of January, 2001, 1241 
cases have been booked. All kinds of 
Gas Horns/pneumatic horns and multi-tone 
horns fitted to motor vehicles were banned 
by the Commissioner of Police on 8-1-
2001. It was further stated directions 
have also been issued to remove the gas 
horns fitted to all school buses and 3427 
noise pollution cases have been booked 
within a period of six months against 
the drivers of vehicles who violated the 
traffic rules. 
</p> 

<p id="p_4"> 3. However, the A.P. Pollution 
Control Board in their status report dated 
26-2-2001 admits of heavy noise 
pollution in Vijayawada city caused on 
account of using of air horns by APSRTC 
Buses, private tourist buses, lorries. It was 
pointed out that at junction points, 
turning of roads, the drivers blow horns 
at highest pitch as a result whereof, the 
traffic rules are violated, which result in 
causing accidents and noise problems. It 
was stated that noise values observed in 
Vijayawada city at all the three places viz., 
Industrial, Commercial and residential 
areas have exceeded the normal values of 
noise levels fixed by the Central Pollution 
Control Board. The values of noise levels 
recorded at the above three places from 
29-1-2001 to 10th February, 2001 are 
stated to be as under:

Vehicles Act, 1988 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_10">(Central Act</a> 59 of 
1988) made Rules known as Andhra 
Pradesh Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. Rule 
427 of the said Rules which deals with 
sound signals and restrictions on the 
whereof reads thus: 
</p><p id="p_31">  Sound signals - 
</p><p id="p_32">Restrictions on use of:--No driver of a 
motor vehicle shall sound the horn or 
other device for giving audible 
warning, with which the motor 
vehicle is equipped, or shall cause 
or allow any other person to do so, to 
an extent beyond that which is 
reasonable necessary to ensure 
safety. 
</p> 

<p id="p_33"> 10. Rule 428 of A.P. Motor 
Vehicles Rules, 1989 empowers the 
authority to issue notification to prohibit 
sound signals in the following terms: 
</p>  

<p id="p_34"> The Commissioner of 
Police in the Cities of Hyderabad and 
Secunderabad and elsewhere the 
Collector may, by notification in the 
Official Gazette and by the erection 
in suitable places of appropriate 
traffic signs prescribed under the 
Act, prohibit the use of any horn, 
gong or other device on a motor 
vehicle for giving suitable warning 
within such locality and during such 
hours as may be specified in the 
notification : 
</p> 

<p id="p_35"> Provided that when the 
Commissioner of Police or the 
Collector as the case may be, prohibits 
the use of any horn, gong or other 
device for giving audible warning during 
certain specified hours, he shall cause 
a suitable notice in English and in the 
script of the city or district, setting 
forth the hours within which such use 
is so prohibited to be affixed below 
the traffic sign. 
</p> 

<p id="p_36"> 11. Rule 119 of the V Central 
Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 reads 
thus: 
</p>

  

<p id="p_37"> Horns: (A) Every 
motor vehicle shall befitted with an 
electric horn or other device 
(conforming to the specifications of the 
Bureau of Indian Standards) for use 
by the driver of the vehicle and 
capable of giving audience and sufficient 
wanting of the approach or position of 
the vehicle. 
</p> 

<p id="p_38"> (B) No motor vehicle shall 
befitted with any multi-toned horn 
giving a succession of different notes 
or with any other sound producing 
device giving an unduly harsh, shrill, 
loud or alarming noise. 
</p> 

<p id="p_39"> (C) Nothing contained in sub-
rule (2) shall prevent the use in 
vehicles used as ambulance or for fire 
fighting of salvage purposes or a 
vehicle used by police officers or 
officers of Motor Vehicles 
Department in the course of their duties, 
of such sound signals as may be approved 
by the registering authority in whose 
jurisdiction such vehicles are 
kept. 
</p> 

<p id="p_40"> 12. There exists difference 
between sound as part of nature and sound 
generated by electrical and electronic 
devices being the contribution of 
modern science. Although from the 
inception of the civilisaiton sound is 
part of the nature, but unwanted noise 
created from the sources like 
loudspeakers, air horns fitted to motor 
vehicles, playing of music records etc., 
is not desirable. 
</p> 

<p id="p_41"> 13. The effect of noise pollution 
is a matter of great concern to the 
mankind. Noise not only causes annoyance 
to mankind outside his home but also 
invades his home. Noise pollution has been 
brought within the purview of Air 
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) 
Act</a>, 1981 as amended by Act No.47 of 
1987 which came into force with effect 
from 1-4-1988. It is now established that 
noise is a form of environmental 
degradation and it has serious implication 
on health which can change man's


psychological state by speeding up pulse 
and respiratory rates. It also impair hearing 
either permanently or temporarily. Millions 
of industrial workers are threatened with 
hearing damage. Medical evidence shows 
that it can cause heart attacks in individual 
with existing cardiac injury and that 
continued exposure to loud noise is likely 
to cause chronic effects such as hyper-
tension or ulcer. Noise also causes both 
injury and nuisance and alarming noise 
causes disturbance and distraction to the 
students who are not able to concentrate 
fully due to irritation caused by such devices. 
It is also causing adverse effect on infants, 
sick and elderly persons. 
</p> 

<p id="p_42"> 14. W.S. Gilbert in 'The Grand 
Duke' stated: 
</p>  

<p id="p_43"> When you have 
got a beehive in your head, 
 

 And a sewing machine in each 
ear, 
 

 And you feel like you have eaten 
your bed, 
 

 And you have got a bad headache 
down here. 
</p> 

<p id="p_44"> 15. Noise is also created by 
traffic and it also causes disturbed sleep. 
The citizens have right to sleep peacefully 
and also a right to a decent environment 
as highlighted by the Supreme Court in 
various decisions which are all well 
known in the field of pollution. In view of 
the enormous increase in number of motor 
vehicles of all types every year, the 
menace of noise pollution is posing 
problems, to the mankind. The effect of bad 
right sleep as highlighted by an eminent 
scientist in the field Fiona Goolee in his 
article in British medical journal, in 
which it was stated that noise can have 
positive effects on health. The effect of 
bad night sleep includes mood change, 
reduce cardiovascular performance and 
poor performance at intellectual and 
mechanical tasks and it was further


observed in a recent review of research 
into noise and sleep recommends that 
sound at night in sleeping quarters should 
not exceed 45 DB (A). It was held that 
noise also adversely affects behaviour, 
increasing anxiety and reducing the 
incidence of helpful behaviour. Levels of 
aggression are increased by loud noise, 
an effect which may persist outside the 
noisy environment. Steel workers have 
more domestic disputes if they work in 
noisy areas. Noise is unacceptable not 
only to human beings but also to animals. 
There cannot be any doubt that 
tremendous sound beyond permissible 
limits is anti-thesis of civilised order. The 
effect of noise even on the domesticated 
animals like pet dogs in a common 
man's knowledge. 
</p> 

<p id="p_45"> 16. So far as noise pollution 
caused by the use of air horns is 
concerned, as indicated hereinbefore, 
the same is fully covered by the A.P. 
Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 and the 
Central Motor Vehicles Rules.

of Central Motor Vehicles Rules, it was 
held that apart from the fact that use of 
electric or air horn is not permissible in 
public vehicle, the air and electric horn 
produces or causes unduly rash, shrills, 
loud and alarming noise. It was also 
found that research conducted jointly 
by Basu Bignan Mandir and Presidency 
College, Calcutta showed that the 
atmosphere and the environment in the 
city of Calcutta and its suburbans was 
very much polluted from discriminating 
noise emitted from different quarters. It 
was held: 
</p><p id="p_47">  It is also desirable in 
the larger public interest that the 
respondents and the State 
Government and the authorities


should take suitable measures to 
implement the provision of Rule 
114(d) of the Motor Vehicles Rules, 
1940 and no certificate of fitness 
should be granted under <a href="/doc/1266268/" id="a_13">Section 38</a> 
of the said Act, in case of non-
compliance of the provisions of Rule 
114(d) of the said Rules so that this 
type of noise pollution is eradicated at 
any early date from the State of West 
Bengal.

<p id="p_48"> 18. Yet again in Nayan Bchari 
Dass v. State of Orissa (Original 
Jurisdiction Case No. 3481 of 1992), 
a Division Bench of the Orissa High 
Court dealing with <a href="/doc/201266/" id="a_14">Section 119</a> of the 
Central Motor Vehicles Rules held: 
   It cannot be denied that 
constant use of such devices 
producing unduly harsh, shrill, loud or 
alarming noise is bound to cause 
disturbance and distraction to the 
students who are notable to concentrate 
fully due to irritation caused by such 
devices. It is also causing adverse effect 
on infants, sick and elderly persons. 
Audio generally causing inconvenience 
as persons like the petitioner are not able 
to concentrate on their work because of 
constant sound pollution. Thus it is an 
addition to the already exiting should 
pollution and appropriate steps are 
required to be taken for controlling the 
same. But, as the use of such type of 
horns is not permitted by the rules the 
question of issuing any direction 
prohibiting such use does not arise. 
However, we consider it to be a fit case 
in which some directions are to be issued. 
Accordingly, we fell that it would be 
appropriate, if at regular intervals 
announcement is made through the 
medium of All India Radio and 
Doordarshan and the Press that the use 
of multi-toned horns or such other devices 
creating unduly harsh, shrill, loud or 
alarming noise is prohibited. It will be 
advisable if notices are exhibited at the


bus stops and at the RTO Offices 
regarding the prohibition on the use 
of multi-toned horns and similar 
devices. The authorities may also 
consider printing of a warning of 
affixing of a rubber stamp on all 
application forms required for fitness 
certificates, permits and in the 
registration books, that the use of multi-
toned horns and other similar devices 
creating unduly harsh, shrill, loud or 
alarming sounds is prohibited under the 
Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. 
But all this would not be sufficient 
unless follow up is taken by the 
appropriate authorities against those 
committing the breach.

<p id="p_49"> 19. The averments made in the 
counter- 
</p><p id="p_50">affidavit filed by the respondents and the 
status report filed by the A.P. Pollution 
Control Board clearly depict that there 
exits 
sound pollution in the City of Vijayawada 
caused due to noise generated from motor 
vehicles and air horns etc., fitted to them. It 
also stands admitted that despite taken action 
in this regard, the ambient Air Quality 
Standards in respect of noise fixed by the 
Central Pollution Control Board in terms of 
the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) 
Rules, 2000 as also the directives issued 
by 
the Commissioner of Police had not produced 
the desired results.  
</p> 

<p id="p_51"> 20. The Commissioner of 
Police, Vijayawada city, therefore, 
must take appropriate action not only for 
the purpose of enforcement of the said 
rules but also for implementation of the 
guidelines issued by the A.P. Pollution 
Control Board and furthermore shall take 
appropriate action in accordance with 
Rules 427 and 428 of A.P. Motor Vehicles 
Rules, 1989, to prohibit the use of air 
horns and see that the directives issued in 
this regard from time to time are complied 
with scrupulously. Announcements should 
be made at regular intervals through the 
electronic media, press as regards the 
prohibition of the use of multi-toned 
horns


or such other devices creating unduly harsh, 
shrill, loud or alarming noise. The authority 
should also issue appropriate directions 
regarding printing of a warning or affixing 
of a rubber stamp on all application forms 
required for fitness certificates, permits and 
in the registration books to the effect that 
the use of such horns and other similar 
devices creating unduly harsh, shrill, loud 
or alarming sounds is prohibited under the 
rules.

Government of Andhra Pradesh, Secretary, 
Transport Department, Commissioner 
of Transport, Director-General and 
Inspector General of Police, for taking

of the above order.
