                                 JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.    These four appeals were clubbed together for common hearing and
      decision in as much as they are interlinked. They are being disposed of by
      common Judgment in order to avoid repetition of facts and overlapping
      consideration of the documents filed by the parties.
</p><p id="p_2"> 2.   Appellant No. 1 M/s Hubtown Ltd. was previously styled as "Akruti City
     Ltd."     The Appellant No. 1 is developer and deals in construction
     activities. The Appellant No. 1, admittedly, undertook construction of
     buildings for Maya Nagar Cooperative Housing Society Ltd. and
     Durgamata Cooperative Housing Society Ltd. There is no dispute about
     the fact that both the housing societies are formed by slum dwellers. The
     rehabilitation project of slum dwellers was to be implemented by the
     Housing Societies formed by the slum dwellers. There is no dispute about
     the fact that one of such project is contemplated to be executed on a plot
     at Worli (Survey No. 32 Pt) and 38(Pt) admeasuring 5665 sq.meters and
     another at Bandra (CTS No. B-908, B-909, B-910 &amp; B-911 (part)
     admeasuring 15,295 sq.mtrs. There is no dispute about the fact that
     certain slum dwellers having their hutments on the subject plots were
     censused in/or about 1976. The State Government issued photo passes
     to them. It appears that the plots in question were already occupied by
     the slum dwellers prior to 19.2.1991.
</p>


<p id="p_3">3.   On 19.2.1991 a Notification was issued by the Ministry of Environment &amp;
     Forests (MoEF). Under the said notification, classification was made in
     respect of Coastal Area for the purpose of Development Regulations. By
     the said classification, Category-II CRZ (III) was declared to consist of the
     area which had already been developed up to limit of the shore land. The
     expression "developed area" was purported to mean the area within the
     Municipal Limits or in other designated urban area which was already
     substantially build up and which had been provided with drainage and
     project roads and other infrastructural facilities, such as water supply and
     Sewerage. Category-III (CRZ-III) was declared to consist of the areas
     within the Municipal Limits or other designated area, which were not
     substantially build up, and had been neglected. The development or
     construction activities in such areas was regulated by virtue of the said
     notification. On 27.9.1996 Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) for the
      State of Maharashtra was approved by the MoEF as per the general
     conditions. In the order of approval, it has been mentioned that the Parks,
     Playgrounds, Regional Parks, General Green zones and other non-
     buildable areas, which are in the category "CRZ-II", shall be treated as
     "CRZ-III." Thus, by fiction the non- buildable areas as well as the parks
     ground general areas etc. were shifted from Category-II (CRZ-II) areas to
     category-III (CRZ-III) areas.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.   Slum Rehabilitation Authority ("SRA") issued Letter Of Intent (LOI) to the
     appellants for grant of approval to the proposed redevelopment of the
     subject plots. The slum dwellers were permitted to be rehabilitated in the
     new buildings proposed to be constructed on the plots in question. On
     4.1.2002, Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management (MCZMA) was
     requested to grant clearance for construction of the buildings over the
     subject plots for the rehabilitation of slum dwellers. Slum Development
     Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) issued amended Letter Of Intent (LOI) on
     30th October, 2004. It appears that the appellants submitted an
     application to the MoEF for grant of clearance to their projects under the
     Environment Impact Assessment Notification. The appellant submitted
     proposals to MCZMA for no objection certificate.             The MCZMA
     recommend for approval to proposals of the appellants on 14.5.2009.
     The MCZMA forwarded the recommendations to the Director, Coastal
     Zone Regulation, MoEF along with the proposals submitted by the
     appellants. The MoEF did not give approval to the proposals in view of
     the CRZ Notification of 1991, on the ground that these subject plots were
     reserved for "garden" and therefore reclassification of the plots from
     Category-II (CRZ-II) to Category CRZ -III could not be approved. The
     appellants preferred an appeal to NCZMA (National Coastal Zone
     Management Authority). The appeals were not decided by the NCZMA
     and therefore the appellants filed two writ petitions in the High Court of
     Bombay, bearing Writ Petition No. 930 of 2011 and Writ Petition No. 931
     of 2011. The High Court of Bombay disposed of both the Writ Petitions
     on 17.8.2011, directing the NCZMA to decide representation of the
      appellants though the appeals were not maintainable under the law. The
     appellants were granted leave to make supplementary representations
     and additional submissions before the NCZMA. They accordingly filed
     fresh representations to the NCZMA. The NCZMA eventually declined to
     accord permission for both the projects. The said orders of the NCZMA
     are subject matter of challenge in Appeal No. 13/2012 and Appeal No.
     14/2012 which were taken in its 23rd meeting of 04.01.2012 on the above
     subject, which was Item No. 4 on agenda of the meeting of the NCZMA.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.   The NCZMA held that although the subject plots were being used by the
     slum dwellers even prior to 1976, due to reservation of the plots as per
     the development plan under CRZ Notification, 1991, because those plots
     were reserved for "garden" and therefore the request of the appellants
     for reclassification of CRZ areas from CRZ-III to CRZ-II cannot be
     considered Still, however, the NCZMA observed that since scheme is for
     slum improvement, the MCZMA to consider such issues in the CZMP to be
     prepared under CRZ Notification, 2011 to protect the socially important
     project.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     In other words, the NCZMA asked the MCZMA to place the proposals in
     the subsequent plan of CZMP as would be required under the CRZ
     Notification of 2011. It clearly appears that the NCZMA came to the
     conclusion that it was necessary to prevent the hurdles for such "socially
     important projects".
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.   Feeling aggrieved by the decision taken by the NCZMA in its 23rd meeting
     of 04.01.2012 declining to approve the projects as stated above, the
     two(2) appeals (Appeal No. 13/2012 and 14/2012) have been preferred by
     the appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     The other two appeals (Appeal No. 19/2012 and Appeal No. 20/2012) are
     between the same parties and the issues involved are also the similar. In
     those two appeals the appellants have challenged letters dated 31.8.2009
     and dated 16.2.2010 issued by the MoEF whereby the projects were not
      approved. The MoEF asked the NCZMA to refrain itself from making
     references of such cases which were not in accordance with CRZ
     Notification, 1991.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.   In all the four appeals, the appellants have filed delay condonation
     applications. We propose to deal with the delay condonation applications
     in Appeal No. 19/2012 and Appeal No. 20/2012 at the outset. Thereafter
     we propose to deal with the other two applications for delay condonation
     and merits of the appeals (Appeal No. 13/2012 and Appeal No. 14/2012).
</p>
<p id="p_10">8.   We have heard Learned Counsel for the parties. We have carefully
     perused the relevant documents and pleadings of the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.   On behalf of the appellants, Learned Senior Counsel Dr. Abhishek Manu
     Singhvi and Mr. P.S. Narsimha contended that the Appeal Nos. 19 &amp; 20 of
     2012 are not barred by limitation because the appellants were litigating
     before the NCZMA and the High Court of Bombay during the relevant
     period as well as awaiting final outcome of representation presented to
     the NCZMA in pursuance to order of the High Court of Bombay. They
     submitted that the appellants were bonafidely litigating before the
     authorities and the High Court of Bombay, challenging the order dated
     31st August, 2009 rendered by the MoEF and therefore the time spent by
     them should be excluded from consideration. They submitted that
     exclusion of the time is required to be made in order to meet ends of
     justice because of continuity of the legal process. We find it difficult to
     countenance the arguments of Learned Senior Counsel of the appellants.
     It is pertinent to note that <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_1">Section 16</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act
     prescribes limitation of 30 days for filing of an appeal. A further period of
     60 days is available on the appellant's furnishing sufficient explanation for
     the delay. Thus a total of 90 days prescribed period of limitation is
     envisaged under <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_2">Section 16</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act. Perusal of
     the order dated 17th August, 2011 passed by the High Court of Bombay, in
     Writ Petition No. 930/2011 and Writ Petition No. 946/2011, makes it
     amply clear that the appeals filed by the appellants before the Chairman,
    NCZMA were not maintainable and therefore the MoEF was called upon
    to decide representation of the appellants within period of 2 months. It is
    explicit, therefore, that the appellants had approached wrong forum
    when they preferred appeals before the Chairman, NCZMA. Once it is
    found that by order dated 17th August, 2011, the High Court held that the
    appeals before the NCZMA were not maintainable, the appellants ought
    to have promptly preferred appeals under <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_3">Section 16</a> of the National
    Green Tribunal Act. The orders dated 31.8.2009 and 16.2.2010 are the
    subject matter of Appeal Nos. 19/2012 and Appeal No.20/2012. Perusal
    of <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_4">Section 16</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act will make it clear that
    only the orders passed after 18.10.2010 are susceptible to appeal. The
    orders passed prior to 18.10.2010 cannot be challenged before NGT by
    way of appeal. Needless to say, those orders dated 31.8.2009 and
    16.2.2010 could not have been challenged by appellants before the NGT.
    Consequently, both the Appeal Nos. 19/2012 and 20/2012 are not
    maintainable at all. Nor the delay caused in filing of those appeals can be
    condoned. It may be stated such a view has already been taken by this
    Tribunal in a similar matter while deciding Appeal No. 14/2012 ( Thervoy
    Gramam Munnetra Nala Sangam Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors.). Adopting the
    same reasons, we hold that the Appeal No. 19/2012 and Appeal No.
    20/2012 are covered by the Judgment dated 26th April, 2012 rendered by
    this Tribunal in Appeal No. 14/2012. Hence both these appeals are
    dismissed as not maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_12">10. Coming to the delay condonation applications in other two appeals
    (Appeal No. 13/2012 and Appeal No. 14/2012), it may be gathered that
    the impugned decision taken by the NCZMA in its 23rd meeting of
    04.01.2012 was not communicated to the appellants. They were not
    given any intimation about the adverse decision. What transpires from
    the record is that the appellants gathered knowledge of the impugned
    decision after downloading the information from the internet. The
    version of the appellants that they learnt about the impugned decisions,
     at belated stage is acceptable. The appellants were not to gain anything
    by committing the delay. The delay appears to be unintentional. We are
    inclined, therefore, to accept their explanation and condone the delay.
    The delay condonation applications in both the above appeals are
    accordingly allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">11. Ms. Neelam Rathore, Learned Counsel appearing for MoEF, would submit
    that neither appeal is maintainable. She would submit that the impugned
    decisions are not an appealable orders. She pointed out that the
    impugned decisions were outcome of the minutes of meeting held on
    4.1.2012.

    objection raised in this behalf is therefore rejected.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">13. Perusal of the impugned orders show that proposals of the projects were
    rejected only on a ground that site in question was shown as garden in
    the development plan and was governed by CRZ Notification, 1991. It
    appears that the MoEF declined to consider the proposals on the ground
    that it would mean to allow reclassification of the subject plots from CRZ
    Category III to CRZ Category II. It is stated in the impugned orders that
    the remarks of the Urban Development Department, Government of
    Maharashtra indicated that the parks and play grounds and other non-
    buildable areas falling within CRZ-II Category have been categorised as
    CRZ-III. That appears to be main reason assigned by the MoEF in the
    impugned decisions.
</p>
<p id="p_16">14. A close scrutiny of the record shows that there was no existence of
    garden or park on the subject plots since much prior to 1991. It is an
    admitted fact that the area is covered by hutments. It is a fact that a large
    group of hutment dwellers falls under the census carried out by the
    Government agency in or about 1976. In other words, the subject plots
    were treated as gardens/parks only because of the Coastal Regulations
    Zone Notification, 1991.
</p>
<p id="p_17">15. The question that needs to be addressed is whether the plots already
    covered by the slums could be treated as reserved gardens/parks. Such a
    reservation is assumed by giving "deeming effect" on account of issuance
    of the CRZ Notification, 1991. Needless to say, what did not exist, in
    reality, is assumed to be in existence by virtue of the CRZ Notification,
     1991 with retrospective effect. In our opinion, legal fiction may give
    deeming effect to the proposition or thing which does not exist as on the
    date of regulation or Law. However, no deeming effect can be given to
    assume non existence of thing to be an existing thing with retrospective
    effect. Such an interpretation may create analomous position. For
    example, where a building is constructed and stands and the same was
    constructed by obtaining necessary permission as per the Law, which was
    inforce at the time of such construction, by subsequent executive
    Instructions or Regulations, the existence of such a building cannot be
    made to "disappear" by legal fiction. We mean to say that subsequent
    executive Instructions or Regulations cannot be interpreted so as to make
    the same unworkable and impracticable. There is no magic wand under
    the CRZ Notification, 1991 to make disappear such slums which already
    existed since long before issuance of the CRZ Notification, 1991.
</p>
<p id="p_18">16. This takes us to subsequent Notification dated 3.6.1992 issued by the
    Urban Development Department, State of Maharashtra, under Section
    31(1) of the MRTP Act, the said Notification recognised the fact that the
    slums were in existence in the areas which were not designated as
    residential areas. This subsequent notification of the Urban Development
    Department dated 3.6.1992 appears to have been ignored by the NCZMA.
    The NCZMA did not consider whether both the subject plots are fully
    seaward or partly seaward or totally landward. In case, a part of the
    proposed project falls within no-go zone, then the same has to be
    identified and segregated for the purpose of consideration. In our
    opinion, the NCZMA (MoEF) appears to have given no much tangible
    reasons in support of the impugned decisions. The communications
    served by the MoEF which are challenged in the present appeals are
    therefore passed by rendering non-speaking orders. Thus, both the
    impugned decisions are contrary to the principles of natural justice. It is
    well -settled that non-speaking order is one of the category which violates
    the principles of natural justice.
</p><p id="p_19"> 17. The learned Counsel for the appellants invited our attention to certain
    observations in "Suresh Estates Private Limited and Ors. Vs. Municipal
    Corporation of Greater Mumbai and Ors." (2007) 14 SCC 439. The Apex
    Court observed:
</p>
<p id="p_20">     19. "The word "existing" as employed in the CRZ Notification means
         the town and country planning regulations in force as on
         19.2.1991. If it had been the intention that the town and
         country planning regulations as in force on the date of the grant
         of permission for building would apply to the building activity, it
         would have been so specified. It is well to remember that CRZ
         notification refers also to structures which were in existence on
         the date of the notification. What is stressed by the notification
         is that irrespective of what local town and country planning
         regulations may provide in future the building activity permitted
         under the notification shall be frozen to the laws and norms
         existing on the date of the notification".
</p>
<p id="p_21">         xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

</p><p id="p_22">     30. "The contention that even if it is assumed that the appellants are
        entitled to higher FSI, they cannot use the plot in question for
        construction of a hotel as the land was reserved for public
        purpose on the date when CRZ notification was issued, cannot be
        accepted. As noticed earlier the plot was reserved as playground
        for secondary school as well as for primary school and also for
        DP Road. The appellants had caused the purchase notice dated
        16.6.2005 served to the competent authority under Section 127
        of the MRTP Act, 1966".
</p>
<p id="p_23">    In the above case, the Apex Court further held that a statute confers a
    discretionary power to be exercised by Competent Authority, the Court
    cannot direct the competent authority to exercise discretion in a
    particular manner. The Court can always direct competent authority to
    exercise discretion wasted in it in accordance with Law.
</p><p id="p_24"> 18. Considering the legal, and factual position, we are of the opinion that the
    NCZMA and MoEF ought to have properly exercised the discretion by
    harmonious interpretation of CRZ Notification, 1991 and subsequent
    Notification, 1992 as well as the purpose of classification under the CRZ
    Notification, 1991. In view of the discussion made above, we are of the
    opinion that the impugned decisions are required to be interfered with.
</p>
<p id="p_25">19. For the reasons discussed herein above, we partly allow both the appeals
    (Appeal Nos. 13 and 14 of 2012) and direct the MoEF to restore the earlier
    representation of the appellants and to take a fresh decision in the light of
    observations made above. It is made clear that we have not given any
    finding on merits of the matter and it will be within discretion of the
    competent authority to take any decision which will be backed by
    reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_26">    The other two appeals (Appeal Nos. 19 and 20 of 2012) are dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_27">    No costs in either appeal.</p><pre id="pre_2">
