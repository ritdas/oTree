                  DECLARED ON : SEPTEMBER 23, 2019


 JUDGMENT [PER PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, CJ.] :
</p>
<p id="p_2"> 1.               The villages of Mahul and Ambapada, in distinction to the
 densely populated regions of the main city, were hitherto sparsely
 populated regions, home to only a few local fishing communities and
 thick mangrove forests. In the 1950s, the State-owned refineries now
 present in the region were first established in Mahul, with a view to
 gainfully make use of these lands with negligible population. Over the
 post few decades, the region has become home to 9 major industrial
 units, including refineries of the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation
 Limited ("HPCL"), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited ("BPCL"),

 Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd., the Bhabha Atomic Research
 Centre ("BARC") as well as private industrial units such as the Tata
 Power Thermal Power Plant, Sealord Containers and Aegis Logistics.
</p>

<p id="p_3"> 2.               In Writ Petitions (L) No. 874/2018 and (L) No.
 3314/2017, the Petitioners have challenged the allotment of tenements
 reserved for Project Affected Persons ("PAP") to them in a PAP colony
 by the name of Eversmile Layout, developed by a private builder
 named Dynamix reality in Mahul, Chembur. The Petitioners in Writ
 Petition (L) No. 874/2018 have already been relocated to the PAP
 colony known as the Eversmile Complex in Mahul, Chembur. The
 Petitioners in Writ Petition (L) No. 3314/2017, have received notices
 allotting them tenements in Mahul, Chembur, but have not yet been
 evicted from their existing structures. The present Petitioners were
 declared to be PAPs due to the Tansa Pipeline Project, which resulted in
 the dwelling unit/slum located within 10 meters of the Tansa Pipeline
 in Mumbai city being demolished in pursuance of the order dated
 14.10.2009 of this Court in PIL No. 140/2006.
</p>

<p id="p_4"> 3.               The Eversmile PAP colony is located upon land originally
 demarcated to be a No-Development Zone in the Draft Development
 Plan of 1984. These lands had been acquired by the State Government
 on account of being surplus under the <a href="/doc/1005850/" id="a_4">Urban Land Ceiling Act</a>, 1976,

 Government for the construction of residential quarters for the staff of
 BPCL.         Accordingly, the zoning of the land was altered in the
 Development Plan of the city to allow residential constructions.
 However, BPCL ultimately chose not to construct its staff quarters on
 the site where the PAP colony presently lies, eventually resulting in the
 State Government modifying its order of exemption under <a href="/doc/1314450/" id="a_6">Section 20</a>

 the HPCL refinery.            With the exception of the PAP colonies the
 Respondent State Authorities have been constructing in the region over
 the past two decades, there is limited presence of residential buildings
 and premises within this area of Mahul. In fact, the Supreme Court
 and this Court have passed orders, at the behest of the refineries of the
 region, estopping the development of private residential buildings in
 this industrial belt.

<p id="p_6"> 5.               The location of the Eversmile Colony posits three issues
 that render the Colony uninhabitable, as per the Petitioners in Writ
 Petitions (L) No. 874/2018 and (L) No. 3314/2017. The first is that
 the proximity of the refineries to the PAP colony has resulted in those
 Petitioners who have been rehabilitated to the colony to suffer from
 severe health issues due to their exposure to high levels of carcinogenic
 air pollution. The second, is that the presence of residential premises
 such in close proximity of industrial belts poses a threat to the security
 of the industries and refineries, as well as to the safety of the residents
 themselves. Thirdly, the Petitioners in Writ Petition (L) No. 874/2018
 and (L) No. 3314/207 have also contended that the PAP colony is
 bereft of hygienic conditions and basic amenities, including schools and
 medical centres.

 foundation of the Petitioners' arguments about the toxic air pollution

 pollution on their health. The litigants before the National Green
 Tribunal are not PAPs rehabilitated in Mahul, but instead had been
 residing in Mahul, close to the site of the PAP colony, for several
 decades. The Tribunal examined reports prepared by KEM Hospital,
 Parel, which suggested that the respiratory morbidity of people residing
 in Ambapada, Mahul Gaon and 4 other areas within Chembur have
 significantly enhanced due to their proximity to heavily polluting
 industries.        At paragraph 25 of its judgment, the National Green
 Tribunal held that there is a perceptible threat to the health of the
 residents of villages Mahul and Ambapada due to prevailing air quality
 in the area. It is noteworthy that at paragraph 30 of the said judgment,
 Sealord Containers along with BPCL and HPCL refineries were
 identified by the National Green Tribunal to be the primary pollutants

 directions of the Tribunal, the State of Maharashtra belatedly filed Writ
 Petition No. 14102/2018, to challenge the portions of the judgment of
 the National Green Tribunal in 2018, 3 years after it was passed.
</p>

<p id="p_10"> 8.               A perusal of the pleadings of the State of Maharashtra in
 Writ Petition No. 14102/2018 reveals that the State Government was
 inclined to challenge the findings of the Tribunal at paragraph 25 of
 the judgment, as the said paragraph, quoted below, proved to be an
 "impediment" in the implementation of orders of this Court in PIL No.
 140/2006.
</p>

<p id="p_11"> 9.               Paragraph 25 of the NGET judgment reads as follows:

         nutrition and life style of individual subjects.</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">         Notwithstanding such delicate but significant dependencies,
         it is always statistically prudent to consider basis when large
         cases of similar kind, namely, respiratory disorder have been
         noticed by KEM, in relation to people from above two (2)
         villages and considering the human health on priority and
         therefore, we do not find any reason for not accepting the
         KEM report. Considering such observations and also, the
         demonstrated link between the prevalent ambient air quality
         at Mahul and Ambapada villages with the health impacts in

         those areas, it can be observed that there is a perceptible
         threat to health of the residents of village Mahul and
         Ambapada due to prevailing air quality in the area."
</p>
<p id="p_13"> 10.              It appears to be the case of the State Government that the
 observations in aforementioned paragraphs amounted to being
 directions in perpetuity about the air pollution in Mahul, when the
 judgment itself was only based on data presented between 2014-2015.
 The State Government has pleaded in its Writ Petition that these
 observations of the National Green Tribunal should have been
 restricted to the prevalent air pollution in the area at the time of passing
 the judgment.

<p id="p_14"> 11.              Prior to evaluating the merits of the arguments of the State
 Government against the judgment of the National Green Tribunal, it
 would be useful to note the important paragraphs of the judgment of
 the Tribunal.
</p>

<p id="p_15"> 12.              At paragraph 22 of its judgment, the National Green
 Tribunal observed that the respiratory morbidity and study of the
 health of the residents of the Mahul region done by KEM hospital
 shows that a majority of the residents showed acute symptoms of
 breathing difficulties, severe lung-related issues, dry coughs, eye and
 skin irritation, chronic fatigue and weakness.

<p id="p_31">           However, due to comparatively high emission rate with
           large numbers of fugitive and point sources, industrial
           handling &amp; storage activities sometimes results in
           contribution of significant concentration of VOCs &amp;
           odorous compounds in ambient air and requiring attention
           on control measures by various stakeholders. Presence of
           VOCs/odorous compounds has been established in this
           study at locations covering work zones of industrial
           installations as well as in nearby habitation with mixed
           land use. It is gathered that refineries in the area came in
           early 1950's and one of the major chemical logistics
           installation company came in 1977. Another chemical
           logistics company came in 2007. Lot of land use
           development in surrounding has taken place after 1980's.
           Though the distance or proximity with habitat does not
           give liberty to industrial installations to be lenient on
           control measures at source, the landuse development could
           have been regulated to minimizes the exposure to habitants

           long term 'health effects; tin fortunately, there is very little
           awareness. Exposures to high level of VOCs are known to
           have carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic effects
           (0/zura eta/., 2006). Other symptoms include eye, nose
           and throat irritation, headaches, loss of coordination,
           nausea, dry cough, dizziness, tiredness, and damage to liver,
           kidney, blood vessel, central nervous and respiratory
           systems (Fine II and Seppala, 2.108). However, sometimes
           symptoms of diseases and their causes may not be clear.
           VOCs also have bad effects on respiration systems, blood
           vessel systems, and nerve systems (Sarigitmnis et aL, 2011;
           Zhou et al., 2011). According to a study by (Yoo et. al.,
           2015) where he tried to find out associations between
           personal exposures to VOCs and in cardiovascular
           physiology observed that VOCs may have rapid impacts
           upon the human cardiovascular system. Petroleum related
           VOCs were associated with increases in Bronchial Artery
           Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD) and Nitroglycerine
           Mediated Areterial (NMD). Zhou et al., 2011 measured
           personal, home, indoor, work, vehicle and outdoor levels of
           VOCs and estimated cancer risks. In a study by Loh et al.,
           2007 cancer risks of a broad range of organic hazardous
           pollutants many of which were VOCs in U.S population
           were estimated to be approximately 1 in 1000 based on
           cancer potency estimates from the U.S.EPA. Formaldehyde
           had the highest carcinogenic risk levels, followed by
           Naphthalene, Benzene and Toluene due to other' effects.
           Formaldehyde exposure may pose acute and chronic non-
           carcinogenic health risks to the occupants, whereas benzene
           exposure may pose chronic non-carcinogenic risks to the
           occupants. Exposure to both compounds is associated with
           significant carcinogenic risks (Huang et al., 2013). VOCs
           presences have also resulted in increase of breast cancer
           (Lavra et al. 2015)."

           Development of residential premises should not be

           It is clear that health impacts not only lead to enhanced
           costs of treatment for low income categories of population,
           but they also cause other adverse impacts by affecting their
           ability to work, earn wages, and sustain their livelihoods.
           Over 140 individuals claimed that they lost their jobs due
           to health related issues and over 200-two thirds of the
           sample mentioned loss of wages due to health issues, as
           they could not go to work on many days in a year due to
           poor health (Table 7). Over 140 also mentioned frequently
           having to change jobs as they frequently fell ill, and lost
           their earlier jobs.

           resettlement is that it provides access to good and stable
           access to drinking water. Our survey showed that the vast
           majority of the sample indeed got access to municipal
           water supply (Table 8 and 9). However the quality of
           drinking water supplied leaves much to be desired. Over
           90% of the sample averred that the quality of drinking
           water was bad, and not fit for human consumption. This
           was also observed during our visits, where the drinking
           water in the pipes and sumps were contaminated, had thin
           oil films, had foreign particles, and had got mixed with
           sewage and toilet water in several of the buildings."

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">           "A key reason for the current petition is the location of the
           township close to polluting industries, refineries,
           petrochemical storage etc. The impact on health has been a
           growing concern, and has been strongly articulated by the
           people, and emerges strongly through the survey results as
           well. Table 42 mentions the chief sources of pollution. A
           range of health problems especially respiratory problems
           have been frequently reported (Table 43). This is also
           mentioned in the KEM report, and the Doctors for You
           survey in M Ward, of which Mahul is a part. In Chapter 5
           this is further elaborated. While not all health impacts
           identified by the sample can be attributed to the pollution,
           a majority of them have casual effects. Our team consulted
           with doctors to confirm that these symptoms can be an
           outcome of air pollution.

           importance also came up in the nearby area, the population
           over there was sparse, and that is why these installations
           were permitted to be set up at locations in the Mahul area
           of Chembur far away from the island city of Mumbai. Now
           the city has grown up, as also the suburbs, and people are
           trying to occupy the vacant spaces wherever available. The

 BPCL, which is the refinery neighbouring the Eversmile Complex and
 is only at a distance of 15 meters from              the PAP complex, had
 approached this Court by filing Writ Petition No. 1515 of 2017 to
 oppose the issuance of a commencement certificate to the
 redevelopment of a high rise residential building located 50 meters
 away from its warehouse. Vide its judgment dated 25 th April 2019, this
 Court quashed and set aside an order of the Municipal Corporation of
 Greater Mumbai which authorized the construction for the
 redevelopment of the residential building in question. This Court
 relied on the aforementioned judgment of the Supreme court dated 10-
 12-2013 in the matter of Oswal Agro Mills Ltd. Vs. Hindustan

<p id="p_63">           The submissions of the Municipal Corporation and the

           any lesson despite the authoritative pronouncement of the
           Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held further that if

           would be coming up, then, that is a very crucial aspect and
           requires serious consideration. The Supreme Court
           emphasised that the security threat is clearly placed on
           record so also a possible danger to the health placed on
           record so also a possible danger to the health of the

<p id="p_64"> 35.       It is therefore evident that residential premises in the vicinity of
 such refineries can pose multi-faceted security risks, which are not only
 restricted to the health of the residents nearby and the absolute liability
 imposed on the refineries, but a terrorist attack using these refineries as
 targets could lead to colossal destruction within the city, that could
 debilitate a large number of people living around the Chembur region.

<p id="p_65"> 36.       It is noteworthy that in order to quell the concerns about security
 within the PAP Complex, the State Government and Municipal
 Corporation had planned to allot 2000 police officers and constables
 homes in the Eversmile Complex. These officers were intended to be
 deputed within the Complex to oversee the safety of the neighbouring
 industries and refineries. However, to this day not a single police
 officer has been ready to accept the homes allotted to them in
 Eversmile Complex due to the fact that they share the same concerns
 about safety and the exposure to the air pollution in the region.

           Furthermore, much of the basic infrastructure in Mahul is
           non-existent or failing: drainage pipes in many buildings

           recreational facilities. There are limited schools, shops or

           major reason behind low site-based air flow was the
           arrangements of building blocks and their spatial
           configuration. Hyper-dense compactly arranged building
           towers placed in close proximity to one another with
           limited inter-block distance act as a barrier to the air path,
           thus causing lower air velocity zones within building
           blocks. This lower natural ventilation performance does not
           meet the ventilation effectiveness threshold, hence often
           failing in efficient extraction and disposal of air pollutants.

           respondents cited concerns with the quality of medicine
           received from public health care facilities. Moreover, some
           respondents stated that the BMC clinics only treated certain
           conditions. The high incidence of respiratory and skin-
           related symptoms is cause for concern. Public health care
           facilities must have specific infrastructure and resources to
           deal with these conditions.            Screening services for
           respiratory illnesses and skin infections must be available.
           Health care providers at public facilities must be well-
           trained in diagnosing and responding to respiratory
           conditions like tuberculosis. In order to alleviate the illness
           burden of Mahul residents, accessible and quality health
           care must be provided."

<blockquote id="blockquote_36">           "7. The recommendations of the National Green
           Tribunal, The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, and
           reports by various agencies such as NEERI, as well as
           previous court judgments must be seriously implemented.
           Most of the reports point to adverse environmental
           conditions seriously affecting living conditions, health, and
           livelihoods in this area. Where needed, apart from
           reducing and eliminating sources of pollution, shifting of
           populations needs to be done in keeping with the
           recommendations of various reports and judgments.

<blockquote id="blockquote_37">           8. The majority of the residents think that the
           conditions are unlivable in Mahul PAP Township. While
           the recommendations 9-&amp; above may improve the
           situation somewhat, these are unlikely to address the
           serious problems of air and water pollution from nearby
           factories, refineries and petro-chemical storage facilities.
           Hospitals and health-care facilities can treat people after
           they fall ill, but not prevent illnesses and diseases. It is
           clear that health has been seriously affected leading to
           higher health care expenditure, and loss of lives and
           livelihoods. Hence since the large scale industries and
           refineries in the area that cause environmental damage and
           pollution cannot be shifted from this place, to prevent
           further harm to lives and livelihoods, there seems no
           option other than to shift the entire population or sections

 paragraph 25 of the order of the Tribunal cannot freeze the situation is
 theoretical. Indeed no situation can ever be frozen. But, as rightly held

           its sweep the right to food, the right to clothing, the right
           to decent environment and a reasonable accommodation to
           live in. The difference between the need of an animal and
           a human being for shelter has to be kept in view. For the
           animal it is the bare protection of the body; for a human
           being it has to be a suitable accommodation which would
           allow him to grow in every aspect - physical, mental and

           the international sphere of what is termed as the 'right to
           the city' (RTTC), which in the context of the case on

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">            "The idea that the RTTC is a right to "change ourselves
            by changing the city" needs close consideration. It is a
            right not in the sense of liberty but in the sense of
            power; it is an individual as well as collective or
            common right; it is a right to call for, or achieve, change
            in our living spaces and ourselves. However, the 'we-
            ness' for transformation is not a given but has to be
            constructed, forged, or fabricated if only because those
            who wield economic, social, and political domination
            aspire always towards fragmentation of the emergent
            'we-ness'. In this sense, then the RTTC is a 'right' to
            struggle for maintaining critical social solidarities.

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">            And, accordingly, such a right presupposes the respect
            for freedom of speech and expression, advocacy and
            dissent, movement and assembly, or the popular
            capacity to struggle to attain these. In sum, the moral

           adopted by heads of States of Governments and the
           official delegations of countries assembled at the United
           Nation's Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat
           II) in Istanbul, Turkey from 3rd to 14th June 1996. It
           endorsed "the universal goals of ensuring adequate
           shelter for all and making human settlements safer,
           healthier and more reliable, equitable, sustainable and
           productive." There were two major themes at that
           conference: adequate shelter for all and 'sustainable
           human settlement development' in an urbanizing unit.
           The conference recognized with a sense of urgency the
           continuing deterioration of conditions and shelter of
           human settlements. It reaffirmed its commitment to
           better the standards of living "in larger freedom of all
           human right." The conference also reaffirmed the
           commitment to "the full and progressive realization of
           the right to adequate housing as provided for in
           international instruments" and to that end sought the
           active participation of public, private and non-
           governmental partners at all levels "to ensure legal
           security of tenure, protection from discrimination and
           equal access to affordable, adequate housing for all
           persons and their families."

           on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development
           (Habitat III) in Quito, Ecuador on 20th October 2016. In
           December 2016, during the 68th plenary session of the

           a Habitat III Policy Unit 'Right to the City, and Cities for
           All', consisting of experts from Member States, was
           formed to provide inputs into formulation of the
           Agenda. The aforesaid policy paper defined the RTTC
           as under:
</p>
<p id="p_86">           "10. The right to the city is... defined as the right of all
           inhabitants present and future, to occupy, use and
           produce just, inclusive and sustainable cities, defined as a
           common good essential to the quality of life. The right
           to the city further implies responsibilities on government
           and people to claim, defend, and promote this right."
</p>
<p id="p_87">           100. The policy paper also sets out a non-exhaustive list
           of components that ensure the 'city as a common good':
</p><p id="p_88">           (a) a city of free of discrimination; (b) a city of inclusive
           citizenship; (c) a city with enhanced political
           participation in all aspects of urban planning; (d) a city
           ensuring equitable access for all to shelter, goods and
           services; (e) a city with quality public spaces for
           enhancing social interaction; (f) a city of gender equality;
</p><p id="p_89">           (g) a city with cultural diversity; (h) a city with inclusive
           economics; and, (i) a city respecting urban-rural
           linkages, biodiversity and natural habitats.
</p>
<p id="p_90">           101. The aforementioned components of the 'city as a
           common good' have been ultimately incorporated in the
           New Urban Agenda as a 'shared vision' for "the equal
           use and enjoyment of cities and human settlements,
           seeking to promote inclusivity and ensure that all
           inhabitants, of present and future generations, without
           discrimination of any kind are able to inhabit and
           produce just, safe, healthy, accessible, affordable, resilient
           and sustainable cities and human settlements to foster
           prosperity and quality of life for all". Formulated thus,

            RTTC.
</p>
<p id="p_91">            102. The RTTC acknowledges that those living in JJ
            clusters in jhuggis/slums continue to contribute to the
            social and economic life of a city. These could include
            those catering to the basic amenities of an urban
            population, and in the context of Delhi, it would include
            sanitation workers, garbage collectors, domestic help,
            rickshaw pullers, labourers and a wide range of service
            providers indispensable to a healthy urban life. Many of
            them travel long distances to reach the city to provide
            services, and many continue to live in deplorable
            conditions, suffering indignities just to make sure that
            the rest of the population is able to live a comfortable
            life. Prioritizing the housing needs of such population
            should be imperative for a state committed to social
            welfare and to its obligations flowing from the ICESCR
            and the Indian Constitution. The RTTC is an extension
            and an elaboration of the core elements of the right to
            shelter and helps understand the broad contours of that
            right."

           "8. In any organized society, right to live as a human
           being is not ensured by meeting only the animal needs
           of man. It is secured only when he is assured of all
           facilities to develop himself and is freed from restriction
           which inhabit his growth. All human rights are
           designed to achieve this object. Right to live guaranteed
           in any civilized society implies the right to food, water,
           decent environment, education, medical care and
           shelter. These are basic human rights known to any
           civilized society. All civil, political, social and cultural
           rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human
           Rights and Convention or under the Constitution of
           India cannot be exercised without these basic human
           rights. Shelter for a human being therefore, is not a
           mere protection of his life and limb. It is home where
           he has opportunities to grow physically, mentally,
           intellectually and spiritually. Right to shelter, therefore,
           includes adequate living space, safe and decent
           structure, clean and decent surroundings, sufficient
           light, pure air and water, electricity, sanitation and other
           civil amenities like roads etc. so as to have easy access to
           his daily avocation. The right to shelter, therefore, does
           not mean a mere right to a roof over oner's head but
           right to all the infrastructure necessary to enable them
           to live and develop as a human being. Right to shelter
           when used as an essential requisite to the right to live
           should be deemed to have been guaranteed as a
           fundamental right. As is enjoined in the Directive
           Principles, the State should be deemed to be under an
           obligation to secure it for its citizens of course subject to
           its economic budgeting. In a democratic society as a
           member of the organized civil community one should
           have permanent shelter so as to physically, mentally and
           intellectually equip oneself to improve his excellence as
           a useful citizen as enjoined in the Fundamental Duties

            and to be a useful citizen and equal participant in
            democracy. The ultimate object of making a man
            equipped with a right to dignity of person and equality
            of status is to enable him to develop himself into a
            cultured being. Want of decent residence, therefore,
            frustrates the very     object of the constitutional
            animation of right to equality, economic justice,
            fundamental right to residence, dignity of person and
            right to live itself."

            hardly be justified as a valid excuse to avoid

</p><p id="p_98"> 54.       The Court propounded the legal principle of a requirement of

 'reasonableness' while providing public housing by the State:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_51">             "... a court considering reasonableness will not
             enquire whether other more desirable or favourable
             measures could have been adopted, or whether public
             money could have been better spent. The question
             would be whether the measures that have been
             adopted are reasonable. It is necessary to recognize
             that a wide range of possible measures could be
             adopted by the State to meet its obligations. Many of
             these would meet the requirement of reasonableness.
             Once it is shown that the measures do so, this
             requirement is met."

 security of tenure upon households which lack such protection against
 forced eviction, harassment and other threats by State Agencies and
 private parties.

 on forced eviction which is defined as the permanent or temporary
 removal against their will of individuals, families or communities from
 their homes or land which they occupy. This Comment prohibits
 forced eviction stressing that the State itself must refrain from forced
 evictions and ensure that the law is enforced against its agents third
 parties who carry out such evictions. Clause 17 of General Comment
 No. 7 states:-

            homeless or vulnerable to the violation of other human

            themselves, the State-Party must take all appropriate
            measures, to the maximum of its available resources to
            ensure that adequate alternative housing, resettlement of
