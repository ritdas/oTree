                     -----------------------------------
               Dated this the 21st day of November, 2014

                            J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioners have filed this writ petition challenging Ext.P9

order passed by the 1st respondent granting a licence under Section

233 of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act to establish an industrial unit. The

petitioners are persons who claim to be residents of the locality.

According to them, the industry that is proposed, would be a source of

nuisance.   Therefore, they have sought for setting aside Ext.P9. A

counter affidavit has been filed by the 5th respondent producing

Exts.R5(a) and R5(m) documents. Adv.Sri.M.Ajay appears for the 4th

respondent. Adv.Sri.Anil K Mohammed appears for respondents 1 and

</p><p id="p_2">2. The learned Government Pleader appears for the 3rd respondent.

</p><p id="p_3">      2. According to the counsel for the petitioners, the consent to

establish has been granted to the 5th respondent by the 4th respondent

relying on a sketch that has been marked as Ext.R3(h) in Ext.P2. The

said sketch according to the counsel, is erroneous since it does not

show any of the residential houses that are actually located within the

prohibited distance of the proposed unit. According to the counsel, it is

necessary that an Advocate Commissioner is deputed from this Court

to ascertain and report the said facts to this Court.

</p><p id="p_4">      3. Adv.Sri.G.Gopalakrishnan Nair who appears for the 5th

respondent on the other hand points out that, Ext.P9 is an order

W.P.(C) No.29461 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2</span>

against which the petitioners have a statutory remedy by way of

appeal to the Tribunal for Local Self Government Institutions,

Thiruvananthapuram.        Against the consent granted by the 4th

respondent also, the petitioner has preferred Ext.P10 appeal which is

pending before the appellate authority under the Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. In view of the above, it is contended

that the petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs sought for in this

writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      Having heard the counsel appearing for the respective parties, I

am not satisfied that any interference with Ext.P9 is called for, at this

stage. The remedy of the petitioner against Ext.P9 is by way of an

appeal, provided by the statute to the Tribunal for Local Self

Government Institutions, Thiruvananthapuram.         It shall therefore be

open to the petitioner to invoke the said remedy against Ext.P9.

Against the consent that has been issued by the 4th respondent to the

5th respondent, the petitioner has already invoked his statutory remedy

and Ext.P10 appeal is pending before the appellate authority.

Therefore, it is for the petitioner to pursue the said appeal for

necessary reliefs. The above being the position, I am not satisfied that

the petitioner is entitled to any of the reliefs sought for.

</p><p id="p_6">      This writ petition is therefore, dismissed.
