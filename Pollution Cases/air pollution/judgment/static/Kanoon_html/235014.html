</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">1.    Leave granted.
</p><p id="p_4">2.    This batch of appeals arise out of a judgment and order dated 23rd

June, 2009 passed by a Division Bench of the Gauhati High Court at

Guwahati whereby and whereunder the Memorandum dated 11th
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                       3</span>


September, 2003 issued by the Government of Meghalaya purported to

be in terms of Section 138 (2)(b) of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_1">Motor Vehicles Act</a>, 1988 (for

short `the Act') was held to be illegal and a writ of or in the nature of

mandamus was issued directing the Government of Mehalaya to make

Rules in exercise of its powers thereunder.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.    The basic fact of the matter is not in dispute.

</p><p id="p_6">      Several writ petitions were filed before the High Court alleging

that trucks carrying cargo in the State of Meghalaya are compelled to pay

substantial amounts to various entites at innumerable points who broadly

fall under four categories - (1) persons operating weighbridges on

various terms and conditions stipulated by the State of Meghalaya ; (2)

the local tribal chiefs known as Sylems and Sardars ; (3) the authorities

implementing the provisions of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and (4) the Police officers of the State of

Meghalaya.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      The Sylems and Sardars being the local tribal chiefs, admitted

establishment of such toll gates and collection of monies from the cargo

carrying vehicles asserting customary rights in them therefor and which

are said to be protected by Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India

and the laws made by the District Council thereunder.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     4</span>


</p><p id="p_8">      Indisputably a batch of the writ petitions including the connected

appeals relating to the right of Sylems and Sardars who established Toll

Gates and collection of monies by them, had been heard in part by the

High Court.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           5</span><p id="p_9">


</p><p id="p_10">       It is also not in dispute that various interim orders were passed in the said

pending mattes. The Gauhati High Court, however, took up for hearing a batch of six

matters in regard to the legality of collection of monies by the operators of the

weighbridges in the State of Meghalaya opining that the purported grievances made
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           6</span>


in the other writ petitions relating to establishment of toll gates and collection of

monies by other agencies could be determined later.

            deponent denies the same and states that the
            Members of the Petitioner's Association have not

<p id="p_51">22.   The core question which arises for consideration in these appeals is as

to whether the State Government is empowered to issue any executive order

in respect of the matters required to be prescribed by Rules.

</p><p id="p_52">23.   <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_24">Article 162</a> of the Constitution of India in unequivocal terms provides

that the executive power of a State shall extend to the matters with respect to

which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws. Such executive

powers having regard to the Rule of Executive Business are framed in terms

of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_25">Article 166.</a> Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_26">Article 166</a> empowers the Governor to make

rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of the Government

of the State, and for the allocation among Minister of the said business in so

far as it is not business with respect to which the Governor is by or under the

Constitution required to act in his discretion.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                      17</span>


</p><p id="p_53">24.   The Memorandum was issued in the name of the Governor. It is not

in dispute that it was authenticated in terms of clause (2) of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_27">Article 166</a> of

the Constitution. The power was exercised by the State under the provisions

of the Act. The said order was to remain in force till Rules are framed in the

prescribed manner.
</p>
<p id="p_54">      The provisions of the Act mandate that the unladen weight and laden

weight must be determined.       Indisputably, weighing devices had to be

provided for the said purpose. It is true that for the said purpose Rules may

have to be framed. It is, however, a well settled principle of law that even in

a case where the statute provides for certain things to be done, subject to

Rules, any action taken without framing the Rules would not render any

action invalid. If a statute is workable even without framing of the Rules,

the same has to be given effect to. The law itself except in certain situations

does not envisage vacuum.
</p>
<p id="p_55">25.   Non compliance of the provisions relating to "laden weight" and

"unladen weight" being penal in nature must be held to be imperative in

character. For the purpose of construction of the provisions of the Act the

Courts will have to take into consideration the freedom on the part of the

citizens as also non citizens to carry out trade and business in terms of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                       18</span>


<a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_28">Article 301</a> of the Constitution of India, subject of course to the other

provisions thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_56">26.   The High Court itself noticed the two primary contentions of the writ

petition for its consideration, which read :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">             "Essentially the grievances in these cases is two
             fold - (1) the State lacks the necessary authority of
             law to collect such fee and (2) even if the authority
             in law exists, that those who are entrusted with the
             responsibility of rendering the services and
             collecting the fee are acting in excess of the
             authority conferred on them."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_57">27.   The second contention was not answered.
</p>
<p id="p_58">      In fact there was no sufficient pleadings brought on record by the

parties in that behalf. The State for giving effect to the provisions of the

statute may upon itself take the burden of providing for weighbridges and

collection of fees etc. in exercise of its power under <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_29">Article 298</a> or <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_30">Article

162</a> of the Constitution of India. It may, however, permit to provide parties

to install weighbridges, subject to regulations.

</p><p id="p_59">28.   The Memorandum in question provides broad terms and conditions

under which the private parties were authorized to set up weighbridges and

collection of fees. Power of the State to do so is not in question. It is not a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                       19</span>


case where fees are required to be prescribed for undertaking administrative

action.
</p>
<p id="p_60">29.   Apart from <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_31">Section 211</a> of the Act the State is entitled to make laws

for collection of fees in respect of any manner enumerated in List II of the

Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India as would be evident from

Entry 66 thereof. If it itself carries on business, it is entitled to lay down the

norms therefor.
</p>
<p id="p_61">30.   Where the State or the State controlled agencies render services for

the purpose of effectuation of the provisions of a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_32">Central Act</a>, it, in our

opinion, is entitled to charge a reasonable amount in respect thereof.

U. Jormanik Siem and another</a> [ [1961] 1 SCR 750]. The question which

<p id="p_63">Wanchoo, J. speaking for the Court opined as under :-



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">      "The High Court seems to be of the view that until
      such a law is made there could be no power of
      appointment of a Chief or Siem like the respondent
      and in consequence there would be no power of
      removal either. With respect, it seems to us that the
      High Court has read far more into para 3(1)(g)
      than is justified by its language. Para 3(1) is in fact
      something like a legislative list and enumerates the
      subjects on which the District Council is
      competent to make laws. Under para 3(1)(g) it has
      power to make laws with respect to the
      appointment or succession of Chiefs or Headmen
      and this would naturally include the power to
      remove them. But it does not follow from this that
      the appointment or removal of a Chief is a
      legislative act or that no appointment or removal
      can be made without there being first a law to that
      effect. The High Court also seems to have thought
      that as there was no provision in the Sixth
      Schedule in terms of Articles 73 and 162 of the
      Constitution, the administrative power of the
      District Council would not extend to the subjects
      enumerated in para 3(1). Now para 2(4) provides
      that the administration of an autonomous district
      shall vest in the District Council and this in our
      opinion is comprehensive enough to include all
      such executive powers as are necessary to be
      exercised for the purposes of the administration of
      the district. It is true that where executive power
      impinges upon the rights of citizens it will have to
      be backed by an appropriate law; but where
      executive power is concerned only with the

            must be laws, rules or regulations governing the

            administration under the control of the District
            Council. "

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">      The said decision has been noticed by this Court in Surinder Singh v.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_64">Central Govt., [ (1986) 4 SCC 667]. It was held therein:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">         "6. The High Court has held that the disposal of
         property forming part of the compensation pool was
         "subject" to the rules framed as contemplated by
         <a href="/doc/105251258/" id="a_34">Sections 8</a> and <a href="/doc/18641359/" id="a_35">40</a> of the Act and since no rules had
         been framed by the Central Government with regard
         to the disposal of the urban agricultural property
         forming part of the compensation pool, the authority
         constituted under the Act had no jurisdiction to
         dispose of urban agricultural property by auction-sale.
         Unless rules were framed as contemplated by the Act,
         according to the High Court the Central Government
         had no authority in law to issue executive directions
         for the sale and disposal of urban agricultural
         property. This view was taken, placing reliance on an
         earlier decision of a Division Bench of that court in
         <a href="/doc/1486675/" id="a_36">Bishan Singh v. Central Government</a>. The Division
         Bench in Bishan case took the view that since the
         disposal of the compensation pool property was
         subject to the rules that may be made, and as no rules
         had been framed, the Central Government had no
         authority in law to issue administrative directions
         providing for the transfer of the urban agricultural
         land by auction-sale. In our opinion the view taken by
         the High Court is incorrect. Where a statute confers
         powers on an authority to do certain acts or exercise
         power in respect of certain matters, subject to rules,
         the exercise of power conferred by the statute does
         not depend on the existence of rules unless the statute
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                     22</span>


         expressly provides for the same. In other words
         framing of the rules is not condition precedent to the
         exercise of the power expressly and unconditionally
         conferred by the statute. The expression "subject to
         the rules" only means, in accordance with the rules, if
         any. If rules are framed, the powers so conferred on
         authority could be exercised in accordance with these
         rules. But if no rules are framed there is no void and
         the authority is not precluded from exercising the
         power conferred by the statute."

<p id="p_65">32.   Mr. Sharma would lay emphasis on the opinion of the Bench in Cajee

(supra) that executive power infringing upon the rights of the citizens would

have to be backed by appropriate law.
</p>
<p id="p_66">      The aforementioned observation was made in the context of the

Constitutional provisions contained in the Sixth Schedule.

</p><p id="p_67">      There exists a distinction between an executive order made in terms of

Articles 73 and 162 of the Constitution of India and one made under the

Sixth Schedule thereof.

They cannot obtain such services free of any charges. When private parties

are given the right to set up such weighbridges, indisputably they would be

entitled to reasonable profit.
</p>
<p id="p_71">      It was not the contention of the writ petitioner-respondent that the

charges levied for getting their trucks weighed at the weighbridges are

exorbitant or they are compelled to get their trucks weighed at several

places, although they otherwise fulfill the statutory requirements laid down

             defined to be a charge for a special service
             rendered to individuals by some governmental
             agency. The amount of fee levied is supposed to be
             based on the expenses incurred by the Government
             in rendering the service, though in many cases the
             costs are arbitrarily assessed. Ordinarily, the fees
             are uniform and no account is taken of the varying
             abilities of different recipients to pay. These are
             undoubtedly some of the general characteristics,
             but as there may be various kinds of fees, it is not
             possible to formulate a definition that would be

<p id="p_73">35.   We may, however, notice that the question has been considered by a

Constitution Bench of this Court in Jindal Stainless Ltd. (2) and <a href="/doc/1937475/" id="a_39">another vs.

State of Haryana and others</a> [ (2006) 7 SCC 241 ]. The Bench noticed the

difference between `a tax' `a fee' and `a compensatory tax" inter alia in the

following terms :-
</p>
<p id="p_74">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">             "40. Tax is levied as a part of common burden.
             The basis of a tax is the ability or the capacity of
             the taxpayer to pay. The principle behind the levy
             of a tax is the principle of ability or capacity. In the
             case of a tax, there is no identification of a specific
             benefit and even if such identification is there, it is
             not capable of direct measurement. In the case of a
             tax, a particular advantage, if it exists at all, is
             incidental to the State's action. It is assessed on
             certain elements of business, such as, manufacture,
             purchase, sale, consumption, use, capital, etc. but
             its payment is not a condition precedent. It is not a
             term or condition of a licence. A fee is generally a
             term of a licence. A tax is a payment where the
             special benefit, if any, is converted into common
             burden.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">             41. On the other hand, a fee is based on the
             "principle of equivalence". This principle is the
             converse of the "principle of ability" to pay. In the
             case of a fee or compensatory tax, the "principle of
             equivalence" applies. The basis of a fee or a
             compensatory tax is the same. The main basis of a
             fee or a compensatory tax is the quantifiable and
             measurable benefit. In the case of a tax, even if
             there is any benefit, the same is incidental to the
             government action and even if such benefit results
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                      25</span>


            from the government action, the same is not
            measurable. Under the principle of equivalence, as
            applicable to a fee or a compensatory tax, there is
            an indication of a quantifiable data, namely, a
            benefit which is measurable."
