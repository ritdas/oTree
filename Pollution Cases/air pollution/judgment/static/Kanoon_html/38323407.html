              =====================================================

               Dated this the 11th day of April, 2018


                                JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner, which is a partnership firm engaged in

conducting a crusher unit in Ward No.1 of Tarur Grama Panchayat,

had submitted an application for renewal of trade license as

required under Section 232 of the Kerala Panchayat Raj act and

also for renewal of consent to operate as required under the

provision of Air (prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, as

also the Water (prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. The

application was made through Ext.P5 submitted before the District

Single Window Clearance Board under the Kerala Investment

Promotion and Faciliation Ordinance, 2017, which has since

become an Act. It is the case of the petitioner that, by virtue of the

amendments brought into the Industrial Single Window Clearance

Board and Industrial Township Area Development Act 1999,

through the said Act, the petitioner is entitled to a deemed license

and consent for the period for which they were applied.



</p><p id="p_2">      2.      I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the

petitioner,   the learned Standing Counsel appearing for              the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          -2-</span>
W.P.(C). No. 12143 of 2018(P)



respondent Panchayat as also the learned Standing Counsel

appearing for the respondent Pollution Control Board.



</p><p id="p_3">        On a consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case

as also the submissions made across the bar, I find force in the

contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner, based on the

statutory provisions aforementioned that, since there is no order

passed by any of the statutory respondents, either rejecting or

allowing the application for consent/renewal of license, within a

period of thirty days from the date of submission of the application

before     the Industrial        Single    Window     Clearance   Board,   the

petitioner has become entitled to a deemed license and consent for

the period for which the same was applied. Accordingly, I dispose

the writ petition directing the 1st respondent to issue a certificate

indicating       that      the   petitioner     has   obtained    a   deemed

license/consent for the period for which the license/consent was

applied, within two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this

judgment.        It is made clear that, nothing in this judgment shall

prevent the respective respondents from taking any action against

the petitioner, in the event it is found that the petitioner is

violating any of the conditions of the licenses that have been

granted, pursuant to this judgment.
