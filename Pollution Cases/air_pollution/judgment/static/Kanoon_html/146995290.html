     referred to as NEAA) with a prayer to set aside the No Objection Certificate
     granted in favour of M/s Prabhu Nath Rai Eent Bhatta Udyog Ltd. (Respondent
     No. 1) to establish a brick Kiln. The appellate authority by order dated 18th
     February, 2009 allowed the appeal and set aside the permission. The grievances of
     the appellate/petitioner in this case is with regard to non implementation of the
     orders passed by NEAA. He has filed this petition praying as follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           i.      Summon and prosecute the respondent no. 1 for willfully violating
                   the other of this Hon'ble Authority dated 25.05.2009.
           ii.     Pass any order, writ or direction which the Hon'ble Authority may
                   deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_7">3.      Bereft of unnecessary details the facts which are necessary for effectual
     adjudication of this petition are as follows:
</p>

<p id="p_8">Admittedly Respondent No.1 Ms. Prabhunath Rai Eent Bhatta Udyod filed an
application before the Regional Officer, U.P. Pollution Control Board, Varanasi for
grant of permission under Section-21 of Air (Prevention and Control Board) Act,
1981 for establishing and running a brick kiln. After compliance with necessary
paraphernalia the Regional Officer, U.P. Pollution Control Board, by order dated 20th
November, 2002 granted consent/permission/NOC to the said Respondent to establish
the brick kiln. Being aggrieved by the said order the present appellant/petitioner
approached the U.P. , Pollution Control Board and raised certain objections. After
going through the objections raised the Secretary, U.P. Pollution Control Board in
exercise of the power vested upon him under Section 31-A of the NEAA Act directed
to stop setting up of the brick kiln. The said order dated 3rd May, 2006 passed by the
Member Secretary of U.P., Pollution Control Board, was challenged before the
Hon'ble Allahabad High Court of Civil Misc Writ Petition No. 29099 of 2006. The
said Writ Petition was remitted back to the Member Secretary with a direction to
consider the matter de-novo and pass fresh orders after taking into consideration the
objections raised by the the petitioner. It appears, the Respondent No.1 thereafter
made fresh representation and the Member Secretary of the Board after considering
the objections raised by order dated 5th December, 2006 rejected the representation
filed by Respondent No.1. Consequently, the NOC granted in favour of Respondent

 No.1, under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_1">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and Control Board) Act 1981 stood
withdrawn.
</p>



<p id="p_9">4. Respondent No. 1 assailed the order passed by the Secretary of the Board before
   State of Uttar Pradesh, Department of Environment, Lucknow under Section-31
   (2) of the 1981 Act. The said appeal was registered as Appeal No.1 of 2007. The
   forum by order dated 8th September, 2008 set aside the order dated 15th December,
   2006, passed by the Member Secretary U.P., Pollution Control Board.
</p>

<p id="p_10">5. The said order was assailed by the Petitioner/Appellant under Section-11 of
   National Environment Appellate Authority Act, 1997 before the NEAA and the
   same was registered as appeal of No. 12 of 2008. The Appellate Authority
   allowed the appeal by order dated 18th September, 2009.
</p>


<p id="p_11">6. The order of the Appellate Authority was assailed by Respondent No.1 before the
   Hon'ble Allahabad High Court in Civil Misc Writ Petition No. 2785 of 2010. It
   appears that initially an order or Interim Stay was granted, however, by afflux of
   time the said order spent its force as no order or extension was passed by the High
   Court. The Petitioner has filed the present misc. application before the NEAA
   inter lia praying to prosecute the Respondent No.1 under Section -19 of the
   <a href="/doc/79225559/" id="a_2">National Environment Appellate Authority Act</a>, for violating the orders passed by
   NEAA.
</p>

<p id="p_12">7. While matters stood thus NEAA Act 1977, has been repealed by National Green
   Tribunal (NGT) Act, and the National Green Tribunal was constituted. The Misc.
   petition filed by the petitioner therefore, came up for hearing before this Tribunal.
</p>


<p id="p_13">8. The petitioner has appeared in person before this Tribunal. In course of hearing he
   has fairly admitted that in the meanwhile by judgment of 28th April, 2010 the
   Hon'ble High Court of Allahabad has allowed the writ petition and has set aside
   the orders passed by the NEAA. The petitioner, as has been stated earlier was
   aggrieved by non implementation of the directions issued by the NEAA in their
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                                       3</span>
              order dated 18th May, 2009, but then in the meanwhile the said order passed by the
             NEAA has been set aside by the Hon'ble High Court of Allahabad in Civil Misc.
             Writ Petition Order No. 27865 of 2010, and do not exist any more.
</p><p id="p_14">          9. In view of the aforesaid clear position of both facts and Law we are satisfied that
             no relief can be granted to the Petitioner in this case. Accordingly, we dismiss the
             misc. petition. Parties to bear their own cost.</p><pre id="pre_2">
