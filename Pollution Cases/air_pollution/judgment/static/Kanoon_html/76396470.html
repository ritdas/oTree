                 ---------------------
      Dated this the day 19th of August, 2015

                   J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">         All these writ petitions are connected and I

shall refer to the exhibits in W.P.(C) No.10608/2011

for the sake of convenience.
</p>
<p id="p_2">         2.     The  Pathanamthitta    District  Railway

Passenger   Action   Council    had   preferred   Ext.P4

representation to the fifth respondent complaining of

high risk pollution and environmental degradation in

and around Thiruvalla Railway Station.     The complaint

highlighted the loading and unloading of cement bags on

the platform causing serious health hazards to the

passengers.  The relevant part of Ext.P4 representation

is extracted hereunder:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "As  you  may   be  aware  about   7000

         passengers are travelling or making use

         of Tiruvalla Railway station every day.</blockquote><p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">         Recently a goods siding is constructed

         just   adjacent   to   the    passenger

         platform.   Presently in the siding a

         rake of cement wagons are unloaded on

         daily  basis.    Cement  is  the   only

         commodity  handled  almost  every   day

         under   the   nose   of   the   waiting

         passengers. Passengers are experiencing

29211 of 2009

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>



            serious health hazard as the cement-

            filled smoky air heavily pollutes the

            platforms and the entire nearby areas.

            This dangerous pollution is a silent

            killer   and    the   passengers regularly

            using the Railway station are the worst

            affected."
</p>
<p id="p_5">The failure to take remedial steps by respondents 1 to

3 prompted the Action Council to move the Kerala State

Human Rights Commission.            The Commission by Ext.P14

order directed the fifth respondent to take steps under

Section 22 (A) and 41 of the Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 against respondents 1

to 3.    The fifth respondent even issued Ext.P15 notice

to the third respondent indicating that the present

activity     causing     pollution    is   a culpable  offence

punishable with imprisonment and fine.             Every thing

proved futile necessitating the Action Council and two

other passengers to file WP (C) No.15219/2009 on the

file of this Court. One of the reliefs in the writ

petition pertained to the proposed construction of a

cement yard at Thiruvalla Railway Station for the

purpose of unloading of cement bags from the goods

wagon. Relief (a) therein is extracted hereunder:

WP(C) Nos.10608/2011, 12995/2011 &amp;
29211 of 2009

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>



            "(a) Issue a writ of prohibition or

           appropriate writ, order or direction

           commanding the railway authorities to

           restrain     from   going ahead  with  the

           proposed     construction  of  the  cement

           yard at Thiruvalla railway station for

           the purpose of unloading of cement bags

           from       the      goods   wagons    and

           transportation of the same into the

           lorries/other transportation vehicles."

</p><p id="p_6">           3. The fifth respondent herein who was the

fourth respondent in the said writ petition filed a

report supporting the writ petition and confirming the

pollution     due   to    unloading  of  cement   bags.  The

relevant part of Ext.P23 report is extracted hereunder:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           "The Goods unloading platform at the

           Thiruvalla Railway Station is located

           adjacent to the main passenger platform

           (No.2).     Several goods wagons carrying

           cement bags are regularly unloaded and

           loaded    to   trucks   in this  platform.

           Also, the cement from broken bags and

           refilled     in   open.  This  results  in

           emanation of dust causing nuisance to

           the passengers and nearby residents.</blockquote><p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">           There    are    a   number of  residential

           buildings within 100m radius of the

           sides    of   the   wagons  are  kept open

           during unloading to facilitate better

           working environment.      Hence cross winds

           spreads cement dust to larger area.

           Continuous inhalation of cement dust

           may     lead      to    serious   bronchile

           problems."

<p id="p_9">There was every likelihood of the reliefs in the said

writ petition being granted in the wake of the material

then available on record.         Respondents 1 to 3 thereupon

undertook before this Court that they have no intention

to   construct     a   cement     yard at  Thiruvalla  Railway

Station     and that the apprehension of the petitioners

was misplaced.       It is in view of the said stand taken

</p><p id="p_11">           4. The Government of Kerala in the meanwhile

issued a notification dated 22.4.2009 (produced as

Ext.P1 in WP(C) No. 29211/2009) under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_2">Section 4(1)</a> of

the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.            The purpose stated

therein was the doubling of railway track between

Chengannur and Chingavanam for the southern railway.

There can be no dispute that the same is a public

purpose if it is solely for the purpose of doubling of

track without expanding the goods platform (used also

for   unloading      cement     bags). The   present  exercise

includes     the    augmentation     of  the   goods  platform

increasing its capacity from 32 BCN wagons to 41 BCN

wagons.      This is evident from Ext.P19 communication

issued by the second respondent to the President of the

Vigilance Council formed.         The relevant part of Ext.P19

communication reads as follows:

            including cement.        An average of 3

            rakes of Cement per month is dealt with

            at   the   goods    shed.    The   present

            capacity of the goods shed dealing with

            augmented to 41 BCN wagons."
</p>
<p id="p_13">           5. An Advocate Commissioner was deputed in

these three writ petitions who has filed a detailed

report    dated    10.8.2015      along with  photographs and

mahazar.     The same reflects that a new goods platform

of breadth 20 meters and length 650 meters is proposed

to be constructed in the place of the old goods

platform of breadth 10-13.25 meters and length 260

meters.       The relevant part of the report of the

Advocate Commissioner is extracted hereunder.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">            "The proposed goods platform is having

            a breadth of 20 meters in breadth and a

            length of 650 meters as against the old

            platform having a breadth of 10-13.25

            meters in breadth and 260 meters in

            length.      When   the  new  platform is

            constructed the distance between the

            eastern end of the goods platform to

            the residential houses will be further

            reduced.    The environmental engineer to

            if the new platform is constructed the

            distance between the goods platform and

            the houses will be considerably reduced

            and the risk of health hazard will also

            increase considerably."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">The report of the Advocate Commissioner also throws

light on the fact that houses are situated within a

distance of 25 meters from the old goods platform and

the respondents may have to land on the new goods

platform (if constructed) when they step out of their

house.    It is not disputed before me that the exercise

of unloading goods in the goods platform very much

includes     cement    bags    also  as conceded  in Ext.P19

communication.

<p id="p_15">           6.    The    Thiruvalla    Municipal Council  has

already passed Ext.P18 resolution condemning the move

of respondents 1 to 3 to augment and shift the goods

platform.        That pollution still subsists due to the

unloading of cement bags is conceded even in the

counter     affidavit      filed   by  the  sixth  respondent

District Collector .         The relevant part of the counter

affidavit filed       by the District Collector is extracted

hereunder:

         "It     is    hereby     submitted  that   the

         functioning of the cement yard at the

         Thiruvalla     Railway    Station  is   causing

         nuisance, air pollution and inconveniences

         to   the    passengers    as  well  as   nearby

         residents. The cement yard is situated

         adjacent to the passenger plat form No.2

         of Thiruvalla Railway Station.       Cement bag

         are being unloaded and then loaded into

         the Lorries directly from the wagons.       At

         the time of the above mentioned unloading

         and     loading,     cement    dust   emanates.

         Pollution/disturbance is very high while

         handling of broken bags and at the time of

         cleaning the wagons after unloading the

         cement    bags.      Pollution   control  Board

         found    that    cement   dust  was   spreading

         around area including the passenger plat

         form Nos. 1 &amp; 2.        There are large number

         of residential houses within a radius of

         100 m from the cement yard.         The cement

         yard is an open area and no preventive

         measures have been taken by the Railway

         Authorities to prevent air pollution at

         the time of cement handling.       At the time

         of unloading cement bags from the railway

         wagons, both sides of the wagon are kept

         open and the cross winds spreads the dust

         to the nearby areas leading to respiratory

         ailments to the nearby residents."

Thus all the authorities namely the District collector,

Thiruvalla Municipality, Pollution Control Board and

the passengers are disgusted with the loading and

unloading     activity      of   cement  bags   in  the  goods

platform.
</p>
<p id="p_17">           7. No doubt the fifth respondent has been

repeatedly      suggesting      methods  to   abate  even   the

existing     nuisance     and   pollution  in   the  old goods

platform.      Ext.P8 report,       Ext.P23 report as well as

the two reports filed in this writ petition suggest the

construction of another pucca building with roof and

dust extraction system.           Respondents 1 to 3 in the

counter affidavit dated 20.7.2012 filed in the writ

petition have already declared that all these remedial

measures are incapable of being executed.          The relevant

part of the counter affidavit of respondents 1 to 3 is

extracted hereunder:

           shifting of these goods shed to some

           remote places is not practical and it

           is neither the interest of the public

</blockquote><p id="p_18">A   goods    shed    is   entirely   different  from  a goods

platform which can only be constructed far away from

the passenger platform.           The dimension of the goods

platform (particularly when goods include cement bags

also) cannot be altered or changed in view of the

specific stand taken in Ext.P24 judgment.          Respondents

1   to   3   cannot     approbate   and   reprobate  and take

inconsistent stands depending on the case or the court.
