(Hon'ble Shri Justice M. Chockalingam, Judicial Member)

        The appellant herein being aggrieved by the common

judgment dated 20.04.2013 in Appeal Nos. 48 &amp; 49/2012

passed by the Karnataka State Appellate Authority,

Bangalore,    under Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and    Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, ( for short 'Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>s') has

filed   the above appeal on the following brief facts and

grounds.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             3</span><p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5"> 2.   The appellant, a proprietary concern is involved in the

Environmental Consultancy and other allied activities. The

appellant was    interested in establishing a Common

Biomedical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility (for short

'CBWTF') which was then a new concept in India.

Accordingly, the appellant approached the respondents with

an application for setting up a CBWTF. On examining and

scrutinizing the same and inspecting the place at which the

proposed plant to be erected the first respondent herein by

its order dated 02.05.2011 has issued Consent order to

establish of CBWTF under Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a>s at Sy.No.25

of Varuna village Mysore. With an enormous investment,

the appellant established CBWTF providing employment to

30 to 40 persons with 7 dedicated vehicles to transport the

bio-medical waste generated by the hospital, nursing

homes, clinics   from four districts viz., Mysore, Coorg,

Hassan and Chamarajanagar, which are all situated within a

range of 120 km from the plant established by the appellant.

The construction of the plant was completed in the year

2002 and the 2ndrespondent started issuing consents for

every year with effect from first July to 30th June of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             4</span>
 subsequent years under both the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a>s. The

appellant was given Consent orders for the last 10 years

without any hindrance or any allegations from any quarter

including the hospitals, clinics, nursing homes etc. from all

the four districts.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">3.     At the beginning, in the year 2002-03 the district of

Hassan was also included and the appellant was collecting

bio-medical waste from 4 districts regularly without any

default and the same has been disposed of in a scientific

manner and as per the guidelines of the Karnataka State

Pollution Control Board (for short 'KSPCB').


</p><p id="p_8">4.     In the year 2010, the respondent Board informed the

appellant that they are permitting for establishment of one

more plant at Hassan though the appellant was not provided

with an opportunity of being heard before excluding the

district   of   Hassan   from       the   appellants   CBWTF.

Subsequently, without even consulting the appellant, the

Consent Order was redistricted only to three districts viz.,

Mysore, Chamarajnagar and Coorg, excluding the Hassan

District. However, the appellant did not challenge the same.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span>
</p><p id="p_9"> 5.    The said action of the second respondent/KSPCB is

contrary to the Biomedical Waste (Management and

Handling)   Rules,   1998      and   regulations   thereunder

according to which the prescribed authority may cancel or

suspend an authorization, if for reasons, to be recorded in

writing, the occupier/ operator has failed to comply with any

provision of the act of these rules: provided no authorization

shall be canceled or suspended without giving a reasonable

opportunity to the occupier /operator of being heard. As per

the guidelines of Central Pollution Control Board, (for short

'CPCB') regarding the coverage of the area for CBWTF in

any area, only one CBWTF may be allowed to cater up to

10,000 beds at the approved rate by the prescribed

authority. A CBWTF shall not be allowed to cater to the

healthcare units situated beyond a radius of 150 km.

However, in any area where 10,000 beds are not available

within a radius of 150 km, another unit may be allowed to

cater to the needs of healthcare units situated outside the

said 150 km.     The Biomedical Waste (Management and

Handling) Rules, 1998 in its clause 3. Definitions in point (3)

and (4) read as follows:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               6</span><p id="p_10">
 (3)   'Authorization' means permission granted by the

prescribed authority for the generation, collection, reception,

storage, transportation, treatment, disposal and /or any form

of handling of bio-medical waste in accordance with rules

and any guidelines issued by the Central Government.


(4) 'Authorized Person" means an occupier or operator

authorized by the prescribed authority to generate, collect,

receive, store, transport, treat, dispose and/or handle the bio

medical waste in accordance with these rules and any

guidelines issued by the Central Government to operate.


</p><p id="p_11">6.    Following the said guidelines, the appellant unit was

given four districts. Since the district of Hassan was also

situated within 120 km radius, the same was also included to

the appellant CBWTF. As per the guidelines, 10,000 beds

covering 150 km to cater to the health care units was

permitted. However, the same guidelines provide for

permitting the said CBWTF to extend its operation beyond

150 km, if 10,000 beds are not available. In other words, the

whole object of providing CBWTF at a particular place is to

see that the said facility shall be made available to at least
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               7</span>
 for 10,000 beds, keeping in mind to minimize the number of

CBWTF in the area. It does not mean that the respondents

or the State Governments can establish as many as CBWTF

wherever they want, according to their whims and fancies

and further the object is not to establish more and more

CBWTF to ensure that there shall not be any environmental

degradation affecting ecological system. The appellant is

one of the first CBWTF established in the State of Karnataka

and also in the entire South India. Till to-day there were no

complaints whatsoever either from the public or from the

healthcare units of the three districts to whom the appellants

CBWTF is provided with regard to collection of bio-medical

waste every day and disposing of the same scientifically.


</p><p id="p_12">7. The appellant was also given the consent for three

districts for the period from 01.07.2012 to 30.06.2015 as per

the authorization No.PCB/F-04/BMW/2012-13/756 under the

Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986 (for short 'EP Act')

read with the Bio-medical Waste (Management and

Handling) Rules, 1998 dated 09.10.2012. Similarly, consent

was issued by the respondent-Board as per the Consent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              8</span>
 Order No PCB / Shree Consultants / BMW 2012/ 757 dated

09.10.2012 for a period between 01.07.2012 to 30.06.2013

under the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a>s, respectively. The respondent

authorities before issuing the Consent Order, will make

inspection report and the latest inspection report submitted

by the Regional Office of the second respondent dated Nil

shows that the appellant unit is running under capacity. As

per inspection report of the Regional Officer, Mysore on the

appellant's CBWTF on 18.07.2012, the Regional Officer,

Mysore has referred to various facts including the capacity

of the appellant, which shows that the appellant CBWTF has

the capacity to treat and dispose of the Bio Medical waste of

12,000 to 15,000 beds. However, presently the CBWTF of

the appellant is getting the bio-medical waste from around

5000 beds only from all the three districts. Similarly, in the

said inspection report, the second respondent has referred

to the incinerable waste of 10,000 kg per month or 333 kg

per day. The capacity of the appellant CBWTF is 100 kg per

hour and is now working only 3-4 hours per day. By working

in three shifts of 8 hours in a day unit can process up to

2400 kg of incinerable waste per      day.   Accordingly, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                              9</span>
 appellant is not running its plant, even to 3 to 4 hours per

day. This only goes to establish that the appellant is running

its CBWTF under the capacity. Further, as stated above the

collection of bio-medical waste from the three districts is

hassle free and on regular basis and till to-day there were no

complaints against the appellant CBWTF.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">8. Under these circumstances, a proposal was mooted in the

month of March, 2012 with regard to establishment of

second CBWTF in Mysore, for the reasons best known to

the respondent authorities. The copy of the letter of the

Senior Environmental Officer, the fourth respondent to the

fifth respondent dated 25.04.2012 directing Gibbs Biotech

the 5th respondent to submit the feasibility report. In a casual

manner the fourth respondent had submitted feasibility

report to the Respondent Nos. 2 and 3, herein which does

not disclose the correct facts and figures. In fact, inflated

figures were furnished to make believe that the capacity of

the appellants CBWTF is not sufficient and one more

CBWTF is needed at Mysore. When the latest report of the

Environmental Officer of the Mysore discloses the fact that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               10</span>
 the appellant is running under capacity, how can there be a

contrary report from a person who is interested to establish

one more CBWTF. The feasibility report submitted by the

fifth respondent exaggerated by showing that there is

generation of 5000 Kg of incinerable bio-medical waste per

day, forwarded by the same Environmental Officer of the

KSPCB, Mysore, the third respondent to the Head office,

Bangalore, with a recommendation. It is an imaginary one

and inflated figure. In fact, the appellant has brought to the

notice of the respondents herein that the actual generation

of incinerable bio-medical waste from the hospitals, nursing

homes, clinics, labs etc., in three districts. The same was

submitted to the respondent No.2 by the letter of appellant

dated 11.10.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">9. In the mean time, it appears there was a discussion by

the Lok Adalath of the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka,

Bangalore, in the proceedings dated 02.05.2012 of the

Regional Lok Adalath of the Hon'ble High Court Legal

Service Committee, at Mysore chaired by the Hon'ble

Justice Sri Shyledendra Kumar and Sri Yellappa Reddy

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                              11</span>
 wherein a presentation was made by the then Deputy

Commissioner of the Mysore that there is satisfactory

disposal of the bio-medical waste in the Mysore. However,

one Sri Ramesh Kikkeri, a member of an NGO, made

representation before the said Lok Adadalath that CBWTF

should be established within 50 to 60 km of all the places

which generate bio-medical waste. The same was recorded

in the said proceedings and directed the Regional

Environmental Officer Mysore, the 4threspondent to look into

the matter and to work out ways and means of giving

permission for such CBWTF. This is a kind of deliberate act

on the part of the NGO, conniving with the Regional

Environmental Officer Mysore and to take cue from the Lok

Adalath of the Hon'ble High Court Legal Service Committee

for   establishing   second   CBWTF     at   Mysore.    The

representative of the NGO has no knowledge, about the

guidelines in the establishment of CBWTF or with a

deliberate act made such a representation before the

Hon'ble High Court Legal Service Committee without facts

and figures. There is no basis for making such a statement

before the Hon'ble High Court Legal Service Committee that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                              12</span>
 bio-medical waste cannot be transported for a long distance.

On the other hand, the guidelines of the CPCB, clearly

provides for CBWTF to be established to collect and dispose

of the bio-medical waste at a range of 150 km covering

10,000 beds from the healthcare units and that there was no

basis for making such a representation before the Hon'ble

Lok Adadalat. He has not produced any material to

substantiate that there is a need to establish another

CBWTF at Mysore or any place in the districts of Mysore,

Coorg and Chamarajanagar. It is totally unnecessary.

Having regard to the fact that the appellant CBWTF is

covering needs of all the healthcare units of the three

districts without there being clear material on facts regarding

inadequacy of appellants CBWTF, the respondent authority

as a matter of right or as a matter of course cannot decide to

establish another CBWTF next to appellants' unit.


</p><p id="p_17">10. The date of application made by the respondent No.5 to

the Mysore KSPCB office is 12-03-2012. The date of

inspection of location / land by the KSPCB officials is on 12-

03-2012 i.e., the third respondent. The date of forwarding

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                              13</span>
 the application with report to the head office is dated 13-03-

2012. The 4th respondent directed the 5th respondent to

submit feasibility report on 25.04.2012. The Lok Adalath of

Hon'ble High Court Legal Service Committee. was held 02-

05-2012.    However,     the 4threspondent referring to the

proceedings before the Hon'ble Lok Adalath at Mysore

dated 02.05.2012, although the application was processed

and sent before the Lok Adalath, has recommended to the

2nd respondent for issuing a consent i.e., Consent for

Establishment under the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air Act</a>s in favour of the

fourth   respondent    for   establishment   of   CBWTF     at

Gajjegowdanapura village, Jaiypura Hobli, Mysore Taluk

and District, which is just about 25 km from the appellant's

CBWTF.     This   action of    the 4th respondent clearly

establishes that the proceeding of the       Lok Adalath of

Hon'ble High Court Legal Service Committee was used to

make out a case for establishment of second CBWTF at

Mysore, though technically not only feasible and not

required at all. The action of the 4th respondent appears to

be for extraneous considerations with oblique motives. In the

said recommendation, the 4th respondent, in order to make
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                              14</span>
 out a case for establishment of second CBWTF, has

referred to the data furnished by the appellant as per the

agreement that the appellant has to collect bio-medical

waste from 938 healthcare units, as against which the

appellant is collecting bio-medical waste from only 180

healthcare units. It was further observed that the appellant is

not collecting the bio-medical waste as per the execution of

the agreement. The appellant has, more than once,

submitted the data of participating healthcare centers to the

KSPCB on various occasions. It is a device adopted by the

4threspondent to help the 5th respondent and has made such

a report against the appellant. When once the appellant is

given authorization and consent for disposal of bio-medical

waste in its CBWTF, from the healthcare units of the three

districts, it is the sole responsibility of the appellant to collect

all the bio-medical waste generated by all the healthcare

units in the three districts, whether it is government or

private hospitals, clinics, etc.      The data furnished by the

appellant in the monthly report to the respondent authorities

is with regard to the bigger hospitals and not the clinics.

However, having sensed the mischief by the 4th respondent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                 15</span>
 in making out a case for establishment of another CBWTF,

the appellant is submitting the details of all the health care

units of each one of the districts from where the appellant is

collecting bio-medical waste. Notwithstanding the fact that

none of the clinics nor the nursing homes have made any

complaints against the appellants for the last 10 years and

that the appellant is not collecting the bio-medical waste, the

4th respondent was bent upon to make out a case against

the appellant unit. To overcome such deficiency, the 4th

respondent has stated in the recommendation dated

18.10.2012 that there were oral complaints against the

appellant. It is unfortunate on the part of the officers of the

KSPCB for using this as a devise and making allegations

against the appellants' CBWTF which is carrying its

obligation to the satisfaction of one and all. At no point of

time, the respondents nor the CPCB, have received any

complaints from any quarter in the last 10 years. Apart from

the same, there are no allegations from the neighbors of the

appellant's CBWTF with regard to causing any damage to

the environment and ecology and causing health hazard in

disposing of the bio-medical waste scientifically. In fact, as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                              16</span>
 and when the tests were conducted by the officers of the

KSPCB or the CPCB, all the values were found to be within

permissible limits. The CPCB has appreciated the work of

the appellant in maintaining its CBWTF. The District Health

Officer, Mysore, by way of a reply dated 05.07.2012

addressed to the Deputy Commissioner, Mysore, informed

that the appellant's CBWTF is carrying its activities

scientifically and they have not found the bio-medical waste

stored more than 48 hours. Though the capacity of the

appellant CBWTF is to dispose of bio-medical waste

generated from 15,000 beds, it is getting bio-medical waste

from only around 5000 beds. The laboratory analysis of the

CBWTF of the appellant shows that the parameters of the

appellant are well within the prescribed limits of the KSPCB

as per the report of the Ganesh Consultancy and Analysis

Services, recognized by the KSPCB. A similar letter has

been written by the District Health Officer, Chamarajnagar,

to the appellant requesting his cooperation in sensitizing/

conducting awareness regarding the subject.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                             17</span>
</p><p id="p_18"> 11. As the appellant has sensed the gravity of the situation

of proposing to grant of Consent for Establishment to

establish another CBWTF in favour of the fifth respondent,

the appellant had addressed several letters to the KSPCB

dated 08.10.2012 and 11.10.2012 disputing the feasibility

report submitted by the 5threspondent with statistics. The

appellant also approached the CPCB on 08.10.2012

regarding the 2nd respondents' proposal to establish second

CBWTF at Mysore. The CPCB by its letter dated 22.10.2012

addressed to the 2nd respondent informed that the appellant

had made a representation objecting for the establishment

of the second CBWTF at Mysore and also contended that it

is contrary to the guidelines issued by the CPCB and further

directed   the   respondent   authorities   to   examine   the

complainant of the appellant in the light of the provisions of

the Bio-medical Waste (Maintenance and Handling) Rules,

1998 as amended and the guidelines and to submit the

report. However, the 2nd respondent authorities refused to

take note of the CPCB communication dated 22.10.2012.

On the other hand, they proceeded to issue the impugned

order dated 24.11.2012 permitting the fourth respondent to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                              18</span>
 establish one more CBWTF at Mysore by issuing Consent

for Establishment.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">12. The CFE is issued for a period of 5 years which is

generally not the usual practice. According to the guidelines

for common bio medical waste facility Section K- point iii

and iv reads as follows;
</p>
<p id="p_21">
Iii) "The SPCB / PCC upon receipt of such work plan shall,

authorization under Bio-medical waste (management and

to the proponent." However, the respondents, for reasons

best known to them have in the 8th clause authorized the

applicant, the third respondent to collect the waste from

health care centers in Mysore in the Consent to Establish

impermissible and contrary to the rules.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">13.   The appellant being aggrieved by the action of the

respondent Nos. 2 to 4 in issuing the impugned Consent for

Establishment, bearing No.PCB/SEO/EO/58/BMW/2512/909

dated 24.11.2012, in favour of the 5th respondent filed two

separate appeals under the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a>s in Appeal

Nos. 48/2012 and 49/2012 before the Appellate Authority,

Bangalore on 10.12.2012. The Appellate Authority has

stayed the impugned order of the Consent for Establishment

of the respondent Nos 2 to 3 dated 24.11.2012 on

12.12.2012 and issued notices.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">14.   In the course of hearing, when the question with

regard to the guidelines framed by the CPCB was an issue,

the appellant thought it fit to implead the Union of India as

well as the CPCB. Accordingly, an application was filed on

19.02.2013 to implead them in the above appeals before the

Appellate Authority. However, the Appellate Authority

refused to consider the said application to implead them and

accordingly the said application was dismissed.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                             20</span>
</p><p id="p_27"> 15. The Appellate Authority has filed objections in a similar

matter i.e., in Appeal No.53/2012 and made submissions

that the same objections are adopted in Appeal Nos. 48 and

49/2012. Similarly, the 5th respondent in whose favour the

impugned Consent for Establishment was issued for

establishment one more CBWTF filed detailed objections,

contending that the action of the respondent Nos. 2 to 4 in

permitting the 5th respondent to establish one more CBWTF

as per impugned order of Consent to Establish dated

24.11.2012, is just and proper. It is further contended that

there is no prohibition for establishment of any number of

CBWTF and the guidelines issued by the CPCB under

Column No. 8-Coverage Area of CBWTF has no relevance

for the facts and circumstances of the case and said

guidelines are not binding on the State Pollution Control

Board.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">16. When the Appellate Authority sought to know about the

appellant's average receipt of bio-medical waste, particularly

incinerable waste and number of beds it is serving, the

appellant has filed a memo dated 27.02.2013 during the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                              21</span>
 course of the argument, which clearly discloses that the

appellant's CBWTF is running under-capacity. As against its

capacity of 100 kg per hour of treating incinerable waste, it

is working only 3 to 4 hours a day and as such it was not

even utilizing its 1/3 capacity. The total number of beds was

not more than 5500 from all the three districts. There were

no complaints whatsoever from any quarters against the

appellant in collecting and disposing of the bio-medical

wastes.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">17. The matter was elaborately heard by the Appellate

Authority and the judgment was reserved. In the meantime

the appellant also approached the Union of India and the

CPCB for clarification with regard to the application of the

guidelines issued by the CPCB. The CPCB with a covering

letter dated 01.04.2013 enclosed the clarification dated

25.03.2013 issued by the Union Ministry, clarifying that while

permitting additional CBWTF        one should ensure fixed

coverage area for each of the authorized CBWTF taking into

account the provisions in the guidelines. On receipt of the

covering letter dated 01.04.2013 from the CPCB along with

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                              22</span>
 the clarification, the appellant has filed the same on

10.04.2013 before the Appellate Authority. The same was

acknowledged by the Appellate Authority.


</p><p id="p_32">18. The appellant herein had strenuously contended before

the Appellate Authority that the respondent Nos. 2 to 4 ought

not to have permitted one more CBWTF to be established

within 25 km from the appellant's CBWTF. Further, it is also

stated before the Appellate Authority that the site where the

proposed CBWTF of the 5th respondent to be situated is on

the highway and in proximity to the residential areas. The

Appellate Authority, by its order dated 20.04.2013 dismissed

the Appeal Nos.48/2012 connected with Appeal No.49/2012

filed by the appellant under both the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">Air Act</a>s on

the ground that the KSPCB had all the powers to grant

consent for CBWTF under the E P Act,1986, as there is no

restriction restricting its power. Further, an observation in

the Lok Adalath of the Hon'ble High Court Legal Service

Committee was also referred which has nothing to do with

the permission to establish additional CBWTF by the

KSPCB. In fact, the Lok Adalath proceeding was held in the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                             23</span>
 month of May 2012, whereas the process for considering the

grant of one more CBWTF was initiated on 12.03.2012.

Therefore, the observations of the Lok Adalath dated

02.05.2012 cannot have any bearing in considering the case

of the 4th respondent application for grant of Consent for

Establishment of one more CBWTF within 25 km, from the

appellant's CBWTF.This point was raised before the Lok

Adalath at the instance of 5th respondent through his own

men who participated in the above proceedings.The 4th

respondent being the Environmental Officer of the Regional

Office at Mysore has sworn in a false affidavit and produced

inflated figures to see that the 5th respondent gets Consent

for Establishment of one more CBWTF within 25 km from

the appellant's CBWTF. The Appellate Authority, even

without considering the case of how the guidelines are not

binding on the KSPCB, has virtually discarded the same,

holding that the said guidelines are subject to Acts and

Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_33">
</p><p id="p_34">19. The guidelines issued by the CPCB, is in exercise of its

powers under the Bio-medical Waste (Management and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                             24</span>
 Handling) Rules, 1998 only. The guidelines also have been

made part of the Bio-medical Rules. It is at the stage of

issuing Gazette Notification by the Central Government.

Therefore, it cannot be said by the Appellate Authority that

the KSPCB need not be bound by the same and there are

no restrictions and prohibitions on the KSPCB to give

permission for additional CBWTF, contrary to guidelines.

Accordingly,   the   Appeal   Nos.48   and   49/2012    were

dismissed by the Appellate Authority by its common order

dated 20.04.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">20.   The appellant being aggrieved by the judgment dated

20.04.2013 of the Appellate Authority in Appeal Nos.48 and

49/2012 is filing this appeal. Hence, the appellant herein

has prayed to set aside the order dated 20.04.2013 passed

by the Appellate Authority, Bangalore in Appeal Nos.48 &amp;

49/2012, by allowing this appeal and also grant the relief as

prayed for in the Appeals No. 48 &amp; 49/2012, filed before the

Appellate Authority, Bangalore.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">21. Per contra, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th respondents have filed a

common reply countering the contentions putforth by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                              25</span>
 appellant. The brief defence of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th

respondents herein is narrated below:
</p>
<p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">22. The respondents are responsible to ensure effective

disposal of bio-medical waste and the 2nd respondent is

vested with the authority to issue consent for establishment

of common bio-medical waste management treatment

facility in adherence to due process of law. The consent for

the establishment issued by the 2nd respondent to the 5th

respondent on 24.11.2012 is legal and valid. Further, the

respondents are not specifically prevented from issuing

consent for establishment of more than one waste

management facility in an area. The appellant is abusing its

position as a sole operator of CBWTF in the particular three

districts. The respondents have been receiving various

complaints both oral and written against the appellants

regarding ineffective and improper methods of bio-medical

waste disposal in the region. Hence, if the respondents are

allowed to operate without any alternative, the object of

effective bo-medical waste management will be defeated.

The respondents also took notice of the increasing demand

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                             26</span>
 for effective bio-medical waste treatment facility and with the

current facility the appellant would not be able to manage

the increase in demand. Hence, there is an imminent need

for establishing a new CBWTF in the same region. The

appellant has filed the current appeal with the sole intention

to delay the process of establishment of alternative

arrangement for disposing the bio-medical waste in the three

districts.
</p>
<p id="p_41">23.    The appeals have been filed mainly because of

business rivalry and ulterior motive of the appellant to

prevent 5th respondent from establishing and operating a

CBWTF and the appellant has no locus standi to question

the validity of the consent order dated 24.11.2012 issued by

the 2nd respondent, when the order was issued after

following the due process of law.
</p>
<p id="p_42">
</p><p id="p_43">24.   The appellant had applied to the 2nd respondent for

grant of consent to establish and operate a CBWTF at Sy.

No.25 of Varuna Village, Mysore. The Board, after

scrutinizing the application, issued consent for erecting and

operating the CBWTF plant vide its order dated 02.05.2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                              27</span>
 which was renewed periodically by the 2nd respondent. The

consent order under Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air Act</a>s and authorization

under Bio-Medical Waste (Management and Handling)

Rules, 1998 were issued by the respondent to the appellant

to operate the facility and collect the bio-medical waste from

the       Health     Care      Establishments           in    Mysore,

Chamarajanagar, Coorg and Hassan Districts in the State of

Karnataka. The 2nd respondent by consent order dated

31.07.2013 had renewed the consent given to the appellant

for a period till 30.06.2012. However, the said consent had

been granted by the 2nd respondent to the appellant to

collect     bio-medical      waste    from      the     health     care

establishments in Mysore, Chamarajanagar and Coorg

Districts only. The authorization granted by the 2nd

respondent under the Bio-Medical Waste Rules,1998 was

also      extended   till   30.06.2015   vide     its    letter   dated

09.10.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_44">
</p><p id="p_45">25. The 5th respondent had applied for obtaining consent

from the 2nd respondent to establish a CBWTF on

12.03.2012 in furtherance of which an inspection of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                 28</span>
 proposed project site was conducted by the Regional

Officer. The 2nd respondent after duly complying with the

procedures established under law granted consent dated

24.11.2012 to the 5th respondent to establish a CBWTF for

collection, reception, transportation, treatment and disposal

of bio-medical waste generated in the districts of Mysore,

Coorg and Chamarajnagar. Aggrieved by the consent to

establish the CBWTF issued by the 2nd respondent, the

appellant approached the Appellate Authority to set aside

the consent order dated 24.11.2012 and by the order dated

20.04.2013 the said Appellate Authority dismissed the

appeals filed by the appellant and hence, the appellant has

approached this Tribunal for relief. The following are some

of the shortfall observed by the respondent, KSPCB

authorities:
</p>
<p id="p_46">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      a. Operational shortfall regarding collection of wastes
         from the health care establishments.
      b. Shortfall during transportation of waste in respective
         colour coded containers and washing of vehicles
         used to transport bio-medical waste.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                              29</span>
      c. Shortfall during treatment of bio-medical wastes,
        effluent generated during the treatment of the bio-
        medical waste.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     d. There were complaints from the health care
        establishments for not collecting bio-medical wastes
        in time and storage of the same beyond the time
        laid down in schedule leading to air pollution.
     e. The bio-medical wastes were disposed in municipal
        dustbins and in landfill sites.

</blockquote><p id="p_47">26. Initially, since the appellant was a newly established

facility, the respondents had discussed the same with the

appellant and had instructed them to rectify the same at the

earliest. When the complaints were received continuously

the second respondent had issued notices on several

occasions. Apart from that, the CPCB had also issued

directions under section 5 of the EP Act, 1986 on

04.04.2008 for non-compliance. As regards the averments

that the appellant was not given an opportunity of being

heard, the respondents are not bound to consult with the

appellant and that the appellant does not have a right of

being heard. The Bio-Medical Waste (Management and

Handling) Rules,1988 have been framed under the E P Act,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                              30</span>
 1986 and as per rule 14 of the said rules, the Municipal

Corporations, Municipal Boards or Urban, Local Bodies shall

be    responsible     for   providing     suitable     common

disposal/incineration sites for the bio-medical wastes

generated in the area under their jurisdiction, it shall be the

responsibility of the occupier generating            bio-medical

wastes/operator of a bio-medical waste treatment facility to

arrange for suitable sites individually or in association so as

to comply with the provisions of these rules. Rule 14 clearly

states that each and every local body shall provide bio-

medical treatment facility in each and every district and no

where it is stated that a single operator of the facility shall

cover four districts. The object and scheme of the rules is to

have a common disposal/incineration facility within the area

of each Municipal Corporations, Municipal Boards or Urban,

Local Bodies for treating the bio-medical wastes generated

within the respective jurisdiction. The KSPCB had issued

consent to the appellant to collect the bio-medical wastes

from Mysore, Coorg, Hassan and Chamarajanagar districts.

When an agency approached the 2nd respondent to

establish a common treatment facility at Hassan district, it is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                              31</span>
 the responsibility of the KSPCB to provide the agency with

requisite consent and authorization in accordance with the

said rules. The KSPCB need not have to consult or provide

the appellant an opportunity of being heard before permitting

the common treatment facility at Hassan District. The

respondents have not taken any step contrary to the Bio-

medical Waste Rules. Rule 7(8) of the Bio-medical Waste

(Management and Handling) Rules,1998          states that the

authority may cancel or suspend the authorization, if the

occupier has failed to comply with the provisions of the act

or these rules and the reasons should be recorded. A

reasonable opportunity of being heard must be granted

before canceling or suspending the said authorization and

the respondents had not cancelled the authorization nor

suspended    the   authorization   of   the   appellant.   The

proceedings initiated by the appellant herein is based on the

guidelines of the CPCB with regard to the coverage area of

the CBWTF. According to the guidelines in any area, only

one CBWTF may be allowed to cater up to 10,000 beds at

the approved rate by the prescribed authority. A CBWTF

shall not be allowed to cater to the health care units beyond
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                             32</span>
 a radius of 150 km. However, in any area where 10,000

beds are not available within a radius of 150 km, another

CBWTF may be allowed to cater to the health care units

situated outside the said 150 km. A plain reading of the said

guidelines issued by the CPCB would clearly support the

case of the respondents herein where it did not restrict the

number of units to be established in a particular area or

district. However, it gives the maximum number of beds that

can be catered by the CBWTF. Further, it also prescribes

the maximum radius in which the CBWTF can be operated.

Therefore, the appellant has misrepresented the guidelines

given by the CPCB to suit to his convenience. Any

guidelines or notifications issued by a statutory authority

shall reflect the objects and language of the acts and rules

as the statutory authority could be deriving the powers to

issue guidelines only as per the act and rules. Therefore, in

the present case either in the EP Act, 1986, or in the Bio-

medical Waste Rules, 1998 prohibit or restrict the

respondents from establishing more than one CBWTF in a

particular locality or any guidelines issued by the CPCB

should be necessarily in consonance with the acts and rules.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                             33</span>
 Therefore, even assuming that the guidelines of CPCB

restrict the number of CBWTF, the same has no legal basis

and cannot override the act or rules and it would not bind the

respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">27. The inspection report is prepared by the respondents

based on the inputs that are provided by the appellant. As

per the condition stipulated in the authorization, the operator

of the facility, namely the appellant is required to furnish the

requisite details every month in Form E, but the appellant

did not submit the same periodically. The data provided by

the appellant was not only irregular but also unreliable and

highly   approximate.     (emphasis     supplied).   For    non

submission of the monthly returns in the prescribed form, the

appellant was called for a personal hearing on 09.01.2013.


</p><p id="p_50">28. The total capacity of the CBWTF plant was subject to

the quantity submitted by the appellant to the respondents

and the statement regarding under-utilization of the plant

was mentioned based on the misleading and fraudulent oral

submissions of the appellant to the inspecting officers. The

appellant does not have any locus standi to question or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                               34</span>
 comment on the contents of the feasibility report filed by any

applicant, i.e., in this case the 5th respondent. The feasibility

report   submitted     by   the     5th   respondent    to   the

respondents/KSPCB was considered along with the World

Health Organization report and other available information

published above as well as from the CPCB. The quantity

submitted as per the list of health care establishments in

Mysore, Chamarajanagar and Coorg Districts is correct.

Hence, the statement of the appellant regarding projection

being imaginary and inflated by the officials of the KSPCB

cannot be accepted. The total quantity of bio-medical waste

generated as per the records of the KSPCB in 21 healthcare

establishments on the basis of the inspection made on 18th

to 21st of December 2012 was 1230.87 kg/day and as per

the records submitted by the appellant it was only 579.10

kg/day. This would indicate that the appellant is not

collecting the entire bio-medical waste or not quantifying the

same as per the authorization conditions. The submission of

low quantities to show that his facility is operating on lower

capacity to avoid establishment of additional facility. The

CBWTF of the appellant was inspected by the District

 Administration on 17.03.2013 and observed that the bio-

medical wastes were collected and stored in an unscientific

manner, the operator of the facility was not practicing colour

codes for storing bio-medical waste and all categories of

wastes were stored in one container, the incinerator was not

in operation and there was no record in the facility about the

regular   operation    of    the    incinerator,     information   on

collection, quantity and disposal of bio-medical waste was

not available in the facility, even the staff of the facility were

unable to furnish any information on the same, the

employees of the facility have not been provided with safety

equipment and safety systems as per rule and over all the

CBWTF was not operating as per the Bio-medical Waste

Management Rules,1998 and as per in the information

gathered from the officials present at the time of inspection,

that the operator of the facility is collecting exorbitant fees

from the health care units and he is not collecting the bio-

medical wastes from number of clinics.

<p id="p_51">
</p><p id="p_52">29. A notice was issued to the appellant on 19.03.2013.

There     is   no     rule   or         regulation   restricting   the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                   36</span>
 respondent/KSPCB to take action on an application for

issuing consent for establishment. The appellant is trying to

bring out a fictitious link between the dates and events and

wants to base its case on fiction. Whenever of the officers of

the 2nd respondent inspected the health care units, there

were oral complaints regarding non-collection of the bio-

medical wastes within the stipulated time thereby the

intervention of the 2nd respondent was required by the health

care units. When an analysis wad made from the effluent

and emission samples collected, the values of the BOD and

COD of the treated effluent and particulate matter and acid

mist from the emission exceeded the stipulated standard

and notices in that regard were sent to the appellant. The

respondents have replied in detail to the letter dated

22.10.2012 issued by the CPCB in letter dated 04.12.2012

explaining the reasons for considering the establishment of

CBWTF. The consent for establishment for the CBWTF was

issued in accordance with <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_12">sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_13">21</a> of the Water

and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_14">Air Act</a>s and the proponent of the facility cannot start

collecting waste from the health care establishments before

establishing the facility and the respondents have not issued
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                              37</span>
 any authorization for the said facility under Bio-Medical

Waste (Management and Handling)         Rules, 1998.     The

capital invested and manpower employed for establishing

and operating the CBWTF is a normal requirement and the

appellants were not compelled in any way to establish the

same. There is enough scope for establishing additional

facility since Mysore is projected as health city which is

leading in establishment of new hospitals, multi-speciality

hospitals and clinics contributing enormous quantity of bio-

medical wastes which need proper treatment for which

additional facility is required. As per the present scenario,

the common treatment facility operated by the appellant is

not collecting the bio-medical wastes from all the healthcare

units, and the bio-medical wastes are not being collected

from all the units with whom agreement is entered with. The

consent was issued to the 5th respondent only after

considering the suitability of site in accordance with the

guidelines. There were many complaints received by the

respondents both oral and written against the appellant and

the respondents have also issued show cause notice to get

suitable replies from the appellant. The Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_15">Air Act</a>s
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                             38</span>
 provide only maximum time limit for processing the

application but not any minimum time limit. The time taken

for processing the application depends upon various factors

like pending applications, direction of location to be

inspected. Since there is no specific rule preventing the

respondents to process the application in short time, the

allegation of the appellant in this regard is fictitious and

imaginative. The requirement for establishing a second

CBWTF arose because of inefficiency of the appellant and

not due to any statement made by a representative of an

NGO and the 3rd respondent had not misused the Lok Adalat

proceedings and the 2nd respondent had issued the consent

for establishment of additional facility after carefully

examining and complying with the provisions of the Bio-

Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules,1998

and not merely on the feasibility report filed by the 5th

respondent, the 2nd to 4th respondents herein are regulatory

authorities and issued the consent for establishment to the

5th respondent on its making an application and the same

was issued considering all scenario for scientific handling of

bio-medical wastes within the frame work of rules and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                              39</span>
 respective Acts.   The question of getting feasibility report

from a third party did not arise. The appellant has not been

discharging its functions efficiently and has been portraying

as if functioning "under capacity" when the facts and figures

suggest that the appellant has not been picking up the bio-

medical wastes from all the health care units as required to

be done by the appellant. The 2nd respondent has taken a

policy decision not to allow the operation of captive

incineration within the city limits in order to ensure emission

regulations and the 2nd respondent has issued the consent

for establishment of additional facility only after considering

additional quantity of bio-medical waste generation and

upcoming health projects and for scientific management of

bio-medical wastes. Similarly, consent for establishment of

additional facilities was given in Bangalore. The order dated

20.04.2013 passed by the 1st respondent is a detailed order

and has dealt with all the applicable acts, rules, regulations

and guidelines.
</p>
<p id="p_53">
</p><p id="p_54">30. Hence, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th respondents seek to dismiss
the appeals.
</p>
<p id="p_55">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                              40</span>
</p><p id="p_56"> 31.     The 5th respondent would state in reply that the

appellant has approached the Tribunal based on an

erroneous reading of the statutory provisions and by

misconstruing the rules, regulations and guidelines and is

not entitled to any relief in law or equity. With the dismissal

of the appeals filed by the appellant before the Appellate

Authority and confirming the impugned order passed by the

2nd   respondent     in   No.PCB/SEO/Eo/258/BMW/2512/909

dated     24.11.2012,     consent     was    granted   for   the

establishment of CBWTF at Sy.No.82, Guggegoudanapura

village, Jayapura Hobli, Mysore Taluk and District by the 5th

respondent     for    collection,    reception,   transportation,

treatment and disposal of bio-medical waste and the

appellant has no locus standi to challenge the grant of

Consent to Establish as no vested right of the appellant is

infringed.
</p>
<p id="p_57">
</p><p id="p_58">32. In exercise of the powers conferred by sections 6, 8,

and 25 of the E P Act, 1986, the Central Government has

notified the rules for the management and handling of bio-

medical waste under the Bio-medical Waste (Management

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                41</span>
 and Handling) Rules, 1998. The rules read with the

provisions of the EP Act, 1986 comprehensively regulate the

management and handling of the disposal of bio-medical

waste. The EP Act, 1986 is a beneficial regulatory

enactment for the protection and improvement of the

environment and prevention of hazards to human being,

other living creatures, plants and property with the objective

to create harmony between development and protection of

the environment. The Bio-medical (Management and

Handling) Rules, 1998 comprehensively provide for all

aspects   relating   to   segregation,   packing,   generation,

collection, reception, storage, transportation, treatment,

handling and disposal of bio-medical waste. The acts and

rules framed thereunder are in furtherance of the objective

of protecting and ensuring cleaner environment and is not a

legislative enactment for the regulation of trade, business or

commerce, Independent of the aims and objectives of the

enactment. Any restriction placed on the establishment of a

new bio-medical treatment facility must serve the object of

the Act and facilitate the creation of efficient waste handling

facility which will lead to a cleaner environment. All rules,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                               42</span>
 regulations and guidelines are formulated under the act and

rules are to be read in conformity with the express intention

of the Legislature as enacted in the Act and the provisions of

<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_16">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_17">Article 301</a> of the Constitution of India.


</p><p id="p_59">33. The appellant has mistakenly interpreted the guidelines

framed by the CPCB in the year 2003 as if they prohibit the

establishment of any new CBWTF within a radius of 150 km

of an existing CBWTF. The CPCB has formulated the

guidelines by way of a CBWTF as an option as per para 2 in

the introduction. While referring to the coverage area of a

CBWTF the guidelines state as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_60">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "D. Coverage area of CBWTF:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">
      In any area, only one CBWTF may be allowed to

     cater upto 10,000 beds at the approved rate by

     the prescribed authority. A CBTF shall not be

     allowed to cater healthcare units situated

     beyond a radius of 150 km. However, in any

     area where 10,000 beds are not available within

     a radius of 150 km, another CBWTF may be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                               43</span>
      allowed to cater the healthcare units situated

     outside the said 150 km. "
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">
</blockquote><p id="p_61">34. A plain reading of the language used in the above

guidelines does not in any way impose any prohibition or

restriction on the setting up of a new CBWTF and that one

facility may be allowed to cater up to 10,000 beds at the

approved rate and that such facility shall not cater to the

healthcare units beyond a radius of 150 km. The guidelines

therein contain an exception which provide that another

facility in any area where 10,000 beds are not available may

be allowed to cater to the healthcare units beyond 150 km.

The appellant seeks to construe the rules and guidelines in

a manner which is against the text and language of the act,

rules and guidelines framed thereunder. There is no

restriction on the setting up of or establishing a new bio-

medical waste handling facilities in the guidelines. Any law

which seeks to restrict or prohibit any occupation, business,

trade or commerce must be explicit and in conformity with

the Constitutional provisions. It is settled position in law that

apprehension that the profitability or economic viability of a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                               44</span>
 private enterprise is likely to be reduced by competition is no

ground for the authorities to consider in ensuring the

fundamental right of all the citizens under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_18">Article, 14</a> and <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_19">19</a>

and the right under <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_20">Article 301</a> of the Constitution of India.

While the general rule of freedom of trade as enunciated in

<a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_21">Article 301</a> of the Constitution may be subject to restrictions

as imposed by law by Parliament and by State Legislature

and no restriction could be imposed by executive action. The

construction sought to be put by the appellant would operate

and restrict the right of all citizens to establish and carry on

any business, trade and commerce directly in violation of

<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_22">Article 14</a><a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_23">, 19</a> and <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_24">301</a> of the Constitution and would create

an impermissible monopoly in favour of the applicant. No

barriers for entry are contemplated by the act or the rules

and neither can monopolies be created by construing the

rules to prohibit the establishment of new waste disposal

facilities in conformity with the prescribed rules and

regulations   which   would    satisfy   the   standards    and

parameters laid down thereunder. The application of the 5th

respondent herein for consent to set up a CBWTF as per the

standards and specifications prescribed is in conformity with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                               45</span>
 the law and the authorities have accepted the same and

have given consent as contemplated under the acts, rules

and guidelines and the appellant cannot abuse the process

of law and permitted to create a monopoly at the cost of

efficiency and public interest in violation of law.


</p><p id="p_62">35. The KSPCB vide Notification No. KSPCB/CE2/EO/

BMW /CBWTF/Notification/2012-13/1288 dated 18.03.2013

has notified that the authorization and consents issued by

the KSPCB so far is hereby amended without service area

mentioned therein for all the common bio-medical waste

treatment facilities in Karnataka. The contention of the

appellant has been made without reference to the KSPCB

notification issued and in force as on today and the applicant

is seeking a relief which would be in violation of the laws,

lead to restriction on competition, lead to inefficiencies,

create vested interests in perpetuating exploitation at the

final cost to the public and set up illegal barriers to carrying

on the business, trade and commerce. The interpretation of

the appellant in regard to the creation of monopoly right

sought to be made by the appellant is also against the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                46</span>
 provisions   of the Karnataka Transparency in Public

Procurements Act, 1999 and rules framed thereunder.


</p><p id="p_63">36. The appellant by way of these appeals cannot seek to

make a new law nor claim rights not contemplated by the

act, rules and guidelines thereunder. The act of the 2nd

respondent in allowing the establishment of a new CBWTF

at Hassan within 150 km of the appellant's CBWTF is in

conformity with the law and the appellant has not challenged

the same. The state of affairs in the disposal of bio-medical

waste in Karnataka as evidenced by the Lok Adhalat

proceedings presided by the sitting Judge of the Hon'ble

High Court of Karnataka further support the requirement of

more CBWTF to improve efficiency and better service in the

waste disposal.   The averments in the memorandum of

appeal regarding the proceedings before the Hon'ble High

Court Legal Services Committee at the regional Lok Adhalat

at Mysore are inappropriate and show a contemptuous lack

of respect and disregard for the sanctity of the proceedings

before the Hon'ble High Court Legal Services Committee at

the regional Lok Adhalat at Mysore. The allegations are

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                             47</span>
 prima facie false, factually incorrect and the appellant by

misrepresentation is seeking to abuse the process of law

before the Tribunal. The appellant cannot hinder the function

of the statutory authorities in accordance with law or deny

the rights of any person under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_25">Article 14</a><a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_26">, 19</a> and <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_27">301</a> of the

Constitution and the provisions of the E P Act, 1986 and the

Bio-medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules,

1998 and other statutory enactments.
</p>
<p id="p_64">37. Therefore, the KSPCB has acted in accordance with law

in issuing Consent to Establish a CBTWF to the respondent

No. 5 and the Appellate Authority has rightly upheld the

same, dismissing the appeals of the appellant herein before

it, in conformity with law. Hence, the 5th respondent seeks to

dismiss the appeals on hand. The learned counsel for the 5th

respondents relied on the following judgments of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court of India in support of his contentions:


</p><p id="p_65">(i) '<a href="/doc/1298157/" id="a_28">The Nagar Rice and Flour Mills vs. N.T. Gowda</a> (1970 (1)

the appeals by an order dated 03.02.2014 of the Tribunal in

these appeals states in his reply affidavit that the CPCB had

received a representation from the appellant vide letter No.

Nil dated 08.10.2012 requesting the 6th respondent to issue

directions to the 2nd respondent for not allowing more than

one Common Bio Medical Waste Treatment and Disposal

CPCB guidelines regarding coverage area of the CBWTF

and   the   6th   respondent   vide   letter   F.No.   B-31033

(BMW)/30/93/HWMD/3236 dated 22.10.2012 requested the

submit the action taken report. The KSPCB vide letter No.

PCB/SEO/EO/F-CBWTF(II)/BMW/2012/766                      dated

04.12.2012 had informed that they had observed serious

irregularities in operating and management of CBWTF of the

appellant as detailed below:</p>
<p id="p_71">



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                               49</span>
  Karnataka State Pollution Control
  Board had authorised the CBWTF
  of the appellant to cater services
  to    the     member         health      care
  facilities located in the districts,
  namely,         Mysore,          Coorg   and
  Chamarajanagar              of     Karnataka
  considering that there was no
  other facility in the area.
</p><p id="p_72"> As per the inspection carried out
  by      their        Regional        Officer,
  Karnataka State Pollution Control
  Board, Mysore on 18.07.2012, it
  was observed that the appellant's
  CBWTF was not lifting the bio-
</p><p id="p_73">  medical waste on regular basis
  from the member health care
  facilities of the three districts,
  which is a serious violation of
  BMW rules.
</p><p id="p_74"> Upon hearing the discussion for
  setting up of a new CBWTF, the
  Lok         Adalat      had         directed
  Karnataka State Pollution Control
  Board             and               Regional
  Commissioner to find a way out
  and means of giving permission

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                         50</span>
             to such units which are prepared
            to put their plants.
</p><p id="p_75">          Non-lifting of bio-medical waste
            regularly    by    the    appellant's
            CBWTF resulted in receipt of
            complaints from local health care
            facilities and which were taken
            into consideration for allowing
            the 5th respondent's CBWTF at
            Mysore. Further, the bio-medical
            waste generated by the member
            health care facilities should reach
            the CBWTF within 48 hours as per
            the provisions of BMW rules.
</p>
<p id="p_76">39.   The 2nd respondent also informed that the actions

initiated by their Board are in compliance to the directions

issued by the Lok Adalat constituted by the Hon'ble High

Court of Karnataka. Accordingly, the KSPCB initiated action

to permit new CBWTF by the 5th respondent as the CBWTF

operated by the appellant is not coping up with the demand

of the existing member health care facilities.


</p><p id="p_77">40. With regard to the coverage area of the CBWTF, Clause

D of the CPCB guidelines for CBWTF stipulates that:


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                              51</span>
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">            "Ïn any area, only one CBWTF
     may be allowed to cater upto 10,000
     beds at the approved rate by the
     prescribed authority. A CBWTF shall
     not be allowed to cater to the health
     care units beyond a radius of 150 km.
     However, in any area where 10,000
     beds are not available within a radius
     of 150 km, another CBWTF may be
     allowed to cater to the health care units
     situated outside the said 150 km. "

</blockquote><p id="p_78">41. The CPCB guidelines for CBWTF have been formulated

with an aim to ensure effective storage, collection,

transportation, treatment and disposal of bio-medical wastes

and also to ensure that the CBWTF is located as near to its

area of operation as possible so as to minimize the travel

distance in waste collection and to minimize the time taken

between generation to disposal of waste, thus enhancing its

operational flexibility. The location shall be decided in

consultation with the State Pollution Control Board/Pollution

Control   Committee.   As   per   the   Bio-medical   Waste

(Management and Handling) Amendment Rules, 2000, the

local authorities are made responsible for providing suitable

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                             52</span>
 sites within their jurisdiction. The multiple facilities in close

vicinity may lead to unhealthy competition among the

operators and result       in non viable techno-economic

feasibility of CBWTF for disposal of bio-medical waste and

this would ultimately affect the quality service for bio-medical

waste disposal in accordance with the BMW rules by the

CBWTF. The CPCB has, therefore, addressed all the State

Pollution Control Board/Pollution Control Committees in the

country to follow the provisions of the aforesaid CPCB

guidelines with regard to the location and coverage area of

CBWTF while granting clearances for new proposals.

Further, in view of the draft modification of the Bio-medical

Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011, the CPCB

has initiated the process of revising the existing guidelines

for setting up of CBWTF which is not yet finalized. Hence,

the statement made by the appellant on draft Bio-medical

Waste Rules, 2011 is not correct.
</p>
<p id="p_79">
</p><p id="p_80">42. As seen above, both the appeals challenge a common

judgment made by the        Appellate Authority at Bangalore

dismissing the appeals preferred by the appellant in Appeal

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                               53</span>
 Nos. 48 and 49 of 2012 whereby an order dated 24.11.2012

issued by the 2nd respondent/KSPCB in favour of the 5th

respondent under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_29">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_30">Air Act</a> to establish a

CBWTF for collection, reception, transportation, treatment

and disposal of bio-medical waste generated in the districts

of Mysore, Coorg, and Chamrajanagar at Sy.No.82,

Gajjegowandapura village, Jaiypura Hobli, Mysore Taluk

and District.
</p>
<p id="p_81">43. The only question that would arise for determination in

these appeals is: whether the common judgment dated

20.04.2013 of the Appellate Authority is liable to be set aside

for all or any of the reasons putforth by the appellant herein.

Pending the appeals, two miscellaneous applications were

made by the appellant to add the Member Secretary, CPCB,

New Delhi as a party respondent and after hearing both

sides those applications were allowed. The Member

Secretary, CPCB, New Delhi was added as 6th respondent

who was given an opportunity to file a reply.


</p><p id="p_82">44. Advancing the arguments on behalf of the appellant, the

learned counsel would submit that the appellant is the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                              54</span>
 proprietary concern who approached the authorities and

applied for setting up a CBWTF. On scrutiny of the

application and on inspection of the site for the proposed

facility to be erected, the KSPCB by an order dated

02.05.2011 has issued a consent order to establish the

CBWTF under the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_31">Air Act</a>s at Sy.No.25 of Varuna

Village in Mysore. Pursuant to the consent, the appellant

established the plant after completing the construction in the

year 2002 and from the very beginning the appellant was

collecting bio-medical waste from all the four districts of

Mysore, Coorg, Hassan and Chamarajanagar regularly

without any default and the same has been disposed of in a

scientific manner as per the guidelines of the KSPCB. The

appellant was given the consent orders for the last 10 years

without any hindrance or any allegations from any quarter

including hospitals, clinics, nursing homes etc., from all the

four districts till the year 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_83">
</p><p id="p_84">45.   Without giving any opportunity of being heard and

without consulting the appellant, the consent order was

restricted   to   only    to   three   districts   viz.,   Mysore,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                 55</span>
 Chamarajnagar and Coorg thereby excluding the Hassan

District. The appellant did not challenge the same.


</p><p id="p_85">46. The appellant was given the consent from for a period

between 01.07.2012 to 30.06.2015 under the E P Act, 1986.

Equally, the consent was issued by the respondent/KSPCB

as per the Consent Order No. PCB/Shree Consultants/BMW

2012/757 dated 09.10.2012 for a period 01.07.2012 to

30.06.2013 under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_32">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_33">Air Act</a>. Before issuing

the consent order, the authorities of the regional office of the

2nd respondent made necessary inspection. As per the

inspection report dated 18.07.2012, the appellant CBWTF

has the capacity to treat and dispose of the bio-medical

waste of 12,000 to 15,000 beds. However, presently the

CBWTF of the appellant is getting the bio-medical waste

from around 5000 beds only from all the three districts.

Similarly, in the said inspection report, the inspecting officer

has referred to the incinerable waste of 10,000 kg per

month, i.e., 333 kg per day. The capacity of the appellant's

CBWTF is 100 kg per hour and it is now working only 3-4

hours per day. By working in three shifts of 8 hours in a day,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                               56</span>
 the unit can cater upto 2400 kg of incinerable waste per day.

Accordingly, the appellant is not running his CBWTF plant

even to 3 to 4 hours per day and the appellant is running the

CBWTF "under capacity". Apart from that, the above

collection of bio-medical waste is hassle free and on regular

basis and till today there were no complaints against the

appellant's CBWTF unit.
</p>
<p id="p_86">
</p><p id="p_87">47. While the matter stood thus, a proposal was mooted in

March, 2012 for the establishment of a second CBWTF in

Mysore. A letter dated 25.04.2012 was addressed by the

third respondent, Senior Environmental Officer to the 4th

respondent,   Environmental        Officer   directing   the   5th

respondent to submit a feasibility report which was

submitted in a casual manner to the 2nd and 3rd respondents.

It did not disclose the correct factors and figures. But,

inflated figures were furnished in order to make believe that

the capacity of the appellant's CBWTF was not sufficient

and one more CBWTF is needed at Mysore. The figures

found therein were imaginary and inflated which were

intended to suit to the convenience of the 5th respondent. A

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                              57</span>
 discussion that took place at Lok Adhalat of the Hon'ble

High Court of Karnataka in its proceedings dated 02.05.2012

wherein a representation was made to establish CBWTF

within 50 to 60 km of all the places which generate bio-

medical waste was taken advantage as if it was a

permission given for establishing of one more CBWTF. The

5th respondent applied to KSPCB, Mysore on 12.03.2012

and the inspection of the authorities was made on the same

day. The said application was forwarded on 13.03.2012. The

3rd respondent directed the 4th respondent to submit

feasibility report on 25.04.2012.   Following the same, the

recommendations were made to the 2nd respondent to issue

Consent to Establish for CBWTF at Gajjegowdanapura

village, Jaiypura Hobli in Mysore Taluk and District which is

25 km from the appellant's CBWTF.
</p>
<p id="p_88">
</p><p id="p_89">48. In order to overcome the deficiency, the 3rd respondent

has stated in the communication dated 18.10.2012 that

there were oral complaints against the appellant. Thus,

making it as a device against the appellant's CBWTF which

has been carrying on its obligation to the satisfaction of all.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                              58</span>
 At no point of time, the CPCB has received any complaints

from any quarter for the past one decade. In fact, the CPCB

has appreciated the work of the appellant in maintaining the

CBWTF unit. The District Health Officer, Mysore in his reply

dated 05.07.2012 addressed to the Deputy Commissioner,

Mysore informed that the appellant's CBWTF is carrying ion

its activities scientifically and they have not found the bio-

medical waste stored more than 48 hours. Added further the

learned counsel, that aggrieved by the action of the 2nd to 4th

respondents    in   issuing   the   impugned     consent    for

establishment of another CBWTF on 24.11.2012 in favour of

the 5th respondent under Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_34">Air Act</a>s filed two

appeals before the     Appellate Authority. In course of the

hearing, the appellant filed application to implead the CPCB

as a party since the question with regard to the guidelines

framed by the CPCB was an issue. But, the said application

was dismissed on unsustainable grounds. It is a fresh

contention of the counsel for the appellant that the CPCB is

a statutory body formed even prior to coming into force of

the E P Act, 1986 and now it operates as a technical wing of

the MoEF. With regard to the coverage area, the CPCB
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                              59</span>
 guidelines as they existed in 2003 clearly prescribes that in

any area only one CBWTF may be allowed to cater upto

10,000 beds. It also prescribes that where 10,000 beds are

not available within a radius of 150 km, another CBWTF

may be allowed to cater the health care units situate outside

150 km. The draft revised guidelines of the CPCB have not

been made a part of Bio-medical Waste Management Rules

and draft gazette notification has not been issued in which

the amended rules were brought in force. The consistent

interpretation of the guidelines regarding the coverage area

of CBWTF is to permit only one unit in a radius of 150 km is

fortified by all the subsequent revised guidelines. Even

assuming that the 5th respondent can raise an issue as to

whether the CPCB guidelines are mandatory in the manner

of granting consent by KSPCB, it is not open to the KSPCB

or any other pollution control authorities in India to disregard

the guidelines of the CPCB as they are binding force on

them. The CPCB guidelines have been framed after

consultation with all State Pollution Control Boards. The unit

of the 5th respondent is proposed to be located within 40 km

from the appellant's CBWTF. The inspection report relating
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                               60</span>
 to the appellant's unit in July, 2010 just prior to grant of

renewal of consent and approval shows that the appellant's

CBWTF has the capacity of 12,000 beds, at present

covering 5000 beds per day. The report also states that the

quantum of incinerable waste generated is only 10,000 kg

per month which is approximately 333 kg per day. Contrarily,

the feasibility report submitted by the 5th respondent in

3/2012 for grant of consent shows as though 5000 kg per

day of bio-medical waste was being generated which is not

only far from truth but also did not categorize any waste as

per rules as incinerable, autoclave value etc., in order to

arrive at a correct figure. The report also falsely claims that

there were 8000 beds. The complaint made by the appellant

on 08.10.2012 to the MoEF and also directly to the KSPCB

on 11.10.2012 were not considered. The CPCB in the letter

dated 22.10.2012 addressed to the 2nd respondent calling

for an action taken report based on the representation of the

appellant objecting to the 2nd CBWTF and directing to follow

the Bio-Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules,

1998 and the CPCB guidelines were ignored by the KSPCB,

the KSPCB proceeded to grant consent to the 5th
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                              61</span>
 respondent for the establishment of CBWTF. By allowing the

establishment of one more or many CBWTF, the whole

objective would be defeated. The KSPCB has also failed to

consider individual merits of the proposal of the 5th

respondent for setting up one more CBWTF independently

with reference to the statutory rules and CPCB guidelines.

On the contrary, unnecessary references have been made

to unrealistic data produced by the 5th respondent. The

CPCB guidelines have been made mandatory and made

part of the rules of 2011. Relying on the revised draft

guidelines of the CPCB published in February 2014

regarding the coverage area, the counsel would submit that

the consent granted in favour of the 5th respondent was

against the guidelines. The guidelines of the CPCB have a

binding nature and have force. The CBWTF can be

established in any State or Union Territory only if a unit is

set up and operated as per the specifications prescribed by

the CPCB with regard to location, technical equipments,

coverage area etc. Hence, the KSPCB cannot maintain that

they followed the guidelines of the CPCB with regard to all

specifications, but no with regard to the coverage area.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                              62</span>
</p><p id="p_90"> 49.   Assailing the impugned judgment of the Appellate

Authority, the learned counsel for the appellant herein would

submit that the Appellate Authority did not consider the

scheme of Bio-medical Waste (Management and Handling)

Rules, 1998 which explained the need for a CBWTF before

concluding that the KSPCB has all the authority to decide

whether one or more CBWTF can be allowed in the same

area. The draft amendment to the rules of 2011 that have

made the CPCB guidelines as part of the rules with clarity

on coverage area of each CBWTF, was consciously ignored

by the Appellate Authority in spite of the appellant bringing

the same to the notice by filing an affidavit. Unnecessary

reference to the proceedings before the Lok Adhalat of the

Hon'ble High Court of      Karnataka which gave general

directions without considering any rules and regulations

governing the field which were relied on by the Appellate

Authority. The Appellate Authority did not even consider the

objection of the appellant that the Lok Adhalat proceedings

was a ruse to grant consent to the 5th respondent. The

Appellate Authority did not consider the specific direction

from the CPCB as contained in its letter dated 25.03.2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                             63</span>
 addressed to all the State Pollution Control Boards

regarding coverage area of CBWTF. The Appellate Authority

did not approach the issue as per the existing rules. Instead,

it considered the issue as if it was a challenge to the CPCB

guidelines. The 5th respondent cannot be heard to argue the

<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_35">Article 19(1) (g)</a> of the Constitution of India regarding his

freedom to do business in any area without challenging the

rules or guidelines which have to be followed.       Thus the

impugned order of consent to establish dated 24.11.2012

granted to the 5th respondent is against the spirit of the Bio-

medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998

read with the guidelines issued by the CPCB and thus by

looking from    any angle      the impugned      order dated

24.11.2012     for consent to establish granted to the 5th

respondent cannot stand. Hence, the appeals have got to be

allowed by setting aside the order of the Appellate Authority.


</p><p id="p_91">50.   Countering     the   above     contentions,    the   2nd

respondent/KSPCB would submit that the MoEF, in exercise

of powers conferred under sections 6, 8 and 25 of the EP

Act, 1986, framed Bio-medical Waste (Management and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                              64</span>
 Handling) Rules, 1998 which have already come into force

and these rules shall be applicable to all those who are

responsible for generation, collection, receiving, storage,

transportation, disposal and handling the bio-medical wastes

in whatever form. The rule 14 makes it clear that it is the

responsibility of the Municipal Corporations and local bodies

etc., to provide suitable incineration plants. For the bio-

medical wastes generated outside the jurisdiction of the

local bodies, it is the responsibility of the occupier to arrange

for suitable sites. When the rules are framed under the EP

Act,1986, they have to prevail over any other guidelines. It is

for the KSPCB to decide as to how the BMW should be

disposed of and as such the KSPCB has power to decide on

the number of operators necessary for the job. Under rule 14

of the Bio-medical Waste (Management and Handling)

Rules, 1988, no one can claim any exclusive right to operate

CBWTF in any particular area and that the appellant cannot

claim monopoly. The KSPCB has taken a policy decision to

permit the setting up of several CBWTF in all the districts

keeping in view the public interest to improve the quality of

service in collection, reception, storage, transport, treatment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                               65</span>
 and disposal of the bio-medical waste. Merely because the

appellant was given the consent to operate in 3 districts, it

would not confer any absolute right on the appellant and the

appellant cannot prevent the KSPCB from granting consent

to others. Hence, the judgment of the Appellate Authority

has got to be sustained and the appeals have to be

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_92">
</p><p id="p_93">51. The learned counsel for the 5th respondent, in his

earnest attempt to sustain the judgment of the Appellate

Authority would submit that the appeals are not maintainable

either in law or on facts. The EP Act, 1986, a beneficial

regulatory legislation was enacted for the protection and

improvement of environment and prevention of hazards to

human being, other living creatures, plants and with an

objective to create harmony between development and

protection of the environment. The Bio-medical Waste

(Management and Handling) Rules, 1998 comprehensively

provide for all aspects relating to segregation, packing,

generation, collection, reception, storage, transportation,

treatment, handling and disposal of bio-medical waste. The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                             66</span>
 very object of the rules is to ensure a cleaner environment.

The rules, regulations and guidelines have to be read in

conformity with the express intention of the legislation and

the provisions of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_36">Article 19 (1) (g)</a> and <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_37">Article 301</a> of the

Constitution of India. The guidelines relied on by the

appellant is to be read harmoniously and it did not in any

way impose any restriction on the setting up of another

CBWTF. It only provides that one facility may be allowed to

cater 10,000 beds, but not beyond the radius of 150 km.

Nowhere, in the provisions of the guidelines is there any

restriction on the establishment of a new CBWTF. The

powers conferred on the authority under the act is regulatory

in nature for the purpose of carrying out the aims and

objectives of the act and rules and does not empower the

authorities to restrict the fundamental rights under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_38">Article 19

(1) (g)</a> of the Constitution of India to carry on any

occupation, trade or business or under <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_39">Article 301</a> to impede

the flow of trade and commerce. The 5th respondent made

an application for consent to set up CBWTF as per the

standards and specifications prescribed in conformity with

law and rightly the authorities gave the consent. Nothing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                              67</span>
 wrong or illegality was committed by the KSPCB in granting

consent   to   the   5th   respondent.   The   appellant   has

approached the Tribunal on an erroneous reading of the

statutory provisions and misconstruing the rules, regulations

and guidelines. Pointing to the guidelines of the CPCB

issued in the month of August, 2003 for bio-medical waste

disposal under the Bio-medical Waste (Management and

Handling) Rules, 1998 by way of a CBWTF as an option to

dispose the bio-medical waste generated can also be

treated at CBWTF. A plain reading of relevant portion of the

guidelines for CBWTF does not in any way impose

prohibition or restriction of setting up of a new bio-medical

waste treatment facility or CBWTF. It only provides that one

facility may be allowed to cater up to 10,000 beds at the

approved rate and such a facility shall not be allowed to

cater the healthcare units situated beyond a radius of 150

km. The guidelines therein itself contain an exception which

provides that another facility in any area where 10,000 beds

are not available may be allowed to cater to healthcare units

beyond 150 km.
</p>
<p id="p_94">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                               68</span>
</p><p id="p_95"> 52. The appellant sought to construe the rules and

guidelines framed under in a manner which is contrary to the

text and language of the act, rules and guidelines framed

thereunder. The meaning given by the appellant to the

works set out in the guidelines of the CPCB is perverse and

unsustainable. Any law which seeks to restrict or prohibit

any occupation, business, trade or commerce must be

explicit and in conformity with the Constitutional provisions.

The act, rules and guidelines for the CBWTF do not impose

or contemplate any such restriction on the establishment of

a new bio-medical waste treatment facility. The scheme of

act, rule and guidelines framed thereunder are beneficial

and regulatory and are not by way of legislature empowering

the authorities to prohibit or restrict the establishing of

business, trade and commerce.        Creating more CBWTF

would serve the object of the act and facilitate creation of

more and efficient waste handling facilities which would lead

to   a   cleaner   environment.    The   interpretation   and

construction of powers of the regulatory authority must be

reasonable and not in restriction of the freedom to carry on

any occupation, trade or business or impede the flow of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                              69</span>
 trade or business. It is settled position of law that

apprehension that profitability or economic viability of a

private enterprise is likely to be reduced by competition is no

ground for a person to be aggrieved nor is it a ground for the

authorities to consider in ensuring the fundamental right of

all citizens under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_40">Article 14</a> and <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_41">19</a> of the Constitution and

the right under <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_42">Article 301</a> of the Constitution. It is also well

settled position in law that while the general rule of freedom

of trade as enunciated in <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_43">Article 301</a> of the Constitution

might be subject to restrictions, it can only be subject to the

restrictions imposed by law by Parliament under <a href="/doc/412767/" id="a_44">Article 302</a>

and <a href="/doc/1800328/" id="a_45">303(2</a>), and State Legislature under <a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_46">Article 304</a> subject

to the limitations prescribed by <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_47">Article 302-304</a> of the

Constitution, respectively. No such restriction could be

imposed by executive action. If the contention putforth by

the appellant is to be accepted, the same would operate and

restrict the right of all citizens to establish and carry on any

business, trade and commerce directly and immediately in

violation of the freedom guaranteed under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_48">Article 14</a><a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_49">, 19</a> and

<a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_50">301</a> of the Constitution. Apart from that, it would create an

impermissible monopoly of the appellant. The contention of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                               70</span>
 the appellant about the applicability of rule 7 and sub clause

(8) of the Bio-Medical Waste (Management and Handling)

Rules, 1998 is misplaced since the said provision has no

application to the facts of the case. The act and rules do not

contemplate the creation of monopoly in the setting up of

bio-medical    waste     treatment      facilities   nor    do     they

contemplate the creation of exclusive territorial rights. The

appellant, by way of this appeal cannot seek to make a new

law nor claim right not contemplated by the act, rules and

guidelines thereunder. The act of the respondent/KSPCB in

allowing the establishment of a new CBWTF at Hassan

district   which   is   within   150    km    of     the   appellant's

establishment is in conformity with law. It is pertinent to point

out that the appellant has not challenged the same. The

state of affairs in the disposal of bio-medical waste at

Karnataka as evidenced by the Lok Adhalat proceedings

presided by the sitting Judge of the Hon'ble High Court of

Karnataka     further    supports      the   requirement      of    the

competition to improve efficiency and better service in waste

disposal without creating vested interest at the ultimate cost

of the public. The act, rules and the guidelines should not be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">                                 71</span>
 construed to place obligation on the state authorities. Thus,

the 2nd respondent/KSPCB gas acted in accordance with

law in issuing the consent to establish a CBWTF in favour of

the 5th respondent. The Appellate Authority has rightly

upheld the same by dismissing the appeals of the appellant.

Hence, the judgment of the Appellate Authority has to be

confirmed and the appeals on hand before the Tribunal have

to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_96">53. The learned counsel appearing for the 6th respondent

would submit that the 6th respondent had no knowledge

about the appeals made by the appellant herein against the

consent order granted by the KSPCB in favour of the 5th

respondent.    A representation was received from the

appellant dated 08.10.2012 requesting issuance of direction

to the KSPCB for not allowing more than one CBWTF in

small cities in compliance of the provisions of the guidelines

of the CPCB regarding coverage area of the CBWTF. In

pursuance of the same, the 6th respondent by a letter dated

22.10.2012 requested the KSPCB to examine the issue

raised by the appellant in the light of the Bio-medical Waste

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">                              72</span>
 (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998 and the guidelines

of the CPCB and to submit the action taken report. The 2nd

respondent/KSPCB by its letter dated 04.12.2012 had

informed that they had observed serious irregularities in the

operation and the management of the CBWTF of the

appellant as detailed in the letter. From the letter it was clear

that as per the inspection carried out by the Regional Officer

of the KSPCB on 18.07.2012, it was observed that the

CBWTF of the appellant was not lifting the bio-medical

waste on a regular basis from the member-healthcare units

of the 3 districts, which was a serious violation of the Bio-

medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998. It

was also stated therein that upon hearing the discussion for

setting up of a new CBWTF, the Lok Adhalat had directed

the KSPCB and the Regional Commissioner to find a way

out and means of giving permission to such units which

were prepared to put up their plants. The non-lifting of bio-

medical waste regularly by the appellant's CBWTF and the

complaints received from local healthcare facilities were

taken into consideration for allowing presently a new

CBWTF by the 5th respondent. The Bio-medical waste
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">                               73</span>
 generated by the member-healthcare units should reach the

CBWTF within 48 hours as per the provisions of the bio-

medical waste management rules. The 2nd respondent

informed that the action initiated by the KSPCB was in

compliance with the direction issued by the Lok Adhalat

constituted by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka and also

the CBWTF operated by the appellant was not coping up

with the demand of the existing member-healthcare units.

The learned counsel would further add that the CPCB

guidelines for CBWTF have been formulated with an aim to

ensure    effective   storage,    collection,   transportation,

treatment, and disposal of the bio-medical waste and also to

ensure that the CBWTF is located as near to its area of

operation as possible so as to minimize the travel distance

in waste collection and also the consumption of time taken

between generation and disposal thus enhancing the

operational flexibility. The location shall be decided in

consultation with the State Pollution Control Board/Pollution

Control Committee.       As per the Bio-medical Waste

(Management and Handling) (Amendment) Rules, 2000, the

local authorities are made responsible for providing suitable
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                             74</span>
 site within their jurisdiction. It is true that the draft

modification of the Bio-medical Waste (Management and

Handling) Rules, 2011 is under process for revising the

existing guidelines for setting up CBWTF. But, the same is

not finalized. Any rule or guidelines which are in draft stage

cannot be considered as final and hence the same cannot

be relied. Hence, the 6th respondent/CPCB prays that he

would abide by any order passed by the Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_97">54. On scrutiny of the entire materials made available, the

following would emerge as admitted facts:


</p><p id="p_98">     The appellant, a proprietary concern made an

application for the establishment of a CBWTF. Consent for

the establishment of the same was granted by the KSPCB

by an order dated 02.05.2001 covering four districts in the

State of Karnataka, namely, Mysore, Coorg, Hassan and

Chamarajanagar. On completion of the construction of the

CBWTF in the year 2002, Consent to Establish was granted

by the KSPCB. The said consent has been renewed

periodically. The said consent given to the appellant was

restricted only to three districts viz. Mysore, Coorg and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">                              75</span>
 Chamarajanagar excluding Hassan District by an order of

the 2nd respondent/KSPCB in the year 2010 which has never

been challenged by the appellant. The 5th respondent made

an application to the office of the KSPCB at Mysore on

12.03.2012 and the said application was forwarded to the

Head Office of the KSPCB on 13.03.2012. Pursuant to the

direction given, the 5th respondent submitted a feasibility

report on 25.04.2012. In a Lok Adhalat proceedings dated

02.05.2012 that took place before the Hon'ble High Court of

Karnataka, a representation was made by an NGO that the

CBWTF should be established within 50 to 60 km of

healthcare units at all places and directions were issued to

the authorities of the KSPCB by Lok Adhalat to look into the

matter immediately. An inspection of the appellant unit was

made on 18.07.2012. The appellant sent communications to

the KSPCB and CPCB on 08.10.2012 and 11.10.2012,

respectively raising objection to permit one more CBWTF

alleging that it was contra to the guidelines. The KSPCB

issued authorization to the appellant in respect of the above

three districts, namely, Mysore, Coorg and Chamarajanagar

under Bio-medical Waste (Handling and Management)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                             76</span>
 Rules, 1998 from 01.12.2012 to 30.06.2015. The consent

which was given to the appellant was renewed under Water

and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_51">Air Act</a>s till 30.06.2018. The appellant placed a status

report dated 11.10.2012 regarding the quantum of waste

generated. The application filed by the 5th respondent for

consent was recommended for approval by the concerned

officer citing defects in the functioning of the appellant's unit

along with the figures and data regarding the quantum of

waste generated. The CPCB issued direction on 22.10.2012

to KSPCB to consider the representation of the appellant

objecting to the establishment of CBWTF by the 5th

respondent.    The   2nd   respondent/KSPCB        granted   the

impugned consent order dated 24.11.2012 to the 5th

respondent to establish one more CBWTF. Aggrieved over

this, the appellant preferred two appeals before the

Appellate Authority and also an application for impleading

the CPCB in the proceedings. The Appellate Authority

dismissed the impleading application. The CPCB issued a

clarification on 25.03.2013 to the State Pollution Control

Boards to take into account the fixed coverage area to each

of the authorized CBWTF in case additional facilities were to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                               77</span>
 be allowed. The appellant submitted a copy of the

clarification issued by the CPCB before the Appellate

Authority. The Appellate Authority dismissed both the

appeals as devoid of merits. Hence the present appeals are

filed before the Tribunal.

problem that has been recognized for many decades by the

environmental      engineers        and   the     healthcare

establishments. The bio-medical waste is generated during

the diagnosis, treatment or immunization of human beings

or animals or in research activities pertaining thereto or in

the production or testing of biologicals. This may include

wastes like sharps, soiled wastes, disposables, anatomical

waste, cultures, discarded medicines, chemical wastes etc.,

It is pertinent to point out that this waste is potentially

hazardous, the main hazard being infection and may pose

a serious threat to human health if its management is

indiscriminate and unscientific. It became necessary to pay

much attention over the periods since the healthcare

establishments were not giving due attention to their waste

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                               78</span>
 management. The negligence on the part of the healthcare

establishments became evident. Realizing the gravity of the

issue, the CPCB issued notification of 'Bio-medical Waste

(Management and Handling) Rules, 1998 which paved way

for slow and steady streamlining of the process of waste

segregation, collection, treatment and disposal. While the

bio-medical waste is potentially hazardous and poses a

serious threat to human health, it has to be taken serious

note of from the point of view of protection of environment.

This scenario has to be kept in mind while adjudicating the

appeals on hand.

necessary provisions of the EP Act, 1986 and also the rules

generally focus on specific types of

pollution or on specific categories of

areas of environmental hazards are not

 regulatory enactment for improvement of environment and

</p><p id="p_125">60. In view of section 25 of the EP Act, 1986 empowering

Central Government to make rules for the purpose of

carrying out the Act, the Bio-medical Waste (Management

and   Handling)    Rules,    1998         were   framed    which

comprehensively    provide   for    all    aspects   relating   to

storage, transportation, treatment, handling and disposal of

the bio-medical waste.
</p>
<p id="p_126">
</p><p id="p_127">61.   The CPCB formulated a set of guidelines for the

CBWTF. The heading 'D' in the guidelines speaks on the

coverage area of CBWTF which reads as follows:


</p>      " D. Coverage area of CBWTF:
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">

      In any area, only one CBWTF may be

      allowed to cater upto 10,000 beds at the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">                             84</span>
       approved      rate     by        the   prescribed

      authority.    A     CBWTF         shall   not   be

      allowed      to     cater   healthcare       units

      situated beyond a radius of 150 km.

      However, in any area where 10,000 beds

      are not available within a radius of 150

      km, another CBWTF may be allowed to

      cater   the       healthcare      units   situated

      outside the said 150 km".</blockquote><p id="p_128">


</p><p id="p_129">62.   Placing much reliance on the above part of the

guidelines of the CPCB on the coverage area of the

CBWTF, it is contended by the appellant's side that the

entire process of consideration of the application and grant

of consent for one more CBWTF was not only contrary to

the guidelines of the CPCB but also illegal. From a plain

reading of the guidelines in respect of coverage area of

CBWTF as above, it would be clear that (a) only one

CBWTF may be allowed to cater upto 10,000 beds at the

approved rates by the prescribed authority (b) the said

CBWTF shall not be allowed to cater to the health care units

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">                                  85</span>
 situated beyond a radius of 150 km and (c) in any area

where 10,000 beds are not available within the radius of 150

km, another CBWTF to cater to the health care units

situated outside the radius of 150 km. Pointing to the above

guidelines, it is vehemently contended by the appellant's

side that the appellant was granted consent to operate the

CBWTF     in    three   districts   of   Mysore,   Coorg and

Chamarajanagar which are situate within a radius of 150 km

and hence granting of one more consent to establish

another CBWTF by the 5th respondent was contrary to the

guidelines. On the contrary, the 5th respondent in whose

favour the impugned consent order has been given would

argue that, the 2nd respondent/KSPCB was perfectly correct

and legal in granting the consent in favour of the 5th

respondent since the guidelines did not impose any

restriction or prohibition on setting up a new BWTF or a

CBWTF.
</p>
<p id="p_130">
</p><p id="p_131">63. The contention putforth by the appellant's side that the

issuance of the impugned consent order in favour of the 5th

respondent was violative of the acts, rules and guidelines of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">                              86</span>
 the CPCB cannot be countenanced for more reasons than

one. As stated above, the EP Act, 1986 was enacted. In

exercise of the powers and the Central Government notified

the Bio-medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules,

1998. Though the said rules read along with the provisions

of the EP Act, 1986 comprehensively regulate the

management, handling and disposal of the bio-medical

waste, they do not speak about the coverage area of the

CBWTF. The guidelines for CBWTF were formulated in the

year 2003 by CPCB in order to regulate the establishment

and regulation of CBWTF. Thus, they are only regulatory or

recommendatory and not mandatory. Hence, the contention

of the appellant that consent given in favour of the 5th

respondent for the establishment of one more CBWTF was

in violation of the CPCB guidelines cannot be sustained.

Neither the EP Act, 1986 nor the Bio-medical Waste

(Management and Handling) Rules, 1998 restricts or

prohibits the Pollution Control Board from establishing more

than one CBWTF in a particular locality. Needless to say,

the guidelines issued by the CPCB should necessarily be in

accordance with the acts and rules.     Hence, though the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">                             87</span>
 guidelines of the CPCB restrict the coverage area, the same

cannot have a legal basis nor force since they are only

regulatory and not mandatory.
</p>
<p id="p_132">
</p><p id="p_133">64. The words employed 'another CBWTF may be allowed

to cater the health care units' would clearly indicate that it is

an exception which provides that another facility can be

established in the very same area. But, it would add that if

10,000 beds are not available, the 2nd unit might be allowed

to cater to the health care units beyond the radius of 150

km. The appellant cannot be allowed to assail the impugned

consent    order   in   view   of   the   following   facts   and

circumstances attendant in the instant case:


</p><p id="p_134">65. Pointing to the inspection report of the Environmental

Officer, KSPCB, RO-1, Mysore Urban as found in page Nos.

70-74 of the Compilation No.2- Volume 1 of the Type Set

filed by the respondents, the learned counsel for the

appellant would submit that the said inspection was made

just prior to the grant of renewal of consent to the appellant

and the same would show that the appellant's CBWTF has

the capacity to cater to 12,000 beds and at the time it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">                               88</span>
 covered 5000 beds per day and also the quantum of

incinerable waste generated was 10,000 kg per month which

is approximately 333 kg per day. The counsel for the

appellant would urge that there was no need to establish

any more CBWTF since it was not supported by any

material on record apart from the fact that the appellant's

CBWTF is running below the required capacity. It was added

further by the counsel that there are no allegations or

complaints whatsoever from any quarter including hospitals,

clinics, nursing homes etc., in the three districts.


</p><p id="p_135">66. On the contrary, it is the case of the KSPCB that the

appellant has been abusing the position as a sole operator

of the CBWTF in the three districts of Mysore, Coorg and

Chamarajanagar and a number of complaints against the

appellant was received regarding inadequacy and shortfall in

the disposal of waste in the region. Also, in view of the

increasing demand for effective bio-medical waste treatment

facility, there arose a genuine need for establishing a new

CBWTF in the same region.

</p><p id="p_137"> 67. The scrutiny of the materials would clearly indicate that

the contention that there were no complaints against the

appellant has to be rejected. On receipt of various

complaints, the 2nd respondent/KSPCB issued notices on

several occasions to the appellant. The CPCB too had an

occasion to issue a direction under section 5 of the EP Act,

1986 on 04.02.2008 for non compliance of Bio-medial Waste

(Management and Handling) Rules, 1998 as could be seen

from Annexure-I of the common reply affidavit filed by the

 It is noticed in total that with the above

framed         under         the        Environmental

(Protection) Act, 1986, for disposal of the

this context, to know and get the action

taken about the operation and management

of bio-medical waste from Karnataka State

Pollution Control Board and to take action

as per the provisions of the rules against

the facility as per the instructions of the

Hon'ble Minister, this notice is issued by

informing the operator of the facility to take

notice and directed to submit compliance

appellant was not in operation properly or when in operation

it was not disposing the waste as per the rules and also not

collecting the bio-medical waste from the hospitals and other

clinics regularly, all in violation of the rules. Equally, the

contention put forth by the appellant that its CBWTF was

operating below the capacity and there is no need for

additional CBWTF has no force since a number of complaints

were received from the public and hospitals that the bio-

medical waste was neither properly nor regularly collected

from the hospitals and clinics.
</p>
<p id="p_158">
</p><p id="p_159">71. Needless to say, in a thickly populated city like Mysore,

where there are a number of hospitals, multi-speciality

hospitals,   clinics   and   healthcare   centers   generating

enormous quantities of bio-medical waste, there exists a

need for proper treatment and if not done, the same would

cause unimaginable health hazards. In such a situation, the

appellant against whom complaints of not collecting the bio-

 medical waste regularly and properly were made cannot be

allowed to say that there was no need for the setting up of

anymore CBWTF. Under the above circumstances and in

view of the increasing demand for disposal of huge quantities

of bio-medical waste with suitable incineration plants and

also taking into account of the public interest to protect and

improve the environment and to prevent hazards by

employing qualitative service in the collection, segregation,

packing,   reception,    storage,      transportation,    treatment,

handling and disposal of bio-medical waste, the 2nd

respondent/KSPCB        is    fully   justified   in   granting    the

establishment of one more CBWTF to the 5th respondent.

     During the presentation by Sri P.S. Vastrad,

     Deputy       Commissioner,      Mysore    District

     about the manner of bio-medical waste

     disposal and steps taken in this regard for

     satisfactory disposal of bio-medical waste,

     the representative of Swamy Vivekananda

     Youth Movement, a voluntary organization
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                              97</span>
 providing     medical      facilities        to     rural

population     and   having         its     centre     at

Saragur,     represented       by     Sri     Ramesh

Kikkeri has highlighted the problem of non-

availability of proper bio-medical waste

disposal facilities, within 50 to 60 km of all

such places, which generate bio-medical

waste, that the human anatomical and

animal     anatomical      waste          cannot      be

transported for a long distance, it will

decompose and that only one such unit

with one incinerator in Mysore City is

totally   insufficient,   inadequate          for    the

quantity of bio-medical waste generated in

the Mysore region and it has to be

complied and the so called disposal by the

existing unit either may not be satisfactory

or not in a proper manner. Therefore, there

is very imminent and acute need for

establishing more such bio-medical waste

disposal units having incineration and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">                          98</span>
 other   facilities    installed     therein    and

permission should be given to have many

such units in the region. This aspect is

brought to the notice of the Deputy

Commissioner,        Mysore       and   also    Sri

Niranjan,   Environmental         Officer.    While

Regional Commissioner may look into this

problem and work out ways and means of

giving permission for such units which are

prepared to put up their plant by the

Government itself.
</p>
<p id="p_163">
The Pollution Control Board is directed to

place an affidavit before the Adhalat

indicating the capacity of the existing bio-

medical waste disposal units, number of

new units to be set up in suitable locations

and the workability or feasibility of such

plants to cater to the existing need of

disposal of bio-medical waste generated by

all medical and healthcare facilities etc., in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">                         99</span>
      the State and also to suggest what is the

     additional number of bio-medical waste

     disposal units required to be set up in

     suitable locations.
</p>
<p id="p_164">
     The State Administration is also to bestow

     its attention to evolve alternate solutions

     within       the   limits     of   Environmental

     (Protection) Act, Rules and Regulations,

     wherein the disposal of bio-medical waste

     and to promote alternate methods within

     the bounds of law.

</p>
<p id="p_167">73. The above proceedings of the Lok Adhalat were in two

Public Interest Litigations. The proceedings as recorded

above would clearly indicate that the Lok Adhalat, after

considering the non-availability of proper bio-medical waste

facility within 50 to 60 km of places which generate bio-

medical waste, that the human and animal anatomical waste

when transported for a long distance, will decompose, that

only one such unit with one incinerator in Mysore City is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">                                 100</span>
 totally insufficient, inadequate for the quantity of bio-medical

waste generated in the Mysore region, that the so called

disposal by the existing unit either may not be satisfactory or

not in a proper manner, that therefore, there is very

imminent and acute need for establishing more such bio-

medical waste disposal units having incineration and other

facilities installed therein, that permission should be given to

have many such units in the region, thought it fit to direct the

Deputy Commissioner, Mysore and also Sri Niranjan,

Environmental      Officer   and     that    while    Regional

Commissioner might look into this problem and work out

ways and means of giving permission for such units which

were prepared to put up their plant by the Government itself.


</p><p id="p_168">74.    Since the Lok Adhalat has made the above

observations considering the totality of the facts and

circumstances and reasons for the establishment of more

CBWTF, the respondent/KSPCB pursuant thereto has

granted the consent in favour of the 5th respondent to

establish one more CBWTF            which in the considered

opinion of the Tribunal was in the public interest in order to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">                              101</span>
 protect the environment and prevent the environmental

hazards by improving the quality of service. The contention

putforth by the appellant that no complaints were made by

the Environmental Officer and the appellant was not a party

before the Lok Adhalat proceedings cannot stand scrutiny

since it was a Public Interest Litigation and the observations

were made by the Lok Adhalat recording all facts,

circumstances and reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_169">75.   The   contentions putforth by the appellant that the

consent to operate CBWTF given in favour of the appellant

originally for 4 districts was restricted to 3, namely, Mysore,

Coorg    and   Chamarajanagar       and   authorization   was

renewed upto 30.06.2014 and the consent has also been

renewed under the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_56">Air Act</a>s till 30.06.2018, the

act of the KSPCB in granting consent in favour of the 5th

respondent to establish one more CBWTF was in violation

of Principles of Natural Justice since no opportunity of

being heard was afforded to the appellant, attractive though

at the first sight, do not stand the scrutiny for the reasons

that what is challenged by the appellant in these appeals is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">                              102</span>
 the grant of consent for establishment of a CBWTF to the

5th respondent. For issue of such consent to the 5th

respondent or for that matter any other person, the 2nd

respondent KSPCB who is empowered to give consent

need not necessarily give any notice to the appellant or

canvas his nod before granting the consent.


</p><p id="p_170">76. The appellant cannot claim any vested right because of

the grant in his favour or infringement in view of the grant in

favour of the 5th respondent and no right of the appellant is

infringed by granting consent for CBWTF in favour of the 5th

respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_171">
</p><p id="p_172">77. A feeble attempt was made by the learned counsel for

the appellant that the CPCB draft of the revised guidelines

have now been issued which are made part of the Bio-

medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998

and a draft gazette notification has also been issued in

order to bring the amended rule into force. This contention

was rightly answered by the learned counsel for the CPCB

that the CPCB has initiated the process of revising the

existing guidelines for setting of CBWTF which is not yet
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">                              103</span>
 finalized. Needless to say that any rule or guidelines which

are in the draft stage cannot be taken up for consideration

or acted upon. Equally, the Tribunal is unable to notice any

force in the contention put forth by the counsel for the

appellant that by establishing one more CBWTF in a

particular area, there will be a proliferation of waste

treatment equipment which would not be conducive to the

environment. This contention is unacceptable from the point

of view of environmental protection. Non-availability of

proper or insufficient and inadequate bio-medical waste

disposal facility would certainly cause health problem and

hazards. If only one CBWTF should be allowed to operate

within a radius of 150 km as put forth by the appellant, the

human    and   animal    anatomical   wastes    cannot   be

transported quickly in order to avoid decomposition. No

doubt, there exists very imminent and acute need for

establishing more bio-medical waste treatment disposal

units having incinerator and other facilities therein. While

huge quantities of bio-medical wastes are generated, more

units have to be necessarily set up in suitable locations in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_102">                             104</span>
 the same area in order to cater to the existing needs of

disposal of bio-medical waste.
</p>
<p id="p_173">
</p><p id="p_174">78. It is not disputed that the 2nd respondent/KSPCB has

followed the guidelines with regard to the technical

specification for equipment and disposal of waste. So long

there is no provision for restricting the power of the

Pollution Control Board to grant establishment of additional

CBWTF, the act of the 2nd respondent/KSPCB in granting

consent in favour of the 5th respondent cannot be termed as

illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_175">
</p><p id="p_176">79. Apart from all the above, allowing one CBWTF of the

appellant alone to operate within a radius of 150 km by

placing restraint on the KSPCB not to give consent for

additional   CBWTF    would      be   nothing   but   imposing

restriction on the power of the KSPCB which would not be

consistent with the provisions of EP Act, 1986 and also the

rules made thereunder. If the relief of quashing the consent

given in favour of the 5th respondent for establishment of a

new CBWTF as asked for by the appellant is granted, it

would be imposing unreasonable restriction on the freedom
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">                              105</span>
 of trade of the 5th respondent apart from creating an

impermissible monopoly in favour of the appellant.


</p><p id="p_177">80. While interpreting the nature of fundamental right under

<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_57">Article 19 (1) (g)</a> of the Constitution of India, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court of India has held in '<a href="/doc/1298157/" id="a_58">The Nagar Rice and

Flour Mill v. N.T. Gowda</a>' (1970(1)SCC 575) that "the right

to carry on the business being a fundamental right under

<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_59">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution, its exercise is subject

only to the restrictions imposed by law in the interest of

general public under <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_60">Article 19(1)(i)".</a> ..."Competition in the

trade or business may be subject to such restrictions as are

permissible and are imposed by the State by a law enacted

in the interest of the general public under <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_61">Article 19(6</a>), but

a person cannot claim independently of such restriction that

another person shall not carry on business or trade so as to

affect his trade or business adversely."
</p>
<p id="p_178">81. Terming the monopoly right as indefensible and

impermissible, the Apex Court in the matter of '<a href="/doc/1584653/" id="a_62">State of

Rajasthan v. Mohan Lal Vyas</a> (1971 (3) SCC 705) has held

as follows:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">                              106</span><p id="p_179">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">         "A monopoly right cannot be conferred on

        a citizen under the Constitution nor can it

        be justified under the Constitution."


        ".... ,if the State conferred any monopoly

        right on a citizen it would be defensible

        and impermissible and would be an

        infraction of the inviolable   provision   of

        the Constitution."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">
</blockquote><p id="p_180">82. The above decisions support the contentions of the 5th

respondent in whose favour the Consent to Establish for

the CBWTF was granted by the 2nd respondent/KSPCB.


</p><p id="p_181">83. Under such circumstances, the problem can be solved

only by having common bio-medical waste treatment

facilities situate within short distance from the health care

units    generating   bio    medical   wastes   enabling   the

transportation of bio-medical waste within a short span of

time before they become decomposed. From the point of

view of environmental protection, the establishment         or

having only one CBWTF would no doubt, defeat the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">                               107</span>
 purpose, since it would not only be insufficient, but also

inadequate.
</p>
<p id="p_182">
</p><p id="p_183">84.   Hence, in the instant case, there existed an imminent

and acute need for establishing more CBWDT units and in

that line the 2nd respondent/KSPCB has rightly given the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">                            108</span>
 consent to the 5th respondent for establishing its CBWTF

and the same is justified.
</p>
<p id="p_184">
</p><p id="p_185">85. For the reasons stated above, the appeals are

dismissed   as    devoid     of    merits.   The    miscellaneous

applications, if any pending are closed.
</p>
