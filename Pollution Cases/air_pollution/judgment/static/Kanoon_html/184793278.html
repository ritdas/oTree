B.N. MAHAPATRA, J.     This writ petition has been filed with a prayer for quashing

           order dated 18.07.2009 (Annexure-5) passed by opposite party No.1-

           Commissioner-cum-Secretary to Government, Department of Steel &amp; Mines,

Government of Orissa and letter dated 18.07.2009 (Annexure-6) issued by

the Under Secretary to Government, Department of Steel &amp; Mines,

Government of Orissa. The opposite party No.1 under Annexure-5 rejected

the representation of the petitioner for removal of 473.565 MTs of quartz

from Stack Nos.3/07 to 6/07 of Burubuda Jungle Mines. Under Annexure-

6, the Under Secretary to Government of Orissa, Steel &amp; Mines Department

vide his letter dated 18.07.2009 requested the Director of Mines, Orissa,

Bhubaneswar to issue a direction to the Mining Officer, Bolangir to recover

cost of the minerals removed unauthorizedly by the petitioner- Amarendra

Mallik from the mining area in village Burubuda Jungle of Subarnapur

district and to collect the royalty due thereon as per the provisions of laws

and also to initiate the legal action against Sri Mallik as per the provisions

of law.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.          Bereft of unnecessary details, the facts and circumstances

giving rise to the present writ petition are that the petitioner, a mining

lessee in respect of two number of mining leases, one over 37.433 hects in

the village Burubuda Jungle and another over 18.000 hects. in village

Chandili for quartz, gemstone and mica. The aforesaid mining leases were

granted and executed in favour of the petitioner on 28.02.2006. After

execution of the lease deeds, the petitioner started quarrying operation in

respect of the said two leases and made production of quartz minerals from

both the leases and dispatched the minerals on the basis of transit permit
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>




issued by opposite parties from time to time on the application made by the

petitioner to that effect. On 21.06.2007 the petitioner applied for transit

permit for removal of 508.500 MTs quartz minerals extracted from the lease

hold mines and the opposite party No.3-Mining Officer, Bolangir Circle,

Bolangir issued transit pass (Annexure-3) allowing the petitioner to remove

508.500 MTs from the stack of the petitioner's mines. The said permit was

issued on 21.06.2007 and remained valid for the period 21.06.2007 to

20.07.2007. According to the petitioner, pursuant to the said transit permit

issued under Annexure-3, he could be able to remove 34.935 MTs minerals

and the balance he could not be able to remove as he fell ill due to brain

malaria. Apart from the above, the road was completely damaged due to

rainy season and remained closed. The petitioner again on 27.08.2008

applied to opposite party No.3 for extension of time for removal of balance

473.565 MTs of quartz. In the meantime, the Collector, Khurda reported to

the Mining Officer, Bolangir that the petitioner furnished a forged solvency

certificate at the time of granting the mining lease. The Mining Officer

reported the matter to the police and the petitioner was behind the bar for a

period of one month. Since no transit permit was issued by opposite party

No.3, the petitioner filed a writ petition before this Court bearing W.P.(C)

No.2142 of 2009 praying for issuance of permit. The said writ petition was

disposed of on 06.04.2009 with a direction to opposite party No.1 to take a

decision on the representation of the petitioner with regard to issuance of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                             4</span>




transit   permit      within   a   period   of    one   month   from   the    date   of

communication of the order. Since the representation of the petitioner was

not disposed of within the time stipulated by this Court, the petitioner filed

a contempt petition bearing CONTC No.797 of 2009. After filing of the

contempt petition, opposite party No.1 rejected the application for extension

of transit permit of the petitioner vide order dated 18.07.2009 (Annexure-5).

Thereafter, Under Secretary to Government issued letter dated 18.07.2009

(Annexure-6)       to   opposite    party       No.2-Director   of   Mines,    Orissa,

Bhubaneswar to initiate a legal proceeding against the petitioner. Hence,

this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.           Mr. Patitapaban Panda, learned counsel appearing for the

petitioner vehemently argued that the orders passed under Annexures-5

and 6 are arbitrary, illegal, mala fide and contrary to the provisions of law

and the materials available on record and as such the same are liable to be

quashed. The reasons mentioned in the rejection order are non est in the

eye of law, biased, far from truth, self created, mala fide and inconsistent

with their own orders passed from time to time. Mr. Pravat Kumar Ojha,

the Mining Officer has wrongly reported regarding non-availability of

physical possession of the stock in the leased out area. Since, the petitioner

has made an application for extension of the period of permit after lapse of

the validity period on 21.07.2007, the opposite party No.1 is wrong to reject

the petitioner's application for extension of the permit on the ground that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      5</span>




the same has not been made in specific Form-'J' accompanied by the

required fee as has been prescribed under Sub-Rule (2) of Rule 10 of the

Orissa Mineral (Prevention of Theft, Smuggling &amp; Illegal Mining and

Regulation of Possession, Storage, Trading and Transportation) Rules, 2007

(for short, "Rules, 2007"), which came into force w.e.f. 20.09.2007. Since

the petitioner has only utilized 14 number of Forms out of 50 from the book

bearing Book No.19, the opposite parties are not correct to say that the

petitioner has not submitted the returns of used transit passes. The

petitioner has filed monthly returns in Form A for Burubuda Jungle Mines

till 31.12.2007. The petitioner has also filed monthly returns in Form B

showing all the details. The allegation that the application made for removal

of stock from stack Nos.3/07 to 6/07 was not found physically available at

the petitioner's mines is false and fabricated. Since there was no need to

submit any solvency certificate along with the application for grant of

mining lease, there was no occasion for the Collector, Sonepur or the

Mining Officer to find out whether any false solvency certificate has been

submitted by the petitioner or not. It is the Director of Mines, who can say

whether the petitioner has submitted any solvency certificate or not.

Opposite party No.3 has no business to initiate a police case against the

petitioner as he was not an authorized officer to do so. All alleged forgery

and irregularities were committed by his childhood friend, Manas Ranjan

Sahoo to whom in good faith he entrusted the work of supervision of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                       6</span>




mining activities because of his illness. Earlier the opposite parties have

granted several extension of transit permits after lapse of their validity

period, but presently the said extension is not granted only to harass the

petitioner. Concluding his argument, Mr. Panda urged that Annexures-5

and 6 should be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.          Learned Advocate General appearing for opposite parties

submits that the impugned orders passed under Annexures 5 and 6 are

valid and legal. In the present case disputed questions of fact are involved

and therefore, this Court by exercising jurisdiction under Articles 226 and

227 of the Constitution cannot effectually adjudicate the disputed

questions of fact. The petitioner has not approached this Court with clean

hands. In the meantime, the lease granted has been cancelled. After

cancellation of the lease no permit can be granted for removal of any stack.

Moreover, the petitioner has raised minerals from outside the lease hold

area. Therefore, the writ petition is liable to be dismissed. It is submitted

that though it is averred by the petitioner that the forgery and irregularities

as alleged against the petitioner by the opposite parties were committed by

one Sri Manas Ranjan Sahoo, who was the childhood friend of the

petitioner, the petitioner has not made him a party in the writ petition.

Similarly, though the petitioner has raised allegation against the Collector,

Khurda, he has also not been made him a party in the writ petition. Hence,

the writ petition is not maintainable due to non-joinder of necessary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     7</span>




parties. On 17.01.2008 the Sub-Collector, Bhubaneswar intimated the

Collector, Khurda that the solvency certificates bearing Nos.57/2003 and

12/2006 were forged documents. On 25.01.2008, the Collector, Khurda

intimated to the Collector, Bolangir regarding the above facts. The

Collector, Bolangir vide his letter dated 01.02.2008 intimated the same to

the opposite party No.3-Mining Officer. On 02.02.2008, the opposite party

No.3 intimated the matter to the Director of Mines, Orissa, Bhubaneswar.

On 04.02.2008 the Collector, Subarnapur intimated the facts to the

opposite party No.2-Director of Mines, Orissa, Bhubaneswar as well as the

opposite party No.1-Commissioner-cum-Secretary to Government in Steel

and Mines Department for taking appropriate action. On 20.05.2008 the

Director of Mines intimated the Steel &amp; Mines Department for cancellation

of two granted MLs bearing Nos.29/S and 30/S in view of submission of

forged solvency certificates. The application for extension of time for

removal of balance quantity of 473.565 MT of quartz from Burubuda

Jungle ML area was not in the prescribed Form-'J'. The said application

was submitted without specific dimension of the stack Nos. 3/07 to 6/07

and was also not accompanied with the prescribed fee as provided under

Sub-Rule (2) of Rule 10 of Rules, 2007. The opposite party No.3 filed an

F.I.R. against the petitioner on 08.03.2008 in the Town Police Station,

Bolangir. Thereafter, the petitioner was arrested on 12.07.2008 in Bolangir

Town P.S. Case No.178/2008 and released on bail by order of the Sessions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                      8</span>




Judge, Bolangir on 22.07.2008. The petitioner has not yet submitted

returns of used transit passes in Form-M showing the details of dispatched

quantity of quartz from the above stacks out of 508.500 MTs of Quartz

permitted earlier for removal. Despite request dated 03.03.2008 the

petitioner has not submitted the monthly returns in the prescribed Forms A

&amp; B in respect of the aforesaid mines after May, 2007. During the

inspection of Burubuda Jungle Quartz Mines of the petitioner by the Joint

Director of Mines, Orissa on 15.01.2008, it was noticed that the petitioner

had unauthorizedly removed 10,900 Cubic Meters of morrum from his

leasehold area (Burubuda Jungle) and used the same in construction of

road out side the leasehold area without obtaining permission from

opposite party No.3, who is the competent authority. The petitioner was

asked to pay royalty amounting to Rs.1,09,000/- (Rupees One Lakh nine

Thousand) and to pay Rs.71,967/- (Rupees Seventy One Thousand Nine

Hundred and Sixty Seven) only towards outstanding arrears of dues of

Dead Rent, Surface Rent and interest on delayed payment thereof. As the

petitioner did not respond to make payment of the outstanding dues as

mentioned above, a certificate case was initiated against him in the Court

of the Certificate Officer-cum-Sub-Collector, Bolangir vide Certificate Case

No.5/2008 under the provisions of Orissa Public Demand Recovery Act,

1962. The State Pollution Control Board, Orissa, Bhubaneswar vide its

letter No.1335 dated 18.01.2008 issued instruction to the petitioner for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                       9</span>




closure of the above two mines under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_1">Section 31(A)</a> of Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_3">Section 33(A)</a> of Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 in view of the fact that the petitioner had not

taken any steps in compliance to obtain the consent of the State Pollution

Control Board under the aforesaid Act for mining operations.

</p><p id="p_7">            Sri R.K. Das, Senior Inspector of Mines, Bolangir during his

visit on 25.06.2009 to the said mines noticed and reported that the applied

stacks Nos. 3/07 to 6/07 could not be found in the mines area of the

petitioner. It was further detected that neither the boundary pillars all

along the boundary lines of the leasehold area nor surface right area

therein were found existing in the leasehold area. During his visit to the

mines, neither the petitioner nor his representative was found available at

the mines site except only one watchman, who stated that all their staff

have left the mines since long and all the reports, returns, records etc.

pertaining to mining activities are kept with the petitioner at Bhubaneswar.

Therefore, the Senior Inspector of Mines could not verify the area from

which the mineral was removed. He also could not know the balance stock

out of the previously permitted quantity and so also the total stock at

mines site. Therefore, he could not recommend for extension of time of the

permit to lift the balance left out    quartz permitted earlier, as required

under the provisions of sub-rules (5) &amp; (6) of Rule 10 of the Rules, 2007.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                      10</span>




Prior to the application dated 27.08.2008 for issue of transit permit,

proceedings have been initiated for fraudulent action of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_8">            The Vigilance Cell, Orissa, Bhubaneswar has instituted a case

vide Case No.8/2008 for submission of forged solvency certificate by the

petitioner during grant of M.L. No.30/S over 37.433 hects in village

Burubuda Jungle and M.L. No.29/S over 18.000 hects in village Chandli of

Subarnapur district for quartz, mica and gemstone.
</p>
<p id="p_9">            The petitioner has defaulted in payment of dead rent and

surface rent in respect of both the leases.      Since the petitioner could

manage to acquire/obtain the grant of these mining leases which is

contrary to the provisions of the Act, 1957 and the Rules, 1960, the entire

mining operation including production and despatch of minerals carried

out by the petitioner is in contravention of the provisions of <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_5">Section 4(1)</a>

and <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_6">4(1A)</a> of the Act, 1957. Under <a href="/doc/169222158/" id="a_7">Section 21(5)</a> of the Act, 1957, the price

of mineral unauthorizedly and unlawfully removed from a void and non-

existent leasehold area in contravention of <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_8">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act, 1957 is

to be recovered from the person concerned along with rent, royalty or tax,

as the case may be. The reasons for rejection of order for issuance of transit

permit by opposite party No.1 are based on facts and provisions of MM<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">(DR)

Act</a>, 1957, MC Rules, 1960 and the Rules, 2007. The petitioner applied for

extension of the originally granted permit to him for removal of balance

quantity of the mineral on 27.08.2008, when the Rules, 2007 was already
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                      11</span>




in force w.e.f. 16.07.2007. It is submitted that as per the provisions of Rule

10(11) of the Rules, 2007, the transit permit was to be issued by the

competent authority after verification of the quantity of mineral available in

the stack and other information. Since the petitioner has not submitted any

returns in the prescribed form, the availability of balance mineral could not

be checked by opposite party No.3. Since the petitioner did not submit the

said monthly returns beyond May, 2007, he was instructed by opposite

party No.3, vide letter No.772 dated 03.03.2008 to make good of the same.

</p><p id="p_10">5.          The petitioner in the present writ petition challenges the order

dated 18.07.2009 (Annexure-5) rejecting his request for extension of transit

permit to remove the minerals extracted from the leasehold area granted in

his favour. He has also challenged the order dated 18.07.2009 (Annexure-6)

issued by Deputy Secretary to Government to the Director of Mines

requesting him to recover the cost of minerals removed unauthorizedly as

per the provisions of law and to initiate legal proceedings against him.

Petitioner's request for grant of transit permit for removal of minerals was

rejected by opposite party No.1 on the ground that the petitioner has

transported the quartz mineral unauthorizedly and he has violated the

covenants of the lease deed. While rejecting the petitioner's prayer the

opposite party No.1 has taken into consideration the following aspects:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      (a)   The petitioner has not submitted application for issuance of
            permit for removal of the mineral from mines in specific form
            i.e. Form-'J'.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      (b)   The application was not accompanied by the required fees as
            has been prescribed under Sub-rule (2) of Rule 10 of Orissa
            Mineral (Prevention of Theft, Smuggling &amp; Illegal Mining and
            Regulation of Possession, Storage, Trading and Transportation)
            Rules, 2007.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (c)   The petitioner has not submitted the returns of used TP in
            Form No.M showing details of dispatched quantity of quartz
            from the stacks i.e. stack Nos.3/07 to 6/07.

            not found physically available at the petitioner's mines as
            revealed by the visit of Shri R.K. Das, SIM to the Mines on
            25.06.2009. This field visit also reveals that neither the
            boundary pillars all along the boundary lines nor surface right
            pillars of the granted surface right area were in existence.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      (f)   The Director of Mines vide his letter No.7767/DM dated
            30.06.2009 reported that as per the communication of
            Collector, Sonepur, the petitioner has submitted false solvency
            certificate for grant of two mining leases including the mines at
            Burubuda Jungle from which the petitioner seeks to remove
            473.565 mts of quartz.
</blockquote><p id="p_11">6.          The reason/basis given by opposite party No.1 for rejecting the

petitioner's request for extension of time of the transit permit to remove the

minerals as applied for and the reply of the petitioner to the same involve

purely disputed questions of fact. Such factual questions of fact cannot be

       adjudicated by this Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction under Articles

       226 and 227 of the Constitution. Apart from the above, we find that action

       has been taken against the petitioner by the State Pollution Control Board,

       Orissa, Bhubaneswar under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_10">Section 31(A)</a> of the Air (Prevention and

       <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_12">Section 33(A)</a> of the Water (Prevention

       and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, suggesting closure of its mines.

       Proceedings for realization of royalty for unauthorized removal of minor

       minerals was also initiated. Criminal cases have been instituted for

       submitting forged solvency certificate to obtain the mining lease. Vigilance

       Case No.8/2008 has also been instituted by the State Vigilance Cell,

       Orissa, Bhubaneswar. Criminal case in G.R. Case No.386/2008 arising out

       of Bolangir Town P.S. Case No.178/2008 has also been instituted against

       the petitioner by the Police in the Court of S.D.J.M., Bloangir. Therefore,

       this is not a fit case for interference by this Court. However, we are

       expressing no opinion on the merit of the above noted cases.
