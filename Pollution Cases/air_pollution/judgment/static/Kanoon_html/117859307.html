<p id="p_1">1.    Leave granted.

<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    The present writ petitions and appeals raise the question

of the constitutional validity of <a href="/doc/873452/" id="a_1">Section 45</a> of the Prevention of

Money Laundering Act, 2002.        <a href="/doc/1001502/" id="a_2">Section 45(1)</a> imposes two

conditions for grant of bail where an offence punishable for a

term of imprisonment of more than 3 years under Part A of the

Schedule to the Act is involved. The conditions are that the

Public Prosecutor must be given an opportunity to oppose any

application for release on bail and the Court must be satisfied,

where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, that there

are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not

guilty of such offence, and that he is not likely to commit any

offence while on bail.

<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">        “STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

        It is being realised, world over, that money-
        laundering poses a serious threat not only to the
        financial systems of countries, but also to their
        integrity and sovereignty. Some of the initiatives
        taken by the international community to obviate
        such threats are outlined below:—
</p><p id="p_8">        (a) the United Nations Convention Against Illicit
        Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
        Substances, to which India is a party, calls for
        prevention of laundering of proceeds of drug crimes
        and other connected activities and confiscation of
        proceeds derived from such offence.
</p><p id="p_9">        (b) the Basle Statement of Principles, enunciated in
        1989, outlined basic policies and procedures that
        banks should follow in order to assist the law
        enforcement agencies in tackling the problem of
        money-laundering.
</p><p id="p_10">        (c) the <a href="/doc/231604/" id="a_4">Financial Act</a>ion Task Force established at
        the summit of seven major industrial nations, held in
        Paris from 14th to 16th July, 1989, to examine the
        problem of money-laundering has made forty
        recommendations, which provide the foundation
        material for comprehensive legislation to combat the
        problem        of      money-laundering.         The
        recommendations were classified under various
        heads. Some of the important heads are—

     reportable transactions;

     crime;

     extraditable offence; and

     in investigation of money-laundering.
</p><p id="p_16">(d) the Political Declaration and Global Programme
of Action adopted by United Nations General
Assembly by its Resolution No. S-17/2 of 23rd
February, 1990, inter alia, calls upon the member
States to develop mechanism to prevent financial
institutions from being used for laundering of drug
related money and enactment of legislation to
prevent such laundering.
</p><p id="p_17">(e) the United Nations in the Special Session on
Countering World Drug Problem Together
concluded on the 8th to the 10th June, 1998 has
made another declaration regarding the need to
combat money-laundering. India is a signatory to
this declaration.
</p><p id="p_18">2. In view of an urgent need for the enactment or a
comprehensive legislation inter alia for preventing
money-laundering      and    connected     activities
confiscation of proceeds of crime, setting up of
agencies and mechanisms for coordinating
measures for combating money-laundering, etc., the
Prevention of Money-Laundering Bill, 1998 was
introduced in the Lok Sabha on the 4th August,
1998. The Bill was referred to the Standing

Committee on Finance, which presented its report
on the 4th March, 1999 to the Lok Sabha. The
recommendations of the Standing Committee
accepted by the Central Government are that (a)
the expressions “banking company” and “person”
may be defined; (b) in Part I of the Schedule under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">
Indian Penal Code</a> the word offence under <a href="/doc/1697463/" id="a_6">section
477A</a> relating to falsification of accounts should be
omitted; (c) ‘knowingly’ be inserted in clause 3(b)
relating to the definition of money-laundering; (d)
the banking companies, financial institutions and
intermediaries should be required to furnish
information of transactions to the Director instead of
Commissioner of Income-tax (e) the banking
companies should also be brought within the ambit
of clause II relating to obligations of financial
institutions and intermediaries; (f) a definite time-
limit of 24 hours should be provided for producing a
person about to be searched or arrested person
before the Gazetted Officer or Magistrate; (g) the
words “unless otherwise proved to the satisfaction
of the authority concerned” may be inserted in
clause 22 relating to presumption on inter-
connected transactions; (h) vacancy in the office of
the Chairperson of an Appellate Tribunal, by reason
of his death, resignation or otherwise, the senior-
most member shall act as the Chairperson till the
date on which a new Chairperson appointed in
accordance with the provisions of this Act to fill the
vacancy, enters upon his office; (i) the appellant
before the Appellate Tribunal may be authorised to
engage any authorised representative as defined
under <a href="/doc/864575/" id="a_7">section 288</a> of the Income-tax Act, 1961, (j)
the punishment for vexatious search and for false
information may be enhanced from three months
imprisonment to two years imprisonment, or fine of
rupees ten thousand to fine of rupees fifty thousand
or both; (k) the word ‘good faith’ may be
incorporated in the clause relating to Bar of legal
proceedings. The Central Government have broadly

     accepted the above recommendations and made
     provisions of the said recommendations in the Bill.
</p><p id="p_19">     3. In addition to above recommendations of the
     standing committee the Central Government
     proposes to (a) relax the conditions prescribed for
     grant of bail so that the Court may grant bail to a
     person who is below sixteen years of age, or
     woman, or sick or infirm, (b) levy of fine for default
     of non-compliance of the issue of summons, etc. (c)
     make provisions for having reciprocal arrangement
     for assistance in certain matters and procedure for
     attachment and confiscation of property so as to
     facilitate the transfer of funds involved in money-
     laundering kept outside the country and extradition
     of the accused persons from abroad.

</p><p id="p_58">5.   Shri Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior advocate appearing

on behalf of the petitioners, has argued before us that <a href="/doc/873452/" id="a_35">Section

45</a> of the said Act, when it imposes two further conditions


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                  13</span>
before grant of bail is manifestly arbitrary, discriminatory and

violative of the petitioner’s fundamental rights under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_36">Article 14</a>

read with <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_37">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. According to learned

senior counsel, at the stage that the said Act was a Bill (which

was referred to a Standing Committee on Finance of the

Parliament, and which presented its report on 4.3.1999 to the

Lok Sabha), the Central Government broadly accepted the

recommendations of the Standing Committee, which were then

incorporated in the said Bill along with some other changes. At

this stage, argued Shri Rohatgi, it is interesting to note that

Clauses 43 and 44 of the Bill, which correspond to <a href="/doc/1852805/" id="a_38">Sections 44</a>

and <a href="/doc/873452/" id="a_39">45</a> of the present Act, were very differently worded and

dealt only with offences under the 2002 Act.           The twin

conditions laid down as additional conditions for grant of bail

were, at this stage, only qua offences under the 2002 Act.

When Parliament enacted the 2002 Act, this scheme was

completely changed in that <a href="/doc/873452/" id="a_40">Section 45</a> of the Act now spoke

only of the predicate/scheduled offence and not the offence

under the 2002 Act. In the present Act, a scheduled offence,

which is an offence under other penal laws contained in Part A


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                    14</span>
of the Schedule, that is tried with offences under the Act, bail

would be granted only after satisfying the twin conditions laid

down in the Section. Also, when the Act was originally enacted,

according to learned senior counsel, part A of the Schedule

was very sparsely populated, in that it comprised of two

paragraphs only consisting of two offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_41"> the Indian

Penal Code</a>, 1860 and 9 offences under the Narcotic Drugs and

<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_42">Psychotropic Substances Act</a>, 1985.        These offences were

considered extremely heinous by the legislature and were,

therefore, classified apart from offences under Part B, which

dealt with certain other offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_43"> the Indian Penal Code</a>

and offences under the <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_44">Arms Act</a> 1959, Wildlife (Protection) Act

1972,   <a href="/doc/69064674/" id="a_45">Immoral     Traffic (Prevention) Act</a>,    1956   and   the

<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_46">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988.       According to learned

senior counsel, this classification was maintained right until the

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_47">Amendment Act</a> of 2012, which then incorporated Part B

offences into Part A of the Schedule, resulting in offences under

26 Acts, together with many more offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_48"> the Indian

Penal Code</a>, all being put under Part A.         This, according to

learned senior counsel, was done because the definition of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                     15</span>
“scheduled offence” in <a href="/doc/564136/" id="a_49">Section 2(y)</a> of the Act made it clear that,

if offences are specified under Part B of the Schedule at the

relevant time, the total value involved for such offences should

be Rs.30 lakhs or more. The idea behind the 2012 Amendment,

as the Statement of Objects of the said Amendment discloses,

is that this limit of Rs.30 lakhs be removed, which is why the

entire Part B of the Schedule was subsumed in Part A. He

further argued that the object was not to deny bail to those

charged with offences under the erstwhile Part B, and that

putting Part B offences together with heinous offences in Part A

would amount to treating unequals equally and would be

discriminatory and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_50">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. In

addition, such lumping together of disparate offences would

have no rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by

the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_51">Amendment Act</a> of 2012, that is to obviate the Rs.30 lakh

limit qua Part B offences, and it would violate <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_52">Article 14</a> on this

ground as well.     According to learned senior counsel, the

change from the original scheme of the Bill to introducing

offences outside the 2002 Act dependent upon which bail would

be granted, with the twin conditions as aforestated first having


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                     16</span>
to be satisfied, is itself manifestly arbitrary, in that the predicate

offence, which is the scheduled offence, and the classification

of such offence as being punishable with three years or more

would again be wholly irrelevant and would have absolutely no

rational relation to the object of granting bail insofar as offences

under the 2002 Act are concerned. Learned senior counsel

also referred to <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_53">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and stated that the

aforesaid procedure would be unfair, unjust and would fall foul

of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_54">Article 21</a> inasmuch as it would certainly fall foul of the US

Constitution’s Eighth Amendment which interdicts excessive

bails. Since this Court has recognized that this feature of the

Eighth Amendment would fall within <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_55">Article 21</a>, it would be a

direct infraction thereof. He also argued that a person will be

punished for an offence contained under the 2002 Act, but will

be denied bail because of a predicate offence which is

contained in Part A of the Schedule, which would again render

<a href="/doc/1001502/" id="a_56">Section 45(1)</a> as manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable. He

referred to Nikesh Tarachand Shah’s case, which is Writ

Petition (criminal) No.67 of 2017, in which the scheduled

offences were <a href="/doc/1697463/" id="a_57">Sections 120B</a>, <a href="/doc/1697463/" id="a_58">409</a>, <a href="/doc/1697463/" id="a_59">420</a>, <a href="/doc/1697463/" id="a_60">471</a> and <a href="/doc/1697463/" id="a_61">477A</a> of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                         17</span><a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_62">
Indian Penal Code</a> read with <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_63">Section 13</a> of the Prevention of

Corruption Act. These offences were being investigated by the

CBI in CBI Special Case No.91/2009 in which the petitioner

was granted bail by the Sessions Court by an order dated

10.12.2015. When the offence under the 2002 Act was added

to the aforesaid offences, thanks to the applicability of the twin

conditions in <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_64">Section 45(1)</a>, he was denied bail with effect from

27.11.2015, which itself shows that <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_65">Section 45(1)</a> is being used

in an extremely manifestly arbitrary fashion to deny bail for

offences which extend only to seven years under the 2002 Act,

as opposed to predicate offences which may extend even to life

imprisonment. Also, according to learned senior counsel, the

threshold of three years and above contained in <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_66">Section 45</a> of

the 2002 Act is itself manifestly arbitrary in that it has no

reference to the offence of money laundering under the 2002

Act, but only to three years and more of the predicate offence.

There is no condition, so far as the 2002 Act is concerned, of

classification based on the amount of money that is laundered,

which perhaps may be a valid basis for classification. Also,

according to learned senior counsel, if the twin conditions of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                     18</span>
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_67">Section 45(1)</a> are to be satisfied at the stage of bail, the

defendants will have to disclose their defence at a point in time

when they are unable to do so, having been arrested and not

being granted bail at the inception itself. Another conundrum

raised by <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_68">Section 45</a> is the fact that, there being no interdict

against anticipatory bail in the 2002 Act, and<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_69"> the Code</a> of

Criminal Procedure applying to offences under the 2002 Act, it

would be clear that anticipatory bail could be granted for both

offences under the 2002 Act and predicate offences. This being

so, unlike the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act

1987, where anticipatory bail expressly cannot be granted, the

twin conditions of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_70">Section 45</a> would not apply at the anticipatory

bail stage, which would mean that a person charged of money

laundering and a predicate offence could continue on

anticipatory bail throughout the trial without satisfying any of the

twin conditions, as opposed to a person who applies for regular

bail, who would have to satisfy the twin conditions, which in

practice would mean denial of bail.       For all these reasons,

according to learned senior counsel, <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_71">Section 45</a> needs to be

struck down. Also, according to learned senior counsel, it is not


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                       19</span>
possible to read down the provision to make it constitutional as

the very scheme of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_72">Section 45</a> is manifestly arbitrary and

irrational. Shri Rohatgi cited various judgments to buttress his

submissions which will be referred to by us in the course of this

judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_59">6.   On the other hand, the learned Attorney General Shri K.K.

Venugopal impressed upon us the fact that the Parliamentary

legislation qua money laundering is an attempt by Parliament to

get back money which has been siphoned off from the

economy.    According    to   the   learned   Attorney   General,

scheduled offences and offences under <a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_73">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/731949/" id="a_74">4</a> of the

2002 Act have to be read together and the said Act, therefore,

forms a complete code which must be looked at by itself.

According to the learned Attorney General, it is well settled that

classification which is punishment centric has been upheld by a

catena of judgments and so have the twin conditions been

upheld by various decisions which were referred to by him.

According to him, the expression “any offence” in <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_75">Section

45(1)(ii)</a> would mean offence of a like nature and not any

offence, which would include a traffic offence as well. According


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                     20</span>
to the learned Attorney General, <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_76">Section 45</a> can easily be read

down to make it constitutional in two ways.            First, the

expression “there are reasonable grounds for believing that he

is not guilty of such offence” must be read as the making of a

prima facie assessment by the Court of reasonable guilt.

Secondly, according to the learned Attorney General, in any

case the conditions contained in <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_77">Section 45(1)(ii)</a> are there in a

different form when bail is granted ordinarily insofar as offences

generally are concerned and he referred to State of U.P.

through C.B.I. v. Amarmani Tripathi, (2005) 8 SCC 21 for this

purpose.    According to the learned Attorney General, if

harmoniously construed with the rest of the Act, <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_78">Section 45</a> is

unassailable.   He relied upon <a href="/doc/940317/" id="a_79">Section 24</a> of the Act, which

inverts the burden of proof, and strongly relied upon Gautam

Kundu v. Directorate of Enforcement (Prevention of Money-

Laundering Act), (2015) 16 SCC 1 and Rohit Tandon

v. The Enforcement Directorate, Criminal Appeal Nos.1878--

1879 Of 2017 decided on 10th November, 2017. In answer to

Shri Rohatgi’s argument on the object of the 2012 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_80">Amendment

Act</a>, according to the learned Attorney General, it is well settled


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                                     21</span>
that where the language of the Act is plain, no recourse can be

taken to the object of the Act and he cited a number of

judgments for this proposition. He referred us to <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_81">Section 106</a> of

the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and argued that when read with

<a href="/doc/940317/" id="a_82">Section 24</a> of the 2002 Act, it would be clear that the twin

conditions contained in <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_83">Section 45</a> are only in furtherance of the

object of unearthing black money and that we should, therefore,

be very slow to set at liberty persons who are alleged offenders

of the cancer of money laundering. Ultimately, according to the

learned Attorney General, <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_84">Section 45</a> being part of a complete

code must be upheld in order that the 2002 Act work, so that

money that is laundered comes back into the economy and

persons responsible for the same are brought to book.

</p><p id="p_60">7.   Having heard learned counsel for both sides, it is

important to first understand what constitutes the offence of

money laundering.    Under <a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_85">Section 3</a> of the Act, the kind of

persons responsible for money laundering is extremely wide.

Words such as “whosoever”, “directly or indirectly” and

“attempts to indulge” would show that all persons who are even

remotely involved in this offence are sought to be roped in. An

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                                    22</span>
important ingredient of the offence is that these persons must

be knowingly or actually involved in any process or activity

connected with proceeds of crime and “proceeds of crime” is

defined under the Act, by <a href="/doc/62140/" id="a_86">Section 2</a> (u) thereof, to mean any

property derived or obtained directly or indirectly, by any person

as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence

(which is referred to in our judgment as the predicate offence).

Thus, whosever is involved as aforesaid, in a process or activity

connected with “proceeds of crime” as defined, which would

include concealing, possessing, acquiring or using such

property, would be guilty of the offence, provided such persons

also project or claim such property as untainted property.

<a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_87">Section 3</a>, therefore, contains all the aforesaid ingredients, and

before somebody can be adjudged as guilty under the said

provision, the said person must not only be involved in any

process or activity connected with proceeds of crime, but must

also project or claim it as being untainted property.      Under

<a href="/doc/731949/" id="a_88">Section 4</a> of the Act, the offence of money laundering is

punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a minimum period of

three years which may extend to 7 years and fine. Also, under


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                     23</span>

Clause 39, which was, at that time, written in Latin, is translated

as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      “No free man shall be seized or imprisoned or
      stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or
      exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way,
      nor will we proceed with force against him, or send
      others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his
      equals or by the law of the land.”
It is well known that Magna Carta, which was wrung out of King

John by the barons on the 15th of June, 1215, was annulled by

Pope Innocent III in August of that very year. King John died

one year later, leaving the throne to his 9 year old son, Henry

III. It is in the reign of this pious King and his son, Edward I, that

Magna Carta was recognized by kingly authority. In fact, by the

statutes of Westminster of 1275, King Edward I repeated the

injunction contained in clause 39 of Magna Carta. However,

when it came to the reign of the Stuarts, who believed that they

were kings on earth as a matter of divine right, a struggle

ensued between Parliament and King Charles I. This led to

another great milestone in the history of England called the

Petition of Right of 1628. Moved by the hostility to the Duke of

Buckingham, the House of Commons denied King Charles I the

means to conduct military operations abroad. The King was

unwilling to give up his military ambition and resorted to the

expedient of a forced loan to finance it. A number of those

subject to the imposition declined to pay, and some were

imprisoned; among them were those who became famous as

“the Five Knights”. Each of them sought a writ of habeas corpus

to secure his release. One of the Knights, Sir Thomas Darnel,

gave up the fight, but the other four fought on. The King’s

Bench, headed by the Chief Justice, made an order sending the

knights back to prison. The Chief Justice’s order was, in fact, a

provisional refusal of bail.   Parliament being displeased with

this, invoked Magna Carta and the statutes of Westminster, and

thus it came about that the Petition of Right was presented and

adopted by the Lords and a reluctant King. Charles I reluctantly

accepted this Petition of Right stating, “let right be done as is

desired by the petition”. Among other things, the Petition had

prayed that no free man should be imprisoned or detained,

except by authority of law.

now the most usual remedy by which a man is restored again to

his liberty, if he have been against law deprived of it.” Despite

this statement of the law, one Jenkes was arrested and

imprisoned for inciting persons to riot in a speech, asking that

King Charles II be petitioned to call a new Parliament. Jenkes

went from pillar to post in order to be admitted to bail. The Lord

Chief Justice sent him to the Lord Chancellor, who, in turn, sent

him to the Lord Treasurer, who sent him to the King himself,

who, “immediately commanded that the laws should have their

due course.” (See Jenke’s case, 6 How. St. Tr. 1189 at 1207,

1208 (1676)). It is cases like these that led to the next great

milestone of English history, namely the Habeas Corpus Act of

1679. <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_106">This Act</a> recited that many of the King’s subjects have

been long detained in prison in cases where, by law, they

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      “27. It is not necessary to refer to decisions which
      deal with the right to ordinary bail because that right
      does not furnish an exact parallel to the right to
      anticipatory bail. It is, however, interesting that as
      long back as in 1924 it was held by the High Court
      of Calcutta in <a href="/doc/1692860/" id="a_112">Nagendra v. King-Emperor</a> [AIR 1924
      Cal 476, 479, 480 : 25 Cri LJ 732] that the object of
      bail is to secure the attendance of the accused at
      the trial, that the proper test to be applied in the
      solution of the question whether bail should be
      granted or refused is whether it is probable that the
      party will appear to take his trial and that it is
      indisputable that bail is not to be withheld as a
      punishment. In two other cases which, significantly,
      are the ‘Meerut Conspiracy cases’ observations are
      to be found regarding the right to bail which deserve
      a special mention. <a href="/doc/176143/" id="a_113">In K.N. Joglekar v. Emperor</a> [AIR
      1931 All 504 : 33 Cri LJ 94] it was observed, while
      dealing with Section 498 which corresponds to the
      present Section 439 of the Code, that it conferred
      upon the Sessions Judge or the High Court wide
      powers to grant bail which were not handicapped by
      the restrictions in the preceding Section 497 which
      corresponds to the present Section 437. It was
      observed by the court that there was no hard and
      fast rule and no inflexible principle governing the
      exercise of the discretion conferred by Section 498
      and that the only principle which was established
      was that the discretion should be exercised
      judiciously. <a href="/doc/1882348/" id="a_114">In Emperor v. Hutchinson</a> [AIR 1931 All
      356, 358 : 32 Cri LJ 1271] it was said that it was

having regard to the fact that the legislature itself
left the discretion of the court unfettered. According
to the High Court, the variety of cases that may
arise from time to time cannot be safely classified
and it is dangerous to make an attempt to classify
the cases and to say that in particular classes a bail
may be granted but not in other classes. It was
observed that the principle to be deduced from the
various sections in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_115"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a>
was that grant of bail is the rule and refusal is the
exception. An accused person who enjoys freedom
is in a much better position to look after his case
and to properly defend himself than if he were in
custody. As a presumably innocent person he is
therefore entitled to freedom and every opportunity
to look after his own case. A presumably innocent
person must have his freedom to enable him to
establish his innocence.

            in the matter of granting bail. The facts
            and circumstances of each case will
            govern the exercise of judicial discretion
            in granting or cancelling bail.”
</p><p id="p_75">      30. In AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE (2d, Volume 8, p.
      806, para 39), it is stated:

            the discretion of the court, the granting
            or denial is regulated, to a large extent,
            by the facts and circumstances of each
            particular case. Since the object of the
            detention or imprisonment of the
            accused is to secure his appearance
            and submission to the jurisdiction and
            the judgment of the court, the primary
            inquiry is whether a recognizance or
            bond would effect that end.”
      It is thus clear that the question whether to grant
      bail or not depends for its answer upon a variety of
      circumstances, the cumulative effect of which must
      enter into the judicial verdict. Any one single
      circumstance cannot be treated as of universal
      validity or as necessarily justifying the grant or

       that its laws are directed to problems made manifest
       by experience and its discriminations are based on
       adequate grounds.

       to any other individual or class, and yet the law hits
       only a particular individual or class.
       (3) The principle of equality does not mean that
       every law must have universal application for all
       persons who are not by nature, attainment or
       circumstances in the same position, and the varying
       needs of different classes of persons often require
       separate treatment.

       purposes.

       produce some inequality, and mere production of
       inequality is not enough.

Proposition 7 is important for the present purpose. Also, it is

any discriminatory treatment being meted out to
them as compared with other offenders who did not
fall within the same group or category and who
continued to be treated under the normal procedure.
The next question to consider is whether this
differentia had a rational relation to the object
sought to be achieved by the impugned Act. The
preamble of the Act showed that it was enacted for
providing a more speedy trial of certain offences. An
argument was however addressed before us based
on certain observations of Mahajan, J. (as he then
was) at p. 314, and Mukherjea, J. (as he then was)
at p. 328 in Anwar Ali Sarkar’s case [(1952) SCR

case of <a href="/doc/1908113/" id="a_132">Kedar Nath Bajoria v. State of West
Bengal</a> [(1954) SCR 30] that the speedier trial of
offences could not afford a reasonable basis for
such classification. Standing by themselves these
passages might lend support to the contention
urged before us by the learned counsel for the
appellant. It must be noted, however, that this ratio
was not held to be conclusive by this Court in Kedar
Nath Bajoria’s case [(1954) SCR 30] where this

In the instant case, bribery and corruption having
been rampant and the need for weeding them out
having been urgently felt, it was necessary to enact
measures for the purpose of eliminating all possible
delay in bringing the offenders to book. It was with
that end in view that provisions were enacted in the
impugned Act for speedier trial of the said offences
by the appointment of Special Judges who were
invested with exclusive jurisdiction to try the same
and were also empowered to take cognizance
thereof without the accused being committed to
them for trial, and follow the procedure prescribed
for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates. The
proceedings before the Special Judges were thus
assimilated to those before the courts of sessions
for trying cases without a jury or without the aid of
assessors and the powers of appeal and revision
invested in the High Court were also similarly
circumscribed. All these provisions had the
necessary effect of bringing about a speedier trial of
these offences and it cannot be denied that this
intelligible differentia had rational relation to the
object sought to be achieved by the impugned Act.

      Both these conditions were thus fulfilled and it could
      not be urged that the provisions of the impugned
      Act were in any manner violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_135">Article 14</a> of the

important to advert to the majority judgment of this Court in

<a href="/doc/115701246/" id="a_136">Shayara Bano v. Union of India and others</a>, (2017) 9 SCC 1.

The majority, in an exhaustive review of case law under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_137">Article

14</a>, which dealt with legislation being struck down on the ground

that it is manifestly arbitrary, has observed:

      manifestly arbitrary is obviously unreasonable and

      contradiction in the three-Judge Bench decision
      in <a href="/doc/1732220/" id="a_139">McDowell [State of A.P. v. McDowell and Co</a>.,
      (1996) 3 SCC 709] when it is said that a

      unreasonable”, yet such challenge would fail on the
      very ground of the law being “unreasonable,

unnecessary or unwarranted”. The arbitrariness
doctrine when applied to legislation obviously would
not involve the latter challenge but would only
involve a law being disproportionate, excessive or
otherwise being manifestly unreasonable. All the
aforesaid grounds, therefore, do not seek to
differentiate between State action in its various
forms, all of which are interdicted if they fall foul of
the fundamental rights guaranteed to persons and
citizens in Part III of the Constitution.

this Court in <a href="/doc/703879/" id="a_140">Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay)

Newspapers (Bombay) (P) Ltd</a>. v. Union of India,
(1985) 1 SCC 641 : 1985 SCC (Tax) 121] stated
that it was settled law that subordinate legislation
can be challenged on any of the grounds available
for challenge against plenary legislation. This being
the case, there is no rational distinction between the
two types of legislation when it comes to this ground
of challenge under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_141">Article 14.</a> The test of manifest
arbitrariness, therefore, as laid down in the
aforesaid judgments would apply to invalidate
legislation as well as subordinate legislation under
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_142">Article 14.</a> Manifest arbitrariness, therefore, must be
something done by the legislature capriciously,
irrationally and/or without adequate determining
principle. Also, when something is done which is
excessive and disproportionate, such legislation
would be manifestly arbitrary. We are, therefore, of
the view that arbitrariness in the sense of manifest
arbitrariness as pointed out by us above would
apply to negate legislation as well under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_143">Article 14</a>.”

the only article in the Fundamental Rights chapter (along with

<a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_145">Article 20</a>) that cannot be suspended even in an emergency

In the converse positive form, the expanded article
will read as below:

</p><p id="p_93">58. This epoch-making decision in Maneka Gandhi
[(1978) 1 SCC 248] has substantially infused the
concept of due process in our constitutional
jurisprudence whenever the court has to deal with a
question affecting life and liberty of citizens or even
a person. Krishna Iyer, J. giving a concurring
opinion in Maneka Gandhi [(1978) 1 SCC 248]
elaborated, in his inimitable style, the transition from
the phase of the rule of law to due process of law.
The relevant statement of law given by the learned
Judge is quoted below: (SCC p. 337, para 81)
“81. … ‘Procedure established by law’, with its lethal
potentiality, will reduce life and liberty to a
precarious      plaything     if   we      do      not ex
necessitate import into those weighty words an
adjectival rule of law, civilised in its soul, fair in its
heart and fixing those imperatives of procedural
protection absent which the processual tail will wag
the substantive head. Can the sacred essence of
the human right to secure which the struggle for
liberation, with ‘do or die’ patriotism, was launched
be     sapped     by formalistic        and    pharisaic
prescriptions, regardless of essential standards? An
enacted apparition is a constitutional, illusion.
Processual justice is writ patently on <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_151">Article 21.</a> It is
too grave to be circumvented by a black letter ritual
processed through the legislature.”
</p><p id="p_94">59. Immediately after the decision in Maneka
Gandhi [(1978) 1 SCC 248] another Constitution
Bench of this Court rendered decision in Sunil

Batra v. Delhi Admn. [(1978) 4 SCC 494 : 1979
SCC (Cri) 155] specifically acknowledged that even
though a clause like the Eighth Amendment of the
United States Constitution and concept of “due
process” of the American Constitution is not
enacted in our Constitution text, but after the
decision of this Court in Rustom Cavasjee
Cooper [(1970)     1    SCC     248]  and Maneka
Gandhi [(1978) 1 SCC 248] the consequences are
the same. The Constitution Bench of this Court
in Sunil Batra [(1978) 4 SCC 494 : 1979 SCC (Cri)
155] speaking through Krishna Iyer, J. held: (Sunil
Batra case [(1978) 4 SCC 494 : 1979 SCC (Cri)
155] , SCC p. 518, para 52)
“52. True, our Constitution has no ‘due process’
clause or the Eighth Amendment; but, in this branch
of law, after Cooper [(1970) 1 SCC 248]
and Maneka Gandhi [(1978) 1 SCC 248], the
consequence is the same.”
</p><p id="p_95">60. The Eighth Amendment (1791) to the
Constitution of the United States virtually emanated
from the English Bill of Rights (1689). The text of
the Eighth Amendment reads, “Excessive bail shall
not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor
cruel and unusual punishments inflicted”. The
English Bill of Rights drafted a century ago
postulates, “That excessive bail ought not to be
required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel
and unusual punishments inflicted”.
</p><p id="p_96">61. Our Constitution does not have a similar
provision but after the decision of this Court
in Maneka Gandhi case [(1978) 1 SCC 248]
jurisprudentially the position is virtually the same
and the fundamental respect for human dignity
underlying the Eighth Amendment has been read
into our jurisprudence.
</p><p id="p_97">62. Until the decision was rendered in Maneka
Gandhi [(1978) 1 SCC 248], <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_152">Article 21</a> was viewed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                       41</span>
      by this Court as rarely embodying the Diceyian
      concept of the rule of law that no one can be
      deprived of his personal liberty by an executive
      action unsupported by law. If there was a law which
      provided some sort of a procedure it was enough to
      deprive a person of his life or personal liberty. In this
      connection, if we refer to the example given by S.R.
      Das, J. in his judgment in A.K. Gopalan [AIR 1950
      SC 27 : (1950) 51 Cri LJ 1383] that if the law
      provided the Bishop of Rochester “be boiled in oil” it
      would be valid under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_153">Article 21.</a> But after the
      decision in Maneka Gandhi [(1978) 1 SCC 248]
      which marks a watershed in the development of
      constitutional law in our country, this Court, for the
      first time, took the view that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_154">Article 21</a> affords
      protection not only against the executive action but
      also against the legislation which deprives a person
      of his life and personal liberty unless the law for
      deprivation is reasonable, just and fair. And it was
      held that the concept of reasonableness runs like a
      golden thread through the entire fabric of the
      Constitution and it is not enough for the law to
      provide some semblance of a procedure. The
      procedure for depriving a person of his life and
      personal liberty must be eminently just, reasonable
      and fair and if challenged before the court it is for
      the court to determine whether such procedure is
      reasonable, just and fair and if the court finds that it
      is not so, the court will strike down the same.
</p><p id="p_98">      63. Therefore, “law” as interpreted under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_155">Article 21</a>
      by this Court is more than mere “lex”. It implies a
      due process, both procedurally and substantively.”

</p><p id="p_99">20.   Given the parameters of judicial review of legislation laid

down in these judgments, we have to see whether <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_156">Section 45</a>

In its original avatar, the precursor to <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_158">Section 45</a>, which was

<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_159">Section 44</a> of the said Bill, read as follows:-

      1973 or any other law for the time being in force on
      granting of bail.”
At this stage, it is clear that this Section referred only to

offences punishable under the Act itself, in which the twin

conditions for grant of bail were imposed, in addition to

limitations for such grant under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_163"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure.

Somehow, this provision did not translate itself into dealing with

offences under the 2002 Act, but became <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_164">Section 45</a> of the

2002 Act, which was brought into force in 2005. This provision

originally read as follows:

The change made by <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_168">Section 45</a> is that, for the purpose of

grant of bail, what was now to be looked at was offences that

were punishable for a term of imprisonment of three years or

more under Part A of the Schedule, and not offences under the

2002 Act itself. At this stage, Part A of the Schedule contained

two paragraphs – Para 1 containing <a href="/doc/786750/" id="a_169">Sections 121</a> and <a href="/doc/1949191/" id="a_170">121A</a> of

wage war or abetting waging of war against the Government of

India, and conspiracy to commit such offences. Paragraph 2

dealt with offences under the Narcotic Drugs and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_171">Psychotropic

Substances Act</a>, 1985. Part B of the Schedule, as originally

enacted, referred to certain offences of a heinous nature under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_172">

the Indian Penal Code</a>, which included murder, extortion,

kidnapping, forgery and counterfeiting. Paragraphs 2 to 5 of

Part B dealt with certain offences under the <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_173">Arms Act</a> 1959,

Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, <a href="/doc/69064674/" id="a_174">Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act</a>,

1956 and the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_175">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988. <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_176">When the

Act</a> was originally enacted, it was, thus, clear that the twin

conditions applicable under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_177">Section 45(1)</a> would only be in

cases involving waging of war against the Government of India

and offences under the Narcotic Drugs and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_178">Psychotropic

Substances Act</a>. Even the most heinous offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_179"> the

Indian Penal Code</a> were contained only in Part B, so that if bail

were asked for such offences, the twin conditions imposed by

<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_180">Section 45(1)</a> would not apply. Incidentally, one of the reasons

for classifying offences in Part A and Part B of the Schedule

was that offences specified under Part B would get attracted

only if the total value involved in such offences was Rs.30 lakhs

or more (under <a href="/doc/62140/" id="a_181">Section 2(y)</a> of the Act as it read then).

Thereafter, the Act has been amended several times. The

amendment made in 2005 in <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_182">Section 45(1)</a> was innocuous and

is not an amendment with which we are directly concerned.

The 2009 Amendment further populated Parts A and B of the

Schedule. In Part A, offences under Sections 489 A and<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_183"> B of

the Indian Penal Code</a>, relating to counterfeiting were added

and offences under the <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_184">Explosive Substances Act</a>, 1908 and

<a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_185">Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act</a>, 1967, which dealt with

terrorist activities, were added.    In Part B, several other

offences were added from<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_186"> the Indian Penal Code</a>, as were

very important amendment was made to the Schedule by which

the entire Part B offences were transplanted into Part A. The

object for this amendment, as stated in the Statement of

Objects and Reasons for the amendment in clause 3 (j),

specifically provided:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">      “(j) putting all the offences listed in Part A and Part
      B of the Schedule to the aforesaid Act into Part A of

      apply to the offences.”

amendments were made, by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_207">Finance Act</a> of 2016, to the

2002 Act with which we are not directly concerned.


</p><p id="p_115">24.   The statutory history of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_208">Section 45</a>, read with the

Schedule, would, thus show that in its original avatar, as Clause

44 of the 1999 Bill, the Section dealt only with offences under

the Act itself. <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_209">Section 44</a> of the 2002 Act makes it clear that an

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/731949/" id="a_210">Section 4</a> of the said Act must be

tried with the connected scheduled offence from which money

laundering has taken place. The statutory scheme, as originally

enacted, with <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_211">Section 45</a> in its present avatar, would, therefore,

lead to the same offenders in different cases having different

results qua bail depending on whether <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_212">Section 45</a> does or does

not apply. The first would be cases where the charge would

only be of money laundering and nothing else, as would be the

case where the scheduled offence in Part A has already been

tried, and persons charged under the scheduled offence have

or have not been enlarged on bail under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_213"> the Code</a> of Criminal

Procedure and thereafter convicted or acquitted. The proceeds

of crime from such scheduled offence may well be discovered

much later in the hands of Mr. X, who now becomes charged

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                                                    49</span>
with the crime of money laundering under the 2002 Act. The

predicate or scheduled offence has already been tried and the

accused persons convicted/acquitted in this illustration, and Mr.

X now applies for bail to the Special Court/High Court. The

Special Court/High Court, in this illustration, would grant him

bail under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_214">Section 439</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure – the

Special Court is deemed to be a Sessions Court – and can,

thus, enlarge Mr. X on bail, with or without conditions, under

<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_215">Section 439</a>. It is important to note that Mr. X would not have to

satisfy the twin conditions mentioned in <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_216">Section 45</a> of the 2002

Act in order to be enlarged on bail, pending trial for an offence

under the 2002 Act.
</p>
<p id="p_116">
</p><p id="p_117">25.   The second illustration would be of Mr. X being charged

with an offence under the 2002 Act together with a predicate

offence contained in Part B of the Schedule.         Both these

offences would be tried together.      In this case, again, the

Special Court/High Court can enlarge Mr. X on bail, with or

without conditions, under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_217">Section 439</a> of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, as <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_218">Section 45</a> of the 2002 Act would not apply. In a

third illustration, Mr. X can be charged under the 2002 Act

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                                                    50</span>
together with a predicate offence contained in Part A of the

Schedule in which the term for imprisonment would be 3 years

or less than 3 years (this would apply only post the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_219">Amendment

Act</a> of 2012 when predicate offences of 3 years and less than 3

years contained in Part B were all lifted into Part A). In this

illustration, again, Mr. X would be liable to be enlarged on bail

under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_220">Section 439</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the

Special Court/High Court, with or without conditions, as <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_221">Section

45</a> of the 2002 Act would have no application.


</p><p id="p_118">26.   The fourth illustration would be an illustration in which Mr.

X is prosecuted for an offence under the 2002 Act and an

offence punishable for a term of imprisonment of more than

three years under Part A of the Schedule. In this illustration, the

Special Court/High Court would enlarge Mr. X on bail only if the

conditions specified in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_222">Section 45(1)</a> are satisfied and not

otherwise. In the fourth illustration, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_223">Section 45</a> would apply in a

joint trial of offences under the Act and under Part A of the

Schedule because the only thing that is to be seen for the

purpose of granting bail, under this Section, is the alleged

occurrence of a Part A scheduled offence, which has

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                                                      51</span>
imprisonment for over three years. The likelihood of Mr. X being

enlarged on bail in the first three illustrations is far greater than

in the fourth illustration, dependant only upon the circumstance

that Mr. X is being prosecuted for a Schedule A offence which

has imprisonment for over 3 years, a circumstance which has

no nexus with the grant of bail for the offence of money

laundering. The mere circumstance that the offence of money

laundering is being tried with the Schedule A offence without

more cannot naturally lead to the grant or denial of bail (by

applying <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_224">Section 45(1)</a>) for the offence of money laundering and

the predicate offence.
</p>
<p id="p_119">
</p><p id="p_120">27.   Again, it is quite possible that the person prosecuted for

the scheduled offence is different from the person prosecuted

for the offence under the 2002 Act. Mr. X may be a person who

is liable to be prosecuted for an offence, which is contained in

Part A of the Schedule. In perpetrating this offence under Part

A of the Schedule, Mr. X may have been paid a certain amount

of money. This money is ultimately traced to Mr. Y, who is

charged with the same offence under Part A of the Schedule

and is also charged with possession of the proceeds of crime,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                                                        52</span>
which he now projects as being untainted. Mr. X applies for bail

to the Special Court/High Court. Despite the fact that Mr. X is

not involved in the money laundering offence, but only in the

scheduled offence, by virtue of the fact that the two sets of

offences are being tried together, Mr. X would be denied bail

because the money laundering offence is being tried along with

the scheduled offence, for which Mr. Y alone is being

prosecuted.   This illustration would show that a person who

may have nothing to do with the offence of money laundering

may yet be denied bail, because of the twin conditions that

have to be satisfied under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_225">Section 45(1)</a> of the 2002 Act. Also,

Mr. A may well be prosecuted for an offence which falls within

Part A of the Schedule, but which does not involve money

laundering. Such offences would be liable to be tried under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_226"> the

Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, and despite the fact that it may be

the very same Part A scheduled offence given in the illustration

above, the fact that no prosecution for money laundering along

with the said offence is launched, would enable Mr. A to get bail

without the rigorous conditions contained in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_227">Section 45</a> of the

2002 Act. All these examples show that manifestly arbitrary,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                                                    53</span>
discriminatory and unjust results would arise on the application

or non application      of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_228">Section 45</a>, and would directly violate

Articles 14 and 21, inasmuch as the procedure for bail would

become harsh, burdensome, wrongful and discriminatory

depending upon whether a person is being tried for an offence

which also happens to be an offence under Part A of the

Schedule, or an offence under Part A of the Schedule together

with an offence under the 2002 Act. Obviously, the grant of bail

would depend upon a circumstance which has nothing to do

with the offence of money laundering. On this ground alone,

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_229">Section 45</a> would have to be struck down as being manifestly

arbitrary and providing a procedure which is not fair or just and

would, thus, violate both Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.

</p><p id="p_121">28.   Another interesting feature of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_230">Section 45</a> is that the twin

conditions that need to be satisfied under the said Section are

that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the

accused is not guilty of “such offence” and that he is not likely

to commit any offence while on bail.      The expression “such

offence” would be relatable only to an offence in Part A of the

Schedule.   Thus, in an application made for bail, where the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                                                    54</span>
offence of money laundering is involved, if <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_231">Section 45</a> is to be

applied, the Court must be satisfied that there are reasonable

grounds for believing that he is not guilty of the offence under

Part A of the Schedule, which is not the offence of money

laundering, but which is a completely different offence.       In

every other Act, where these twin conditions are laid down, be it

the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 or

the Narcotic Drugs and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_232">Psychotropic Substances Act</a>, 1985, the

reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty

of an offence is in relation to an offence under the very Act in

which such section occurs. (See for example, Section 20(8) of

TADA and <a href="/doc/496325/" id="a_233">Section 37</a> of the NDPS Act). It is only in the 2002

Act that the twin conditions laid down do not relate to an

offence under the 2002 Act at all, but only to a separate and

distinct offence found under Part A of the Schedule. Obviously,

the twin conditions laid down in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_234">Section 45</a> would have no

nexus whatsoever with a bail application which concerns itself

with the offence of money laundering, for if <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_235">Section 45</a> is to

apply, the Court does not apply its mind to whether the person

prosecuted is guilty of the offence of money laundering, but


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                                                    55</span>
instead applies its mind to whether such person is guilty of the

scheduled or predicate offence.     Bail would be denied on

grounds germane to the scheduled or predicate offence,

whereas the person prosecuted would ultimately be punished

for a completely different offence - namely, money laundering.

This, again, is laying down of a condition which has no nexus

with the offence of money laundering at all, and a person who

may prove that there are reasonable grounds for believing that

he is not guilty of the offence of money laundering may yet be

denied bail, because he is unable to prove that there are

reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of the

scheduled or predicate offence. This would again lead to a

manifestly arbitrary, discriminatory and unjust result which

would invalidate the Section.
</p>
<p id="p_122">
</p><p id="p_123">29.   It is important to notice that <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_236">Section 45</a> classifies the

predicate offence under Part A of the Schedule on the basis of

sentencing. The learned Attorney General referred to a number

of judgments in which classification on this basis has been

upheld. It is unnecessary to refer to these judgments inasmuch

as the classification of three years or more of offences

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                                                   56</span>
contained in Part A of the Schedule must have a reasonable

relation to the object sought to be achieved under the 2002 Act.

As has already been pointed out, the 2002 Act was enacted so

that property involved in money laundering may be attached

and brought back into the economy, as also that persons guilty

of the offence of money laundering must be brought to book. It

is interesting to note that even in the recent 2015 amendment,

the Legislature has used the value involved in the offence

contained in Part B of the Schedule as a basis for classification.

If, for example, the basis for classification of offences referred

to and related to offences under the 2002 Act with a monetary

limit beyond which such offences would be made out, such

classification would obviously have a rational relation to the

object sought to be achieved by the Act i.e. to attach properties

and the money involved in money laundering and to bring

persons involved in the offence of money laundering to book.

On the other hand, it is clear that the term of imprisonment of

more than 3 years for a scheduled or predicate offence would

be a manifestly arbitrary and unjust classification, having no

rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by an Act


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                                                     57</span>
dealing with money laundering. Again a few illustrations would

suffice to prove the point.
</p>
<p id="p_124">
</p><p id="p_125">30.   An   extremely    heinous   offence,   such   as   murder,

punishable with death or life imprisonment, which is now

contained in Part A of the Schedule may yield only Rs.5,000/-

as proceeds of crime. On the other hand, an offence relating to

a false declaration under <a href="/doc/852376/" id="a_237">Section 132</a> of the Customs Act,

punishable with a sentence of upto 2 years, which is an offence

under Part B of the Schedule, may lead to proceeds of crime in

crores of rupees.    In short, a classification based on sentence

of imprisonment of more than three years of an offence

contained in Part A of the Schedule, which is a predicate

offence, would have no rational relation to the object of

attaching and bringing back into the economy large amounts by

way of proceeds of crime. When it comes to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_238">Section 45</a>, it is

clear that a classification based on sentencing qua a scheduled

offence would have no rational relation with the grant of bail for

the offence of money laundering, as has been shown in the

preceding paragraphs of this judgment. Even in the judgments

citied by the learned Attorney General, it is clear that a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                                                     58</span>
classification is justified only if it is not manifestly arbitrary. For

example, in Special Courts Bill, 1978, In re, (1979) 1 SCC

380, a judgment cited by the learned Attorney General,

proposition 9 contained at page 425 states:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">      “If the legislative policy is clear and definite and as
      an effective method of carrying out that policy a
      discretion is vested by the statute upon a body of
      administrators or officers to make selective
      application of the law to certain classes or groups of
      persons, the statute itself cannot be condemned as
      a piece of discriminatory legislation. In such cases,
      the power given to the executive body would import
      a duty on it to classify the subject-matter of
      legislation in accordance with the objective
      indicated in the statute. If the administrative body
      proceeds to classify persons or things on a basis
      which has no rational relation to the objective of the
      Legislature, its action can be annulled as offending
      against the equal protection clause. On the other
      hand, if the statute itself does not disclose a definite
      policy or objective and it confers authority on
      another to make selection at its pleasure, the
      statute would be held on the face of it to be
      discriminatory, irrespective of the way in which it is
      applied.”

It is clear from a reading of this judgment that offences based

on sentencing of the scheduled offence would have no rational

relation to the object of the 2002 Act and to the granting of bail

for offences committed under the Act, and, therefore, have to

be annulled on the basis of the equal protection clause.

is clear that there are many sections under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_239"> the Indian Penal

Code</a> punishable with life imprisonment which are not included

in Part A of the Schedule, and which may yet lead to proceeds

of crime.   For example, <a href="/doc/367254/" id="a_240">Sections 232</a> and <a href="/doc/951248/" id="a_241">238</a> of the Indian

Penal Code, which deal with counterfeiting of Indian coin and

import or export of counterfeited Indian coin, are punishable

with life imprisonment. These sections are not included in Part

A of the Schedule, and a person who may counterfeit Indian

coin is liable to be tried under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_242"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure

with conditions as to bail under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_243">Section 439</a> being imposed by

the High Court or the Sessions Court.        As against this, a

person who counterfeits Government stamps under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_244">Section

255</a> is roped into Part A of the Schedule, which is also

punishable with life imprisonment. If such person is to apply for

bail, the twin conditions contained in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_245">Section 45</a> would apply to

him. Similar is the case with offences where a punishment of

maximum of 10 years is given. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_246">Section 240</a> dealing with

delivery of Indian coin possessed with knowledge that it is

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_249">373</a> which deal with the selling and buying of minors for the

purpose of prostitution, are all offences which are outside Part

A of the Schedule and are punishable with the maximum of 10

years sentence. Each of these offences may involve money

laundering, but not being in Part A of the Schedule, a person

prosecuted for these offences would be able to obtain bail

under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_250">Section 439</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, without

any further conditions attached. On the other hand, if a person

is charged with extortion under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_251">Sections 386</a> or 388, (such

sections being included in Part A of the Schedule) and <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_252">Section

would only be able to obtain bail after meeting the stringent

conditions specified in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_253">Section 45</a>.       This is yet another

circumstance which makes the application of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_254">Section 45</a> to the

manifestly arbitrary.

psychotropic substances where a person is found with, what is

a person found with small quantity, to 10 years for a person

found with something between small and commercial quantity,

and a minimum of 10 years upto 20 years when a person is

for only insofar as persons who have commercial quantities

with them are concerned. A person found with a small quantity

or with a quantity above small quantity, but below commercial

quantity, punishable with a one year sentence or a 10 year

sentence respectively, can apply for bail under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_273">Section 439</a> of

is liable to be punished for imprisonment for a term which may

and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987, there is no

provision in the 2002 Act which excludes grant of anticipatory

bail. Anticipatory bail can be granted in circumstances set out

in <a href="/doc/1108032/" id="a_284">Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra</a>,

(2011) 1 SCC 694 (See paragraphs 109, 112 and 117). Thus,

anticipatory bail may be granted to a person who is prosecuted

for the offence of money laundering together with an offence

under Part A of the Schedule, which may last throughout the

trial. Obviously for grant of such bail, <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_285">Section 45</a> does not need

to be satisfied, as only a person arrested under <a href="/doc/128102/" id="a_286">Section 19</a> of

the Act can only be released on bail after satisfying the

conditions of <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_287">Section 45</a>.      But insofar as pre-arrest bail is

concerned, <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_288">Section 45</a> does not apply on its own terms. This,

again, would lead to an extremely anomalous situation. If pre-

arrest bail is granted to Mr. X, which enures throughout the trial,

for an offence under Part A of the Schedule and <a href="/doc/1693109/" id="a_289">Section 4</a> of

the 2002 Act, such person will be out on bail without his having

conditions of <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_291">Section 45</a> will have first to be met. This again

leads to an extremely anomalous situation showing that <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_292">Section

therefore, violate Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.

before us that we must uphold <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_293">Section 45</a> as it is part of a

complete code under the 2002 Act. According to him, <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_294">Section

the conclusion that the source of the proceeds of crime, being

the scheduled offence, and the money laundering offence,

would have to be tried together, and the nexus that is provided

is because the source of money laundering being as important

as money laundering itself, conditions under <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_297">Section 45</a> would

have to be applied.     We are afraid that, for all the reasons

given by us earlier in this judgment, we are unable to agree.

The learned Attorney General asked us to read down <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_298">Section

45</a> in that when the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable

grounds for believing that a person is not guilty of an offence, it

only meant that the Court must prima facie come to such a

conclusion.   Secondly, the fact that he is not likely to commit

“any offence” while on bail would only be restricted to any

offence of a like nature.     Again, we are afraid that merely

reading down the two conditions would not get rid of the vice of

manifest arbitrariness and discrimination, as has been pointed

out by us hereinabove. Also, we cannot agree with the learned

Attorney General that <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_299">Section 45</a> imposes two conditions which

are akin to conditions that are specified for grant of ordinary

bail. For this purpose, he referred us to Amarmani Tripathi

(supra) at para 18, in which it was stated that, for grant of bail,

the Court has to see whether there is prima facie or reasonable

ground to believe that the accused has committed the offence,

and the likelihood of that offence being repeated has also be

seen. It is obvious that the twin conditions set down in <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_300">Section

45</a> are a much higher threshold bar than any of the conditions

laid down in paragraph 18 of the aforesaid judgment. In fact,

the presumption of innocence, which is attached to any person

being prosecuted of an offence, is inverted by the conditions

specified in <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_301">Section 45</a>, whereas for grant of ordinary bail the

presumption of innocence attaches, after which the various

factors set out in paragraph 18 of the judgment are to be looked

at. Under <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_302">Section 45</a>, the Court must be satisfied that there are

reasonable grounds to believe that the person is not guilty of

such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence

In a sharply worded minority judgment of Justice Marshall, with

upheld only because it was necessary for the State to deal with

which speaks of the same twin conditions to be applied to

reasons stated in the aforesaid judgment. Ultimately, in

of TADA in the following terms:

      conditions prescribed under clauses (i) and (ii) of
      sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_312">Section 437</a> and clause (b) of
      sub-section (3) of that section. Similar to the

      that any authorised or empowered officer under the
      respective Acts, if, has got reason to believe that
      any person in India or within the Indian customs
      waters has been guilty of an offence punishable
      under the respective Acts, may arrest such person.</blockquote><p id="p_148">

     condition infringing the principle of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_317">Article 21</a> of the

It is clear that this Court upheld such a condition only because

the offence under TADA was a most heinous offence in which

the vice of terrorism is sought to be tackled. Given the heinous

nature of the offence which is punishable by death or life

imprisonment, and given the fact that the Special Court in that

case was a Magistrate and not a Sessions Court, unlike the

present case, Section 20(8) of TADA was upheld as being in

consonance with conditions prescribed under <a href="/doc/848468/" id="a_318">Section 437</a> of

the Code of Criminal Procedure.      In the present case, it is

<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_319">Section 439</a> and not <a href="/doc/848468/" id="a_320">Section 437</a> of the Code of Criminal

Procedure that applies. Also, the offence that is spoken of in

<a href="/doc/919170/" id="a_321">Section 20(8)</a> is an offence under TADA itself and not an

offence under some other Act. For all these reasons, the

      a construction is placed, the court intending to grant
      bail must arrive at a finding that the applicant has

scheduled offence in Part A of the Schedule, whereas <a href="/doc/1373137/" id="a_328">Section

24</a> speaks of the offence of money laundering, and raises a

presumption against the person prosecuted for the crime of

money laundering. This presumption has no application to the

scheduled offence mentioned in <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_329">Section 45</a>, and cannot,

therefore, advance the case of the Union of India.


</p><p id="p_156">42.     The learned Attorney General then relied strongly on

Gautam Kundu (supra) and Rohit Tandon (supra). Gautam

Kundu (supra) is a judgment relating to an offence under the

SEBI Act, which is a scheduled offence, which was followed in

Rohit     Tandon    (supra).   In   Rohit    Tandon      (supra),

Khanwilkar, J., speaking for the Bench, makes it clear that the

judgment does not deal with the constitutional validity of

<a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_330">Section 45</a> of the 2002 Act. Both these judgments proceed on

the footing that <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_331">Section 45</a> is constitutionally valid and then go

on to apply <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_332">Section 45</a> on the facts of those cases.       These

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                                                                    75</span>
judgments, therefore, are not of much assistance when it

comes to the constitutional validity of <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_333">Section 45</a> being

challenged.
</p>
<p id="p_157">43.   Shri Rohatgi’s alternate argument, namely, that if <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_334">Section

45</a> were not to be struck down, the 2012 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_335">Amendment Act</a>

should be read down in the manner indicated in Gorav

Kathuria v. Union of India and Ors., 2017 (348) ELT 24 (P &amp;

H) and having been expressly approved by this Court, must

apply to the facts of these cases.

</p><p id="p_159">44.   In Gorav Kathuria (supra), the 2012 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_336">Amendment Act</a> was

read down having regard to the object sought to be achieved by

the amendment, namely, that Part B of the Schedule is being

made Part A of the Schedule, so that the provision of a

monetary threshold limit does not apply to the offences

contained therein. The High Court concluded:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">      “12.20 Guided by the aforesaid principles laid down
      by the Hon'ble Supreme Court regarding statutory
      interpretation and the duty of the Court to secure
      the ends of justice, we have no hesitation in holding
      that in 2013, Part B of the Schedule was omitted
      and the Scheduled Offences falling thereunder were
      incorporated in Part A with the sole object to
      overcome the monetary threshold limit of Rs. 30
      lakhs for invocation of PMLA in respect of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                                                   76</span>
     laundering of proceeds of crime involved in those
     offences. No substantive amendment was proposed
     with express intention to apply limitations on grant
     of bail as contained in <a href="/doc/242879/" id="a_337">Section 45(1)</a> in respect of
     persons accused of such offences which were
     earlier listed in Part B. Therefore, twin limitations in
     grant of bail contained in <a href="/doc/242879/" id="a_338">Section 45(1)</a> as it stands
     today, are not applicable qua a person accused of
     such offences which were earlier listed in Part B.”


The matter came to this Court by a certificate of fitness granted

by the High Court. Sikri, J and Ramana, J., by their order dated

12th August, 2016, stated:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">     “Though the High Court has granted certificate to
     appeal, we have heard the learned counsel for
     some time and are of the opinion that the impugned
     judgment of the High Court is correct.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">     This appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.”

The complaint of the learned Attorney General is that this was

done at the very threshold without hearing the Union of India.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_160">Be that as it may, we are of the opinion that, even though the

Punjab High Court judgment appears to be correct, it is

unnecessary for us to go into this aspect any further, in view of

the fact that we have struck down <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_339">Section 45</a> of the 2002 Act as

a whole.

<p id="p_161">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                                                                    77</span>
</p><p id="p_162">45.   Regard being had to the above, we declare <a href="/doc/1001502/" id="a_340">Section 45(1)</a>

of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, insofar as it

imposes two further conditions for release on bail, to be

unconstitutional as it violates Articles 14 and 21 of the

Constitution of India.   All the matters before us in which bail

has been denied, because of the presence of the twin

conditions contained in <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_341">Section 45</a>, will now go back to the

respective Courts which denied bail.    All such orders are set

aside, and the cases remanded to the respective Courts to be

heard on merits, without application of the twin conditions

contained in <a href="/doc/1821448/" id="a_342">Section 45</a> of the 2002 Act.       Considering that

persons are languishing in jail and that personal liberty is

involved, all these matters are to be taken up at the earliest by

the respective Courts for fresh decision. The writ petitions and

the appeals are disposed of accordingly.
