</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">       Your lordship may be pleased to direct the respondent no.5 to
       forthwith stop the industrial construction activity on the disputed
       site block/survey no.111, 112 &amp; 119 and thereby, to comply the
       directions and orders of GPCB."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">2.      During the course of submission and hearing, it transpired that
now the most relevant policy so far as pollution and conservation of
environment is concerned, the GPCB's policy vide Circular dated 12th April
2016 placed on record at page no.93 and the complete compliance thereof
is to be insisted upon by all the concerned and deviation of breach thereof
would entail serious consequences that may include, if required, removal
or shifting of the existing industries in case they are offending or contrary
to the policy as spelt out.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.     Shri Viral Shah, learned advocate appearing for the Gujarat
Pollution Control Board makes a statement that this policy is prevalent as
on date and it has not been rescinded in any manner, therefore all the
authorities will have to insist strict compliance therewith.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.      Shri Utkarsh Sharma, learned AGP for the respondent nos.1, 2 and
3 under the instructions of Shri V.L.Patel, Resident Additional Collector,
states that as there is a specific statement of policy produced on record at
page no.93, the said authority would take all the positive steps to enforce
strict compliance therewith after following due procedure of law and page
no.146 also now would pale into insignificance on account of this clear
stand of GPCB. The industries offending this policy and not in significance
with the policy within the jurisdiction will be proceeded against and 4
weeks be granted for initiating the action, which in due compliance with
law would be over within 4 weeks thereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.      In this view of the matter, we are of the considered view that the
petition is required to be disposed of with a liberty to all the concerned to
approach the Court by filing fresh proceedings in case of difficulty.
Accordingly, the petition is disposed of with aforesaid liberty.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.      It goes without saying that in light of the statement made by the
learned advocate for the GPCB and learned AGP for the respondent nos.1,
2 and 3, all the concerned authorities shall take steps and do the needful
so far as cause of action is concerned.

5     As the consent order came to be revoked, a closure order dated
2nd March 2020 came to be passed by the GPCB.


6     It appears that on the strength of the two orders referred to
</pre><p id="p_16">above, the respondent No.3 disconnected the power supply of the
unit. In such circumstances, the writ applicants are here before this
Court. On 20 th March 2020, this Court passed the following order:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">             "Heard Mr. Mihir J. Thakore, learned Senior counsel with Mr.
      Keyur D. Gandhi and Mr. Raheel S. Patel, learned counsel for Nanavati
      Associates for the petitioner and Mr. Premal R. Joshi, learned counsel for
      respondent no.3 and Mr. Viral K. Shah, learned advocate for GPCB -
      respondent no.1.

      record. Copy of same may be provided to all the parties.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">      3.      Learned advocate for petitioner has prayed to reconnect the
      electricity supply, which was disconnected pursuant to impugned order, as
      there are 600 residential units in the petitioner company.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">      4.      Keeping the issue of disconnection of electricity supply     open, by
      way of ad­interim relief, the respondent no.3 is directed to restore the
      electric connection to the petitioner unit for residential use. However,
      petitioner shall not utilize the electricity for any other purpose. The same
      shall be utilized for residential purpose only.

<blockquote id="blockquote_28">      5.      The respondent GPCB shall present the original file of present
      petitioner before the court on the next date of hearing.

the respondent Nos.1 &amp; 2 &amp; Mr. Premal Joshi, the learned counsel
appearing for the respdt No.3.
</p>

<p id="p_18">8     The principal argument of the learned senior counsel is that
the impugned orders are without jurisdiction as no opportunity of
hearing was given to the writ applicants before the consent order
came to be revoked. In this regard, the learned senior counsel invited
the attention of this Court to the averments made in para 7 of the
affidavit­in­reply dated 13   th
                                   March 2020 filed on behalf of the GPCB.
</p><p id="p_19">The same reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">      "Without prejudice to aforesaid contentions, it is respectfully submitted
      that if this Hon'ble Court is of the Opinion that closure order is passed
      without affording opportunity of hearing to petitioner / in breach of
      principle's of natural justice, matter may be remanded back with direction
      to adjudicate show cause notice afresh within stipulated time after giving
      sufficient opportunity to petitioner and petitioner may be directed to
      appear before the respondent board and to file its representation within
      the stipulated time and respondent shall decide the same afresh."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_20">9     Thereafter, the learned senior counsel invited the attention of
this Court to the further affidavit filed on behalf of the GPCB. In the
further affidavit, the following has been stated:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">      "At the outset, it is again submitted that SCN dated 13­12­2019, @ P.
      109, was served upon the petitioner via online mode on 13­12­2019
      @15:55:00. To substantiate the same, deponent herein annexed the screen
      shot of the GPCB portal, which is marked as ANNEXURE: 1. It is submitted
      that intimation of issuance of SCN is also served upon the petitioner firm
      i.e. on its Registered Mobile being mobile number 7211102011, on 13­
      12­2019, itself."

10    It appears from the materials on record that the villagers took
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_32">up the issue in public interest. It appears that the villagers are
objecting to the various setting up of the industrial unit in their
village. It appears that it is the case of the villagers that the consent
order was granted by the GPCB contrary to the guidelines.

<p id="p_21">11    We do not propose to go into the merits of the case as we are
of the view that both the impugned orders deserve to be quashed
only on the ground that appropriate opportunity of hearing was not
given to the writ applicants. We are of the view that the writ
applicants must be heard by the GPCB, and thereafter, a fresh order,
in accordance with law, may be passed.</p><pre id="pre_4">
