                                  BEFORE
             HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ACHINTYA MALLA BUJOR BARUA

                                               ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">Date : 04-05-2020

       Heard Mr. R Sensua, learned counsel for the applicants. Also heard Mr. PP Dutta, learned
counsel for the writ petitioners and Mr. S Baruah, learned counsel for the Pollution Control Board,
Assam (for short, the PCB, Assam).
</p>


<p id="p_2">2.   The applicants/respondents No.8 and 9 is operating a hot mix plant with capacity of 2000 tonnes
per month at No.2 Kachamari Gaon, Mouza: Sepon, under Moran Revenue Circle in the Dibrugarh
district. The writ petition being WP(C)No.209/2020 is instituted by Mrs. Prema Raidengia and 17 other
persons being residents of Village No.2 Kachamari Gaon seeking a direction to the authorities under
the PCB, Assam to take immediate action against the pollution caused by the hot mix plant of the
respondents No.8 and 9 which is located at No.2 Kachamari Gaon.
</p>


<p id="p_3">3.   In paragraph 12 of the writ petition, the following grounds have been taken as to why there is a
requirement for interference with the functioning of the hot mix plant of the respondents No.8 and 9:
</p><p id="p_4">                                                                                           Page No.# 12/14

      "(i). The said hot mix plant is running without obtaining the necessary 'Consent to Establish' or
'Consent to Operate' from the Pollution Control Board, Assam i.e. Respondent No.4 and hence
violative of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_1">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      (ii). That the hot mix plant is established in a residential area causing pollution to the public.
The local public is severely affected due to the pollution emanating from the hot mix plant.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      (iii). That the land over which the industrial plant i.e. hot mix plant is being operated is an
agricultural land wherein no industry can be set up.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      (iv). That no permission either from local Panchayat or district Authority is obtained in running
the hot mix plant."
</p>


<p id="p_8">4.    A reading of paragraph 12 apparently shows that an interference with the hot mix plant is
sought for on the ground that necessary consent to establish and consent to operate from the PCB,
Assam is not available in respect of the hot mix plant; the hot mix plant is established in a residential
area causing pollution to the public; the land over which the hot mix plant is operated is an
agricultural land; and no permission either from local Panchayat or District Authorities is obtained for
running the hot mix plant. Inspite of the four different grounds being taken to assail the operation of
the hot mix plant, this Court by the order dated 28.02.2020 had restrained the applicants/respondents
No.8 and 9 from operating the hot mix plant by taking into consideration, the first ground raised by
the writ petitioners that no consent to establish and consent to operate have been obtained by the
respondents No.8 and 9. In the circumstances, this interlocutory application is preferred by the
respondents No.8 and 9 by bringing on record a copy of the consent to establish dated 30.11.2019
and a copy of the consent to operate dated 11.12.2019 to show that the first ground taken by the writ
petitioners that the hot mix plant is being operated without the consent to establish and consent to
operate is unsustainable.
</p>


<p id="p_9">5.   From that point of view, we are convinced by the stand taken by the respondents No.8 and 9 as
regards the existence of consent to establish and consent to operate and, therefore, the prima facie
case based upon which the interim order was passed is non-existent. However, Mr. PP Dutta, learned
counsel for the writ petitioners also urges upon that the consent to operate dated 11.12.2019 is only
up to 31.03.2020. A perusal of the consent to operate of 11.12.2019 shows that the said consent to
operate was only up to 31.03.2020 with a request to the applicant/respondents No.8 and 9 to apply
                                                                                           Page No.# 13/14

for further consent to operate for the year 2020-2021. Accordingly, Mr. PP Dutta, learned counsel for
the writ petitioners submits that even if the interim order is vacated, the petitioner would be left
without consent to operate as on date.
</p>


<p id="p_10">6.    We have given our consideration to the contention raised by the applicants/respondents No.8
and 9 as regards the existence of consent to operate and also with regard to the contention of the
writ petitioners that the consent to operate is no longer in force as on date and there would be
requirement of the respondents No.8 and 9 to apply for a further consent to operate. In the
circumstances, we vacate the interim order dated 28.02.2020 in WP(C)No.209/2020 by withdrawing
the restrain order in respect of operating the hot mix plant of the respondents No.8 and 9. But,
however, a recall of the restrain order would not on its own entitle the respondents No.8 and 9 to
begin the operation as on today inasmuch as, the earlier consent to operate was only up to
31.03.2020 requiring the said respondent to make a further application for the year 2020-2021.
Accordingly, it is provided that the respondents No.8 and 9 shall make their necessary application
before the PCB, Assam for grant of a further consent to operate for the year 2020-2021. In doing so,
the PCB shall also take note of any application/representation being made by the writ petitioners as
regards their other grounds that the hot mix plant cannot be allowed to operate in the present
location, inasmuch as, it is in a residential area; it is located in an agricultural land; and no permission
was obtained from the local Panchayat and District Authority. Accordingly, the respondent PCB, Assam
while considering the application of the respondents No.8 and 9 for grant of a further consent to
operate shall also give due consideration to the objections that may be raised by the writ petitioners
in their application and thereafter pass a reasoned order thereon.
</p>


<p id="p_11">7.   As the respondents No.8 and 9 are unable to operate their hot mix plant, interest of justice
would further require that the decision as required by the PCB, Assam be made within a period of 30
days from the date of the application made by the respondents No.8 and 9 for grant of consent to
operate. Correspondingly the writ petitioners may also submit representation before the PCB, Assam
opposing the grant of such consent to operate in respect of the respondents No.8 and 9 and in the
event, any such representation is filed, the same be also given its due consideration along with the
application of the respondents No.8 and 9.
</p><p id="p_12">                                                                                         Page No.# 14/14

</p><p id="p_13">8.   However, at this stage Mr. S Baruah, learned counsel for the PCB, Assam makes a statement that
because of the prevailing COVID 19 situation there is a blanket order extending the consent to
operate in respect of all the categories of industries up to 30.06.2020. If it is so, for opposing the
operation of the hot mix plant up to 30.06.2020, the writ petitioners shall make an application raising
an objection against the hot mix plant of the respondents No.8 and 9 and in the event, any such
representation is made, the PCB, Assam shall give a hearing to the representative of the writ
petitioners as well as to the respondents No.8 and 9 and pass a reasoned order thereon as regards
the contention that the hot mix plant of the respondents No.8 and 9 is causing pollution in the locality.
Irrespective of any application already made, the writ petitioners to make a fresh application and the
PCB, Assam shall pass a reasoned order on such application within a period of 15 days therefrom.
</p>


<p id="p_14">9.   Accordingly, it is an agreement between the parties that the above requirements of this order
can also be construed to be a final adjudication in the writ petition. In view of such agreement, we
are inclined to close the writ petition in the above terms, but, however, for an appropriate decision on
the issues involved, both a representative of the writ petitioners as well as the respondents No.8 and
9 be given a hearing by the appropriate authority of the PCB, Assam before any reasoned order is
passed.
</p>


<p id="p_15">10. Interlocutory application stands disposed of in the above terms.
