</p><p id="p_3">2.   The facts, according to the Petitioner, are as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     2.1. The Petitioner had availed term loan facilities from

          Respondent Nos.5 to 7 viz., HDFC Bank Limited, Federal

          Bank and Aditya Birla Finance Limited, out of which, a

          sum of Rs.190.57 crores was advanced by Respondent

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">          According to the Petitioner, the Petitioner is in the business

          of running an Information Technology Park (Technology

          park or Tech Park) and a 5 star Hotel, both of which have

          been constructed on the land belonging to the Petitioner.</blockquote><p id="p_4">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             5</span>


2.2. In order to service the aforesaid loan, there is an agreement

     arrived at between lenders i.e., the Respondent Nos.5 to 7

     that the revenue from the lease rentals of the Technology

     Park    would     be   credited    into     Escrow      Account

     No.57500000106944 and revenue from the Petitioner's

     hotel business would be credited into Escrow Account

     No.57500000286555.      Respondent        Nos.5   and   6   were

     entitled to appropriate the Equated Monthly Installment

     (EMI, for short) payable on the loans due to them from the

     Escrow Account where the lease rentals were deposited;

     the excess rental was to be released from the Escrow

     Account to the current account of the Petitioner for

     utilisation by the Petitioner to meet its expenses. Similarly,

     the revenue arising out of the hotel business was to be

     deposited in the Escrow Account relating to the hotel

     business, from and out of which, the Petitioner was

     entitled to draw monies to its current account on a daily

     basis for use in connection with its hotel business and

     instalment on the loan borrowed on account of the hotel

     business to Respondent No.7 on the due date that it 13th of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               6</span>




2.3. A pari passu first charge by way of hypothecation of all

     securities,   including   the Petitioner's cash flows and

     receivables, rentals from the Technology Park as also the

     revenues from the hotel business without exception were

     created in favour of all the Banks viz., Respondent Nos.5 to

</p><p id="p_7">     7.   It is the case of the Petitioner that the Petitioner is

     regular in repaying the loan amounts and all the EMIs are

     current in payment. Therefore, the loan account of the

     Petitionerare standard account, there is no default on the

     part of the Petitioner in the repayment of any amount due

     to any of Respondent Nos.5 to 7.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
2.4. At this stage, due to the unfortunate spread of Novel

     Corona Virus - 19 ("N-Covid-19"), the Government of India

     invoked the <a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_1">Disaster Management Act</a>, 2005 ("DMA", for

     short) by its order dated 24.03.2020. Directions were

     issued to all the Ministries, Departments of Government of

     India/State, Union Government and State/Union Territory

     authorities to take effective measures so as to prevent the

     spread of N-Covid 19.
</p><p id="p_9">                                               WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             7</span>


2.5. On the very same day, the Secretary, Ministry of Home

     Affairs, Government of India also issued guidelines under

     the provisions of DMA as regards the measures to be taken

     for containment of N-Covid 19 in the country which

     included a direction for the closure of all commercial and

     private establishments, suspension of transportation, etc.


2.6. Thereafter from time to time, the Government of India as

     also the various State Governments have been, under the

     DMA, issuing directions as regards maintaining of social

     distancing, closure or restrictive operation of private and

     public enterprises/establishments etc., These directions

     being required to be followed by one and all including the

     Petitioner, its employees, tenants and the persons availing

     services of the Petitioner, the non-following would result in

     punitive action under the DMA.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
2.7. The RBI acting with alacrity realising the potential

     disturbance that could be caused to the economy and

     institutions across the country vide a press release dated

     27.03.2020 set out the various development and regulatory

     policies to address the stress in the financial condition

     caused by N-Covid 19 so as to ease the financial stress.
</p><p id="p_11">                                                 WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                             8</span>




2.8. One of the modes for doing so was by relaxing the

     repayment pressures on the borrowers and by improving

     access to the working capital by such borrowers. Realising

     that much of the economic establishment across the

     country would not be able to operate on account of social

     distancing, lockdown, the prohibition of transportation,

     etc., as also realising that there would not be many

     economic activities and/or revenue generated therefrom,

     RBI had also proposed a moratorium for a period of three

     months on the        repayment of all loans by way of

     instalments in respect of loans outstanding as on March

     1st, 2020 to be provided by all commercial Banks

     (including regional rural Banks, small finance Banks, local

     area Banks), Co-operative Banks, All India Financial

     Institutions   and   NBFCs    (including   Housing   Finance

     Companies and Micro Finance Institutions) - for brevity

     referred to as lending institution/s.


2.9. On the very same day, the RBI issued a Circular dated

     27.03.2020 which contains detailed instructions as regards

     the above Regulatory Package permitting the aforesaid

     lending institutions to grant a moratorium of three months

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                             9</span>


     on payment of all term loan instalments falling due

     between March 1st 2020 and May 31st 2020. Para 2

     relating to rescheduling of payments for term loans and

     working capital facilities would be relevant according to the

     Petitioner and the same is extracted hereinbelow.




</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">          "2. In respect of all term loans (including
          agricultural term loans, retail and crop loans),
          all commercial Banks (including regional rural
          Banks, small finance Banks and local area
          Banks), co-operative Banks, all-India Financial
          Institutions, and NBFCs (including housing
          finance companies) ("lending institutions") are
          permitted to grant a moratorium of three months
          on payment of all instalments falling due
          between March 1st, 2020 and May 31st, 2020.
          The repayment schedule for such loans as also
          the residual tenor will be shifted across the
          Board by three months after the moratorium
          period. Interest shall continue to accrue on the
          outstanding portion of the term loans during the
          moratorium period."

     reproduced hereinbelow:
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">          "4. In respect of working capital facilities
          sanctioned in the form of CC/OD to borrowers
          facing stress on account of the economic fallout
          of the pandemic, lending institutions may
          recalculate the 'drawing power' by reducing the
          margins and/or by reassessing the working
          capital cycle. This relief shall be available in
          respect of all such changes effected up to May

          31st, 2020 and shall be contingent on the
          lending institutions satisfying themselves that
          the same is necessitated on account of the
          economic fallout from COVID-19. Further,
          accounts provided relief under these instructions
          shall be subject to subsequent supervisory
          review with regard to their justifiability on
          account of the economic fallout from COVID-19."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_14">2.11. The manner and methodology of the moratorium being

     extended is in terms of Para 8 which comes under the

     heading Other Conditions. It is extracted hereunder:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">          "8. Lending institutions shall frame Board
          approved policies for providing the above

there may be a temporary disruption in the cash
flows, and in some cases loss of income, for the
businesses/individuals and the present measures
work to bring relief to those businesses/individuals.

QUESTION 3: Which are the facilities eligible for
availing the benefits under the RBI COVID-19
regulatory     package and whether the facility
is extended across the  Board        to       all
borrowers?
</p>
<p id="p_20">ANSWER: All term loans (including agricultural term
loans,       retail,    crop loans and loans under
Pool Purchase) and      cash credit / overdraft are
eligible to avail the benefits under the package. This
is available to all such accounts, which are standard
assets as on March 1st 2020. Further, to avoid
unnecessary paperwork the facility has been
extended across the Board to all the borrowers by
extending repayment of term loan installments
(includes interest) by 90 days.           The original
repayment period for term loans will get extended by
90 days e.g. a loan repayable in 60 installments
maturing on March 1st 2025 will mature on 1st June
2025.

</p>
<p id="p_22">     ANSWER: The measures stipulated by RBI under the
     March 27th, 2020 Circular on COVID-19 Regulatory
     package will not be treated as "restructuring" and
     hence will not result in assets classification
     downgrade. Accordingly, the enhanced provisions for
     Restructured Accounts will not apply."

      FAQs:
</p>
<p id="p_42"> 1.   Is the Moratorium applicable for all loans?
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       ABFL would be extending moratorium to all its
      customers as per the latest advice by the Reserve
      bank of India. Only NPA customers will not be
      extended the benefit of Moratorium.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_43"> 2.   Does it mean that my EMI for the next 3 months
      is waived off? Will I get an interest waiver for 3
      months of moratorium?
</p><p id="p_44">      The RBI advisory does not mandate an interest
      waiver and is only a deferment of the payment.
      Hence, interest will be accrued at the contractual rate
      of the loan for the principal amount outstanding before
      the moratorium scheme being availed. The interest
      accrued during the period will be added to the
      principal outstanding and leading to an increase in
      EMI/Tenor, at the sole discretion of ABFL.

</p><p id="p_45"> 3.   If I have availed my loan in March, can I Still
      avail moratorium?
</p><p id="p_46">      Yes you are eligible for moratorium for the instalments
      payable in April and May 2020.

     mentioned in the Regulatory Package to all eligible

7.3. The RBI has contended that since the customer profile,

     organisation           structure        and   spread     of   each   lending

     institution is widely different from others, each lending

     institution is best placed to assess the requirement of its

          to look at the spirit of the reliefs announced by the RBI in

     8.3. The Circular issued by the RBI is not mandatory in nature,

      10.1. Respondent    No.7   is    ready   and   willing   to   grant   a

           moratorium to the Petitioner as per the Circular issued by

           the RBI.

      10.2. However,     the   lending    facility     being    a    multi-Bank

             arrangement with common securities like cash flows,

             Respondent No.7 cannot be individually expected to extend

             a   moratorium    to   the   Petitioner    in     the   absence   of

             Respondent Nos.5 and 6 extending such moratorium more

             so when all three of them enjoyed a pari-passu charge on

             all the assets including the cash flow of the Petitioner.


      10.3. Respondent Nos.5 and 6 cannot unilaterally appropriate

             the funds from the Escrow Accounts where the lease

             rentals are being deposited; Respondent No.7 is also

             entitled to a share out of the money received by the

             Petitioner from and out of its business.


</p><p id="p_75">11.   Sri. BasavaprabhuS. Patil, learned Senior Counsel appearing for

      Ms.Smitha Singh learned Counsel for the Petitioner reiterating

      the contentions taken up in the petition above also submitted

      that


      11.1. The present situation is a unique and peculiar one in that

             it is only on account of the policies and directions issued

             by Government of India and the State Government that the

             Petitioner is unable to carry out its business activities more
                                               WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                            26</span>


     particularly that of the hotel. If these restrictions had not

     been imposed, the Petitioner could have carried out the

     said business and earned a revenue out of which payments

     could have been made to Respondent Nos.5 to 7.



11.2. RBI has permitted the grant of a moratorium realising the

     effect on the economy as a direct consequence of the

     implementation of the policies of the Government of India

     and the State Government by virtue of which much of the

     economy across the country came to a standstill. It is in

     order to facilitate borrowers like the Petitioner to continue

     their business without the fear of being declared as a non-

     performing asset (NPA) that the moratorium facilities were

     promoted by the RBI.
</p>
<p id="p_76">
11.3. One other aspect of the moratorium Policy is that RBI

     facilitated the Banks to extend moratorium by coming up

     regulatory policies relating to Liquidity Management by

     Targeted   Long    Term     Repos   Operations    (TLTRO's),

     Reduction in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), increasing the

     Marginal Standing Facility, Widening of the Monetary

     Policy Rate Corridor, Permitting banks to deal in Offshore

     Non-Deliverable Rupee Derivative market etc.,by virtue of

     which, the Banks benefited by being made available with

     more cash than what was available so that the same could

     offset any moratorium facilities extended to any borrower

     like the Petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_77">
11.4. It was but required for the lenders viz., Respondent Nos.5

     to 7 to act in terms of Para 8 of Circular dated 27.07.2020

     and for the Board to approve the policies relating to the

     implementation of the Circular and extending the benefits

     to all eligible borrowers inter alia by including objective

     criteria for considering reliefs under the said Circular. He

     states that in pursuance of the above, it was required for

     Respondent Nos.5, 6 and 7 to formulate and make

     available in the public domain the said Policy containing

     objective criteria for the methodology of considering the

     extension of a moratorium to an eligible borrower. Despite

     which Respondents no. 5 to 7 have not complied with the

     requirement of the RBI. Therefore, the rejection by

     Respondent     No.5    and   the   subsequent   rejection   by

     Respondent Nos.6 and 7 of the request for a moratorium is
                                                 WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                             28</span>


     not sustainable and is opposed to the letter and spirit of

     the Circular dated 27.03.2020.
</p>
<p id="p_78">
11.5. Referring to the contents of the Circular as also answers to

     the frequently asked questions published by Indian Bank

     Association as also that published by the Respondent

     Nos.5 to 7 on their respective websites, he contends that

     the Policy is applicable to all borrowers, there is no

     discretion vested with any of the Banks to reject any

     application filed by a borrower.    The eligibility is decided

     only on the basis of the account being standard as on

     March 1st, 2020, that is to say, there is no default in

     repayment of the loan as on that date and once this

     condition is satisfied it was, but required, for the Banks, to

     extend the benefit of a moratorium to the Petitioner.


11.6. The entire methodology of decision making by all the three

     Banks is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Policy of the

     RBI and is fallacious in that Respondent No.5 having

     access to the funds of the Petitioner is appropriating the

     same towards the loan amount due to it as also facilitating

     such appropriation on the part of Respondent No.6.

     However, on account of Respondent No.7 being unable to
                                               WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                            29</span>


     appropriate any amounts from and out of the Escrow

     account, no payments are being made to Respondent No.7.

     In view thereof, there being no amounts available to make

     payment to Respondent No.7 the loan account of the

     Petitioner with the Respondent No.7 is more than likely to

     become an NPA. Respondent No.7 is more than likely to

     initiate action against the Petitioner as a whole, since the

     Tech Park and hotel are only the businesses of the

     Petitioner and not separate business entities. On that

     basis, he submits that in the event of Respondent No.7

     declaring the loan account of the Petitioner as NPA, the

     entire business of the Petitioner would come to a halt and

     Respondent No.7 would initiate proceedings against the

     Petitioner exercising the right of a pari-passu charge that

     the Respondent No.7 possesses in respect of the entire

     assets of the Petitioner including all cash flows, more

     particularly, the cash flowing from the rentals being

     received from the Tech Park also.
</p>
<p id="p_79">

11.7. There is a complete incongruity in the implementation of

     the Policy of the RBI resorted to by Respondent Nos.5 to 7,

     such an incongruity was not expected of by the RBI, and
                                                      WP No. 6775 of 2020

           that is the reason why there cannot be any discretion

           vested with Respondent Nos.5 to 7 in implementation of

           Circular dated 27.03.2020.

<p id="p_88">
      14.1. Respondent Nos.5 to 7 in terms of Para 8 of the Circular

           dated 27.03.2020 were required to formulate a board-

           approved Policy lying down objective criteria for the

           assessment of loan application received by the Bank and

           thereafter it is for the Banks to justify as to why an

           application by any of the borrower was rejected.



      14.2. The RBI has issued a Circular believing that the Banks

           would implement the said Circular in its true letter and

           spirit so as to keep the economy running, it is for the

           Banks to objectively assess each and every case while

      objections submitted that


      15.1. Principally the Circular dated 27.3.2020 is not at all

           applicable to the loan availed of by the Petitioner. In that,

           it is neither a term loan nor a working capital facility. The

           loan availed of by the Petitioner is a Lease Rental

           Discounting facility (LRD) which stands on a separate

           distinct and unique footing not comparable to a term loan

           or a working capital loan.     In that, the Petitioner had

           received the then present value of the lease rentals to be

           received by the Petitioner in future towards which the lease

           rental being paid from time to time by the concerned

     lessees is to be appropriated by Respondent No.5.A term

     loan being taken towards the creation of an asset in future

     or a working capital loan facility being extended for the

     working capital requirement are different from an LRD.

     Therefore, the Circularper se does not apply to the present

     transaction.
</p>
<p id="p_91">
15.2. Be that as it may, he submits that HDFC Bank has made a

     Policy which has been approved by the Board and it is the

     guidelines prescribed under that board-approved Policy

     which has been considered while rejecting the application

     for extension of a moratorium submitted by the Petitioner.

     In that, as per the Board approved Policy, the Petitioner is

     not entitled to the benefit of a moratorium in the event of

     the   Petitioner   receiving   cash   flows    from   regulatory

     authorities, Government bodies or any other uninterrupted

     flows so as to enable the repayment of a structured loan. In

     the present case, as admitted by the Petitioner, the

     business of the Tech Park is going on without any

     interruption, the lease rentals are being paid by all tenants

     without any default, infact, the Petitioner itself has refused

     the request made by one of the tenants seeking for
                                                     WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                              34</span>


     deferment of payment of rentals citing that no such

     deferment could be made available.
</p>
<p id="p_92">
15.3. When the Petitioner itself is not extending a similar kind of

     a   moratorium     to   its   tenants,   the   question   of   the

     Respondent No.5 extending a moratorium to the Petitioner

     will not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_93">
15.4. The Petitioner has enough and more revenues coming into

     its Bank account to enable the servicing of the LRD

     account, and as such, there is no requirement for the

     extension of a moratorium to the Petitioner.


15.5. The RBI has left the discretion to the Bank to consider the

     extension of a moratorium or otherwise taking into

     consideration the facts of each case, more particularly,

     taking into account the customer profile, organisation

     structure and spread of each Banking institution which is

     peculiar to each Bank and the discretion exercised by a

     Bank in relation to the fiscal nature of transaction ought

     not to be interfered with by this Court.


15.6. Apart from the interest of a borrower like the Petitioner, the

     interest of the Bank also would have to be considered since
                                               WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                            35</span>


     the   Respondent   No.5-Bank    has   more    than   70,000

     employees who are also to be paid their salaries. If more or

     all borrowers were to avail of a moratorium, there would

     not be any cash flows to the Bank, thereby, coming in the

     way of the Bank making payments to its employees as also

     interest payments to the depositors with the Bank. It is in

     this background that he submits that when there are

     enough and more funds which are available with the

     Petitioner which could be appropriated towards servicing of

     the LRD loans, the same ought to be permitted, and no

     moratorium could be extended in the present case to the

     Petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_94">
15.7. The Policy which has been approved by the Bank has also

     been submitted to the RBI and the RBI not having objected

     to the contents of the said Policy is deemed to have

     accepted the contents thereof thereby admitting the

     discretionary powers of the Bank while considering an

     application for a moratorium by the said borrower.


15.8. The Writ Petition is also not maintainable in view of no

     direction in the nature of writ could be issued to a private

connection, he relies upon the following decisions:


</p><p id="p_95">1.   <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_2">Federal Bank Ltd vs. Sagar Thomas and
     others</a> reported in (2003) 10 SCC 73, (Paras

     He was, however, suspended on 29.5.1982,
     since a disciplinary enquiry was ordered into
     some charges against him for having exceeded
     his authority in grant of loans and advances to

     guilty of the charges and ultimately punishment
     of dismissal was awarded to the Respondent.

</p><p id="p_97">     18. From the decisions referred to above, the
     position that emerges is that a writ petition
     under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India
     may be maintainable against (i) the State
     (Government); (ii) an Authority; (iii) a statutory
     body; (iv) an instrumentality or agency of the

     livelihood and to make profits out of such
     activities. Banking is also a kind of profession
     and a commercial activity, the primary motive
     behind it can well be said to earn returns and
     profits. Since time immemorial, such activities

have been carried on by individuals generally.
It is a private affair of the company though the
case of nationalised banks stands on a different
footing. There may well be companies, in which
majority of the share capital may be contributed
out of the State funds and in that view of the
matter there may be more participation or
dominant participation of the State in managing
the affairs of the company. But in the present
case we are concerned with a banking company
which has its own resources to raise its funds
without any contribution or shareholding by the
State. It has its own Board of Directors elected
by its shareholders. It works like any other
private company in the banking business having
no monopoly status at al.           Any company
carrying on banking business with a capital of
five lakhs will become a scheduled bank. All
the same, banking activity as a whole carried
on by various banks undoubtedly has an impact
and effect on the economy of the country in
general. Money of the shareholders and the
depositors is with such companies, carrying on
banking activity.       The banks finance the
borrowers on any given rate of interest at a
particular time. They advance loans as against
securities. Therefore, it is obviously necessary
to have regulatory check over such activities in
the interest of the company itself, the
shareholders, the depositors as well as to
maintain the proper financial equilibrium of the
national economy. The banking companies have
not been set up for the purposes of building the
economy of the State; on the other hand such
private companies have been voluntarily
established for their own purpose and interest
but their activities are kept under check so that
their activities may not go wayward and harm
the economy in general. A private banking
company with all freedom that it has, has to act
in a manner that it may not be in conflict with
or against the fiscal policies of the State and for
such purpose, guidelines are provided by
                                      WP No. 6775 of 2020

Reserve Bank so that a proper fiscal discipline,
to conduct its affairs in carrying on its business,
is maintained. So as to ensure adherence to
such fiscal discipline, if need be, at times even
the management of the company can be taken
over. Nonetheless, as observed earlier, these
are all regulatory measure to keep a check and
provide guidelines and not a participatory
dominance or control over the affairs of the
company.       For other companies in general
carrying on other business activities, maybe
manufacturing,       other   industries   or   any
business, such checks are provided under the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_5">Companies Act</a>, as indicated
earlier. There also, the main consideration is
that the company itself may not sink because of
its own mismanagement or the interest of the
shareholders or people generally may not be
jeopardised for that reason. Besides taking
care of such interest as indicated above, there is
no other interest of the State,, to control the
affairs and management of the private
companies.      Care is take in regard to the
industries (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_6">Regulation) Act</a>,
1951 that their production, which is important
for the economy, many not go down, yet the
business activity is carried on by such
companies or corporations which only remains a
private activity of the entrepreneurs/companies.

statutes of the like nature which fasten
certain     duties    and     responsibilities
statutorily upon such private bodies which
they are bound to comply with. If they
violate such a statutory provision a writ
would certainly be issued for compliance
with the service of its employee in violation
of the provisions contained under the
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_13">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in innumerable
cases the High Court interfered and has
issued the writ to the private bodies and
the companies in that regard.        But the
difficulty in issuing a writ may arise where
there may not be any non-compliance with
or violation of any statutory provision by
the private body. In that event a writ may
not be issued at all. Other remedies, as
may be available, may have to be resorted
to.

<p id="p_100">29. There are a number of such companies
carrying on the profession of banking. There is
nothing which can be said to be close to the
governmental functions. It is an old profession
in one form or the other carried on by
individuals or by a group of them. Losses
incurred in the business are theirs as well as
the profits. Any business or commercial activity,
maybe banking, manufacturing units or related
to any other kind of business generating
resources,     employment,     production    and
resulting in circulation of money are no doubt,
such which do have impact on the economy of
the country in general.      But such activities
cannot be classified as one falling in the
category of discharging duties or functions of a
public nature. Thus the case does not fall in the
fifth category of cases enumerated in the case of
Ajay Hasia. Again we find that the activity
which is carried on by the appellant is not one
which may have been earlier carried on by the
Government and transferred to the appellant

company. For the sake of argument, even if it
may be assumed that one or the other test as
provided in the case of Ajay Hasia may be
attracted, that by itself would not be sufficient
to hold that it is an agency of the State or a
company carrying on the functions of public
nature. In this connection, observations made in
the case of Pradeep Kumar Biswas quoted
earlier would also be relevant.

<p id="p_101">32. Merely because the Reserve Bank of India
lays the banking Policy in the interest of the
banking system or in the interest of monetary
stability or sound economic growth having due
regard to the interests of the depositors etc. as
provided under <a href="/doc/216565/" id="a_14">Section 5(c)(a)</a> of the Banking
Regulation Act does not mean that the private
companies carrying on the business of or
commercial activity of banking, discharge any
public function or public duty. These are all
regulatory measures applicable to those
carrying on commercial activity in banking and
these companies are to act according to these
provisions failing which certain consequences
follow as indicated in the Act itself. Provision
regarding acquisition of a banking company by
the Government, it may be pointed out that any
private property can be acquired by the
Government in public interest. It is now
judicially accepted norm that private interest
has to give way to the public interest. If a
private property is acquired in public interest it
does not mean that the party whose property is
acquired is performing or discharging any
function or duty of public character though it
would be so for acquiring authority.
</p>
<p id="p_102">33. For the discussion held above, in our view,
a private company carrying on banking
business as a scheduled bank, cannot be
termed as an institution or company carrying on
any statutory or public duty. A private body or
a person may be amenable to writ

    necessary to compel such body or
    association to enforce any statutory
    obligations or such obligations of public
    nature casting positive obligation upon it.
    We don't find such conditions are fulfilled in
    respect of a private company carrying on a
    commercial     activity  of   banking.     Merely
    regulatory provisions to ensure such activity
    carried on by private bodies work within a
    discipline, do not confer any such status upon
    the company nor puts any such obligation upon
    it which may be enforced through issue of a writ
    under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. Present is
    a case of disciplinary action being taken
    against its employee by the appellant
    Bank. Respondent's service with the Bank
    stands terminated. The action of the Bank
    was challenged by the Respondent by filing
    a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_16">Article 226</a> of the
    Constitution of India. The Respondent is
    not trying to enforce any statutory duty on
    the part of the Bank. That being the
    position, the appeal deserves to be allowed.

</p><p id="p_103">    34. In the result, the appeal is allowed and the
    judgment and order passed by the High Court is
    set aside and the writ petition is held to be to

<p id="p_110">11. 'A Public duty' is one in the discharge
of which the public i.e. the community at
large is interested, as affecting their legal
rights and liabilities. Of course, 'public' or
'community' does not necessarily or always
mean all the citizens of the Country or the
State, but may also refer to a defined class
of citizens. A duty will not be a 'public duty' if
it is to be performed to the benefit of a specified
person or persons. On the other hand, a 'public
function' is a function traditionally reserved for
the State. A private person is said to discharge
a public function, if the private person performs
a function that is so traditionally reserved for
the State. Carrying on trade or business or
business or profession or employing persons or
doing acts in connection with or incidental to
any trade or business or profession, is not
performance of a public duty or a public
function.

    purely private in nature.
</p>
<p id="p_112">    14.As no public duty or public function is
    involved, in regard to selection of persons
    by the appellant to its clerical cadre, and
    as the appellant is not a 'State' under
    <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_18">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, the only
    inescapable conclusion is that the writ

      17.1. The loan extended by the Respondent No.7 to the Petitioner

           is a part of a down selling mechanism of the loan which

           was initially advanced by Respondent No.5 - HDFC Bank

           the Tech Park business and that of the hotel business.

           The charge is created on the entire cash flows.

     to   them.   The   account   of   the   Petitioner   insofar   as

     Respondent Nos.5 and 6 would continue to be a standard

     account.     However,   insofar    as   Respondent     No.7    is

     concerned, there are no payments which have been

     received by Respondent No.7 for the last three months and

     if no payment is received for the next month, the said

     account would get automatically classified as a non-

     performing asset without any discretion vested with

     Respondent No.7, on account of the applicable and

     prevalent policies and guidelines issued by the RBI.


17.5. In cases where there are structured loans and/or in cases

     where there are multiple Banks which have extended the

     security to the borrower all the lenders have to be treated

     on the same footing, there should be no discrimination

               not necessarily have to be one imposed by

law, Professor de Smith states: "To be
enforceable by mandamus a public
duty does not necessarily have to be
one imposed by statute. It may be
sufficient for the duty to have been
imposed by charter, common law,
custom or even contract." We share this
view. The judicial control over the fast
expanding maze of bodies affecting the
rights of the people should not be put
into watertight compartment. It should
remain      flexible    to    meet    the
requirements of variable circumstances.</p>

     to see to it that the Circular issued by the RBI is

     implemented in its true letter and spirit.     The Union of

     hands since it is Union of India and the state governments

     responsible for the financial distress which has been

19.5. What is sought to be done by Respondent Nos.5 and 6 at

     the cost of Respondent No.7 is not only restricted to taking

     of a pound of flesh, but such taking of the flesh would kill

     the Petitioner inasmuch as non-payment of dues to

     Respondent    No.7   would    automatically   result   in   the

     Petitioner's account being treated as an NPA.


19.6. The Circular issued by the RBI has to be implemented in

     its true letter and spirit.      No technical defences or

     objections could be raised by the Banks which would come

     in the way of achieving the objectives of the Circular dated

     27.03.2020 issued by the RBI inasmuch as the aim and

     objects of the Circular being to keep the economy and

     businesses running. The actions of Respondents 5 to 7

     would have the effect of closing down the business of the

     Petitioner, which in today's economic condition would

     affect not only the Petitioner but also the economy as a

     Respondent No.4, a moratorium is applicable to all retail

     loan customers who pay a fixed/structured EMI on

     this basis, he contends that a structured loan like LRD is

     isa standard account as on March 1st, 2020, all the due

     amounts having been paid thereof, he submits that the

     Petitioner became automatically eligible for availing a

     moratorium. Availing a moratorium is in the discretion of

     the Petitionerinasmuch as the Petitioner would continue to

     make payment of interest amounts even during the

     moratorium period.     Only the payment of the principal

     amount is deferred for the moratorium           period, the

     Petitioner is not seeking for any waiver of loan or reduction

     in the loan amount but only a deferment in payment

     schedule which would not in any manner adversely affect

<p id="p_162">21.5. At para 11 of the Karnataka Bank's case supra it was

      observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_163">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">          11. 'A Public duty' is one in the discharge of
          which the public i.e. the community at large is
          interested, as affecting their legal rights and
          liabilities. Of course, 'public' or 'community'
          does not necessarily or always mean all the
          citizens of the Country or the State, but may
          also refer to a defined class of citizens. A duty
          will not be a 'public duty' if it is to be performed
          to the benefit of a specified person or persons.
          On the other hand, a 'public function' is a
          function traditionally reserved for the State. A
          private person is said to discharge a public
          function, if the private person performs a
          function that is so traditionally reserved for the
          state.      Carrying on trade or business or
          business or profession or employing persons or
          doing acts in connection with or incidental to
          any trade or business or profession, is not

21.6. In both the above matters after considering the above, the

      courts came to a conclusion that the dispute involved was

      a private one, that is a dispute between the Petitioner in

      his/her individual capacity on the one hand and the

      Bank on the other, there being no public element

      involved, as such the courts held that a Writ petition was

      not maintainable, in those circumstances.


21.7. The Apex court, in Punjab National Bank and Another

      Vs. Astamija Dash reported in (2008) 14 SCC 370,

      held Punjab National Bank to be covered within the ambit

      of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_36">Article 12</a> of the constitution and issued a writ, when

      the dispute before the Court was relating to the

      enforcement of the principle of equality amongst the

      employees of the Bank, holding that the same is a public

      duty of the Bank.
</p>
<p id="p_166">
21.8. What is to be seen here is whether the prayers sought for

      by the Petitioner for implementation of the Circular

      issued by the RBI would amount to the enforcement of

      any statutory obligations or obligations of public nature

      casting a positive obligation upon Respondents 5 to 7.

      duty of the RBI to regulate the financial institutions, its

      business as also the credit system of the country, by

      exercising the powers vested with it under the Act.


21.15. Subsequent to the invocation of the DMA apprehending

      dated 27.03.2020, in order to discharge its above

      obligation and duty. The aim, object and intention of the

      said Circular being to mitigate the burden of debt

      servicing brought about by disruptions on account of

      Covid-19 pandemic and to ensure the continuity of a

      viable business, which is in the interest of the country

22.4. A perusal of Para 2 of the Circular indicates that

      permission is granted to the banks concerned to grant

      moratorium of three months as regards the payment of all

      instalments falling due between March 1st 2020 and May

      31st 2020.     Thus, the permission is one which is

      accorded to a bank or lending institution to permit a

      moratorium, this on account of the fact that without RBI

      permitting the same, a bank of its own accord is

      prohibited from granting any moratorium to a borrower.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_196">22.5. The discretion to grant such a moratorium is that of the

      bank on the basis of a Board approved Policy containing

      objective criteria made available in the public domain.
</p><p id="p_197">                                               WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">                            71</span>




22.6. The consequence of such grant of moratorium is covered

      by the second part of the said Para 2 states "The

      repayment schedule for such loans as also the residual

      tenor, will be shifted across the board by three months

      after the moratorium period."   This would indicate as if

      that on the grant of a moratorium, as a matter of course,

      the repayment schedule of the loan would be shifted.


22.7. The Circular more particularly Para 2,4 and 8 would have

      to be read along with the statement of development and

      regulated Policy released by the RBI on 27.03.2020,

      which inter alia addresses the stress in the financial

      condition or rather distress caused to the economy by

      Covid-19 inter alia to ensure the continuity of viable

      businesses. Thus, the exercise of discretionary power by

      the Bank or lending institution is predicated on ensuring

      the continuity of the business of a borrower. The decision

      of the Bank or lending institution if, were to, fall foul of

      this intention, then that decision would be contrary to the

      Policy as also the Circular.

22.8. In the above background, it has to be seen as to, what the

      banks made of the Circular, their understanding of the

      same and how they sought to implement it.

</p>
<p id="p_217">       1. Is the Moratorium applicable for all loans?

          ABFL would be extending moratorium to all
          its customers as per the latest advice by the
          Reserve bank of India. Only NPA customers
          will not be extended the benefit of Moratorium.

</p><p id="p_218">       2. Does it mean that my EMI for the next 3
          months is waived off? Will I get an interest
          waiver for 3 months of moratorium?
</p>
<p id="p_219">          The RBI advisory does not mandate an interest
          waiver and is only a deferment of the payment.
          Hence, interest will be accrued at the
          contractual rate of the loan for the principal
          amount outstanding before the moratorium
          scheme being availed. The interest accrued
          during the period will be added to the principal
          outstanding and leading to an increase in
          EMI/Tenor, at the sole discretion of ABFL.

</p><p id="p_220">       3. If I have availed my loan in March, can I
          still avail moratorium?
</p>
<p id="p_221">          Yes you are eligible for moratorium for the
          instalments payable in April and May 2020.

</p><p id="p_222">       4. How do I avail the Moratorium benefit?

          All ABFL customers may send SMS
          ABFLOPT to 567679 from their registered
          mobile numbers and avail moratorium for
          the applicable months.

          It is also pertinent to know that ABFL has

22.16. Once the banks have in the public domain on their

      respective websites expressed their solidarity with all

      their customers and stated that all the customers are

      eligible for grant of a moratorium, in accordance with RBI

      guidelines, it is not permissible for such banks to nit-pick

      and later on, refuse the grant of a moratorium, to the

      Petitioner, who is otherwise eligible. That is to say the

      Banks cannot take one stand in the public domain and a

      contradictory stand while implementing what they have

      stated in the public domain. Both the RBI and the banks

      have held out that all customers are eligible for a

      moratorium.      The availing of or otherwise of the

      moratorium is at the sole discretion of the borrower more

      so when the borrower would be required to make
                                                 WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                            79</span>


      payment     of   additional   interest,   during   the   said

      moratorium period. There being no waiver of interest and

      or the principal amount by the mere grant of a

      moratorium.
</p>
<p id="p_226">
22.17. Thus, though the Circular issued by the RBI dated

      27.03.2020 is discretionary in so far as the power to

      grant or not a moratorium by a bank, it is mandatory for

      the Bank to ensure the continuity of viable businesses, in

      that, the non-grant of a moratorium should not result in

      adversely affecting the survival and continuity of a viable

      business. The understanding of the banks by reference

      to their respective answers to the FAQ's is also in line

      with the above. All borrowers are eligible to seek for a

      moratorium, if a borrower were to seek for grant of a

      moratorium on the ground that continuity of its business

      would be affected and establish the same, the borrower

      would as a matter of right be entitled for the grant of

      moratorium so that such continuity is not adversely

      affected.

23.3. It is contended that because the Petitioner's loan is a

      structured one and there are uninterrupted flows of cash

      on account of the lease rentals being paid by the tenants

      of the Technology Park, and not deferred by the payer, a

      borrower like the Petitioner would not be entitled for a

      moratorium.
</p>
<p id="p_242">
23.4. It has also been contended on behalf of Respondent No.5

      that the Board approved Policy of Respondent No.5 had

      been sent to RBI which is not objected to by RBI,

      therefore, it amounts to acceptance of such Policy by RBI,

      as such, the action taken by Respondent No.5 in terms of

      the said Policy is deemed to have the blessings of RBI and

      the Petitioner cannot agitate any grievance against the

      said Board Approved Policy before this Court. This

      contention is devoid of merit, in that as contended by
                                                WP No. 6775 of 2020

       Sri.R.V.S.Naik, learned Senior Counsel it is not required

       for the RBI to revert on the Policy of each and every Bank.

       The RBI has laid down a broad framework/broad Policy

       which is required to be implemented, the prime object

       being the continuity of viable businesses. All banks are

       required to act in terms of the Circular and Policy to keep

       the economy running, it is for the bank to establish that

       the action taken by it is in accordance and compliance of

       the Circular and Policy.
</p>
<p id="p_243">
23.5. Unfortunately, the RBI Circular does not deal in detail with

       the mode and methodology of consideration and grant of

       a moratorium by a lending institution. RBI ought to have

       envisaged this and laid down a methodology to be

       followed by all lenders rather than leaving the discretion

       to each lender, which would result in discriminatory

       and/or contradictory policies/practices being adopted by

       each lender at its whims and fancies, justifying such

       policies/practices on the basis of a so-called board

       approved Policy. In the present case, the Board Approved

       policy of all three banks do not have any objective criteria

       contained in them, the wording of the Board Approved
                                                WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">                             84</span>


       policy is vague, there bing no manner of ascertaining if

       the actions of Respondents 5 to 7, more particularly

       Respondent No. 5 is or is not in accordance with the

       board approved policy.
</p>
<p id="p_244">
23.6. Hence, there being no alternative efficacious remedy for the

     Petitioner, this Court would have to be guided by the aims

     and objectives of the Policy and Circular in order to

     ascertain whether the actions on the part of Respondent

     No.5 is in accordance with or militates against the aims

     and objectives of the Circular and Policy, Respondent No 6

     and 7, for now only following the lead of Respondent No.5,

     and they having submitted that they would have no

     objection to extend a moratorium to the Petitioner if

     Respondent No.5 were to do so.
</p>
<p id="p_245">
23.7. It is not in dispute that the business of the Petitioner is

     viable. It is also not in dispute that the loan account of the

     Petitioner was standard account as on 1.03.2020, there

     were no defaults committed by the Petitioner. Till March

     1st 2020, the Petitioner had made payments of all dues

     towards the said loan accounts. It is only on account of

     the closure of the hotel business that the Petitioner is
                                               WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">                             85</span>


     facing distress and this distress would impact the finances

     of the Petitioner as a whole. The business of the Tech Park

     and the hotel cannot be separated out for the Respondent

     No.5 to rely upon the Board Approved Policy to contend

     that as a structured loan, the Respondent No.5 could

     appropriate the amounts deposited by the tenants towards

     lease amount.
</p>
<p id="p_246">
23.8. Though there are certain cash flows from the Tech Park

     business, which would satisfy the repayment of the LRD

     loan, however, it is also a fact that the hotel business, has

     virtually come to a stand-still and there is no income

     arising therefrom. In this background, when payments are

     not being made by the Petitioner to Respondent No.7 and

     further payments cannot also be made on account of the

     payment received by the Petitioner from the Tech Park

     being appropriated by Respondent Nos.5 and 6 it is but

     natural that the loan of the Petitioner from Respondent

     No.7 would automatically become an NPA as per the

     policies laid down by RBI itself.
</p>
<p id="p_247">
23.9. Respondent No.7 having purchased the loan advanced by

     Respondent No.5 to the Petitioner and being a part of the
                                          WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">                       86</span>


down selling mechanism was admittedly promised to have

a pari-pasu charge overall assets of the Petitioner including

all cash flows made either of the Tech Park or of the hotel.

This charge, of course, can only be exercised on default in

payment of loans by the Petitioner. Admittedly, there is no

payment made to Respondent No. 7 from April till date,

and there is all likelihood of the said default continuing

hereafter. In view thereof, in terms of the Policy laid down

by the RBI itself, the loan account of the Petitioner insofar

as Respondent No.7 is going to be automatically classified

as an 'NPA' and Respondent No.7 would be constrained to

in terms of the applicable policies initiate such action as

may be required for the purposes of recovery of the loan

amount.   This would necessarily entail the invocation of

charge by Respondent No.7, which would also include the

cash flows arising out of the rentals from the Tech Park.

Thus, in essence, the refusal by Respondent No.5 to extend

a moratorium to the Petitioner only on the ground that

there are funds coming into the account of the Petitioner

which Respondent No.5 can appropriate is only a mirage.

In that by doing so, Respondent No.7 would not receive any

monies, Respondent No.7 would exercise its rights over the
                                                    WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">                             87</span>


     said rental amounts which are sought to be appropriated

     by Respondent No.5. On such an event occurring, all three

     lenders viz., Respondent Nos.5 to 7 would not be receiving

     any money. More importantly once the Petitioner's account

     is declared NPA, Petitioner would have to repay the entire

     amount due, which it is admittedly not in a position to do

     do, the entire business of the Petitioner is more than likely

     to come to a stand-still which would militate against the

     prime objective of the Policy and Circular viz., ensuring the

     continuity of a viable business.
</p>
<p id="p_248">
23.10. In the above background it cannot be accepted that the

      Circular   dated    27.03.2020    is   not    applicable   to   a

      structured loan like LRD availed by the Petitioner since

      the appropriation of the monies of the LRD would have a

      negative impact on the continuity of the Petitioner itself.

      There is no distinction in terms of the Policy and Circular,

      giving a separate treatment to structured loans. Hence I

      hold that Circular is applicable to all loans/advances and

      facilities extended by a lending institution, including

      structured loans.

           loan and there is only one lender in respect of such

           structured loan.
</p>
<p id="p_252">
      24.2. The Policy relating to a consortium or multiple bank

           lending only contemplates that a Bank in the consortium

           ought to extend the moratorium on terms similar to those

           offered by HDFC. This would presuppose a situation where

           Respondent No.5-HDFC has approved and formulated the

           terms for grant of a moratorium and the other Banks in the

           consortium have failed to agree to such terms.


      24.3. In the present case, the situation is reverse, in that

           Respondent Nos.6 and 7 have         agreed to extend a
                                               WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">                            89</span>


     moratorium to the Petitioner, however it is on account of

     refusal on part of Respondent No.5 to grant a moratorium

     that they have not been able to extend a moratorium to the

     Petitioner. Thus, even this particular Policy of Respondent

     No.5 would not be of any assistance to Respondent No.5.


24.4. The contention of Sri.Udaya Holla, learned Senior Counsel

     that Respondent No.5-Bank would also have to balance the

     interest of its employees and other account holders and

     therefore, grant of a moratorium would adversely affect the

     payment of salaries, as also interest to the depositors, if

     taken on its face value would indicate as if that

     Respondent No.5-HDFC Bank would not be extending a

     moratorium to any borrower. Such a contention would be

     an easy methodology of rejectingany and all request/s for a

     moratorium and as such would militate against the

     objective of the Policy and Circular dated 27.03.2020. The

     interest of Respondent No.5 is safeguarded by the creation

     of a charge on the assets and receivables of the Petitioner.

     By way of grant of a moratorium what happens is only a

     deferment of payment of the amounts due for a period as

     indicated by the RBI. The same does not in any manner
                                                 WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">                            90</span>


     reduce the liability of the Petitioner and/or reduce the

     receivables on the part of the lending Institutions.


24.5. The contention of Sri.Basavaprabhu Patil, learned Senior

     Counsel that Respondent No.5 is acting like Shylock also

     deserves consideration. In that though in the said famous

     play Shylock was seeking to enforce his rights in terms of

     the agreement entered into with Antonio to receive a pound

     of flesh closest to the heart of Antonio, it was never

     contemplated that by doing so, the life of Antonio would be

     lost.
</p>
<p id="p_253">
24.6. In the present case, though Respondent No.5 would be

     entitled to enforce the LRD agreement and appropriate the

     amounts due from the ESCROW Account, the same would

     end up in classification of the loan account of the

     Petitioner with Respondent No. 7 as an NPA thus in effect

     destroying the Petitioner, which is contrary to the aim and

     object of the Circular dated 27.03.2020.


24.7. The spirit of the Circular is required to be given due

     importance, it is to be seen to it that the Petitioner

     continues to be in business, thus helping the economy.
</p><p id="p_254">                                                WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">                            91</span>


     Needless to say that the business of the Petitioner provides

     employment to various people, taxes are paid to the

     respective authorities, facilities and services are provided

     to various other companies who depend on the Petitioner.

     If the business of the Petitioner is disrupted, it is bound to

     have a cascading effect on all the above and thereby have

     an adverse impact on the economy.
</p>
<p id="p_255">
24.8. The other contention of Sri.Basavaprabhu Patil, learned

     Senior Counsel that Respondent No.5 is seeking to kill the

     golden goose to get all the eggs at one go also deserves

     consideration.    Towards this, Sri.Udaya Holla, learned

     Senior Counsel has countered by stating that Respondent

     No.5 is only taking away the eggs already laid and not

     taking any action against the goose viz., the Petitioner

     herein.   However, the impact of it is what is to be

     considered in the sense that once all the eggs are taken

     away by Respondents No.5 and 6, the default as regards

     the loan to Respondent No.7 would automatically result in

     the classification of the loan account of the Petitioner with

     Respondent No. 7 as an NPA, thus in effect killing of the

     golden goose. Thus, the cause and effect of such action by
                                                     WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">                                  92</span>


           Respondent No.7 being attributable to Respondents No.5

           and 6, they cannot take up such a technical ground in this

           regard. Respondents 5 to 7 are required to ensure the

           survival and continuance of the Petitioner and its business.

           Thus, I'am of the considered opinion that one Bank cannot

           deny the extension of a moratorium, when another or

           others are willing to extend the benefit of a moratorium.


      POINT NO.6:
</p>
<p id="p_256">25.   CAN A DIRECTION BE ISSUED TO RESPONDENTS 1 &amp;4 TO
      ENFORCE THE CIRCULAR DATED 27.03.2020 ISSUED BY
      THE RBI?
</p>
<p id="p_257">      25.1. Mr M BNargund, learned Additional Solicitor General of

            India, appearing for Respondent 1 and 2, has submitted

            that RBI is an autonomous and independent entity,

            Respondent No.1 and 2 cannot issue any direction to

            Respondent No.4, thus there can be no directions issued

            to Respondent No. 1 and 2 to in turn issue directions to

            Respondent No.4 - RBI.This submission is in consonance

            with the RBI Act, the RBI being vested with several

            obligations and duties in respect of the banking as also

            economic requirements of the country, is always required

            to be independent and autonomous. Most of the policies
                                                   WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">                              93</span>


       formulated, guidelines as also circulars issued by the RBI

       have long term impact, being predicated both on macro

       as also microeconomic factors. This would equally apply

       to Respondent No.3 - State Government, hence no

       direction can be issued to the state government for the

       very same reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_258">
25.2. The present situation is on account of aspects beyond the

       control of the petitioner namely initiation of lockdown,

       social distancing, reduction in number of people working

       in an establishment, etc., though necessary, have had an

       adverse impact on the Petitioner's business.


25.3. There is no default on the part of the Petitioner by itself till

       1.3.2020. The RBI cannot in the circumstances contend

       that the discretion is left to the lender to either grant or

       refuse the grant of a moratorium and in the same breath

       contend that it is for the Bank to establish as to why the

       Petitioner did not qualify for the benefit of Moratorium -

       without stating as to before whom such establishment is

       to be made. Admittedly, there is no mechanism which is

       created for redressal of grievance on account of improper

       implementation or non-implementation of the recovery
                                                 WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">                              94</span>


       package or the Circular, there is no forum which has

       been created for the Petitioner to complain of as regards

       any of the actions of the Bank or a forum created for the

       Bank to establish as to how the Petitioner's request has

       been property rejected. Pending creation of such a forum,

       this court would have to intervene to provide for a remedy

       to the aggrieved Petitioner, to give effect to the principle,

       Ubi jus ibiremedium.
</p>
<p id="p_259">
25.4. In view of the above, it is held that no directions could be

       issued to Respondent 1 and 2 - Union of India or

       Respondent No. 3 - State of Karnataka, to inturn issue

       directions   to   Respondent     No.4    -   RBI   for   the

       implementation of the Circular. The contentions of the

       RBI that the dispute is between the Petitioner and

       Respondents No.5 to 7 is not acceptable since the dispute

       arises out of the implementation or not of a Circular

       issued by the RBI. RBI is therefore directed to monitor

       the implementation of the Circular, including verification

       of whether there are Board-approved policies formulated

       by each of the lenders, direct all the banks to submit the

       Board-approved policies for approval to the RBI, to
                                                             WP No. 6775 of 2020

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">                                          95</span>


              approve such board-approved policy,              verify if such a

              board-approved policy contains objective criteria, set up a

              proper and effective grievance redressal forum for any

              aggrieved borrower to approach on account of the

              improper or non-implementation of the Policy and/or
