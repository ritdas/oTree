         question.
</p>
<p id="p_3">         3.           It appears that the main Special Criminal
         Application No.1722 of 2012 is filed by the petitioner
         seeking to quash Criminal Case No.144 of 1998 pending
         before the court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate,
         Rajpipla, District Narmada, which is in respect of
         offence under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_1">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_2">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_3">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_4">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_5">47</a> of the
         Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
         In    the     said       proceedings            learned           Chief         Judicial
         Magistrate issued order dated 16th July, 2010 for non-
         bailable warrant in the name of the petitioner. It
         appears that this Court by passing order dated 07th
         August,     2012       granted      ad-interim             relief         stating             as
         under.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">               "4.   Ad-interim relief in terms of paragraph 23(D) qua the
               Petitioner till then on condition that by the next date,
               the affidavit of the Petitioner will be filed declaring
               that he will remain present through the Advocate on every
               date and shall not ask for any adjournment."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_4">         3.1          The grievance of the applicant-petitioner is
         that despite the aforesaid order, the Court of learned
         Chief Judicial Magistrate, Rajpipla again directed to
         issue non-bailable warrant as per his order dated 22nd
         March, 2013. The said order is the cause of action
         which brought the applicant before this Court by means
         of present application.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         4.           Besides the case of the applicant that he is
         a     physically             challenged            person         constantly                  on
         wheelchair and suffers from 80% disability and that he
         cannot mobilise himself without a helper or nurse,
         learned advocate submitted that the order dated 07th

         August, 2012 itself was clear and in wake of the said
         order, there was no question of issuing subsequent
         order of issuance of non-bailable warrant by the court
         concerned. He further submitted that the applicant has
         been abiding by the condition of stay.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         5.            There          is    substance          in    the       submission             and
         case of the applicant. The order dated 08th August,
         2012 is amply clear wherein it is stated that the
         applicant shall file affidavit declaring that he will
         remain    present            through      advocate           on     every        date        and
         shall    not       ask       for    adjournment.              It      is,      therefore,
         apparently clear that the personal presence of the
         applicant during the proceedings is exempted and is
         permitted to remain present through advocate.

<p id="p_7">         6.            In      the          circumstances,                this        application
         deserves to be allowed and the same is allowed in
         terms    of      paragraph           8(A),         8(B)        and       8(C)        of      the
         application         on       condition         that        the      applicant             shall
         continue to abide by the conditions stated in order
         dated 07th August, 2012.

<p id="p_8">         6.1           Resultantly,            order           dated       22nd     March,          2013
         passed by learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Rajpipla
         in Criminal Case No.144 of 1998 issuing non-bailable
         warrant against the applicant is set aside and it is
         clarified that the order dated 07th August, 2012 shall
         govern in respect of the question of presence of the
         applicant.
