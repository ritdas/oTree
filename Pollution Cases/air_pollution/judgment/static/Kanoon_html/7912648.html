                   placed reliance might not be a correct document, especially in the light of the

                   Resources Organization, Sand Mining and Monitoring Division, Villupuram in

                   March 2018. The impugned order which has been quoted in its entirety supra,

                   Collector, Cuddalore, the Assistant Geologist from the office of the Deputy

                   Director of Geology and Mining, Cuddalore and the Executive Engineer, TWAD,

                   to dismiss the writ petitions, as not maintainable, but to consider the entire

                          The river is a seasonal river with water run - off only during the monsoon rainy
                          season with a North East - South West trend and North Easterly flow. The current

                          river channel was dry. The sand in the subject area is medium to coarse grained.
                          As the River Channel consists of 2 to 3 metres of sand deposit, PWD shall be
                          allowed to quarry sand to a depth of one metre there by enabling free flow of
                          water and seasonal replishment of sand during subsequent run off / floods.
                          Enough free space for forming approach road is available. There are no bridges,
                          permanent structures, Infiltration / drinking water wells within a radius of 500
                          mts. and no Electric lines, Electric Pylons, Railway tracks, Roads within a radial
                          distance of 50 mts. The proposed area is 50 metres away from the River Banks.
</p><p id="p_248">                                 As the quarry is proposed within the River Channel, there are no chances

                          Environment and ecology.
