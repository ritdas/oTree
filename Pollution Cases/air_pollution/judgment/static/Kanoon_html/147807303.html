GURCHARAN SINGH SARAN, PRESIDING JUDICIAL MEMBER

                                ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            The complainant has filed this complaint on the

averments that opposite party No.1, is a Registered Cooperative

Society registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_2">Societies Registration Act</a> XXI of 1860

having its Head Office at Amritsar, which was formed for the

development scheme in the vicinity of the city of Chandigarh at

Sector 113, Mohali whereas opposite parties No.2 &amp; 3 are its

Chairman and Vice Chairman. The complainant being interested to

purchase the residential plot for his own personal living, booked the

same on the basis of advertisement given by the opposite party

No.1. He visited their office situated at Mohali. The complainant

alongwith the application on 3.5.2011 paid a sum of Rs. 21,000/- as

Membership Fee, Rs.1,00,000/- and Rs.8,00,000/- as booking

amount vide different receipts. Opposite parties No. 1 to 3

(hereinafter called Ops) allotted a residential plot measuring 200
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Consumer Complaint No. 181 of 2016                                 3</span>



sq. yards at the rate of Rs.13,800/- per sq. yard in favour of the

complainant. As per clause 9 of the allotment letter, Ops assured

him to hand over the possession of the plot within a period of one

and half year from the date of booking i.e. 3.5.2011 i.e. upto

November, 2012. Complainant also paid different amounts i.e. Rs.

7 Lacs on 18.7.2011, Rs. 6.00 Lacs           and Rs. 2 Lacs on

12.12.2011, Rs. 1 Lac on 27.1.2012 and Rs. 2.10 Lacs on

9.2.2012. In this way, the complainant paid total amount of Rs.

27.31 Lacs including Rs. 21,000/- as Membership fee. However,

Op Nos. 1 to 3 failed to develop the said land as per the terms and

conditions mentioned in the allotment letter and to hand over the

possession of the plot within the stipulated period. Rather, they

decided to hand over the project to Op No.4 i.e. RKM Housing Ltd.,

Mohali and pleaded that the said project will be started immediately

and the possession shall be handed over to the buyers within a

short period. The complainant signed the consent letter for the

MOU dated 15.07.2014 executed between Op Nos.1 to 3 and OP

No.4 with the understanding that the possession of the plot shall be

handed over to the complainant shortly.      The revised allotment

letter No. RKM/0215 dated 6.11.2014 was issued to the

complainant by Op No.4 wherein they stated that the possession

shall be handed over within a period of 20 months from the date of

allotment. In the month of December, 2015, the complainant came

to know that GMADA had issued a letter to the Punjab Govt. stating

that Ops No.1 to 3 in connivance with Op No.4 are grabbing the

money from the general public and have failed to complete the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Consumer Complaint No. 181 of 2016                                       4</span>



project. Alleging unfair trade practice and deficiency in service, the

present complaint has been filed by the complainant seeking

refund of Rs.27,31,000/- alongwith interest at the rate of 18% per

annum;     Rs.5,00,000/-      as     compensation         towards   mental

harassment;     Rs.50,000/-        towards   litigation    expenses   and

Rs.1,00,000/- towards counsel fee.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.          Upon notice, Sh. A. S. Verma, Advocate, had filed his

power of attorney on behalf of Op Nos.1 to 3 but he has filed the

written statement only on behalf of Op Nos.1 and 3. They in their

written reply took the preliminary objections that complaint is not

maintainable in the present form; complainant has not come to the

Commission with clean hands and that the complainant has failed

to make the payment on due dates. On merits, the averments

stated in the preliminary objections were reiterated. However, it is a

matter of record that the complainant applied for membership,

which was allowed and he was allotted plot of 200 square yards for

a total cost of Rs. 27,60,000/-, out of which Rs. 27,10,000/- had

paid and remaining amount including EDC/IDC charges were not

paid by the complainant till date. It has been specifically denied that

Op No.1 expressly assured that the activities at the site will start

very soon and that the possession of the flat will be made within

stipulated period of 1½ years from the date of booking i.e.

3.5.2011. It was also denied that the offer given by Ops was false

and mis-leading or that no development activity was carried out at

the site. As per Clause 9 of the allotment letter, it was mentioned

that all efforts will be made to hand over the possession of the flat
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Consumer Complaint No. 181 of 2016                                   5</span>



within a period of 1½ years from the date of booking. This Op is

just a Society and not Colonizer and the work is to be carried out

on the basis of payment made by its Members. Since the Members

failed to make the payment, therefore, CLU from the GMADA could

not be obtained. Society went in loss. Earlier CLU amount was Rs.

1,29,00,000/- but lateron it was increased to Rs. 2,40,00,000/-.

With the consent of Members vide MOU dated 15.7.2014, the

project was handed over to Op No. 4 for development. Therefore,

the complaint of the complainant is not maintainable against this

Op. Complainant has also given a consent to transfer the project to

Op No. 4, therefore, no unfair trade practice or deficiency in service

on the part of these Ops. Complaint is without merit, it be

dismissed with special costs against these Ops.

</p><p id="p_3">3.          Op No. 4 in their written reply by way of affidavit

pleaded that Op No. 1 is a Society registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_3">Societies

Registration Act</a> and that the complainant was enrolled as a

Member with Op No. 1. It was further stated that the Member, who

is admitted/enrolled as ordinary member was to get his

membership renewed after a period of 2 years. The complainant

was admitted as a Member w.e.f. 3.5.2011 and was bound to get

his membership renewed on or before 3.5.2013, therefore, he is

not a Member of Op No.1. The complainant was told about the

MOU between Op No. 1 &amp; Op No. 4 by sending a letter and

consequently, the complainant gave his consent letter dated

30.10.2014. Op No. 4 wanted to take up the matter and to develop

the project for which he was to get CLU from GMADA and other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> Consumer Complaint No. 181 of 2016                                     6</span>



approvals from the concerned Departments for which huge amount

was required. Op No. 4 wrote letters to the complainant to deposit

the development charges but the complainant did not deposit it.

Therefore, there is no unfair trade practice or deficiency in service

on the part of this Op. Complaint is without merit, it be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_4">4.          The parties were allowed to lead their respective

evidence to prove their contentions. Complainant in his evidence

has tendered has tendered his affidavit Ex. C-1 and documents

Exs. C-2 to C-14. On the other hand Op Nos. 1&amp;3 had tendered

affidavit of Varinder Singh, Accountant Ex. Op-1&amp;3/A and

documents Exs. Op-1&amp;3/1 to Op-1&amp;3/11. Op No. 4 tendered in

evidence affidavit of Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia, M.D. Ex. Op-4/A

and documents Exs. Op-4/1 to Op-4/9.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Miscellaneous Application No. 1751 of 2017

</p><p id="p_6">5.          During the pendency of the complaint Op Nos.1&amp;3

moved an application for dismissal of the present complaint qua Op

Nos.1&amp;3 because Op Nos.1&amp;3 is the Society, according to <a href="/doc/1509263/" id="a_4">Section

13</a> of the Societies Registration Act 1860, provided as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "In the event of any dispute arising among the said governing

      body or the members of the society, the adjustment of its

      affairs shall be referred to the principal court of original civil

      jurisdiction of the district in which the chief building of the

      society is situate and the court shall make such order in the

      matter as it shall deem requisite."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">6.          Therefore, this Commission has no jurisdiction to

decide the matter between the society and members. To support
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Consumer Complaint No. 181 of 2016                                   7</span>



this proposition he has referred the judgment reported in 2009(5)

BCR 201 titled as General Manager, Telecom Vs. M.Krishnan &amp;

Anr., wherein it has been held that Consumer Forum does not

have the jurisdiction as there is a special remedy under <a href="/doc/1471289/" id="a_5">Section 7B</a>

of Telegraph Act regarding disputes in respect of telephone bills.

However, later on the Hon'ble National Commission had circulated

the instructions that under <a href="/doc/76226/" id="a_6">Section 3</a> of the Act an additional

remedy has been provided. Therefore, the Consumer Fora, have

the jurisdiction as held in II (2014) CPJ 38 titled as "GMTD, BSNL,

Shillong Vs. KUM.D.Phawa, Mangpoh". Moreover, the provisions

under the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_7">Telegraph Act</a> are entirely different than the provisions

under the <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_8">Cooperative Societies Act</a>, therefore, this judgment will

not apply to the facts of the present case. He has further referred to

the judgment reported in 2013(4) C.P.J. 333 titled as Anjana

Abraham Vs. Managing Director of Koothattukulam Farmers

Service Co-operative Bank Ltd., in which, there was a dispute

between a member and Cooperative society regarding the

settlement of account. In that event, it was observed that if there is

alternative remedy under <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_9">Section 69</a> of the Act, the complaint was

rightly dismissed by the Consumer Fora. He further referred to a

judgment reported in 2015 (2) C.P.J. 207, titled as K.D.Kothiyal

Vs. Phool Kaul &amp; Ors. in that case, there was a dispute between

two members of the society. In that context, it was held that

consumer complaint is not maintainable. He has also referred to a

judgment reported in 2016(4) C.P.J. 711 titled as Rajendra Singh

Verma Vs. Committee of Management, Indraprastha Sahakari
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> Consumer Complaint No. 181 of 2016                                   8</span>



Awas Samiti Limited &amp; Anr. It was a dispute regarding the

outstanding amount. The matter was settled by the arbitrator. In

that context, it was held by the Hon'ble Bench that once the matter

is settled by the Arbitrator then the complaint before the National

Commission is barred by principles of res judicata. He has referred

to another judgment reported in 2016(2) C.P.J. 42            titled as

"Hanuman Sahakari Pani Pruvatha Sanstha Maryadit &amp; Ors.

Vs. Ramchandra Bapuso Khade &amp; Ors.". In that case, there was

a dispute between the opposite party and society regarding loss

caused on account of non-supply of water for irrigation of land. In

that context, it was held by the Hon'ble National Commission that

Consumer Fora has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.

Whereas, learned counsel for the complainant referred to the

judgment of Hon'ble National Commission reported in 2017(1) CLT

73 titled as "Raj Kumar Goyal Vs. Malwinder Singh Battu &amp;

Ors." In this case, opposite purchased a land and assured to its

members to allot flats but failed to give possession. In that context,

it was held     that even if the issue is to be handled by the

Cooperative Department under cooperative law, jurisdiction of

Consumer Fora to deal with these matters is not barred. In that

case, personal liability of the office bearers of Cooperative Society

will also be there. In that case, a Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme

Court reported in III (1996) CPJ 1 (SC) titled as "Fair Air

Engineers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. N.K.Modi" was also relied upon. In

another judgment reported in IV(2015) C.P.J., Pg.16 titled as H.R.

Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. Vandana Sanjay Pandya &amp; Ors, it was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> Consumer Complaint No. 181 of 2016                                     9</span>



observed that <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_10">Cooperative Societies Act</a> does not oust the

jurisdiction of <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_11">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986. A specific provision

under <a href="/doc/76226/" id="a_12">Section 3</a> of the Act has been provided. The same is

reproduced as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "3. Act not in derogation of any other law: The provisions
      of the Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the
      provisions of any other law for the time being in force."

</blockquote><p id="p_8">7.          This Section is in addition to and not in derogation of

provisions under any other Act. Where the Cooperative Society has

assured for the services after taking the amount from its members

then it falls within the ambit of services and where the society is in

default of services then the matter is covered under the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_13">Consumer

Protection Act</a>, 1986 and Consumer Fora have the jurisdiction to

entertain the complaints. Therefore, we do not agree with the plea

raised by the counsel for OP No. 1 &amp; 3that the complaint against

Op No.1 &amp; 3 be dismissed. The application is without merit and it

is hereby dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">Miscellaneous Application No. 1752 of 2017

</p><p id="p_10">8.          OP No. 1 also moved an application to place on record

the certificate issued by GMADA on 9.3.2012. However, counsel

for the complainant stated that it is clear from this certificate that it

is valid from 7.12.2010 to 6.12.2015 that period is already over and

no certificate has been placed on the record that it has been got

renewed. Therefore, it will not serve the purpose that the Op had

the certificate of Promoter but it expired in the year 2015 and it was

not further got renewed. Therefore, we do not see any merit in the

application and the same is hereby dismissed.

<p id="p_13">Clause No. 6 further specifies the period within which after

development plots will be delivered to the Members.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "6.    The second party shall obtain Change of Land Use

      (CLU) as soon as possible from date of signing of this MOU

      with concerned department and shall undertake development

      of the area into a residential colony. The Second Party will

      hand over Plots after developing the same to the non-

      defaulting Members/Allottees within 20 months from the

      date of MOU."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">Accordingly, the revised allotment letter was issued by Op No. 4 as

Ex. C-12. It also certifies that Rs. 27,10,000/- has already been

received and balance amount of the plot as well as IDC charges

were due. No doubt that consent was given by the complainant for

transferring the project by Op No. 1 to Op No. 4 but when Op No. 1

was    not    developing    the      project,    under   the        compelled

circumstances, he had to give the consent.
</p>
<p id="p_15">10.          Now the question arises whether Op No. 1 was entitled

to raise such a scheme without any CLU and other certificates from

the concerned Departments. The CLU was accorded to Op No. 4

vide their letter dated 2.12.2016, which makes it clear that neither

Op No. 1 or Op No. 4 had the relevant certificates, it has been so

stated by Op No. 4 in their reply, even such certificates were not

there when the project was transferred to Op No. 4. Here the

reference to Section 4 of the PAPRA, 1995 is relevant, which reads

as under:-

<p id="p_16">
   "4. Issuing of Advertisement or Prospectus:-

      that the statement was immaterial or that he had reason to
      believe and did upto the time of issue of the advertisement
      or prospectus believe that the statement was true."

</p><p id="p_28">11.           The counsel for the Ops has failed to convince before

us how they had complied with the provisions of <a href="/doc/57754461/" id="a_18">Section 4</a> of the

Act. Further the CLU now provided by Senior Town Planner vide

letter dated 2.12.2016 Ex. Op-4/6 and Clause No. 9 of the letter

issued by Senior Town Planner is as under:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> Consumer Complaint No. 181 of 2016                               14</span><p id="p_29">



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "(ix) Applicant shall obtain NOC from P.P.C.B. under the

      Water Prevention and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_19">Pollution Act</a>, 1970,

      Municipal Solid Waste Management and Handling Rules,

      2000 or any other relevant Act before undertaking any

      development at site."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">            However, opposite party No. 4 has also not placed on

the record the requisite Certificate obtained by them from the

concerned departments.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">12.         Therefore, we have no hesitation to return the findings

in favour of the complainant and against the Ops that they have

indulged in unfair trade practice as well as deficiency in service

even after transferring the project to Op No. 4. Op No. 4 has not

been able to deliver the possession within a period of 20 months as

agreed. Complainant had submitted an application/complaint in

Sangat Darshan against the Ops, upon which the Estate Officer

(R), GAMADA told to its official to send the complaint under

Section 4 of the PAPRA Act to the competent authority for its

approval and necessary action and soon it was also written to the

Senior Superintendent of Police, S.A.S. Nagar for the registration

of case against the afore said persons.
</p>
<p id="p_31">13.         Counsel for Op No. 4 contended that there is no direct

agreement between the complainant and Op No. 4. The reference

is given to MOU Ex. Op-1&amp;3/4, which shows that Op No. 4 has

come in the footsteps of Op No. 1 and after that he also issued the

fresh allotment letter, therefore, he cannot say that there is no

privity of contract between the complainant and Op No. 4.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13"> Consumer Complaint No. 181 of 2016                                  15</span>



</p><p id="p_32">14.         If this is the situation when the Ops failed to obtain the

necessary permissions from the concerned authorities and to

complete the project within the stipulated time, the consumer

cannot be allowed to suffer for an indefinite period and he is

entitled to refund of his amount. It has been so held in 2007(2) CLT

440 titled as 'Kamal Sood Vs. DLF Universal Ltd.' and 2014(2)

CLT 401 titled as 'Brigadier B.S.Taunque (Retd.) &amp; Others Vs.

M/s Sangeethashree Builders &amp; Developers International

Private Limited &amp; Others'. Similar orders have been passed by

this Commission in F.A. No.231 of 2016 decided on 12.10.2016

titled as M/s R.K.M. Housing Ltd. Vs. Smt. Geeta Bhatia &amp; Anr. and

F.A. No.230 of 2016 decided on 12.10.2016 titled as M/s R.K.M.

Housing Ltd. Vs. Smt. Rakhi &amp; Anr.
</p>
<p id="p_33">15.         Another contention was raised by the counsel for the

Op No.4 that rate of interest should not be given more than 8%,

which is the bank interest rate. However, there is provision under

Clause No. 3 of the allotment letter dated 5.6.2011, which is as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      "3.   As the plot has been offered on no-profit-no-loss basis,

      late payment will attract penal interest @ 12% p.a. and

      sustained default will lead to cancellation of allotment."

</blockquote><p id="p_34">If the Ops are charging interest @ 12% on late payment then they

are liable to pay the same interest to the complainant on account of

their deficiency in service. It has been so provided under Rule 17 of

the PAPRA Rules, 1995.
</p>
<p id="p_35">16.         No other point was raised.

</p><p id="p_37">17.           Sequel to the above, we accept the complaint and

ordered all the Ops as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      (i)     to refund the sum of Rs.27,31,000/- alongwith interest

              at the rate of 12% per annum from the various dates of

              payment till realization;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      (ii)    to pay Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation on account of

              unfair trade practice on the part of the Ops by giving

              false assurances to develop the area within the

              stipulated period of 20 months, which causes mental

              tension and harassment to the complainant;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      (iii)   to pay Rs.21,000/- as litigation costs.</blockquote><p id="p_38">

</p><p id="p_39">              All the Ops are jointly and severally liable to make the

payment to the complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_40">18.           The above directions be complied with within a period

of 45 days from the date of receipt of certified copy of the order.

</p><p id="p_41">19.           The complaint could not be decided within the statutory

period due to heavy pendency of court cases.
