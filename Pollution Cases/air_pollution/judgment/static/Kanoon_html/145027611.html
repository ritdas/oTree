<pre id="pre_1">          THE HON'BLE THE ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE RAMESH RANGANATHAN
                                     AND
               THE HON'BLE SMT JUSTICE KONGARA VIJAYA LAKSHMI

                     Writ Petition No.17756 of 2018

Order: (Per the Hon'ble The Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan)

       Heard Sri D. Arun Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioner,

learned Government for Environment, Sri P. Shiv Kumar, learned

Standing Counsel for the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (the

"Board" for short), and Sri A. Ravinder, learned counsel for the 5th

respondent and, with their consent, the Writ Petition is disposed of at the</pre>

<p id="p_1">stage of admission.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       A show cause notice was issued to the petitioner on 6.10.2017

informing him that he was operating the Unit without obtaining Consent

for Establishment and Consent for Operation from the Board under

<a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_1">Section 31(A)</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; Control of Pollution) Amendment

Act, 1987 and under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_2">Section 33(A)</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; Control of

Pollution) Amendment Act, 1988. In reply thereto, the petitioner, by his

letter dated 13.10.2017, informed the authorities that he had obtained

such permission. Thereafter, the impugned order dated 5.5.2018 came

to be passed informing the petitioner that his unit was causing air and

noise pollution to the surroundings. By virtue of the powers vested with

the Board under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_3">Section 33(A)</a> of Water (Prevention and Control of

Pollution) Amendment Act, 1998 (hereinafter referred to as "the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">Water

Act</a>"), and under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_5">Section 31(A)</a> of the Air (Prevention and Control of

Pollution) Amendment Act, 1987 (hereinafter referred to as "the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a>"),

the Board directed that the unit be closed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       While Sri D.Arun Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioner, would

submit that the order was passed based on a report of TF Committee

dated 2.5.2018, a copy of which was not even furnished to the petitioner,

Sri P. Shiv Kumar, learned Standing Counsel for the Telangana State

Pollution Control Board, would draw our attention to para-5 of the very

same order which refers to the representative of the Unit having informed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2</span>


the Board that they would utilize both virgin and re-cycled plastic to

produce pipes, to submit that this itself shows that the impugned order

was passed after hearing the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        It is wholly unnecessary for us to dwell on this aspect, as

Sri D. Arun Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioner, would fairly state

that he would make a representation in this regard by tomorrow, ie,

19.06.2018, and it would suffice if the representation is directed to be

considered within a specified time frame. Learned Counsel would submit

that, in case the petitioner is informed of the measures he could take to

bring the noise and air pollution levels below the prescribed norms, he

would immediately take necessary action in this regard; and, on its being

satisfied that the unit is no longer causing noise and air pollution, the

Board should be directed to accord permission to re-open and run the

Unit.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        Both Sri P. Shiv Kumar, learned Standing Counsel for the

Telangana State Pollution Control Board, and Sri A. Ravinder, learned

counsel for the 5th respondent, would fairly state that such an order may

be passed, provided the petitioner is not permitted to operate the unit in

the interregnum.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        We consider it appropriate, in such circumstances, to dispose of

the Writ Petition directing the Board to consider the petitioner's

representation within ten days from the date of its receipt; suggest

measures by which the petitioner could bring the noise and air pollution

levels below the prescribed limits; and satisfy itself that such measures

have been taken by the petitioner, and the air and noise pollution levels

are brought down within permissible limits. On the petitioner submitting

another    representation,   furnishing   proof   of   compliance   with   the

measures suggested by the Board, the Board shall cause an inspection,

and take a decision, whether or not to revoke the closure order, within

two weeks from the date of receipt of the said representation.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>


</p><p id="p_7">      The Writ Petition is disposed of accordingly. Miscellaneous

Petitions pending, if any, shall also stand disposed of. There shall be no

order as to costs.
