</p><p id="p_5">35/ 25.04.2018 State had filed its affidavit earlier on 11.04.2018 which refers to the
         measures being undertaken for checking illegal mining. State Pollution Control
         Board has filed an affidavit today which is in two parts; one deals with the role
         of Pollution Control Board in issuing Consent to Establish (CTE) and Consent to
         Operate (CTO), to implement the provisions of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control
         of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981,
         <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and directions of Ministry of Environment,
         Forest &amp; Climate Change (MoEF &amp; CC), Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi
         and Department of Forest, Environment &amp; Climate Change, Government of
         Jharkhand. In the second part, it encloses the Action Taken Reports received from
         five Regional Officers stationed at Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Dumka, Dhanbad and
         Hazaribagh.
</p><p id="p_6">         2.     Conspicuously, affidavit and Action Taken Report do not even whisper
         about any assessment of the pollution levels in the areas where stone crushers are
         operating, more so where they are operating in clusters; what is air quality in such
         areas; what is the quality of water found in those areas, etc. We understand that
         this is one of the primary roles of the Pollution Control Board. After issuance of
         CTO, the authorities of the Board are not supposed to be in the state of inaction
         or hibernation. It is a regulatory authority, constantly required to assess not only
         the compliance of the conditions of CTE and CTO, but also to assess the quality
         of air, water, etc. where these clusters are operating. It is a common knowledge
         that crushers operate in clusters in view of heavy demand of stone chips in many
         of the districts of the State where stones are found in abundance. The activity of
         stone crushing and its transportation both generate huge amount of dust which,
         least to say, contains Particulate Material and Suspended Particle Materials
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                             2</span>


       (SPM) of different sizes which are extremely hazardous to human health. The
       Pollution Control Board can't shut its eyes to these very hazardous polluting
       effects caused by the activities carried out under its CTO.
</p><p id="p_7">       3.     Learned counsel representing the Board submits that by the next date,
       authorities of the Board would carry out extensive exercise of assessment of
       pollution levels in the areas where crushers operate, more so where they are in
       clusters. Report about the action taken to ensure compliances would be brought
       on record by the next date.
</p><p id="p_8">       4.     Learned counsel for the State is also required to bring on record details of
       steps being taken in furtherance of the decisions which are referred to in their
       affidavit dated 11.04.2018. They would also mention about the steps taken for
       enforcement of various industrial laws which specifically apply to such kinds of
       stone crushing activities.
</p><p id="p_9">       5.     Let the matter appear on 15.05.2018 as an unfixed case. On or before the
       next date, affidavits of the State and Pollution Control Board should definitely be
       on record, failing which their officers may have to be summoned to appear in
       person.
</p><p id="p_10">       6.     Learned Amicus Curiae and learned counsel representing the petitioner in
       WP(PIL) No. 290/2013 are also required to assist the Court through affidavits
       containing concrete instances relating to the issues involved, so that deliberation
       in the present proceedings do not remain in abstract, but can be dealt with on the
       ground level.
</p><p id="p_11">       7.     Let a copy of the order be handed over to the counsel for the State and
       Pollution Control Board by Friday.
