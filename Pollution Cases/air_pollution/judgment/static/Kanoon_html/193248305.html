<p id="p_1">          The petitioners were aggrieved with the order

passed by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (PCB),

refusing consent to establish, produced as Ext.P9. Ideally, the

petitioners ought to have challenged the same before the

Appellate Authority constituted under the Air (Prevention &amp;

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981 (for brevity 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Act</a>). The

petitioners also filed the same as is indicated from Ext.P12,

produced    subsequently    along   with   the   interlocutory

application.  However, the consideration was not be made,

since there was no appellate authority constituted as per the

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air Act</a>.  As of now, the Government has constituted the

appellate authority by notification G.O(P) No.5/2016/Envt.

W.P.(C) No.31063 of 2016- G



dated 20.12.2016.         In such circumstance, there shall be a

direction that the matter shall be taken up and shall be

considered for any interim orders, within a period of one

month from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this

judgment.
