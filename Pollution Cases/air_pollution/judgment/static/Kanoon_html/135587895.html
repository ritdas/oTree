JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON)

     The present appeal is preferred against the order dated 10th

April, 2012 passed by the Pollution Control Appellate Authority,

West Bengal (for short 'appellate authority'), upholding the order




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                 2</span>
 of closure passed by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (for

short 'the Board') dated 8th February, 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.   The necessary facts are that the appellant is the sole

proprietor of M/s. Samanta Engineering Works, which is inter alia

engaged in the business of running an Auto Emission Testing

Centre situated at 1, B.T. Road, Barrackpore, North 24-Parganas,

West Bengal. The said Auto Emission Testing Centre checks

motor vehicles including two wheelers for emission of smoke

within permissible limits of pollution, as per the prescribed

norms. Licensing Authority under the relevant rules is the District

Magistrate, North 24-Paraganas, Barasat, West Bengal. The

appellant had made an application for Letter of Offer for

establishment of an Auto Emission Testing Centre before the

Licensing Authority. In furtherance to which, the Licensing

Authority vide its memo dated 8th February, 2005 called upon the

Board to conduct an enquiry and to submit a report. According to

the appellant, being satisfied, the consent to operate was issued

by the Board and the Licensing Authority also permitted the

appellant to operate. Two different licenses for operating the Auto

Emission Testing Centre were issued. These licenses were valid for

a period of one year. The appellant applied for the renewal of said

licenses in the prescribed format. Vide memo dated 10th March,

2011, the Board informed the appellant that their unit will be

inspected on that very date. The inspection was carried out in

relation to the instruments used for testing vehicles and/or two


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                  3</span>
 wheelers. According to the appellant, the said inspection was

satisfactory. In furtherance to the inspection dated 10th March,

2011, the appellant was called for a technical hearing to be

conducted at the head office of the respondent No. 1, where the

appellant brought to the notice of the officials that the copy of the

inspection report was not provided to the appellant as such. He

remained unaware about the contents thereof. Thereafter, vide

Memo dated 8th February, 2012, a closure order against the

appellant was issued by the Chief Scientist of the Board. Against

this order, the appellant preferred an appeal before the Appellate

Authority. The Appellate Authority in its order dated 10th April,

2012 noticed that during the inspection, it was found that:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      1.   RPM and oil temperature sensor were not functioning.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      2.   CO-correction software was not installed in the 4 -
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      gas analyzer software.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      During inspection it was also found that Smoke Meter and

      the 4-gas analyzer were operating unsatisfactorily.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_4">3.   In addition thereto, it was stated in the impugned order that

the unit was not possessed of any valid license in accordance with

the rules. The Appellate Authority, therefore, in its detailed order

dated 10th April, 2012, dismissed the appeal rejecting the

contentions raised by the appellant before it. Against the said

order dated 10th April, 2012, the appellant has preferred the

present appeal (Appeal No. 67 of 2013).
</p>
<p id="p_5">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                    4</span>
</p><p id="p_6"> 4.   According to the appellant, this appeal is barred by 104

days. Thus, the appellant has filed a Miscellaneous Application

No. 573 of 2013 praying for condonation of delay of 104 days in

filing the present appeal. This application is opposed and

vehemently contested by the respondents, particularly the Board

on the ground that firstly, the appeal is hopelessly barred by 104

days and secondly, this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to condone or

even entertain the appeal when it is filed beyond a total period of

90 days i.e. 30+60 days in terms of proviso to <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_1">Section 16</a> of the

National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (for short the 'NGT Act'). In

support of his second contention, the Learned Counsel has relied

upon two judgments of this Tribunal in the case of <a href="/doc/97059486/" id="a_2">Nikunj

Developers &amp; Others v. State Of Maharashtra &amp; Anr</a>. 2013, All

India NGT Reporter page 40 and <a href="/doc/181724128/" id="a_3">Krishna Stone Crushers and

Others v. Haryana State Pollution Control Board and Another</a>,

2014, All India NGT Reporter page 42.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">5.   On the other hand, the Learned Counsel appearing for the

appellant contended that these judgments of the Tribunal do not

lay down the correct law. It is contended that the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_4">Sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/769768/" id="a_5">24</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963 (for short the

'<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_6">Limitation Act</a>') would be applicable to the application filed by the

appellant, as the NGT Act does not expressly or impliedly exclude

the applicability of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_7">Limitation Act</a> as contemplated under

<a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_8">Section 29(2)</a> of the Limitation Act. Further, it is contended that

the language of proviso to Section 16 of the NGT Act has not been

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                    5</span>
 worded by the legislature in a manner so as to completely divest

the Tribunal from the jurisdiction of condoning of the delay

beyond a total period of 90 days provided under proviso to Section

</p><p id="p_9">16. To buttress these submissions, an argument has also been

advanced that this Tribunal being the first appellate judicial

forum, should construe the law of limitation liberally.


</p><p id="p_10">6.   Before we proceed to examine the merit or otherwise of the

rival contentions raised before us, it is necessary for us to notice

certain further facts in relation to the filing of the present appeal

belatedly and for condonation of the delay.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">7.   The order of the Appellate Authority upholding the closure

order passed by the Board, was passed on 10th April, 2012. The

NGT Act had come into force on 2nd June, 2010. However, the

appellant initially did not prefer any appeal before the Tribunal

against the order of the Appellate Authority dated 10th April, 2012

but challenged the said order by filing a writ petition before the

High Court of Calcutta. The writ petition is stated to have been

filed on 17th May, 2012. The writ petition remained pending before

the High Court and by order dated 20th December, 2012, the

Board was asked to inspect the premises of the appellant as it

was the contention of the appellant that it had removed all the

defects. However, the writ petition of the appellant came to be

dismissed as withdrawn vide order dated 31st January, 2013. The

writ petition was withdrawn on the ground that the matter falls


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                    6</span>
 within the ambit of <a href="/doc/561143/" id="a_9">Section 2(m)</a> read with Section 14 of the NGT

Act and therefore, the appeal would lie to this Tribunal. The

certified copy of the order dated 31st January, 2013 was applied

for on 1st February, 2013, which was ready on 12th February,

2013 and was delivered on 13th February, 2013. The present

appeal was filed in the registry of the Tribunal at the Principal

Bench on 29th May, 2013. Here we may notice that originally the

appellant had filed Miscellaneous Application No. 487 of 2013 for

condonation of delay without specifying the days by which the

appeal was barred. On the very first day of hearing of the appeal

before the Tribunal, i.e. on 3rd June, 2013, the appellant had

sought permission to file a better affidavit in support of the

application of condonation of delay. This liberty was granted.

Thereafter, instead of filing additional affidavit, the appellant filed

Miscellaneous    Application    No.   573    of   2013   praying    for

condonation of delay. Vide order dated 9th July, 2013 notice was

issued to the other parties in Miscellaneous Application No. 573 of

2013. According to this application, there was a delay of 104 days

in filing the present appeal. But, from the above narrated facts, it

is clear that the appeal before the Tribunal ought to have been

filed by 10th July, 2012, however, it has been filed on 29th May,

2013. There appears to be a delay of 323 days in filing the appeal.

Even, if the time spent by the appellant before the High Court of

Calcutta is excluded, the appeal would still be barred by 125

days.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                      7</span>
</p><p id="p_14"> 8.    From the above narrated factual matrix of the case it is

apparent that the present appeal has been filed beyond the outer

period of limitation i.e. 90 days as provided under proviso to

Section 16 of the NGT Act.      Even if we take the case of the

appellant at its face value, then admittedly there is a delay of 104

days (which is in excess of the prescribed period of limitation).

However, upon proper computation there is in fact a delay of 125

days. If the period spent before the High Court and other period,

the exclusion of which is prayed for, is not excluded then the

appeal is barred by 323 days. Undisputedly, in any case the

appeal has been filed beyond 90 days which is the outer limit of

period of limitation prescribed under proviso to Section 16 of the

NGT Act.

date on which the order is communicated to the aggrieved

persons.   Proviso to Section 16 of the NGT Act provides for a

special limitation i.e. the appeal could be filed beyond the period

of 30 days within a further period not exceeding 60 days, upon

showing 'sufficient cause'. This means the tribunal cannot allow

an appeal to be filed under <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_35">Section 16</a> beyond a total period of 90

days. The NGT Act is a self-contained code as it provides for the

forum, procedure, limitation, functions and powers of the

tribunal. Furthermore, the scheme of the NGT Act, particularly,

with reference to the language of Section 16 of the NGT Act,

provides special limitation period. Thus, it necessarily excludes

the operation of the general law of limitation. The provisions of

the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_36">Limitation Act</a> cannot be harmoniously construed with the

provisions prescribing special limitation under the NGT Act as in

that event it would defeat the very purpose of the NGT Act.      A

limitation provided under special law must prevail over the

general law of limitation; particularly in face of the overriding

effect given to the NGT Act by the framers of the law in terms of

Section 33 of the NGT Act. In terms of <a href="/doc/161532715/" id="a_37">Section 33</a>, the provisions

of the NGT Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything

 inconsistent contained in any other law for the time being in force.

The cumulative effect of all these factors would be that the special

limitation prescribed under the NGT Act does not admit any

exception to attract the applicability of the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_38">Limitation Act</a>.   Section 16 of the NGT Act controls the very

institution of an appeal in the Registry of the Tribunal. In terms

of <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_39">Section 16</a>, the appeal can be filed 'within a further period not

exceeding 60 days' but thereafter the Tribunal is not vested with

the power to allow the appeal to be filed beyond the total period of

90 days. Thus, the tribunal loses its jurisdiction to entertain an

appeal after the expiry of the special period of limitation provided

under proviso to Section 16 of the NGT Act.

of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_41">Limitation Act</a> including <a href="/doc/115208519/" id="a_42">Section 5</a> are excluded.         The

      filed within 30 days from the date of communication of
      the order. That is, what an applicant is required to
      ensure before the appeal is heard on merits. However, the

 condone the delay has a clear inbuilt limitation as it
ceases to exist if the appeal is filed in excess of 60 days,
beyond the prescribed period of limitation of 30 days
from the date of communication of such order. To put it
simply, once the period of 90 days lapses from the date of
communication of the order, the Tribunal has no
jurisdiction to condone the delay. The language of the
provision is clear and explicit. It admits of no ambiguity
and the legislative intent that Tribunal should not and
cannot condone the delay in excess of 90 days in all, is
clear from the plain language of the provision.
</blockquote><p id="p_25">20. As stated in the cases Hiralal Ratan Lal and India
Houses (supra) the period of limitation statutorily
prescribed, has to be strictly adhered to and cannot be
relaxed and or departed from, on equitable consideration.
Further, in construing a statutory provision, the first and
the foremost rule of construction is that of literary
construction. We do not see any reason to expand the
scope of the provision and interpret the proviso to <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_43">Section
16</a> in the manner that Tribunal can be vested with the
power of condoning the delay beyond 90 days. Such
interpretation would be contrary to the specific language
of the Section and would defeat the very legislative intent
and object behind this provision.

   interpreted in <a href="/doc/487135/" id="a_47">Union of India v. Popular Construction

   considered in that case was whether the provisions of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                               12</span>
 not thereafter" used in the proviso to Sub-section
(3). In our opinion, this phrase would amount to
an express exclusion within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_55">Section 29(2)</a> of the Limitation Act, and would
therefore bar the application of <a href="/doc/115208519/" id="a_56">Section 5</a> of that
Act. Parliament did not need to go further. To hold
that the court could entertain an application to
set aside the award beyond the extended period
under the proviso, would render the phrase "but
not thereafter" wholly otiose. No principle of
interpretation would justify such a result.
</p>
<p id="p_30">16. Furthermore, <a href="/doc/114478429/" id="a_57">Section 34(1)</a> itself provides that
recourse to a court against an arbitral award may
be made only by an application for setting aside
such award "in accordance with" Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (3). Sub-section (2) relates to
grounds for setting aside an award and is not
relevant for our purposes. But an application filed
beyond the period mentioned in <a href="/doc/82687905/" id="a_58">Section 34</a>, Sub-
section (3) would not be an application "in
accordance with" that Sub-section. Consequently
by virtue of <a href="/doc/114478429/" id="a_59">Section 34(1)</a>, recourse to the court
against an arbitral award cannot be made beyond
the period prescribed. The importance of the
period fixed under <a href="/doc/82687905/" id="a_60">Section 34</a> is emphasised by
the provisions of <a href="/doc/158646846/" id="a_61">Section 36</a> which provide that

"where the time for making an application to set
aside the arbitral award under <a href="/doc/82687905/" id="a_62">Section 34</a> has
expired ... the award shall be enforced under the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in the same manner
as if it were a decree of the court".
</p>
<p id="p_31">This is a significant departure from the provisions
of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_63">Arbitration Act</a>, 1940. Under the 1940 Act,
after the time to set aside the award expired, the
court was required to "proceed to pronounce
judgment according to the award, and upon the
judgment so pronounced a decree shall follow"
(<a href="/doc/139918683/" id="a_64">Section 17</a>). Now the consequence of the time
expiring under <a href="/doc/82687905/" id="a_65">Section 34</a> of the 1996 Act is that
the award becomes immediately enforceable
without any further act of the court. If there were
any residual doubt on the interpretation of the
language used in <a href="/doc/82687905/" id="a_66">Section 34</a>, the scheme of the
1996 Act would resolve the issue in favour of
curtailment of the court's powers by the exclusion
of the operation of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_67">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act.

   <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_70">Section 125</a> of the Electricity Act and observed:

</p><p id="p_34">     8. The Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals) as
     also the Tribunal being creatures of statute are
     vested with jurisdiction to condone the delay beyond
     the permissible period provided under the statute.
     The period up to which the prayer for condonation
     can be accepted is statutorily provided. It was
     submitted that the logic of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_71">Section 5</a> of the
     Limitation Act, 1963 (in short "the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_72">Limitation Act</a>")
     can be availed for condonation of delay. The first
     proviso to <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_73">Section 35</a> makes the position clear that
     the appeal has to be preferred within three months
     from the date of communication to him of the
     decision or order. However, if the Commissioner is
     satisfied that the appellant was prevented by
     sufficient cause from presenting the appeal within
     the aforesaid period of 60 days, he can allow it to be
     presented within a further period of 30 days. In
     other words, this clearly shows that the appeal has
     to be filed within 60 days but in terms of the proviso
     further 30 days' time can be granted by the
     appellate authority to entertain the appeal. The
     proviso to Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_74">Section 35</a> makes the
     position crystal clear that the appellate authority
     has no power to allow the appeal to be presented
     beyond the period of 30 days. The language used
     makes the position clear that the legislature
     intended the appellate authority to entertain the
     appeal by condoning delay only up to 30 days after
     the expiry of 60 days which is the normal period for
     preferring appeal. Therefore, there is complete
     exclusion of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_75">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act. The
     Commissioner and the High Court were therefore
     justified in holding that there was no power to
     condone the delay after the expiry of 30 days'
     period.

      adverted to Chapter VI-A of the Act which
      provides for appeals and revisions to various

      provided an additional period of 30 days in the
      case of appeal to the Commissioner, it is silent

      cause in the case of an appeal to the Appellate

  position clear that an appeal and reference to the
  High Court should be made within 180 days only
  from the date of communication of the decision or
  order. In other words, the language used in other
  provisions makes the position clear that the
  legislature intended the appellate authority to
  entertain the appeal by condoning the delay only up
  to 30 days after expiry of 60 days which is the
  preliminary limitation period for preferring an
  appeal. In the absence of any clause condoning the
  delay by showing sufficient cause after the
  prescribed period, there is complete exclusion of
  <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_88">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act. The High Court was,

     The nature of the remedy provided therein is such
     that the legislature intended it to be a complete code

     the benefits conferred therein cannot be called in
     aid to supplement the provisions of the Act. In our

     to examine whether and to what extent, the nature
     of those provisions or the nature of the subject-

     operation. In other words, the applicability of the

the application of provisions of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_105">Section 5</a> of the Limitation

of affirmative words may also be so limiting as to imply a
negative. Once negative expression is evident upon
specific or necessary implication, such provisions must
be construed as mandatory. The legislative command
must take precedence over equitable principle. The
language of Section 16 of the NGT Act does not admit of
any ambiguity, rather it is explicitly clear that the
framers of law did not desire to vest the Tribunal with
powers, specific or discretionary, of condoning the delay
in excess of total period of 90 days. At this stage, we may
also refer to Principle of Statutory Interpretation by
Justice G.P. Singh, 13th Edition, where it is stated as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">    "(c) Use of negative words
     Another mode of showing a clear intention that the
    provision enacted is mandatory, is by clothing the
    command in a negative form. As stated by
    CRAWFORD: "Prohibitive or negative words can
    rarely, if ever, be directory. And this is so even
    though the statute provides no penalty for
    disobedience." As observed by SUBBARAO, J.:
    "Negative words are clearly prohibitory and are
    ordinarily used as a legislative device to make a
    statute imperative". <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_106">Section 80</a> and Section 87-B of
    the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908; <a href="/doc/1554665/" id="a_107">section 77</a> of the

    amended in 1993) and similar other provisions have
    therefore, been construed as mandatory. A provision
    requiring 'not less than three months' notice' is also
    for the same reason mandatory.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">    But the principle is not without exception. Section
    256 of the Government of India, 1953, was construed
    by the Federal Court as directory though worded in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                              17</span>
          the negative form. Directions related to solemnization
         of marriages though using negative words have been
         construed as directory in cases where the
         enactments in question did not provide for the
         consequence that the marriage in breach of those
         directions shall be invalid. Considerations of general
         inconvenience, which would have resulted in holding
         these enactments mandatory, appear to have
         outweighed the effect of the negative words in
         reaching the conclusion that they were in their true
         meaning merely director. An interesting example,
         where negative words have been held to be directory,
         is furnished in the construction of section 25-F of the
         Industrial Dispute Act, 1947, where compliance of
         clause (c) has been held to be directory; although
         compliance of clauses (a) and (b) which are connected
         by the same negative words is understood as
         mandatory. These cases illustrate that the rule, that
         negative words are usually mandatory, is like any
         other rule subordinate to the context, and the object
         intended to be achieved by the particular
         requirement."

     <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_116">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996. Thus, adopting an analogous
     reasoning, as was adopted in Chhattisgarh State
     Electricity Board (supra), we would have no hesitation in
     coming to the conclusion that we have no jurisdiction to
     condone the delay when the same is in excess of 90 days
     from the date of communication of the order to any
     person aggrieved.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">     27. Thus, the application must fail on this ground alone.
     We are of the considered view that the Tribunal has no
     jurisdiction to condone the delay of 19 days in filing the
     present appeal, the same being in excess of 90 days
     computed from the admitted date of communication of
     order, that is 2nd June, 2012."

<p id="p_48">11. The above view of the tribunal was followed by different

Benches of this tribunal in the case of <a href="/doc/181724128/" id="a_117">M/s. Krishna Stone

 NGT Reporter (2) (Bhopal) 1, besides following the law stated in

Nikunj Developers (supra), the bench also clearly held that a

special enactment, which specifically provides period of limitation

would exclude the general law of limitation. Similar view was also

expressed by another Bench of the Tribunal in the case of <a href="/doc/191757222/" id="a_118">Ms.

Medha Patkar v. MoEF &amp; Ors</a>., 2013 All India NGT reporter (Delhi)

</p><p id="p_49">285.


</p><p id="p_50">12. In all the above cases, the consistent view of the tribunal has

been that the tribunal has no jurisdiction to condone the delay

beyond the period of 90 days and it is in fact the very filing of the

appeal that is impermissible in terms of proviso to Section 16 of

the NGT Act. Admittedly, in the present case, the delay in filing

the appeal is beyond 90 days i.e. the total delay being 125 days.

Thus, this tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal

after the expiry of the special limitation period provided under the

relevant provisions. We are unable to find any substance in the

submissions of the learned counsel appearing for the appellant,

that the judgments of the tribunal do not state the correct law

and/or are not applicable to the facts of the present case.      We

have no hesitation in rejecting the said contention raised on

behalf of the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_51">13. Having said so, we would still proceed to discuss the other

contentions raised on behalf of the appellant before the tribunal.

It is argued that the language of Section 16 of the NGT Act does

not expressly or by necessary implication exclude the provisions

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                   19</span>
 of <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_119">Sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/769768/" id="a_120">24</a> (inclusive) of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_121">Limitation Act</a> and thus,

squarely fall within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_122">Section 29(2)</a> of the Limitation

Act. A limitation period is the period of time prescribed by law

within    which     a    person   has    to    approach   the   prescribed

forum/court.       The period of limitation is imposed by statutes.

There are different limitation periods for different types of cause of

action. The period of limitation controls the right of a party to

approach the court or tribunal. It also places an obligation upon

the court to examine if the claim arising before it, is barred by law

of limitation. For instance, the court can reject a plaint inter alia

on the ground that it is barred by any law in terms of Order VII

Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
</p>
<p id="p_52">
</p><p id="p_53">14. The policies underlying the law of limitation are ultimately

based on justice and convenience and an individual should not

live under the threat of a possible action for an indeterminate

period since it would be unjust. Prescription of limitation takes in

its ambit fairness and expeditious trial. Indefinite uncertainty in

relation to bringing an action would be opposed to public policy.

This     concept    is   applicable     with   great   emphasis   to   the

environmental jurisprudence where the project proponent may

invest large amount for making its project operational. Challenge

to such project on the ground that it does not have any

Environmental Clearance or otherwise, has to be within a

specified time, as otherwise it would not only be unfair but also be

seriously prejudicial to the interest of a party. Vigilance in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                        20</span>
 pursuit of rightful claims should be encouraged so that these are

ethical or rational justifications for the law of limitation.


</p><p id="p_54">15. We have already noticed that NGT Act is a self-contained

code in itself.   It provides the forum/procedure that has to be

adopted, the limitation period within which the jurisdiction of the

tribunal gets invoked, and the power and functions of the tribunal

in explicit terms. As a self-contained code, it does not admit of

any ambiguity with regard to application of other laws in the

adjudicatory process of the tribunal. The legislature in its wisdom

has worded provisions of Section 16 of the NGT Act so as to

prohibit even filing of an appeal beyond a total period of 90 days.

The language of these provisions clearly demonstrates the

legislative intendment on excluding application of general law of

limitation to this special statute.    Such a view would also find

clear support from the language of <a href="/doc/372189/" id="a_123">Section 29</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_124">Limitation

Act</a> which postulates that when a special law prescribes for any

period of limitation different from the period prescribed in the

Schedule to the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_125">Limitation Act</a> and the language of the provisions

of such special law is indicative of express or implied exclusion,

then <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_126">Sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/769768/" id="a_127">24</a> (inclusive) of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_128">Limitation Act</a> shall apply

only and to the extent they are not excluded by the Special Law.

The cumulative reading of <a href="/doc/1019641/" id="a_129">Section 16</a>, particularly, the proviso

and <a href="/doc/372189/" id="a_130">Section 29</a> of the Limitation Act leaves no doubt in mind that

legislature had clearly intended to exclude the application of the

general law of limitation provided under the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_131">Limitation Act</a> from


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                                 21</span>
 the NGT Act.     Proviso to Section 16 of the NGT Act uses the

expression 'allow it to be filed under this Section within a further

period not exceeding 60 days'. The use of the negative language

'not' in the proviso makes it mandatory that appeals cannot be

filed after the expiry of total period of 90 days and thus, there is

lack of jurisdiction of the tribunal to condone the delay beyond a

total period of 90 days. The framers of law, where, in their wisdom

wanted to give a benefit and/or restrict or place embargo on

exercise of a right, have done so by using specific language in

Section 16 of the NGT Act. A special concession is made available

to an appellant to file an appeal beyond 30 days, the initial period

of limitation prescribed under that provision. The framers there

put a specific embargo on the power of the Tribunal not to

entertain an appeal after the expiry of a further period of 60 days.

Thus the legislature, by necessary implication excluded the

application of general law of limitation from the provisions of the

NGT Act.     At this stage we may refer to the judgment of the

Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1906339/" id="a_132">Hukumdev Narain Yadav v. Lalit

Narain Mishra</a>, (1974) 2 SCC 133, where the Supreme Court was

dealing with the provisions of the Representation of the Peoples'

Act, 1951 and the applicability of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_133">Limitation

Act</a>.   The Court in relation to the interpretation of the language of

<a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_134">Section 29(2)</a> of the Limitation Act held as:
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">       "17. What we have to determine is whether the provisions

       "expressly excluded" would mean that there must be an
      express reference made in the special or local law to the
      specific provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_135">Limitation Act</a> of which the
      operation is to be excluded. As usual the meaning given
      in the Dictionary has been relied upon, but what we have
      to see is whether the scheme of the special law, that is in
      this case the Act, and the nature of the remedy provided
      therein are such that the Legislature intended it to be a
      complete code by itself which alone should govern the
      several matters provided by it. If on an examination of the
      relevant provisions it is clear that the provisions of the
      <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_136">Limitation Act</a> are necessarily excluded, then the benefits
      conferred therein cannot be called in aid to supplement
      the provisions of the Act. In our view, even in a case
      where the special law does not exclude the provisions of
      <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_137">Section 4</a> to <a href="/doc/769768/" id="a_138">24</a> of the Limitation Act by an express
      reference, it would nonetheless be open to the Court to
      examine whether and to what extent the nature of those
      provisions or the nature of the subject-matter and
      scheme of the special law exclude their operation."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_56">16. From the above dictum of the Supreme Court of India, it is

clear that the exclusion can be by explicit language or even by

necessary implication. It will depend upon the scheme of the Act,

it being a self-contained code and what is the intent of legislature?

Furthermore, in the case of <a href="/doc/487135/" id="a_139">Union of India v. Popular Construction

&amp; Co</a>., AIR 2001 SC 4010, the Supreme Court held that the word

'excluded' appearing in <a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_140">Section 29(2)</a> of the Act would also include

'exclusion by necessary implication'. In the case of <a href="/doc/1740415/" id="a_141">Gopal Sardar

v. Karuna Sardar</a>, (2004) 4 SCC 252, the Supreme Court read

exclusion by implication, where some of the provisions in West

Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955, provided for giving benefit of

<a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_142">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act but <a href="/doc/996339/" id="a_143">Section 8</a> of the said Act did

not make such a provision.         The court took the view that




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                    23</span>
 legislature consciously excluded the application of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_144">Section 5</a> of the

Limitation Act.
</p>
<p id="p_57">
</p><p id="p_58">17. Now let us examine the principles or relevant considerations

that would help in determining the issue whether the legislature

while framing a particular statute intended express, implied or no

exclusion of the general law of limitation. It is difficult to state

such principles exhaustively but inter alia the following would be

the relevant considerations:
</p>
<p id="p_59">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">    a) Whether the statute in question is a self-contained code and

      provides for a special forum or Tribunal?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">    b) Whether the statute provides for special limitation and

      expressly or impliedly excludes the applicability of general

      law of limitation?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">    c) Whether the scheme and object of the statute and the

      relevant provisions of the statute require the limitation

      prescribed thereunder the special law to prevail over the

      general law of limitation?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">    d) Whether the cumulative reading of the provisions of the

      special statute in back drop of the underlying object of the

      statute makes the provisions mandatory and/or directory?</blockquote><p id="p_60">


    If we apply the above principles to the provisions of the NGT

Act, then, it is clear that NGT Act is a self-contained code, the

tribunal is a special tribunal with defined powers and functions,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                                  24</span>
 with a prescribed procedure and unambiguous provisions of

limitation, clearly stating exclusion of general law of limitation.


</p><p id="p_61">18. Now, we may refer to some of the provisions under different

statutes where the language used is para materia or substantially

similar to the provisions of Section 16 of the NGT Act and the

interpretation given by the higher judiciary to such provisions.

<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_145">Section 125</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003 (hereafter 'the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_146">Electricity

Act</a>') reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_62">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">      "Any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the
      Appellate Tribunal, may, file an appeal to the Supreme
      Court within sixty days from the date of communication

      on any one or more of the grounds specified in section
      100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908;
      Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied
      that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from
      filing the appeal within the said period, allow it to be filed
      within a further period not exceeding sixty days."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_63">19. The bare reading of the above provision shows that power to

condone the delay is vested with the Tribunal under that Act but

the said appeal cannot be permitted to be filed before the

appellate tribunal beyond the period of 60 days. The expression

used in the proviso to the section is 'allow it to be filed within a

further period not exceeding 60 days.' This provision came up for

consideration   before    the   Supreme    Court     in   the    case   of

provide special limitation for filing an appeal against the decision

nugatory.

within a further period of 30 days. The Supreme Court held that

"proviso to sub-Section (1) of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_157">Section 35</a> makes the provision

crystal clear that appellate authority has no power to allow the

appeal to be presented beyond the period of 30 days.            The

language used makes the position clear that the legislature

intended the appellate authority to entertain the appeal by

condoning delay only up to 30 days after the expiry of 60 days

which is the normal period for preferring appeal. Therefore, there

is complete exclusion of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_158">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act.       The

holding that there was no power to condone the delay after the

<a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_163">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act cannot be availed for condonation

of delay as there was exclusion of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_164">Limitation Act</a>. In the case of

<a href="/doc/1897845/" id="a_165">Smt. Hetal Alpesh Muchhala v. Adityesh Educational Institute and

 can be granted and that an appeal could be entertained even after

the prescribed period of 60 days that there was clear exclusion of

<a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_168">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act and held as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">      "20. The words used in the proviso to <a href="/doc/1609121/" id="a_169">Section 10F</a> of the
      Companies Act, 1956, are "not exceeding 60 days"
      thereby clearly prescribing the time limit of only 60 days,
      in addition to the initial period of 60 days allowed under
      <a href="/doc/1609121/" id="a_170">Section 10F</a> of the Companies Act, 1956, to enable a
      party to file an appeal. The proviso clearly shows that the
      power vested in the court to condone delay on sufficient
      cause being shown is directory and subject to the
      discretion vested in the           court. However, the
      maximum period to the extent of which such delay is
      capable of being condoned is mandatorily prescribed and
      not open to exercise of any discretion. The words
      "not exceeding" cannot be given any other meaning
      except "not more than" or "not beyond" or "not
      thereafter". Therefore, in my view, the words "not
      exceeding 60        days"       would       amount        to
      an express exclusion       within     the    meaning      of
      <a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_171">Section 29(2)</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963 and would

      the proviso, to <a href="/doc/1609121/" id="a_174">Section 10F</a> of the Companies Act, 1956,

India, it is clear that wherever the words like 'not exceeding', 'not

more than', 'not beyond' or 'not thereafter' are used in the

provisions of limitation under different statutes, a view has been

taken that the general provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_178">Limitation Act</a> would

stand excluded. Even if, there was no specific provision expressly

providing exclusion, the Courts have read exclusion into such

provisions on the principle of implied exclusion. In the case before

us, the Learned Counsel for the appellant, while contending that

there was no express or implied exclusion in the language of the

provisions of the NGT Act and that the benefit of the provisions of

the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_179">Limitation Act</a> would be available to the appellant placed

relevance upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/1895282/" id="a_180">Mangu Ram v. Municipal Corporation Of Delhi</a>, (1976) 1 SCC, 392,

wherein the Supreme Court was considering the provisions of

<a href="/doc/1791573/" id="a_181">Section 417(4)</a> of Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (378 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_182">CrPC</a>,

1973) which provides that no special leave to appeal from the

order of acquittal shall be entertained by the High Court where

the complainant is a public servant and 60 days in every other

case, computed from the date of that order of acquittal. The

question which the Court was called upon to decide was, whether

the provisions of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_183">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act would be

attracted to the benefit of appellant or not and whether <a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_184">Section

while distinguishing the case of <a href="/doc/1511574/" id="a_186">Kaushalya Rani v. Gopal Singh</a>,

AIR 1964 SC 260 the Court held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_73">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">       "7. It is only if the special or local law expressly excludes
      the applicability of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_187">Section 5</a>, that it would stand
      displaced. Here, as pointed out by this Court in
      Kaushalya Rani's case, the time limit of sixty days laid
      down in Sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_188">Section 417</a> is a special law of
      limitation and we do not find anything in this special law
      which expressly excludes the applicability of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_189">Section 5</a>. It
      is true that the language of Sub-section (4) of
      <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_190">Section 417</a> is mandatory and compulsive, in that it
      provides in no uncertain terms that no application for
      grant of special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal
      shall be entertained by the High Court after the expiry of
      sixty days from the date of that order of acquittal. But
      that would be the language of every provision prescribing
      a period of limitation. It is because a bar against
      entertainment of an application beyond the period of
      limitation is created by a special or local law that it
      becomes necessary to invoke the aid of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_191">Section 5</a> in order
      that the application may be entertained despite such bar.
      Mere provision of a period of limitation in howsoever

      application would not be barred and despite the

the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_201">Limitation Act</a> of 1963 and there was not only linguistical

Kerala Rent Control Act, provided for an appeal to the Appellate

Authority within 30 days from the date of the impugned order. It

further provided that the period taken to obtain certified copy of

 correct exposition of law for variety of reasons. Amongst others,

firstly, these judgments do not consider earlier judgments of the

Supreme Court even by larger Benches. This would attract the

principle of stare decisis. Secondly, the language of the provisions

that fall for consideration of the Supreme Court in these two

cases is completely distinct and different from the language of the

provision which came up for discussion before the Supreme Court

in other cases. They are in any case not in parity with the

language of Section 16 of the NGT Act. On a plain reading of the

provisions with which the Court was concerned in the above two

cases, the language of the relevant provisions did not either

expressly or impliedly provide for an exclusion of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_216">Limitation

Act</a>. Lastly, these cases came to be considered by the Supreme

Court itself, even by the larger Benches subsequently and more

particularly in the case of Gopal Sardar (supra) where in

paragraph 14 and 15 of the judgment, the Supreme Court

deliberated upon these judgments and did not concur with the

view. Same was also considered in the case of Chhattisgarh State

Electricity Board (supra) where in paragraph 33 of the case of

Mukri Gopalan (supra) was noticed by the Supreme Court,

however, the view expressed in that judgment was not followed.

where the legislature clearly declares its intent in the scheme and

language of the statute, it is the duty of the Court to give full

effect to the same, without scanning its wisdom and policy and

without engrafting, adding or implying anything which is not

congenial to or consistent with such expressed intent of the law-

giver. In the case of Vidya Charan Shukla (supra), the Bench of

the Supreme Court accepted the application of the principle of

implied exclusion. The concept of 'complete code' was applied by

the Supreme Court in Hukum Dev Narayan Yadav (supra) case,

where the Court discarded the dictionary meaning of the word

'expressly excluded' and accepted the doctrine of implied

exclusion.

     to be excluded. In this regard, we have to see the scheme
     of the special law here in this case is <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_240">Central Excise Act</a>.
     The nature of the remedy provided therein are such that

 by the Supreme Court, is that a mere provision of the period of

limitation in the statute is not sufficient to displace the

applicability of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_247">Limitation Act</a>. But where the

act is a complete code in itself and where the scheme of the Act

and the language of the relevant provisions expressly or impliedly

exclude the applicability of the general law of limitation, then

such exclusion is accepted by the Court. Not only the scheme of

the NGT Act, which is a self contained code, clearly demonstrates

legislative intent for exclusion of the general law of limitation, but

specifically gives precedence to the provisions of the NGT Act in

terms of Section 33 of the NGT Act, which clearly means that the

provisions of limitation contained in the NGT Act would prevail

and by necessary implication would exclude the application of the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_248">Limitation Act</a>. Thus, it squarely satisfies the

Act. Even this contention of the appellant does not impress us.

We have already referred to the relevant provisions of the NGT Act

in relation to limitation. The consequences of not filing an appeal

within the prescribed period of limitation are inbuilt in proviso to

<a href="/doc/1019641/" id="a_251">Section 16</a>. It is the very filing of the appeal under <a href="/doc/1019641/" id="a_252">Section 16</a> of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                                    36</span>
 the NGT Act that stands barred if it is brought beyond the period

of 90 days. The language of the proviso clearly imposes a duty

upon the Tribunal not to permit filing of the appeal if the same is

filed beyond the further period of 60 days.
</p>
<p id="p_88">

</p><p id="p_89">31. In terms of the proviso to Section 16 of the NGT Act, the twin

consequences that flow from the very language thereof are that

firstly, it takes away the right of a party to file an appeal on the

expiry of 90 days and simultaneously, it vests a valuable right in

the opposite party. Secondly, it takes away the very jurisdiction of

the Tribunal to entertain or allow filing of appeal after the expiry

of the prescribed period. None of the provisions vest jurisdiction in

the Tribunal to condone the delay after the expiry of 90 days, be

there a sufficient cause or not for filing the appeal after that

period. In the light of this, the contention that the section does

not provide for any civil consequences can hardly be accepted. To

examine the consequences of a default in a provision, the rule of

plain construction should normally be applied. If upon bare

reading of the provision consequences are clear and such

consequences are in line with the object and purpose of the Act,

then there is no occasion for the Court or the Tribunal to read

words into the provisions which are non-existent. Wherever the

language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning and grammatical

construction, leads to a manifest contradiction of an apparent

purpose of the enactment, there it may be advisable to modify the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                                                   37</span>
 meaning of the words. The Court or the Tribunal would adopt an

interpretation which is reasonable and sensible rather than that

which is none of those things [<a href="/doc/458532/" id="a_253">Sri Nasiruddin v. State Transport

Appellate Tribunal</a>, AIR (1976) SC 331]. Often applied principle of

interpretation is that where the statutory provision is plain and

unambiguous, the Court shall not interpret the same in a

different manner only because of harsh consequences arising

therefrom [<a href="/doc/907049/" id="a_254">Refer E. Palanisamy v. Palanisamy (D</a>) by Lrs. and Ors.,

(2003) 1 SCC 123]. Mere inconvenience or some hardship has not

been accepted as a relevant consideration for giving different

meaning      to   the   provision   which   otherwise   is   clear   and

unambiguous on its plain reading.           Limitation is a statute of

repose.     It ordinarily bars a remedy, but does not extinguish a

right.    Ordinarily, the words of a statute have to be given their

strict grammatical meaning and equitable considerations are out

of place, particularly in provisions of law limiting the period of

limitation for filing suits or legal proceedings. <a href="/doc/979839/" id="a_255">In General Accident

and Life Assurance Corporation Ltd. v. Janmahomed Abdul Rahim</a>,

AIR 1941 PC 6, the Supreme Court held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">         "A limitation Act ought to receive such a construction as
         the language in its plain meaning imports...... Great
         hardship may occasionally be caused by statutes of
         limitation in cases of poverty, distress and ignorance of
         rights, yet the statutory rules must be enforced according
         to their ordinary meaning in these and other like cases."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_90">32. The provisions providing for period of limitation cannot be so

liberally construed so as to not only deprive the right to other


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                                                      38</span>
 party to whom a benefit has accrued, but even frustrate the very

purpose of such provision. In the case of <a href="/doc/1650758/" id="a_256">P.K. Ramachandran v.

State of Kerala &amp; another</a>, AIR 1998 SC 2276, the Supreme Court

held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">       "6. Law of limitation may harshly affect a particular
      party but it has to be applied with all its rigour when the
      statute so prescribe and the Courts have no power to
      extend the period of limitation on equitable grounds. The
      discretion exercised by the High Court was, thus, neither
      proper nor judicious. The order condoning the delay
      cannot be sustained. This appeal, therefore, succeeds
      and the impugned order is set aside. Consequently, the
      application for condonation of delay filed in the High
      Court would stand rejected and the Miscellaneous First
      Appeal shall stand dismissed as barred by time. No
      costs."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_91">33. Normally, the statutory period of limitation provided in a

provision like under the NGT Act, is un-extendable by recourse to

provisions of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_257">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act. While applying the

provisions of limitation, besides applying the rule of strict

construction, the Tribunal has to keep a balance between rival

rights of the parties; appellant who has lost his right or whose

remedy is barred by time and other to whom a benefit has

accrued as a result of loss of right of the first. At this stage, it

may be appropriate to make reference to a recent judgment of the

Supreme Court, in the case of Esha Bhattacharjee v. Managing

Committee of Raghunathpur Nafar Academy and others, Civil

Appeal Nos. 8183-8184 of 2013 (Arising out of SLP (C) Nos.

24868-24869 of 2011), where the Court was primarily concerned

with the condonation of delay in filing an appeal. The Court


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                                    39</span>
 adverted itself towards the respective rights and obligations of the

parties and held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">      "26. The law of limitation is a substantive law and has
      definite consequences on the right and obligation of a
      party to arise. These principles should be adhered to and
      applied appropriately depending on the facts and
      circumstances of a given case. Once a valuable right has
      accrued in favour of one party as a result of the failure of
      the other party to explain the delay by showing sufficient
      cause and its own conduct, it will be unreasonable to
      take away that right on the mere asking of the applicant,
      particularly when the delay is directly a result of
      negligence, default or inaction of that party. Justice must
      be done to both parties equally. Then alone the ends of
      justice can be achieved. If a party has been thoroughly
      negligent in implementing its rights and remedies, it will
      be equally unfair to deprive the other party of a valuable
      right that has accrued to it in law as a result of his acting
      vigilantly.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">      vii) The concept of liberal approach has to encapsule
      the conception of reasonableness and it cannot be
      allowed a totally unfettered free play."</blockquote><p id="p_92">


</p><p id="p_93">     In light of these principles, the contention of the appellant

that the National Green Tribunal is the forum to which first

appeal is provided against the orders specified in Section 16 of the

NGT Act and that these provisions should be construed liberally,

can hardly be accepted. Also there is no question of depravation of

right to appellant. The right of appeal is a statutory right and can

be exercised within the prescribed period of limitation. If a party

chooses to sleep over its right and permits the remedy available to

it to become barred by time, then it can hardly be heard to

contend that it has lost a valuable right and the result is unjust.

Such interpretation would be a normal corollary of application of

rule of 'plain construction'. This would be in line with the object

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                                      40</span>
 and purpose of the Act and would also subserve the cause of

justice. This interpretation would not preclude any litigant from

taking recourse to an appropriate remedy prescribed in the Act

and in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_94">
</p><p id="p_95">34. The provisions of Section 16 of the NGT Act do not admit of

any ambiguity or absurdity. It clearly provides the period of

limitation and the consequences of default for not filing the appeal

within the prescribed period of limitation. We do not see any

reason to give any other interpretation to the provisions of Section

16 of the NGT Act than the one which the legislature in its

wisdom has expressed in plain and unambiguous terms.


</p><p id="p_96">35. Lastly, we shall deal with the contention of the appellant that

the provisions of Section 16 of the NGT Act prescribing limitation

are 'directory' and not 'mandatory', therefore, rule of 'liberal

construction' would justify recourse to the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_258">Limitation Act</a> in condoning the delay even beyond the prescribed

period of limitation (90 days). In support of such contention,

reference is made to the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_259"> of the

Code</a> of Civil Procedure, 1908, where language para materia to

Section 16 of the NGT Act has been used and has been held to be

'directory' in various cases. To examine the merit of this

contention, it is necessary for us to explain the distinction

between the 'mandatory' and 'directory' in law.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                                  41</span>
</p><p id="p_97"> 36. 'Mandatory' and 'directory' are two parallel expressions

which are incapable of being used synonymously or alternatively

for each other. What is 'mandatory' cannot be 'directory' and vice-

versa. With the development of law, the distinction between these

expressions has become finer but not clearly definite in terms.

Whereas 'mandatory' provisions should be fulfilled and obeyed

exactly, substantial compliance is all that is necessary with the

provisions of a 'directory' enactment. Even the question of

prejudice becomes relevant while examining the distinction

between these two expressions. Describing this distinction in his

book 'Principle of Statutory Interpretation', 13th Edition, 2012

(page 393 to Page 396), Justice G.P. Singh, referring to various

case laws on the subject noticed as follows:

<p id="p_98">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">        "6. MANDATORY AND DIRECTORY PROVISIONS

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_38">         (a)    General

          The study of numerous cases on this topic does not
          lead to formulation of any universal rule except this
          that language alone most often is not decisive, and
          regard must be had to the context, subject-matter
          and object of the statutory provision in question, in
          determining whether the same is mandatory or
          directory.      In an oft-quoted passage LORD
          CAMPBELL said: "No universal rule can be laid down
          as to whether mandatory enactments shall be
          considered directory only or obligatory with an
          implied nullification for disobedience. It is the duty
          of Courts of justice to try to get at the real intention
          of the Legislature by carefully attending to the whole
          scope of the statute to be considered". As approved
          by the Supreme Court; "The question as to whether a
          statute is mandatory or directory depends upon the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                                                     42</span>
 intent of the Legislature and not upon the language
in which the intent is clothed. The meaning and
intention of the Legislature must govern, and these
are to be ascertained not only from the phraseology
of the provision, but also by considering its nature,
its design, and the consequences which would follow
from construing it the one way or the other". "For
ascertaining the real intention of the Legislature",
points out SUBBARAO, J. "the court may consider
inter alia, the nature and design of the statute, and
the consequences which would follow from
construing it the one way or the other; the impact of
other provisions whereby the necessity of complying
with the provisions in question is avoided; the
circumstances, namely, that the statute provides for
a contingency of the non-compliance with the
provisions; the fact that the non-compliance with the
provisions is or is not visited by some penalty; the
serious or the trivial consequences, that flow there
from; and above all, whether the object of the
legislation will be defeated or furthered". If object of
the enactment will be defeated by holding the same
directory, it will be construed as mandatory, whereas
if by holding it mandatory serious general
inconvenience will be created to innocent persons
without very much furthering the object of
enactment, the same will be construed as directory.
</blockquote><p id="p_99">But all this does not mean that the language used is
to be ignored but only that the prima facie inference
of the intention of the Legislature arising from the
words used may be displaced by considering the
nature of the enactment, its design and the
consequences flowing from alternative constructions.
Thus, the use of the words 'as nearly as may be' in
contrast to the words 'at least' will prima facie
indicate a directory requirement, negative words a
mandatory requirement 'may' a directory requirement
and 'shall' a mandatory requirement.

<p id="p_100">
</p><p id="p_101">     If a provision is mandatory an act done in

              the statute."
</p>
<p id="p_102">
</p><p id="p_103">37. One of the most often quoted distinction between a

mandatory and a directory provision is that failure to comply with

a 'directory' provision does not invalidate underlining proceedings

unless complaining party can show serious prejudice, while non-

compliance of 'mandatory' statute would not necessarily require

presence of prejudice. The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1450722/" id="a_260">Hari

Vishnu Kamath v. Syed Ahmad Ishaque and Ors</a>., AIR (1955) SC

233, held "the practical bearing of the distinction between a

provision which is 'mandatory' and one which is 'directory' is that

the former must be strictly observed, while in the case of latter it

is sufficient that it is substantially complied with".


</p><p id="p_104">38. The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/558636/" id="a_261">Fairgrowth Investments

Ltd. v. The Custodian</a>, (2004) 11 SCC 472, was concerned with the

provisions of the Special Courts (Trial of Offences Relating to

Transactions in <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_262">Securities) Act</a>, 1992. <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_263">Section 4(2)</a> of the said Act

to the Supreme Court would lie from any judgment, sentence or

order passed by the Special Court within a period of 30 days from

the date of such judgment or Order. Further, the proviso to

<a href="/doc/541605/" id="a_266">Section 10(3)</a> empowered the Supreme Court to entertain the

that sufficient cause has been shown in filing the appeal

belatedly. <a href="/doc/1602186/" id="a_267">Section 13</a> of the said Act provided that provisions of

the Act would have overriding effect over other laws. In light of

these provisions, the Supreme Court while rejecting the argument

that no penal consequences were provided and that <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_268">Section 4(2)</a>

did not exclude the application of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_269">Limitation

Act</a>, held that under <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_270">Section 4(2)</a>, the Special Court was not

vested with the power to condone the delay and, therefore,

provisions of <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_271">Section 4</a> (2) of the Act could not be said to be

'directory'. The Court held that <a href="/doc/372189/" id="a_272">Section 29</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_273">Limitation Act</a>

did not apply to the proceedings under the special law. The Court

while following the principle stated in Gopal Sardar (supra) held

as under:
</p>
<p id="p_105">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_39">      "9. We are of the view that the provision prescribing a
      time limit for filing a petition for objection under
      <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_274">Section 4(2)</a> of the Act is mandatory in the sense that the
      period prescribed cannot be extended by the Court under
      any inherent jurisdiction of the Special Court. Prescribed
      periods for initiating or taking steps in legal proceedings
      are intended to be abided by, subject to any power
      expressly conferred on the court to condone any delay.
      Thus the Limitation Act 1963 provides for different
      periods of limitation within which suits, appeals and
      applications may be instituted or filed or made as the
      case may be. It also provides for exclusion of time from
      the prescribed periods in certain cases, lays down bases
      for computing the period of limitation prescribed and
      expressly provides for extension of time under
      <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_275">Section 5</a> in respect of certain proceedings. If the periods
      prescribed were not mandatory, it was not necessary to

intent and understand the language of the provisions. It is

      <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_287">Section 5</a> ? If it does, then <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_288">Section 5</a> cannot be availed of
      by the appellant for condonation of the delay. Sub-
      section (3) in so many terms says that the Regional
      Transport Authority may condone the delay in making of
      an application for renewal and entertain it on merits
      provided the delay is of not more than 15 days. This
      clearly means that if the application for renewal is
      beyond time by more than 15 days, the Regional
      Transport Authority shall not be entitled to entertain it,
      or in other words, it shall have no power to condone the
      delay. There is thus an express provision in Sub-section
      (3) that delay in making an application for renewal shall
      be condonable only if it is of not more than 15 days and
      that expressly excludes the applicability of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_289">Section 5</a> in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                                                    48</span>
       cases where an application for renewal is delayed by
      more than 15 days."</blockquote><p id="p_116">

</p><p id="p_117">     The Supreme Court took the view that the provisions of

<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_290">Section 58(2)</a> above expressly excluded the application of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_291">Section

5</a> of the Limitation Act within the provisions of <a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_292">Section 29(2)</a>

thereof. Whenever the Court is called upon to examine whether a

provision of a statute or a rule having statutory force is

'mandatory' or merely 'directory', it can be decided only after

gathering the purpose and object behind such statute, the

scheme of the Act, fall out consequences that might flow from

insisting upon strict observance of a particular provision and its

correlation with the other provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_118">
</p><p id="p_119">45. The purpose and object of the statute is important. The

weighing consequences of holding a provision to be 'mandatory' or

'directory' are of significant relevance. We have already indicated

that the consequences are inbuilt in the language of Section 16 of

the NGT Act and serious civil consequences flow from default in

adhering to the time prescribed therein. Not only that the party

loses the right to prefer an appeal against an order from which it

is aggrieved, but there is a duty cast upon the Tribunal not to

permit filing of the appeal beyond the prescribed period of

limitation.

<p id="p_120">
</p><p id="p_121">46. The Learned Counsel appearing for the appellant relied upon

the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/877414/" id="a_293">Kailash v. Nanhku

and Ors</a>, (2005) 4 SCC 480, to contend that the language used in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                                                 49</span>
 Section 16 of the NGT Act is para materia to the language used in

Order VIII Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 and since the

Supreme Court in this case held Order VIII Rule 1 of the Civil

Procedure Code, 1908, as 'directory', therefore, the provisions of

Section 16 of the NGT Act should be held to be 'directory' by the

Tribunal. Thus, the appellant would be entitled to the benefit of

the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_294">Limitation Act</a> in regard to the condonation

of delay.
</p>
<p id="p_122">
</p><p id="p_123">47. Reliance is also placed upon the judgment of the Supreme

Court in the case of <a href="/doc/342197/" id="a_295">Salem Advocate Bar Association, Tamil Nadu

v. Union of India</a>, (2005) 6 SCC 344. The above contention can be

directed into two distinct sections. Firstly, whether the language

of Order VIII Rule 1<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_296"> of Code</a> of Civil Procedure, 1908 and Section

16 of the NGT Act are para materia and therefore, the provisions

of <a href="/doc/1019641/" id="a_297">Section 16</a> should be held to be directory. Secondly, whether

the judgment of the Supreme Court on facts thereof and for the

reasons recorded therein, have any application to the present

case.
</p>
<p id="p_124">
</p><p id="p_125">48. The language of Order VIII Rule 1<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_298"> of the Code</a> of Civil

Procedure, 1908, cannot by any stretch of imagination be equated

with, much less considered as identical to, the provisions of

Section 16 of the NGT Act. Order VIII Rule 1 relates to a

procedural law, while <a href="/doc/1019641/" id="a_299">Section 16</a> is part of substantive law. A bare

reading of Order VIII Rule 1 clearly conveys the intent of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                                                 50</span>
 framers to make the provisions 'directory' and it provides for no

consequences of default therein. Most importantly, it must be

noticed that even if a defendant does not file the written

statement under Order VIII Rule 1, the suit does not come to an

end and the defendant does not lose his right to contest the suit

on questions of law, cross examination of witnesses and even to

lead his own evidences. Order VIII Rule 1 has to be read with

other provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_300"> of Code</a> of Civil Procedure, 1908 which does not

render the default in filing the written statement within the time

prescribed, as of any fatal or serious civil consequences. More so,

the said provision does not even apply to the original side of the

Chartered High Courts, as held by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1570831/" id="a_301">Iridium

India Telecom Ltd. v. Motorola Inc</a>., AIR 2005 SC 514.


</p><p id="p_126">49. In contradistinction thereto, the provision of Section 16 of

the NGT Act is specific, unambiguous and clearly conveys the

legislative intent of making the provisions 'mandatory'. The

provision of Section 16 of the NGT Act, undisputedly has inbuilt

element of consequences. The party loses its right to even

institute an appeal after the prescribed period of limitation and a

duty is cast upon the Tribunal not to permit such institution. As

already stated by us above, the language of <a href="/doc/1019641/" id="a_302">Section 16</a>, by

necessary implication excludes the application of the general law

of limitation. Thus, it cannot be said that the language is para

materia to Order VIII Rule 1 and hence the consequences thereof

should be identical.
</p>
<p id="p_127"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                                                 51</span>
</p><p id="p_128"> 50. The Supreme Court in Kailash Nankhu (supra), while dealing

with the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 clearly stated that the

provision does not deal with the power of the Court and also does

not specifically take away the power of the Court to take the

written statement on record, though filed beyond the time as

provided for. The nature of the provisions contained in Order VIII

Rule 1 is procedural. It is not a part of the substantive law.

Further, the object behind substituting Order VIII Rule 1 in the

present shape is to curb the mischief of unscrupulous defendants

adopting dilatory tactics, delaying the disposal of cases much to

the chagrin of the plaintiffs, approaching the court for quick relief

and also to the serious inconvenience of the court faced with

frequent prayers for adjournments. The object is to expedite the

hearing and not to scuttle the same (paragraph 27 of the

judgment). In paragraph 28 of the judgment, the Supreme Court

further noticed that in an adversarial system, no party should

ordinarily be denied the opportunity of participating in the

process of justice dispensation, unless compelled by express and

specific language of the statute. The provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_303"> of the Code</a> of

Civil Procedure, 1908, or any other procedural enactment ought

not to be construed in a manner which would leave the court

helpless to meet extraordinary situations in order to achieve the

ends of justice.
</p>
<p id="p_129">51. We may also notice here that the Court in Kailash Nankhu

(supra) specifically dealt with the view expressed by the Supreme

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                                                   52</span>
 Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1697375/" id="a_304">Dr. J.J. Merchant and Ors. v. Shrinath

Chaturvedi</a>, (2002) 6 SCC 635, where the Court had taken the

view that proviso to Order VIII Rule 1 should be strictly construed

and adhered to. The Court in the case of Kailash Nankhu (supra)

referred to both <a href="/doc/189381/" id="a_305">Topline Shoes Ltd. v. Corporation Bank</a>, (2002) 6

SCC 33 and Dr. J.J. Merchant (supra). In both these earlier

judgments of the Supreme Court, the Court was concerned with

<a href="/doc/1545556/" id="a_306">Section 13(2)</a> of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which

required the opposite party to a complaint to give his version of

the case within a period of thirty days or such extended period

not exceeding 15 days as may be granted by the District Forum.

This provision was treated by the Court in the case of Dr. J.J.

Merchant (supra) as para materia to Order VIII Rule 1 of the Civil

Procedure Code, 1908. In the case of Topline Shoes Ltd. (supra),

the Court held the same provision as 'directory', while in the case

of J.J. Merchant (supra), it was held to be 'mandatory', which view

in relation to interpretation of Order VIII Rule 1 was treated to be

obiter by the Supreme Court in the case of              Fairgrowth

Investments Ltd. (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_130">
</p><p id="p_131">52. The Supreme Court in the case of Topline Shoes Ltd. (supra),

also took the view that <a href="/doc/1823226/" id="a_307">Section 13(1)(a)</a> of the Consumer

Protection Act, 1986, need not be construed strictly.


</p><p id="p_132">53. From the above discussion, it is clear that provisions of

Order VIII Rule 1<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_308"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure, 1908, do not


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                                                  53</span>
 impose any embargo upon the power of the Court to extend the

time. The provision is in the domain of procedural law and was

held to be 'directory' by the Supreme Court. On the contrary, the

provision of Section 16 of the NGT Act is in unambiguous

language and imposes restriction upon the power of Tribunal to

permit even institution of an appeal beyond the prescribed period.

Besides this and for the reasons afore-recorded, the provision has

to be construed as 'mandatory'.
</p>
<p id="p_133">
</p><p id="p_134">54. Having dealt with the various aspects of this case and the

rival contentions raised on behalf of the respective parties we are

of the considered view that the provisions of Section 16 of the

NGT Act are unexceptionally 'mandatory'. The said provision

clearly conveys the legislative intent of excluding the application

of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_309">Limitation Act</a>, 1963. Further, with

approval we reiterate the view taken by the Tribunal in the cases

referred supra that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to condone

the delay beyond the total period of 90 days provided under

Section 16 of the NGT Act. In fact, the Tribunal cannot permit

even institution of an appeal if there is such a delay.


</p><p id="p_135">55. Accordingly, we hold that the present appeal is barred by

limitation and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to condone the

delay of 104 days as prayed. Resultantly, the application for

condonation of delay is dismissed and appeal does not survive for

consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_136">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                                                 54</span>
</p><p id="p_137"> 56. The appeal and the application are thus dismissed while

leaving the parties to bear their own cost.
