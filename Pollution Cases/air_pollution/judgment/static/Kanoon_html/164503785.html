CC No. 153/01
PS. Hauz Khas

Date : 21.01.2015
                                   ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">       In brief, the facts of the case are that complainant is the resident of
Shahpur jaat and proposed accused M/s East West Linkers is running an
industrial unit at premises no. 241 to 245 Shahpur jaat which is purely a
residential area. The M/s East West Linkers is owned by Smt. Preet Singh.
It is alleged that accused persons are carrying out illegal industrial activity
in the premises without obtaining consent from DPCC or any other
authority. It is further alleged that accused persons are using steam
generator (boiler) in the process which was causing air pollution. It is
further alleged that DPCC had knowledge of this wrong and illegal activity
but did not took any action. Complainant relied upon certified copy of WS
filed in suit no. 466/08 to show this.
</p><p id="p_2">       It is further alleged that the above mentioned generators were used
on roof top without any permission. It is also alleged that ground water is
extracted without permission. It is further alleged that accused persons are
also violating the direction of Hon'ble Supreme Court in MC Mehta V/s
UOI, that "no industrial activity shall be carried out in the non conforming
area". On these facts, complainant wants that accused persons be
summoned for contravention of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_1">section 3</a> and <a href="/doc/75233928/" id="a_2">7</a> of Environment Protection
Act as same are punishable under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_3">section 15</a> of Environment Protection
Act.
</p><p id="p_3">       It is pertinent to note here that cognizance was declined by this court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    Page No. -2-</span>

on the ground that notice has not been served as per provision contained
in the Act, but that order was set aside and revisional court directed this
court to proceed on the facts of the case and decide upon the issue of
cognizance on facts of the case.
</p><p id="p_4">     Thereafter, court took cognizance and complainant produced himself
as witness and deposed that accused no.2 is running a factory at Shahpur
Jat and accused no.1's company           which has its office at Panchsheel
shopping complex. During evidence, complainant proved the notice which
is Ex. CW1/D. He also relied upon WS filed on behalf of DPCC in suit no.
466/08 alongwith inspection report and affidavit of Asst. Environment
Engineer D.K. Shrivastav. During his PSE he deposed on line of his
complaint.
</p><p id="p_5">     After evidence, inquiry was first marked to PS Hauz Khas u/s 202
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Cr.P.C</a>. But on request of complainant, the inquiry was directed to be
conducted by DPCC which is the specialized agency. DPCC filed its report
and its report stated that present complaint is not maintainable as
mandatory notice was not given. It however also admitted that the area
where this generator was running is residential / non conforming area and
the Department of Industries is responsible for taking action against a unit
operating in non-conforming area. It was further reported that all the
industries operating in non conforming areas are required to be closed
down. In the annexure 2, which is request letter written by Environment
Engineer to Commissioner of Industries, it is mentioned that the unit has
MCD license for the activity of storage and sale of readymade garments.
During inspection conducted on 26.02.14, it was found that one steam
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  Page No. -3-</span>

generator for steam pressing is installed at roof top and at the premises,
finishing and packing of garments is being done. It was further found that
two generators were operating at the premises in question. The report is
silent with regard to permission of use of water for the above purpose.
However, during inspection, it was found that no water or air pollution was
being caused and the affluent which are discharged are domestic in nature.
It was also found that no dyeing or bleaching or use of chemical was
observed during inspection.
</p><p id="p_6">     Before deciding as to whether proposed accused persons are
deserved to be summoned , court was required to satisfy itself on
following points :
</p><p id="p_7">  1. Whether this court has jurisdiction to deal with this matter or not ;
</p><p id="p_8">  2. Whether prescribed notice was given or not ;
</p><p id="p_9">  3. Whether ingredients of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_5">section 3</a> and <a href="/doc/75233928/" id="a_6">7</a> are satisfied or not.
     As far as 1st point as to whether this court has jurisdiction to deal
with the present matter. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_7">Environment Act</a> prescribed that court of
Metropolitan Magistrate has jurisdiction to deal with the matter. This court
has territorial jurisdiction of places whether the industry in question is
allegedly being run. However during court proceedings, it was brought to
the notice that there is one circular of Hon'ble High Court accordingly to
which court of Ld. ACMM of Special Act only has power to deal with the
cases under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_8">Environment Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_10">     However, the complainant argued that , that circular is prospective in
nature. He further argued that circular deal with the cases which are
filed by the DPCC and the present matter is filed by the individual after
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  Page No. -4-</span>

giving notice to the DPCC. Perusal of language used in the circular dt.
23.2.2012 shows that it deals with the cases     which are filed by DPCC.   This
complaint is filed by an individual, not by DPCC. Hence this court came
to the conclusion that this court has jurisdiction to try and proceed with
this matter.
</p><p id="p_11">     2nd question which came is before court whether notice was u/s. 19 of
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_9">Environment Protection Act</a> was proper notice. There is bar for the court
to take cognizance of any offence on private complaints except on prior
notice being given as is prescribed under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_10">Environment Protection Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_12">     In the present matter, complainant proved prima facie during his
deposition that he gave notice and revisional court vide order dt.
30.08.2011 has held that notice as valid.
</p><p id="p_13">     3rd question before court was whether the alleged industry is creating
any pollution or not and whether this pollution is exceeding the limit
which is prescribed under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_11">Environment Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_14">     Complainant could not point out what is the prescribed limit of
pollution in the area. In order to       prove that industry was creating
pollution, complainant relied upon inspection report which was filed by
DPCC in suit no. 466/08. However, inspection report is silent regarding
the quantum of pollution and degree of pollution. Without bringing on
record the degree of air pollution, it cannot be said that offence u/s. 7 is
complete. Complainant failed to bring on record any other evidence to
show that pollution which was created by the industry in question was
exceeding the limit which is prescribed by rules. The report on which
reliance has been placed is silent with respect to the degree of pollution.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  Page No. -5-</span>

<p id="p_15">     Further, during inspection , which was carried out by DPCC u/s. 202
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12">CrPC</a>, and it was found that now, industry is not creating any air pollution.
Thus, as complainant failed to bring on record the exact degree of
pollution, it can be said that he failed to prove that        <a href="/doc/75233928/" id="a_13">section 7</a> of
Environment Protection Act is violated.
</p><p id="p_16">     Complainant had also pleaded that action of the proposed accused
also fall within the parameter of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_14">section 3</a> and   which is punishable u/s.
</p><p id="p_17">15. This section shows that Central Govt may make any rule or can do
anything necessary for purpose of securing the effective implementation
of the provisions of this act.
</p><p id="p_18">     He submitted that it has come in report of DPCC that company is
running in non confirming area and in non confirming area, no industry
can run in view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in case
titled as M.C.Mehta v Union of India in WP No. 4677/1985. Perusal of
report filed by the DPCC shows that , this industry is running in non
confirming area in violation of judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court.
</p><p id="p_19">     He submitted that by operating in non confirming area is violation
of judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court and it is also punishable u/s. 21 of
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Air Pollution of Prevention of Pollution Act</a> 1981.
</p><p id="p_20">     The court considered the provisions of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_16">section 3</a> of Environment Act
as well as <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_17">section 21</a> of Air Pollution Prevention Act 1981.
</p><p id="p_21">     As far as proceedings against the accused for offence under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Air
Pollution Prevention Act</a>, there is requirement of giving separate prior
notice to DPCC under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_19">Air Pollution Prevention Act</a> and in absence thereof,
this court cannot take cognizance as contents of that notice is different
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   Page No. -6-</span>

from the notice given under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_20">Environment Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_22">     As far as <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_21">section 3</a> of Environment Act is concerned, <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_22">section 3</a>
empowers the Central Govt to prescribe the area in which running of any
other industries is prohibited or allowed.
</p><p id="p_23">     In M.C.Mehta v Union of India in WP No. 4677/85, Hon'ble
Supreme Court banned the running of industry in non confirming area but
also gave directions to Govt of India to categorize         and identify the
industry which can operate in non confirming area, meaning thereby that
there was not blanket ban for the industries to run in non confirming area.
The Government has permitted certain kind of industry to run in non
confirming area.
</p><p id="p_24">     As per report of DPCC, the area where industry in question is run in
non confirming area, but they cannot take any action &amp; Department of
Industry is responsible for this, they have already requested to Department
of Industry in this regard. As per notification dt. 7th February'2007 of
Central Government for Master Plan 2021, there are 121 industries which
are permitted to operate in non confirming area. Further the additional
conditions under which these 121 industries can operate are that number
of worker should not exceed more than 5 and the electricity load should
not be more than 11KV.
</p><p id="p_25">     In the present case, as per the report of DPCC the number of workers
is around 50 and the electricity load is 150 KV. Further condition is that all
industries   should registered itself. But, as per report of DPCC, no
permission / licence / sanction has been applied for registration except
MCD Licence which is also not for the purpose. Further Environment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   Page No. -7-</span>

<a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_23">Protection Act</a> Rules 1986 prescribe certain condition which every
industry has to follow e.g., one condition is every industry is required to
file the annual pollution report. As the industry is running without
permission or any other kind of approval, it is natural inference these
conditions and rules are also not followed.
</p><p id="p_26">     In the present case, industry is pertaining to readymade garment
finishing. As per list industry w.e.t., readygarment is allowed, but shall
not be doing washing. Further the number of workers shall not exceed 5
and electricity shall not exceed 11 KW which as discussion is above in 50
&amp; 150KW respectively.
</p><p id="p_27">     In view of above discussion it is quite clear that industry in question
is operating in violation of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_24">section 3</a> which is punishable u/s. 15.
</p><p id="p_28">     As per the complaint the owner of industry in question is Smt. Preet
Singh. As per report of DPCC, this is a private limited company, but in its
reports, it is stated that it is being run by Smt. Preet Singh meaning thereby
Smt. Preet Singh is responsible for running and managing the industry.
</p><p id="p_29">     Accordingly, in view of the above discussions, this court find her /
accused no. 1 prima facie liable for violating the <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_25">section 3</a> of Environment
Protection Act, which is punishable u/s. 15 of that Act. Hence, both these
persons shall be summoned on filing of PF &amp; RC to face the trial u/s. 3
read with <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_26">section 15</a> of Environment Protection Act on filing of PF / RC
for 24.4.2015.
