<p id="p_1">SYED SHAH MOHAMMED QUADRI,J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      This  appeal,  by special leave, is from the  judgment
and  order  of	the High Court of Andhra  Pradesh  in  Civil
Revision  Petition  No.134 of 1996 passed on July 29,  1997.
It raises a question of interest, namely, whether a petition
by  a  landlord seeking eviction of a tenant  under  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_1">Section
10(3)(a)(i)(b)</a>	of the A.P.  Act from the demised  building,
let  out under a composite lease for residential as well  as
non-residential purposes, is maintainable?
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The  appellant is the landlady and the respondents are
tenants	 of  premises  bearing D.Nos.19/76-A  and  19/76A-1;
Innespeta,  Rajahmundry	 (hereinafter  referred to  as	"the
demised	 building")  which comprises of a residential and  a
non-residential portion.  She and her husband filed eviction
petition,  R.C.C.No.71 of 1981, on the file of the Principal
District  Munsif-cum-Rent  Controller,	 Rajahmundry,  under
Section	 10(3)(a)(i)(b)	 of  the  Andhra  Pradesh  Buildings
(Lease,	 Rent  and  Eviction) Control Act,  1960  (which  is
referred  to in this judgment as 'the A.P.Act') against	 the
respondents  (the  first respondent is the partnership	firm
and  respondents  2  to 5 are its  partners)  seeking  their
eviction  from	the demised building on the ground  of	bona
fide requirement for the personal residence of their family.
The  respondents  resisted the petition, briefly stated,  on
two  grounds  :	 (i) the lease granted in their favour is  a
composite  lease and as such the petition for their eviction
is  not	 maintainable  and  (ii)   the	requirement  of	 the
appellant is not bona fide.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      The learned Rent Controller recorded the findings that
the  requirement of the appellant is not bona fide and	that
the  eviction petition is not maintainable;  in that view of
the matter, he dismissed the eviction petition.	 The husband
of  the appellant died in the meanwhile.  The appellant then
filed  an  appeal,  R.C.A.No.11/1994,	before	the  learned
Subordinate  Judge,  Rajahmundry,  the	Appellate  Authority
under  the  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_2">A.P.  Act</a>.	By its order dated  27.11.1995,	 the
Appellate  Authority  held  that   the	requirement  of	 the
appellant  was	bona  fide  and the  eviction  petition	 was
maintainable.	Accordingly,  the  Appellate  Authority	 set
aside  the  order  of the Rent Controller  and	allowed	 the
appeal.	  The  respondents  carried   the  matter  in  Civil
Revision  Petition before the High Court of Andhra  Pradesh.
While  confirming  the finding that the requirement  of	 the
appellant  was bona fide, the High Court on the question  of
maintainability,  set  aside  the  order  of  the  Appellate
Authority  holding  that  the	eviction  petition  was	 not
maintainable.	The  revision petition was thus	 allowed  on
29.7.97.   It  is against that order of the High Court,	 the
appellant is in appeal before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      Mr.Sudhir	 Chandra,  learned  senior counsel  for	 the
appellant,  urged  that	 the  building	as  a  whole  is   a
residential one and the purpose for which a portion of it is
used  cannot really change its nature;	therefore, the	High
Court  erred in holding that in respect of a composite lease
for  residential and non-residential purposes, the  eviction
petition  filed for personal occupation of the appellant was
not  maintainable.  On the ground that there is no provision
in the <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_3">A.P.  Act</a> entitling the appellant to seek eviction in
case  of a composite lease, submits the learned counsel, the
appellant  cannot  be rendered remediless and the  statutory
lease cannot be converted into a lease in perpetuity.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      Mr.M.S.Ganesh,   learned	 senior	  counsel  for	 the
respondents,  on  the  other hand, has	submitted  that	 the
building  comprises  of	 two  separate	portions  -  one  is
residential  and  the other non-residential - and  there  is
dichotomy  in  the Act for purposes of eviction	 of  tenants
inasmuch  as  with regard to eviction from  residential	 and
non-residential	 premises  separate  grounds  are  provided;
that  on  the  ground of bona fide personal  requirement  of
residence of the appellant, eviction of non-residential part
of  the building cannot be sought for and as the lease is  a
composite one, no eviction can be ordered even in respect of
residential  part  of  the  building;  the  High  Court	 is,
therefore,  right  in holding that the eviction petition  is
not maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      To  appreciate  the rival contentions of	the  learned
counsel,  it  would  be	 necessary to  notice  the  relevant
provisions of the <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_4">A.P.	Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      <a href="/doc/1743918/" id="a_5">Section  2(iii)</a> defines the term 'building' as follows
:
</p>
<p id="p_9">      "2(iii).	"Building" means any house or hut or part of
a  house or hut, let or to be let separately for residential
or non-residential purposes and includes :-
</p>
<p id="p_10">      (a)  the	gardens, grounds, garages and out-houses  if
any, appurtenant to such house, hut or part of such house or
hut  and  let or to be let along with such house or  hut  or
part of such house or hut;
</p>
<p id="p_11">      (b)  any furniture supplied or any fittings affixed by
the landlord for use in such house or hut or part of a house
or  hut, but does not include a room in a hotel or  boarding
house."
</p>
<p id="p_12">      <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_6">Sections	10</a>,  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_7">12</a>	 and  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_8">13</a> of the	 A.P.	Act  provide
grounds	 for eviction of tenants.  We shall presently  refer
to  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_9">Section  10(3)(a)</a>  with which we are  concerned  in	 the
appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      A	 perusal  of the definition of the  term  'building'
shows  that (a) any house or hut, or (b) part of a house  or
hut,  let  or  to  be  let  separately	for  residential  or
non-residential	 purposes, is a building for purposes of the
Act;   it  takes  in  the   gardens,  grounds,	garages	 and
out-houses,  if any, appurtenant to such house, hut or	part
of  such house or hut and also any furniture supplied or any
fittings  affixed  by the landlord for use in such house  or
hut or part thereof.  However, a room in a hotel or boarding
house is excluded from the meaning of the term 'building'.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      But, if a house/hut is having both residential as well
as  non-  residential  portions which are let  out  together
under  a  composite lease, will it be within the meaning  of
the  term  'building'?	And will it be covered by  the	<a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_10">A.P.
Act</a>?   In  the definition of the term "building" in  <a href="/doc/1743918/" id="a_11">Section
2(iii)</a>	of  the Act, the words "let or to be let  separately
for  residential or non-residential purposes", indicate that
where  any house or hut or parts thereof are let  separately
for residential or non- residential purposes, each part will
be  a building within the meaning of that term.	 It does not
and  cannot  mean  that	 when a residential  portion  and  a
non-residential	 portion  of  a	 building are  let  under  a
composite  lease,  the	whole building as such will  not  be
within	the  meaning of the term 'building' for	 the  simple
reason that a house whether it is wholly residential, wholly
non-residential	  or   partly	  residential	and   partly
non-residential is by definition a 'building'.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      <a href="/doc/1952927/" id="a_12">Section  1(2)(a)(b)</a>  of  the A.P.	 Act  says  that  it
applies	  to   the  cities   of	  Hyderabad,   Secunderabad,
Visakhapatnam,	Vijayawada and to all Municipal Corporations
and  municipalities  in	 the  State of	Andhra	Pradesh	 and
<a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_13">Section	 32</a>  says that the <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_14">A.P.	 Act</a> shall not apply to	 any
building  owned by the Government.  Under <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_15">Section 26</a> of that
Act,  the  Governor  of Andhra Pradesh	has  exempted,	with
effect	from  October  26, 1983, - (1) all buildings  for  a
period	 of  ten  years	 from	the  date  on  which   their
construction is completed and (2) buildings the monthly rent
of  which  exceeds Rs.1,000/-.	The building in question  is
within	the  limits of Municipality of Rajahmundry, thus  it
satisfies  the requirement of <a href="/doc/1952927/" id="a_16">Section 1(2)(a)(b)</a> and neither
<a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_17">Section	 32</a> excludes it from the purview of the Act nor does
it fall under any of the exemptions granted under <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_18">Section 26</a>
of  the	 A.P.	Act.  Now, it cannot be that a	building  is
within	the purview of the <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_19">A.P.	 Act</a> if let out	 exclusively
for  residential purpose or exclusively for  non-residential
purpose	 or  let  out separately in  parts  for	 residential
purpose	 and non-residential purpose but outside its purview
if  let out under a composite lease for residential and non-
residential  purposes.	 To hold so would be to	 defeat	 the
object	of  the	 <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_20">A.P.	Act</a>.  It follows  that	the  demised
building is within the meaning of the term "building" and is
within the ambit of the <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_21">A.P.  Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      With  regard  to	the question of	 maintainability  of
eviction  petition  under  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_22">Section 10(3)(a)(i)</a> of  the	A.P.
Act,  there is no controversy that when a building having  a
residential  and non- residential portions is let separately
to  a person, a petition for eviction of the tenant from the
residential  or non-residential portion or both on the	plea
of  personal  requirement  of  residence or  business  of  a
landlord, as the case may be, is maintainable but there is a
conflict  of  opinion  among various High Courts as  to	 the
maintainability	 of a suit/petition for eviction filed by  a
landlord,  on  the  ground of his  personal  requirement  of
residence,   against   a  tenant   who	is  occupying	both
residential and non-residential portions of a building under
a composite lease.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      Now,  we shall refer to the views expressed by various
High  Courts  on  the  question	  of  maintainability  of  a
suit/petition  filed  on  the ground of bona  fide  personal
requirement  of residence of the landlord for eviction of  a
tenant holding residential and non-residential portions of a
building under a composite lease.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      The  High	 Court of Andhra Pradesh in Ghan  Shyam	 vs.
Laxmi  Narayana	 [1990	(1)  ALT 43];	the  High  Court  of
Rajasthan  in <a href="/doc/714769/" id="a_23">Om Prakash vs.  Smt.Chand Devi</a> [1973 RCR 562];
the  High  Court  of  Madras in	 <a href="/doc/1003648/" id="a_24">Moinuddin  Khan  Sahib	 vs.
Rukmani	 Ammal</a>	[1973  All  India RCJ  311]  and  <a href="/doc/12864/" id="a_25">Tikamchand
Mithalal  Jain vs.  M.R.Narasimhachari</a> [AIR 1981 Madras 21];
the  High  Court  of  Madhya Pradesh  in  Jamna	 Prasad	 vs.
Nandkishore  [1976  MPLJ 28], Panjumal Daulatram  (Firm)  vs
Sakhi Gopal Thakurdin Agrawal [1977 MPLJ 762] and <a href="/doc/156059/" id="a_26">Jagitkumar
vs.  Jagdeeshchandra</a> [AIR 1982 MP 144] took the views that a
suit/petition, under the respective Act, for eviction of the
tenant	  from	 a    premises	  having   residential	 and
non-residential	 accommodation held under a composite lease,
on  the	 ground of personal requirement of residence of	 the
landlord,  is maintainable.  The reasoning is that there are
two   kinds   of  accommodation	   viz.,   residential	 and
non-residential so if an accommodation is primarily used for
residential  purposes it has to be classified as residential
although  a part of it is used for non-residential  purposes
and  vice  versa.   There is also emphasis on  the  dominant
purpose	 of the lease.	However, the contrary view is  taken
in  Dr.Madhusudan Mahuli vs.  Lambu Indira Bai [1987 (2) ALT
504]  by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and in  Gokulchand
vs.   Krishnachandra &amp; Anr.  [1977 All India RCJ 376] by the
High  Court  of Madhya Pradesh on the ground of	 absence  of
specific  provision  in the <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_27">A.P.  Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1407416/" id="a_28">M.P.  Act</a>	 for
eviction of the tenant holding a building having residential
and non-residential portions under a composite lease.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      Apropos  the  discussion, the following  decisions  of
this Court are apposite :
</p>
<p id="p_20">      In  Dr.  Gopal Dass Verma Vs.  Dr.  S.K.	Bhardwaj and
Anr.  [1962 (2) SCR 678], the appellant was the landlord and
the respondent was the tenant of the premises which were let
for  use  as  the  residence  of the  tenant  but  from	 the
inception  of the tenancy, the premises were being used	 for
commercial  purposes also i.e.	for his professional work as
E.N.T.	 Specialist.  The appellant sued the respondent	 for
ejectment,  inter alia, under <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_29">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the  Delhi
and Ajmer Rent Control Act, 1952 (for short 'the <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_30">Delhi Act</a>')
for  his personal requirement of residence.  The trial court
decreed	 the  suit  but	 the Appellate and  the	 High  Court
dismissed  it  on the ground that from the beginning of	 the
tenancy,  a substantial part of the premises was used by the
respondent for his professional work with the consent of the
appellant.  On appeal, this Court held that the premises let
for  residential purposes were being used by the  respondent
with  the  consent of the appellant for commercial  purposes
also  so  it  ceased to be premises let	 for  a	 residential
purpose	 alone and as such the appellant could not eject the
respondent under <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_31">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the Delhi Act.
</p>
<p id="p_21">      <a href="/doc/1539874/" id="a_32">In  S.Sanyal  vs.	 Gian Chand</a> [1968 (1) SCR 536],	 the
predecessor  in	 title	of the respondent let out  the	suit
premises  to the appellant- tenant for her residence and for
running	 a school.  Thereafter, the respondent purchased the
house  and filed a suit under <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_33">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the  Delhi
Act  for  eviction  of the appellant on the ground  that  he
required  the premises bona fide for his own residence.	 The
trial court dismissed the suit.	 On revision, the High Court
held  that a decree for ejectment limited to that portion of
the  house  which was used for residential purposes  by	 the
tenant	 could	be  granted  and   remanded  the  case	 for
demarcating that portion and passing a decree.	On appeal to
this  Court against the order of the High Court, it was held
that  the  contract of tenancy was a single and	 indivisible
contract  and  in the absence of any statutory provision  to
that  effect, it was not open to the Court to divide it into
two  contracts - one of letting out for residential purposes
and  the  other	 for non-residential purposes  for  granting
relief under <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_34">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the Delhi Act in respect of
the  portion  used  for	  residential  purposes.   Following
Dr.Gopal  Dass Verma's case (supra), it was observed that if
in  respect  of	 premises  originally  let  for	 residential
purposes,  a decree for ejectment could not be passed on the
grounds	 mentioned in <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_35">Section 13(1)(e)</a>, if subsequent to the
letting,  with the consent of the landlord, the premises was
used  both for residential and non-residential purposes, the
bar  against  the  jurisdiction of the Court would  be	more
effective  when	 the  original letting was  for	 purposes  -
non-residential	 as well as residential.  It may be recalled
that  the  condition  for invoking <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_36">Section 13(1)(e)</a>  of	 the
Delhi  Act  is that the premises be held by the	 tenant	 for
residential purposes.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      In  Motilal &amp; Anr.  vs.  Nanak Chand &amp; Ors.  [1970 All
India  RCJ 99], the suit-house was let out to the tenant for
residence and for running a school.  The landlord's suit for
ejectment against the tenant filed under <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_37">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of
the  Delhi  Act	 was  dismissed by the trial  court  on	 the
preliminary  issue  of maintainability of the suit  but	 the
District  Judge reversed the decree and remanded the case to
the  trial  court.  The revision against that  order  having
been dismissed by the High Court, an appeal by special leave
was  filed  in	this  Court.  Relying  on  the	judgment  in
S.Sanyal's  case (supra), it was held that as the owner	 let
out the premises to the tenant for residence and for running
a  school, the suit for ejectment on the ground of bona fide
personal  requirement  was not maintainable and it  was	 not
open  to  the  Court  to demarcate  the	 portions  used	 for
residential  and non-residential purposes as the contract of
tenancy	 was  single  and indivisible contract	and  in	 the
absence	 of  a statutory provision, it was not open  to	 the
Court  to divide it into two contracts and grant eviction of
the portion which was used for residential purposes.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      For  appreciating the above noted decisions, it may be
pointed	 out here that though the <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_38">A.P.	Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_39">Tamil	Nadu
Act</a>,  the <a href="/doc/1407416/" id="a_40">M.P.	Act</a>, the Rajasthan Act and the <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_41">Delhi Act</a> are
in  pari materia, yet provisions of these Acts dealing	with
grounds	 of eviction of a tenant for personal requirement of
residence of a landlord are not in haec verba.
</p>
<p id="p_24">      Since  the three cases decided by this Court, referred
to  above, arose under <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_42">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the Delhi Act, it
will be useful to quote that provision here :
</p>
<p id="p_25">      "13(1)(e).  Protection of a tenant against eviction -
</p>
<p id="p_26">      (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in  any other law or any control, no decree or order for the
recovery  of  possession of any premises shall be passed  by
any  court  in	favour of the landlord	against	 any  tenant
(including a tenant whose tenancy is terminated):
</p>
<p id="p_27">      Provided	that nothing in this sub-section shall apply
to  any	 suit  or  other proceeding  for  such	recovery  of
possession if the court is satisfied -
</p>
<p id="p_28">      (e)  that the premises let for a residential  purposes
are  required bona fide by the landlord who is owner of such
premises  for  occupation as a residence for himself or	 his
family and that he has no other suitable accommodation:
</p>
<p id="p_29">      Explanation  -  For  the	 purposes  of  this  clause,
"residential  premises" include any premises which have been
let  for use as a residence are, without the consent of	 the
landlord,   used  incidentally	for   commercial  or   other
purposes;
</p>

<p id="p_30">      A	 perusal  of  this provision reveals  that  the	 ban
imposed	 by  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_43">Section 13(1)</a>, that no decree or order for	 the
recovery  of  possession  of any premises in favour  of	 the
landlord  against  any tenant shall be passed, is lifted  in
case  of  an  owner-landlord  of a premises  who  bona	fide
requires it for occupation as a residence for himself or his
family, provided that the premises was let for a residential
purpose	  and	the   landlord	 has   no   other   suitable
accommodation.	 The explanation makes it clear that if	 the
premises let for residential purposes is used for commercial
purposes  without  the	consent	 of  the  landlord  it	will
continue  to be a residential premises.	 In other words,  if
the  premises let for residential purposes is actually	used
for  commercial	 purposes  but without the  consent  of	 the
landlord,  the landlord can seek the eviction of the  tenant
under  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_44">Section 13(1)(e)</a> as the character of the premises  is
statutorily  retained as a residential premises.  This is so
because	 the <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_45">Delhi Act</a> does not provide for eviction of	 the
tenant	from the premises other than residential premises on
the  ground  of	 bona  fide  requirement  of  the  landlord,
(S.Sanyal's case)(supra).
</p>
<p id="p_31">      It  may be noticed here that the provisions of <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_46">Section
10(3)(a)</a>  of the A.P.  Act and <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_47">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the Delhi
Act  are not in haec verba;  whereas the former provides for
eviction   of	a   tenant   both   from   residential	 and
non-residential	  premises  on	the   ground  of  bona	fide
requirement  of	 the  landlord,	  the  latter  provides	 for
eviction  of  a	 tenant on that ground	from  a	 residential
premises  only and not from a non-residential premises.	 For
this  reason,  the  judgments in  the  aforementioned  cases
decided	 under	<a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_48">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the Delhi Act cannot  be
applied	 to cases arising under <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_49">Section 10(3)(a)</a> of the A.P.
Act  or Section 10(3)(a) of the T.N.  Act which are in	haec
verba.	  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_50">Section  12(e)</a>  and  (f)  of	the  <a href="/doc/1407416/" id="a_51">M.P.   Act</a>	  is
substantially  similar	to the said provisions of  the	<a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_52">A.P.
Act</a>  and the T.N.  Act but Section 13(1)(h) of the Rajasthan
Act  is	 wider than the provisions of the <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_53">A.P.	Act</a> and	 the
T.N.  Act.
</p>
<p id="p_32">      Mr.Sudhir Chandra has further urged that a residential
accommodation  is  one which is suitable for residence	even
with necessary changes and as the tin shade (non-residential
portion)  is not being used for more than a year pursuant to
the orders of the Member Secretary, Andhra Pradesh Pollution
Control	  Board	 under	Air   (Prevention  and	<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_54">Control	  of
Pollution)  Act</a>,  1981 and other authorities  directing	 the
respondents  not  to carry on any manufacturing activity  in
the   residential  area	 and  to   shift  the  same  to	 any
non-residential	 area, so the non-residential portion can be
put  to	 residential use with necessary changes and  indeed,
for  that  purpose  alone,  the eviction of  the  tenant  is
sought;	  therefore, the demised building has to be  treated
as  residential	 and  if so, eviction can  be  ordered.	  In
support	 of his submission, he relied on the observations of
this   Court  in  <a href="/doc/1020200/" id="a_55">Busching   Schmitz  Private  Limited	 vs.
P.T.Menghani  &amp; Anr</a>.  [1977 (2) SCC 835].  In that case, the
landlord  was  the  Government	servant.   He  let  out	 the
building  for  purposes of residence and for business  in  a
portion	 thereof.   He sought eviction of the  tenant  under
<a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_56">Section	 14A(1)</a>	 of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 (59  of
1958).	 That  application was opposed by the tenant on	 the
ground	that what was let out to him was not for residential
purpose	 but  for residential-cum-commercial purposes.	 The
tenant	was, however, refused leave to contest the  petition
under  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_57">Section	25B(4)</a> of the said Act.	 He challenged	that
order  in a writ petition before the High Court of Delhi but
it  was	 dismissed.  On appeal to this Court,  the  question
which arose for consideration was whether the building which
was  let  out  for the	residential-cum-commercial  purposes
remained  a residential building?  It was held that whatever
was  suitable  or  adaptable for residential  use,  even  by
making	some  changes, could be designated  as	'residential
premises'.   Speaking for the Court Krishna Iyer,J., in	 his
inimitable style, observed :
</p>
<p id="p_33">      "Residential premises are not only these which are let
out for residential purposes as the appellant would have it.
Nor  do they cover all kinds of structures where humans	 may
manage	to dwell.  If a beautiful bungalow were let out to a
businessman  to run a show-room or to a meditation group  or
music  society for meditational or musical uses, it  remains
none-  the-less	 a  residential	 accommodation.	  Otherwise,
premises  may one day be residential another day  commercial
and,  on yet a later day, religious.  Use or purpose of	 the
letting is no conclusive test.	Likewise, the fact that many
poor  persons may sleep under bridges or live in large	hume
pipes  or  crawl into verandahs of shops and  bazars  cannot
make  them residential premises.  That is a case of reductio
ad absurdum."
</p>
<p id="p_34">      The  learned counsel for the appellant has also placed
reliance  on  the  following observations of this  Court  in
<a href="/doc/249027/" id="a_58">M/s.Maulavi  Abdur Rub Firoze Ahmed &amp; Co.  vs.	Jay  Krishna
Arora</a> [1976 (1) SCC 295] :
</p>
<p id="p_35">      "The  law does not require that the landlord must need
the  premises for his own occupation only for the purpose to
which  they  were being put by the tenant.  It may  well  be
that  a tenant cannot put the demised premises to any  other
use.   But there is no bar in law in the way of the landlord
requiring   the	 business  premises   for  his	 residential
occupation and vice versa, provided the premises are capable
of  being put to different uses, as they seem to be in	this
case."
</p>
<p id="p_36">      and contended that merely because the tenant was using
the  portion  of the building for non-residential  purposes,
there was no bar in law for the landlord to use the same for
residential purposes.  That case arose under the West Bengal
Premises Tenancy Act, 1956 (12 of 1956).
</p>
<p id="p_37">      It  is true that under the A.P.Act, there is no bar to
convert	 a  non-residential building into a residential	 one
though	<a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_59">Section	 18</a>  mandates that no  residential  building
shall  be converted into a non- residential building  except
with the permission in writing of the Controller.
</p>
<p id="p_38">      We  shall	 now advert to <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_60">Section 10(3)(a)</a> of the	A.P.
Act  under which the instant case arises and it will be	 apt
to quote it here :
</p>
<p id="p_39">      "10(3)(a).   A landlord may subject to the  provisions
of  clause  (d),  apply	 to  the  Controller  for  an  order
directing  the	tenant to put the landlord in possession  of
the building - -
</p>
<p id="p_40">      (i) in case it is a residential building --
</p>
<p id="p_41">      (a)  if  the landlord is not occupying  a	 residential

</p>
<p id="p_43">      (ii) in case it is a non-residential building which is
used  for  the purpose of keeping a vehicle or	adapted	 for

which he is entitled whether under this Act or otherwise;

under this Act or otherwise -
</p>
<p id="p_45">      (a) for the purpose of a business which he is carrying
on, on the date of the application;  or

</p><p id="p_46">      (b) for the purpose of a business which in the opinion
of  the	 Controller  the  landlord  bona  fide	proposes  to
commence :
</p>
<p id="p_47">      Provided	that  a person who becomes a landlord  after
the commencement of the tenancy by an instrument inter vivos
shall  not be entitled to apply under this clause before the
expiry of three months from the date on which the instrument
was registered :
</p>
<p id="p_48">      Provided	further that, where a landlord has  obtained

non-residential	 building,  for possession of  another	non-
residential building of his own."
</p>
<p id="p_51">      The  provisions, extracted above, specify the  grounds
for eviction of a tenant from a residential building as well
as  from  a  non- residential building.	 Sub-clause  (i)  of
clause	(a)  of	 sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_61">Section  10</a>	 deals	with
eviction of a tenant from a 'residential building'.  It says
that  a	 landlord  may apply to the Rent Controller  for  an
order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession
of a residential building on any of the two grounds, namely,
</p><p id="p_52">(a)  if the landlord is not occupying a residential building
of  his	 own in the city, town or village concerned  and  he
requires it for his own occupation;  and (b) if the landlord
who has more buildings than one in the city, town or village
concerned  is in occupation of one such building and he bona
fide   requires	 another  building   instead,  for  his	 own
occupation.  Sub-clause (ii) thereof deals with the eviction
of  a  tenant from a non-residential building which is	used
for  the  purpose of keeping a vehicle or adapted  for	such
use, if the landlord requires it for his own use provided he
is  not	 occupying  any such building in the city,  town  or
village	 concerned which is his own or to the possession  of
which  he  is entitled whether under this Act or  otherwise.
Sub-clause  (iii) thereof furnishes the ground for  eviction
of  a tenant from a non-residential building other than that
falling	 under	sub-clause  (ii);  if the  landlord  is	 not
occupying  a  non-residential building in the city, town  or
village	 concerned which is his own or to the possession  of
which  he  is  entitled under the Act or  otherwise  and  he
requires  it (a) for the purposes of a business which he  is
carrying on, on the date of the application;  or (b) for the
purpose	 of  a	business  which,  in  the  opinion  of	 the
Controller,  the landlord bona fide proposes to commence, he
may  seek  eviction  of the tenant.   These  provisions	 are
subject	 to  two restrictions:	(i) a person who  becomes  a
landlord by an instrument inter vivos after the commencement
of  the	 tenancy cannot apply under that clause	 before	 the
expiry	of three months from the date of registration of the
instrument;   and  (ii)	 where	the  landlord  has  obtained
possession  of a residential building under that clause,  he
will  not be entitled to apply again under it whether he has
obtained  possession of a residential or a non-	 residential
building of his own.
</p>
<p id="p_53">      It  is not necessary to refer to the other  provisions
of <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_62">Section 10</a> for purposes of the present discussion.
</p>
<p id="p_54">      A	 combined  reading  of <a href="/doc/1743918/" id="a_63">Section	2(iii)</a>	and  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_64">Section
10(3)(a)</a>  of the A.P.  Act indicates that when a residential
building  or a non-residential building or parts thereof are
let  separately	 for  residential  and/or  non-	 residential
purposes,  the provisions of <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_65">Section 10(3)(a)</a>, namely,	sub-
clause (i) in case of a residential building and sub-clauses
</p><p id="p_55">(ii) and (iii) in case of a non-residential building, can be
invoked	 and  on the requirements thereof being satisfied  a
landlord  can seek eviction of a tenant therefrom.  However,
there  is  no separate provision under which eviction  of  a
tenant	 can  be  sought  from	 a  building,  having	both
residential  and  non-residential  portions,  held  under  a
composite  lease.  For this reason, the High Court held that
as  the	 demised  building was let out for  residential	 and
non-residential	 purposes  under  a composite lease  to	 the
respondent,  the  eviction petition of the appellant on	 the
ground	of  her	 personal requirement of residence  was	 not
maintainable.	In  the result, the appellant is  placed  in
such  a position that she cannot seek recovery of possession
of  the	 demised  building,  not  even	of  the	 residential
portion,  from	the  respondent	 by  approaching  the	Rent
Controller.   She  cannot  also	 seek  decree  for  eviction
against	 the  respondent on the aforementioned	ground	from
Civil  Court because the building is found to be within	 the
purview	 of  the  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_66">A.P.	 Act</a>.  In such a  situation  is	 she
without	 any  remedy?  The riposte, in our view, is  in	 the
negative.
</p>
<p id="p_56">      There  is nothing in the <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_67">A.P.  Act</a> to suggest that the
right of a landlord like the appellant to recover possession
of  the demised building from the tenant-respondent is taken
away  either expressly or by necessary implication.  Once it
is  held  that	a  building   having  both  residential	 and
non-residential	 portions which are let out together under a
composite  lease  is a building within the meaning  of	that
term and within the ambit of the Act, such a building has to
fall  within one or the other category, namely,	 residential
or  non-residential  - the classification which is  made  in
<a href="/doc/1743918/" id="a_68">Section	 2(iii)</a>	 of the A.P.  Act.  We find it difficult  to
infer  that  the legislature having brought such a  building
within the ambit of the Act and having provided for eviction
of  a  tenant on the ground of personal requirement  of	 the
landlord  from	such  a	 building when it  is  let  out	 for
residential  purposes  or for non- residential	purposes  or
separately  for residential and/or non- residential purposes
and having not taken away the right of the landlord to eject
the  tenant  from  such	 a building left him  in  the  lurch
without	 providing the remedy of eviction of tenant when let
out  under  a  composite  lease.   We  cannot  construe	 the
provisions  of	the  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_69">A.P.   Act</a>	 in  that  way.	  We   have,
therefore,  to discern the remedy under the <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_70">A.P.  Act</a> on the
principle  embodied in the maxim ubi jus ibi remedium.	 The
buildings  under that Act are classified as (i)	 residential
and  (ii) non- residential.  In our view, a building  having
residential  and non- residential portions and let out under
a  composite  lease  has  to  be  categorised  as  either  a
residential  or a non-residential building having regard  to
its  nature,  accommodation,  dominant	 purpose  of  lease,
primary use of the building and other relevant circumstances
on  the	 facts	of each case.  On  such	 determination,	 the
suit/petition  of  the	landlord  has to  be  decided  under
sub-clause (i) or sub-clauses (ii) or (iii) of clause (a) of
<a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_71">Section 10(3)</a> of the A.P Act, as the case may be.  It may be
noticed	 here that under <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_72">Section 10(3)(a)</a> of the A.P.	Act,
the  relief  is granted with reference to the nature of	 the
building  and not with reference to the purpose for which it
is let.
</p>
<p id="p_57">      In  the instant case, it is admitted that the building
comprises  of  two parts - (a) country tiled house used	 for
residential purposes and (b) a L-shape tin shade appurtenant
thereto which is lesser in area than the residential portion
and was being used for manufacturing aluminium vessels.	 The
dominant  purpose  of  the  lease  is  residential  purpose,
non-residential	  activity  being   incidental.	  Now,	some
material  is  sought to be placed on record to show that  no
manufacturing  activity is being carried on in that  portion
pursuant   to	the   orders  of   the	 Member	  Secretary,
A.P.Pollution  Control	Board.	It is not disputed that	 the
demised	  building   is	 in   residential  area	  where	  no
non-residential	 activity  is  permitted to be	carried	 on.
While  respectfully agreeing with the test laid down by this
Court  in Busching Schmitz case (supra), we are of the	view
that  the  portion  of	the demised  building  let  out	 for
non-residential	 purposes can also be adapted with a  little
modification  for residential purposes and indeed the  claim
of  the	 landlord  is to convert the  same  for	 residential
purposes  of  the family.  For all these reasons, we are  of
the  considered	 view  that the demised building has  to  be
treated as a residential building.  If so, the provisions of
<a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_73">Section	 10(3)(a)(i)(b)</a>	 of the A.P.  Act will be  attracted
and  the  eviction petition filed by the appellant  will  be
maintainable.  The impugned order of the High Court, insofar
as it holds that the petition of the appellant under <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_74">Section
10(3)(a)(i)(b)</a> is not maintainable, is accordingly set aside
and  the order of the Appellate Authority dated 27.11.95  is
restored.  We approve the ratio in the judgments of the High
Courts	which  are  in	accord	 with  the  view   expressed
hereinabove by us and overrule the ratio of the judgments of
the  High Courts which have held to the contra.	 Inasmuch as
the  Appellate Authority as well as the High Court have held
that  the requirement for residence of the appellant is bona
fide  and as we have held that the petition of the appellant
filed  under  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_75">Section  10(3)(a)(i)(b)</a> is  maintainable,	 the
appellant  is entitled to a direction to the respondents  to
put  the  appellant-landlord  in possession of	the  demised
building.  The eviction petition, R.C.C.No.71 of 1981 on the
file  of the Principal District Munsif-cum-Rent	 Controller,
Rajahmundry is ordered.	 We grant time to the respondents to
vacate	the demised building and put the  appellant-landlord
