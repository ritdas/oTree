<p id="p_1">            Present petition under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of Code of Criminal

Procedure (for short "the Code") is for quashing of Criminal Complaint

No.2950 dated 24.04.2017 (Annexure P/14) titled Chandigarh Pollution

Control Committee Vs. M/s Som Furniture and another filed              under

<a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_2">Sections 44</a> and <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_3">49</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1986 and    the impugned order, dated          06.09.2017, (Annexure P/15)

therefrom.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.           Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the complaint,

Annexure P/14 and the summoning order, Annexure P/15 are misuse of

the process of law and the same be quashed while invoking the inherent

powers under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">Section 482</a> of the Code. On the ground of maintainability

of the present petition seeking quashing of the complainant, Annexure

P/14 and the summoning order, Annexure P/15, learned counsel for the

petitioner placed reliance upon the judgments of Supreme Court in

Prabhu Chawla Vs. State of Rajasthan and another, 2016 (4) R.C.R.

(Criminal) 270 wherein scope and ambit of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Section 482</a> vis-a-vis <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_12">Section

397</a> of the Code was discussed and Hon`ble Apex Court observed that

powers under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_13">Section 482</a> of the Code begin with a non-obstante clause

and there can be no total ban on the exercise of such course and

jurisdiction. The limitation is self-restraint, nothing more.

</p><p id="p_4">3.           Having considered the matter in its entirety, this Court is of the

considered view that as regards to the maintainability of the petition, there

is no dispute that as per provisions of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_14">Section 482</a> of the Code, the Court

has ample powers to quash the proceedings including filing of complaint

and the summoning order, if the act amounts to mis-carriage of justice.

Such a view was taken by Hon`ble Apex Court in Prabhu Chawla's case

(supra).     In the light of this,   the facts and entire back-ground of the

present case is required to be looked into.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.           As regard to maintainability of the present petition under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_15">Section

482</a> of the Code though, there is no limit on the powers of the Court under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_16">Section 482</a> of the Code, but the more the power, the more due care and

caution is to be exercised in invoking these powers.                 The power of

quashing criminal proceedings should be exercised very sparingly in the

rarest of rare cases. Such a view was taken by Hon`ble Apex Court in

Madhu Limaye Vs. The State of Maharashtra,                        AIR 1978 SC 47,

wherein Hon`ble Supreme Court observed as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "9.             At the outset the following principles may be noticed in

        relation to the exercise of the inherent power of the High Court which

        have been followed ordinarily and generally, almost invariably, barring

        a few exceptions :-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              (1)         That the power is not to be resorted to if there is a
                          specific provision in the Code for the redress of the
                          grievance of the aggrieved party ;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              (2)         That it should be exercised very sparingly to prevent
                          abuse of process of any Court or otherwise to secure the
                          ends of justice;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">              (3)          That it should not be exercised as against the express
                          bar of law engrafted in any other provision of the Code."
</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_5">5.         Law on the point is well settled that at the time of summoning of

accused, the Court is to see prima facie evidence and not to go in the

detailed enquiry. The Court must apply the test as to whether the

uncontroverted allegations as made out from the record of the case and

the documents submitted thereon establish the offence or not. If the Court

has to observe that the matter requires examination of evidence and

material on record to determine whether there is sufficient material on the

basis of which,         the case would end in a conviction,           the Court is

concerned primarily with the allegations taken as a whole whether they

would constitute an offence and if so, is it an abuse of the process of Court

evidence collected, then powers under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_17">Section 482</a> of the Code should not

be exercised and the in the present case, no case is made out to quash

the proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.          Learned counsel for the petitioners has raised certain points

challenging the summoning order and the complaint itself, but certainly, all

these pleas can be taken by way of revision petition before the Court of

Sessions as per law laid down by Hon`ble Supreme Court in Mohit alias

Sonu and another Vs. State of U.P. and another,              2013 (3) R.C.R.

[Criminal] 673, wherein the Apex Court has observed that the petitioners

ought to have challenged the order by way of revision petition under

Section 397 Cr.P.C. and not by invoking inherent jurisdiction of the High

Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.        In view the above, the present petition under Section 482

Cr.P.C., is not maintainable and stands dismissed with liberty to the

petitioners to avail the remedy of filing a revision petition before the Court

of Sessions under Section 397 Cr.P.C.
