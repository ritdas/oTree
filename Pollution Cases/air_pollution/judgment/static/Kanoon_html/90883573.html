<p id="p_22">7.           In the impugned order, in respect of the question 

of jurisdiction, ld. M.M observed that:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">             "As far as 1st point as to whether this Court 
             has   jurisdiction   to   deal   with   the   present 
             matter.   <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_13">Environment   Act</a>   prescribed   that 
             Court   of   Metropolitan   Magistrate   has 
             jurisdiction   to   deal   with   the   matter.   This 
             Court has territorial jurisdiction of places 
             where the industry in question is allegedly 
             being   run.   However   during   Court 
             proceedings,   it   was   brought   to   the   notice 
             that there is one circular of Hon'ble High 
             Court   accordingly   to   which   Court   of   ld. 
             ACMM   of   Special   Act   only   has   power   to 
             deal with the cases under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_14">Environment Act</a>.</blockquote><p id="p_23">


</p><p id="p_24">             However, the complainant argued that, that 
             circular is prospective in nature. He further 
             argued   that   circular   deal   with   the   cases 


Criminal revision  no. 30/2015     17.07.2015                Page no. 8/13
              which   are   filed   by   the   DPCC   and   the 
             present   matter   is   filed   by   the   individual 
             after giving notice to the DPCC. Perusal of 
             language used in the circular dt. 23.02.2012 
             shows that it deals with the cases which are 
             filed by DPCC. This complaint is filed by an 
             individual, not by DPCC. Hence this Court 
             came to the conclusion that this Court has 
             jurisdiction   to   try   and   proceed   with   this 
             matter."
</p>
<p id="p_25">8.           It is clear from the observation of ld. MM that ld. 

M.M accepted the arguments of complainant that the above 

mentioned circular is prospective in nature and is applicable 

only on the cases filed by DPCC. The observation of ld. Trial 

Court in respect of jurisdiction is disputed by ld. counsel for 

petitioners on the ground that the subject of the letter/order 

dated 23.02.2012 itself clarifies that the Special Court of ld. 

ACMM (Special Act) was designed by Hon'ble High Court 

of   Delhi   for   adjudication   of   the   cases   involving   issues   of 

Environment   Pollution   and   Ecological   Destruction   and   in 

essence it includes all the cases either filed by DPCC or by 

way   of   individual   complaint.   Ld.   counsel   for   petitioners 

argued that ld. M.M has misconstrued the letter/order dated 


Criminal revision  no. 30/2015      17.07.2015                 Page no. 9/13
 23.02.2012. The intention behind letter/order could not be to 

create   the   Special   Court   of  ld.  ACMM   only  for  the  cases 

filed   by   DPCC   by   excluding   the   complaints   filed   by   the 

individuals. The contention of ld. counsel for petitioners was 

supported by ld. counsel for respondent no. 2 appearing for 

DPCC. It was submitted by ld. counsel that DPCC is the only 

statutory body which deals with the cases pertaining to the 

pollution in Delhi and he is representing the DPCC's all the 

cases. Ld. counsel also submitted that after letter/order dated 

23.02.2012, all the cases from different Courts of Delhi were 

transferred to the Court of ld. ACMM (Special Act) at Tis 

Hazari   Courts,   Delhi   and   no   case   under   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Pollution   Act</a>   is 

pending in any other Courts in Delhi except the designated 

Court of ld. ACMM. Ld. counsel submitted that letter/order 

dated 23.02.2012 itself indicates that its copy was forwarded 

to all the ld. District Judges of different District Courts of 

Delhi   and   consequently   all   the   cases   pending   in   different 

Court were transferred. Ld. counsel for DPCC also submitted 

that he is representing DPCC in different cases before the 

designated   Court   of   ld.   ACMM   (Special   Act),   Tis   Hazari 

Courts, Delhi.

</p><p id="p_27"> 9.           Respondent   no.   1   (complainant)   put   his 

appearance   before   this   Court   after   receiving   the   notice   of 

criminal revision petition but thereafter he did not appear on 

01.07.2015 and 02.07.2015.
</p>
<p id="p_28">10.            The question of jurisdiction goes to the root of 

the   matter.   Though   under   <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_16">Environment   Act</a>,   ld.   M.M   has 

jurisdiction to take the cognizance of the offence but when a 

Special Court has been created by the order of Hon'ble High 

Court,   no   other   Metropolitan   Magistrate   can   entertain   the 

cases   under   subject   except   the   designated   Court   of   Ld. 

ACMM (Special Act), Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi. In my view, 

ld.   M.M   fell   in   an   error   by   misconstruing   the   letter/order 

dated   23.02.2012   issued   by   Hon'ble   High   Court   of   Delhi. 

From   the   subject   of   letter/order   dated   23.02.2012   and   its 

contents, it cannot be said that Hon'ble High Court intended 

to create Special Court of ld. ACMM (Special Act) only for 

the   cases   filed   by   DPCC   and   permitted   the   individual 

complainant   to   institute   their   cases   at   different   Court 

Complexes.   Moreover,   the   letter/order   dated   23.02.2012 

cannot be interpreted that it was prospective in nature and the 


Criminal revision  no. 30/2015      17.07.2015                Page no. 11/13
 pending cases in different Courts were to be tried in different 

Courts. I find force in the contention of ld. counsel for DPCC 

that   Special   Court   was   created   by Hon'ble   High  Court  of 

Delhi so that all the cases relating to Environment issues may 

be dealt with by one Special Court and individual complaint 

under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_17">Environment Act</a> may be filed only after giving notice 

to the DPCC wherein DPCC is an essential and necessary 

party.   In   my   opinion,   in   view   of   letter/order   dated 

23.02.2012, no other Court of ld. M.M except the Court of ld. 

ACMM   (Special   Act),   Tis   Hazari   Courts,   Delhi   had 

jurisdiction   to   try   the   cases   pertaining   to   the   issues   of 

Environmental Pollution and Ecological Destruction.

</p><p id="p_29">11.           In   view   of   above   observations,   in   my   opinion, 

impugned   order   passed   by   ld.   M.M   is   without   any 

jurisdiction   and   is   liable   to   be   set   aside.   Accordingly,   the 

impugned order dated 21.01.2015 in respect of summoning of 

petitioners (accused persons) is set aside.   In view of above 

observations, I do not deem it appropriate to deal with the 

respective   arguments   on   the   factual   issues   of   the   case. 

Revision petition is accordingly allowed.
