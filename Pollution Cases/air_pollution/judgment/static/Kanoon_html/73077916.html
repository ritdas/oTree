                                              JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">             1.           The Applicants have filed instant Application U/s.

             14(1)(2) and 15 of <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_1">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010

             raising questions relating to unauthorized and unscientific

             burning of tyres which emit smoke containing toxic gases

             and pollutants affecting the environment and human life.

             The Applicants submit that the burning of tyres has now

             become a regular feature in any social and political

             agitation resulting in pollution and environment damage.

             The Applicants claim that though they are not willing to

             blame any individual party or group, but urge that such

             tyre burning, which is environmentally unsafe activity,

             needs to be banned immediately. The Applicants further

             submit that through this Application, they want to raise

             the need of urgent actions to be taken up by the regulatory

             agencies which have been impleaded as Respondents, by

             framing suitable Rules and regulations and also prepare

             mechanism for enforcing the same. The Applicants further

             submit          that     with   the increasing   awareness on   the

             environmental pollution and its adverse effect on the

             human health, it is necessary that such steps are taken on

             priority.            The Applicants also draws the attention that

             there are specific regulations for re-use and re-cycling of

             used tyres, in most of the advanced countries and also,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">(J) Application No.43/2013 (WZ)                                                4</span>
              some developed countries and therefore, plead that India

             being signatory to various International Environmental

             Treaties, suitable regulations in this context are urgently

             required. It is the case of the Applicants that though the

             <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and Air (Prevention

             and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981 has given such powers

             to the regulating agencies, no specific rules or guidelines

             have        been          formulated     by     the    Respondents.           The

             Applicants, therefore, seek following reliefs:

              2014, MPCB has placed on record the report of the said

             Committee.             MPCB submits that after sampling and

             analysis of tyre burning on laboratory scale basis, it has

             been concluded that the tyre burning in open atmosphere

             generates            highly   toxic,   mutagenic   and   hazardous

             emissions, primarily owing to incomplete oxidation and

             therefore, MPCB has recommended the State Government,

             in exercise of the provisions of Sub-section 5 of Section 19

             of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981, to

             issue a Notification prohibiting burning of tyres in the Air

             Pollution Control Area. MPCB has further suggested that

             the Law and Order enforcement Agencies i.e. Police and

             District Administration shall also be directed to take

             appropriate action against such tyre burning under the

             Bombay Police Act,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7"> Criminal Procedure Code</a> etc. The

             MPCB's Affidavit further emphasize that the proper

             solution for minimizing such incidents of burning of tyres

             can be achieved only through creating and implementing a

             system for re-cycling, re-treading and re-using of used

             tyres, more particularly, by adopting "Life Cycle Approach"

             by encouraging and facilitating re-use and re-cycle of tyres.

             The report goes on to discuss various options to re-use and

</p><p id="p_8">             5.          The MPCB i.e. Respondent No.1 in its Affidavit

             dated 11th July 2014 has submitted, after sampling and

             analysis, that tyre burning in open atmosphere generates

             highly         toxic,    mutagenic    and   hazardous      emissions.

             However, the MPCB Affidavit has not dealt with health

             impact of such tyre burning.             The scrap tyres represent

             both a disposal problem and also, resource opportunity

             (For example e.g. as a fuel material replacement, and in

             other Application).            The open tyre burning has been

             reported in the literature to be more toxic and mutagenic.

             The open tyre burning emissions includes "criteria"

             pollutants such as particulates, carbon monoxide (CO),
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">(J) Application No.43/2013 (WZ)                                                  8</span>
              sulfur oxides (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile

             organic compounds (VOCs).                    They also include "non-

             criteria"            hazardous     air   pollutants   (HAPs),     such   as

             polynuclear             aromatic     hydrocarbons       (PAHs),    dioxins,

             furans,          hydrogen        chloride,   benzene,     polychlorinated

             biphenyls (PCBs), and metals such as arsenic, cadmium,

             nickel, zinc, mercury, chromium, and vanadium.                        Both

             criteria and HAP emissions from an open tyre fire can

             represent significant acute (short-term) and chronic (long-

             term) health hazards to nearby residents. Depending on

             the length and degree of exposure, these health impacts

             could include irritation of the skin, eyes, and mucous

             membranes, respiratory effects, central nervous system

             depression, and cancer.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             6.          The piled used tyres can also be a health hazard as

             they become breeding grounds for diseases causing pests

             and can even catch fire. Considering all these aspects, we

             have no hesitation to answer the Issue No.I in the

             Affirmative.

             such as fuel in the Industries, burning for heating

              Vehicles, there is rapid increase in the amount of scrap

             tyres. The large quantity of scrap tyres is posing a serious

             environmental concern for their environmentally sound

             disposal. The main reason for this problem is that used

             tyres are not easily biodegradable. Admittedly, there is no

             system or specific regulations, which will ensure the

             environmentally sound management of the used tyres,

             tracking its journey from generation to the final disposal.

             In the absence of such system, no records are placed

             before this Tribunal about number of used tyres generated

             and its end-use wise disposal.           The Counsel for MPCB

             fairly submits that with the growing awareness about the

             environmental impact of such used material, there is a

             need for some regulations considering the Life Cycle

             Approach for such used tyre management. He, however,

             pleads that such a mechanism needs to be developed at

             National level, similar to Battery rules and also E-waste

             rules       which    have   been   notified   under   <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_8">Environment

             (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 by the MoEF.
</p>
<p id="p_12">             8.          Considering all the above aspects, we are of the

             opinion that there is a need to have a systemic approach to

             deal with the problem of used tyre disposal. This is more

             evident from the submissions of the MPCB that out of 162

             tyre remolding industries, only 55 tyres were registered

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">(J) Application No.43/2013 (WZ)                                             10</span>
              with MPCB which shows that everything is not well in the

             used tyre management. Further, there is no data or even

             approximation account available about total number of

             used          tyres      generated    and     end     uses    thereof.

             Simultaneously, we may also note that the CPCB is

             encouraging use of tyres as fuel for co-processing in

             cement/power/steel Industry subject to provisions of

             necessary Air Pollution Control Systems. Though, the used

             tyre is an opportunity in term of its contents and calorific

             value, there is need to systematically deal with the entire

             issue in a holistic manner based on "Life Cycle Approach",

             considering the pollution potential, tyre generation data,

             technology options, techno-economic viability and social

             implications. We are of the considered opinion that in

             order to formulate such regulation or notifying certain

             approach, it is incumbent that the MPCB shall conduct a

             scientific           study   about   the    used    tyre   generation,

             technologies, viability         and its Life Cycle Assessment in

             order to form its strategy on a long-term basis. Therefore,

             while noting that the present system of used tyre

             management is not environmentally sound, we are of the

             opinion that there is a need of placing an elaborate and

             well defined system in place for environmentally sound tyre

             enforcement agencies to deal with the issues vide their

             record about the status of this proposal at end of the

             Environment Department.                  We are of the opinion that in

             order to deal with the Used Tyre use in category 1, as

             mentioned above, such proposal needs to be expeditiously

             considered and decision needs to be taken in this regard by

             the State Environment Department.                         We expect the

             Secretary, Department of Environment, Maharashtra to

             take a decision on this proposal expeditiously.

</p><p id="p_28">             16.         As regards Used Tyre category 2, we notice that the

             MPCB is competent to restrict such use of used tyres as an

             industrial fuel through its consent management process.

             However, as far as unorganized Industrial sectors like brick

             kiln, small and tiny units are concerned, MPCB and the

             Department of environment have necessary the powers

             conferred upon them under <a href="/doc/195949990/" id="a_21">Section 19(3)</a> of the Air

             (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_22">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981 to restrict

             use of used tyre as fuel by issuing necessary Notification.

</p><p id="p_29">                          Unrestricted use of third category of used tyre can

             also be controlled by the MPCB through the Consent

             Management. However, in order to encourage and facilitate

             the use of used tyres either in category 2 and 3, it is

             necessary to frame suitable guidelines and/or regulations

             as described in above paras.

<p id="p_30">             17.         We, therefore, are of the considered opinion that

             there is an urgent need to regulate the used tyre disposal

             to avoid the environmental problems, on the principles of

             Sustainable development and pre-cautionary principles.

             And therefore, the MPCB need to undertake a scientific

             study         for    Life   Cycle   Assessment   of   Used   tyres   in

             Maharashtra adopting the scientific and analytical tools to

             deal this issue in a holistic manner. Several innovative

             approaches like Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR),

             Advanced Recycling charges (ARC), common facilities, use

             of bar coding etc can be adopted to ensure effective

             collection and disposal of used tyres. We, therefore, direct

             the MPCB to undertake such study in next six (6) months

             and finding shall be shared with the MoEF/CPCB.
