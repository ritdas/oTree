ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 


 

<p id="p_1">1.		The
present appeal under <a href="/doc/1856707/" id="a_1">section 378(4)</a> of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 is directed against the judgment and order of
acquittal dated 31.3.2009 passed by the learned Judicial  Magistrate,
First Class, Hansot in Criminal Case No.529 of 2008 whereby the
respondents-accused has been acquitted of the charges under <a href="/doc/96507/" id="a_2">sections
21(1)(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_3">Section 31</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>,1981. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_2">2.		Brief
facts of the prosecution case are that the accused no.1   M/s. B.R.
Prajapati, his proprietor Mr. B.R. Prajapati was manufacturing bricks
at village Kharach of Hansot Taluka. As per the case of the
complainant, for manufacturing process of brick, clay and husk is
required be used and as per provisions of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_5">Section 21</a> of Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, there is need to
obtain permission of the complainant Board for manufacturing or
establishing such kind of business. But the accused had not obtained
any permission from the Board and continued his business of
manufacturing brick and the accused had violated the provisions of
Act.  On these facts, the complaint was filed  before the Court
against the respondent. At the time of the trial, evidence was led
before the trial Court. The documents were produced and oral evidence
of five witnesses was also recorded by the trial Court and after
considering the oral as well as documentary evidence, the learned
Magistrate has passed the order of acquittal which is impugned in
this appeal. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_3">3.		It
was contended by the learned advocate Mr. Sunil Mehta for the
appellant that the judgment and order of the learned Magistrate is
not proper, legal and it is erroneous. He has also argued that the
learned Magistrate has not considered the evidence of witnesses.  He
has contended that learned Judge ought to have appreciated that as
per notification all the manufacturer of the bricks has required to
take consent of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board under the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Air
Pollution Act</a> and to take effective measures to prevent air pollution
nearby area of the manufacturing unit. Even the appellant has issued
notice under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_8">Section 31A</a> of the Act, give notice, but the respondent
No.1 has continued his activities and violated the notification
issued by the Government of India as well as notice issued by the
G.P.C.B.. Therefore, the order impugned in this appeal passed by the
learned Magistrate requires to be quashed and set aside.
</p> 

 


 

 


 

<p id="p_4">4.		At
the outset, it is required to be noted that the principles which
would govern and regular the hearing of appeal by this  Court against
an order of acquittal passed by the trial Court have been very
succinctly explained by the Apex Court in a catena of decisions. In
the case of <a href="/doc/533881/" id="a_9">M.S.Narayana Menon @ Mani vs. State of Kerala and Anr</a>.
reported in (2006) SCC 39, the Apex Court has narrated about the
powers of the High Court in appeal against the order of acquittal. In
para 54 of the decision, the Apex Court has observed as under: 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_5">"54: In
any event the High Court entertained an appeal treating to be an
appeal against acquittal, it was in fact exercising the revisional
jurisdiction. Even while exercising an appellate power against a
judgment of acquittal, the High Court should have borne in mind the
well settled principles of law that where two views are possible, the
appellate court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal
recorded by the court below."
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_6">5.		Further,
in the case of <a href="/doc/761643/" id="a_10">Chandrappa vs. State of Karnataka</a>, reported in
(2007) 4 SCC 415 the Apex Court laid down the following
principles:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_7"> "42: From
the above decisions, in our considered view, the following general
principles regarding powers of the appellate court while dealing with
an appeal against an order of acquittal emerge:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_8">(1) An
appellate court has full power to review, re-appreciate and
reconsider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_9">(2)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11"> The Code</a> of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no limitation, restriction or condition
on exercise of such power and an appellate court on the evidence
before it may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of act and
of law.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_10">(3) Various
expressions, such as "substantial and compelling reasons",
"good and sufficient grounds", "very strong
circumstances", "distorted conclusions", "glaring
mistakes", etc. are not intended to curtain extensive powers of
an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal. Sych phraseologies
are more in the nature of "flourishes of language" to
emphasis the reluctance of an appellate court to interfere with
acquittal than to curtain he power of the court to review the
evidence and to come to its own conclusion. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_11">(4) An
appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in case of
acquittal, there is double presumption in favour of the accused.
Firstly,the presumption of innocence is available to him under the
fundamental principles of criminal jurisprudence that every person
shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a
competent court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured his
acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is further reinforced,
reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial court.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_12">(5) If two
reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on
record, the appellate court should not disturb the finding of
acquittal recorded by the trial court."
</p> 


 


 

 


 

<p id="p_13">6.		Thus,
it is a settled principle that while exercising appellate power, even
if two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the
evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb the
finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_14">7.		Even
in a recent decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/585040/" id="a_12">State of
Goa, vs. Sanjay Thakran and Anr</a>. reported in (2007)3 SCC 75, the
Court has reiterated the powers of the High Court in such cases. In
para 16 of the said decision the Court has observed as under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_15">  "16.
</p><p id="p_16">From the aforesaid decisions, it is apparent that while exercising
the powers in appeal against the order of acquittal the Court of
appeal would not ordinarily interfere with the order of acquittal
unless the approach of the lower Court is vitiated by some manifest
illegality and the conclusion arrived at would not be arrived at by
any reasonable person and, therefore, the decision is to be
characterised as perverse. Merely because two views are possible, the
Court of appeal would not take the view which would upset the
judgment delivered by the Court below. However, the appellate court
has a power to review the evidence if it is of the view that the
conclusion arrived at by the Court below is perverse and the Court
has committed a manifest error of law and ignored the material
evidence on record. A duty is cast upon the appellate court, in such
circumstances, to re-appreciate the evidence to arrive to a just
decision on the basis of material placed on record to find out
whether any of the accused is connected with the commission of the
crime he is charged with."
</p> 


 


 

 


 

<p id="p_17">8.		Similar
principle has been laid down by the Apex Court in the cases of
<a href="/doc/550589/" id="a_13">State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Ram Veer Singh and Ors</a>., reported in 2007
AIR SCW 5553 and in Girja Prasad (Dead) by <a href="/doc/614758/" id="a_14">LRS vs. State of MP</a>,
reported in 2007 AIR SC 5589. Thus, the powers which this Court
may exercise against an order of acquittal are well settled.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_18">9.		It
is also a settled legal position that in acquittal appeal, the
appellate court is not required to re-write the judgment or to give
fresh reasonings, when the reasons assigned by the Court below are
found to be just and proper. Such principle is laid down by the Apex
Court in the case of <a href="/doc/131360/" id="a_15">State of Karnataka vs. Hemareddy</a>, reported in
AIR 1981 SC 1417, wherein, it is held as under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_19">    "...This
Court has observed in Girija Nandini Devi vs. Bigendra Nandini
Chaudhary (1967) SCR 93; (AIR 1967 SC 1124) that it is not the duty
of the appellate court when it agrees with a view of the trial court
on the evidence to repeat the narration of the evidence or to
reiterate the reasons given by the trial court expression of general
agreement with the reasons given by the Court the decision of which
is under appeal, will ordinarily suffice."
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_20">10.		Thus,
in case the appellate court agrees with the reasons and the opinion
given by the lower court, then the discussion of evidence is not
necessary.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_21">11.		I
have gone through the judgment and order passed by the trial court. I
have also perused the oral as well as documentary evidence led before
the trial court and also considered the submissions made by the
learned Advocate for the appellant Board. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_22">		The
evidence of Vinodkumar Keshavlal Prajapati Exhibit 69 and notice at
Exhibit 50 have been examined before the learned trial Court, but
there is no any single evidence to support the version of aforesaid
witness and therefore, the complainant was bound to prove the case
against the accused, but he has failed to prove the case against the
accused. He has to prove that the act which was committed by the
respondent is covered within the meaning of Notification and whether
the area of the said offence of place, is covered withing meaning of
Notification, but he has totally failed these material aspects in his
favour. He has produced newspaper cutting in support of the case, but
that cutting does not have any identification of newspaper, which
newspaper. Besides, for publication of such notice/advertisement,
there is no any evidence for publishing the same in newspaper. I have
also perused <a href="/doc/1775797/" id="a_16">Section 78(2)</a> of the Evidence Act. I have also perused
the judgments delivered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases (1)
 Indian Oxygen Ltd. Vs. The Workman Employed by M/s. Indian Oxyzen
Ltd. reported in AIR 1979 Supreme Court 1196 (2) Laxmi Raj
Shetty and Another Vs. State of Tamil Nadu reported in AIR 1988
Supreme Court 1274 and (3)
Ravindrakumar Sharma V/s. State of Assam and others reported in
AIR 1999 SC 3571 . The Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that
paper cutting evidence cannot be treated as proof of fact. A
newspaper is not one of the document referred to in <a href="/doc/1775797/" id="a_17">Section 78(2)</a> of
the Evidence Act.  The trial court while considering the oral as well
as documentary evidence has clearly observed that the prosecution has
 miserably failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt against
the respondents. Even in the present appeal, nothing is produced or
pointed out to rebut the conclusion of the trial court. Thus, from
the evidence itself, it is established that the prosecution has not
proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_23">12.		In
the above view of the matter, I am of the considered view that the
trial court was completely justified in acquitting the respondent of
the charges levelled against it.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_24">13.		I
find that the findings recorded by the trial court are absolutely
just and proper and in recording the said findings, no illegality or
infirmity has been committed by it.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_25">14.		I
am, therefore, in complete agreement with the findings, ultimate
conclusion and the resultant order of acquittal recorded by the court
below and hence find no reason to interfere with the same. Hence, the
appeal preferred by the appellant Board  is  hereby dismissed. Record
and Proceedings be sent back to the trial court forthwith. Bail
bonds, if any, stand cancelled.
</p>
