</p><p id="p_3">                       2.     Before setting out the points of reference referred by the learned
                       Single Judge, we may set out the background in which the said questions
                       of law have been referred for the decision of this Court. The applicant
                       No.1 is a firm engaged in the business of mining and minerals. Applicant
                       Nos.2 and 3 are partners. Applicant No.4 is authorized signatory of the
                       firm. The applicant No.1 was granted mining lease for a period of 30 years
                       in respect of Khasra No.412 admeasuring 20.65 hectares and Khasra
                       No.426 admeasuring 6.40 hectares, total 27.05 hectares situated in Patwari
                       Halka No.90 of Tehsil Sihora, District Jabalpur for extraction of Laterite,
                       Iron Ore and Blue Dust. A complaint was filed on behalf of the respondent
                       M.P. Pollution Control Board, (hereinafter referred to as "the Board") by
                       Shri D.V.S. Jatav, Scientist, a Class II Officer of the Board working in the
                       Regional Office of the Board in Jabalpur before the J.M.F.C., Sihora on
                       13.11.2011, with the allegation of commission of the offences by the
                       applicants. On that complaint learned JMFC took cognizance against the
                       applicants for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Sections 21</a>, <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_4">37</a>, <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_5">39</a> of the Air
                       (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter referred as to
                       "the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a>") and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_8">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_9">44</a>, <a href="/doc/1790820/" id="a_10">45A</a> of the Water (Prevention and
                       <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereafter referred as to "the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">Water Act</a>")
                       and registered Criminal Case No.800/2011. Being aggrieved from that
                       order, applicants filed M.Cr.C. No.10573/2017 before the High Court.
                       During the hearing of the petition applicants apart from other grounds also
                       raised an objection before the learned Single Judge that the complaint has
                       been filed by D.V.S. Jatav, II Class Officer with his own signature, while
                       the Board vide its resolution dated 04/06/2007 published in M.P. State
                       Gazette dated 20/06/2008 has not given the power to sign the complaint to
                       its Class II Officer, hence the complaint is not tenable.
</p><p id="p_4">                       3.     In this regard, learned counsel for the applicants also placed reliance
                       on the judgments passed by learned Single Bench of this Court in
                       M.Cr.C.Nos. 22745/2016 &amp; 22746/2016 (M/s Anand Mining Corporation
                       &amp; Others Vs. M.P. Pollution Control Board decided on 09/05/2018) and

                       M.Cr.C. Nos.6500/2017 &amp; 6508/2017 (M/s Nirmala Minerals Vs. M.P.
                       Pollution Control Board decided on 09/05/2018). In which learned Single
                       Judge on relying the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court passed in the case of
                       P. Pramila &amp; Others Vs. State of Karnataka &amp; Others, 2015 (17) SCC
                       651 held that a bare perusal of the notification dated 20/06/2008 leaves no
                       iota of doubt that the respondent Board has conferred the authority of
                       affixing signatures on the complaint on the Chairman, Pollution Control
                       Board, Member Secretary and all the Regional Pollution Control Officers.
                       However, in the year 2007, it was resolved by the respondent Board that in
                       order to ensure swift disposal of cases, the Class II Officers after due
                       approval from the Regional Officer can present the complaint before the
                       competent Court. But, the authority to affix signatures on the complaint
                       has not been conferred upon the Class II Officer of the Board, therefore, it
                       can be safely concluded that according to the Notification dated
                       20/06/2008, an act of affixing signatures on the complaint and
                       presentation/filing of the same before the Court are two independent,
                       separate and mutually exclusive actions and one action is not inclusive of
                       other and quashed the complaint holding that in view of the aforesaid it is
                       clear that the Court below committed error in taking cognizance of the
                       complaint when the same bears signature of an officer having no
                       authorization to do so. On doubting above findings learned Single Bench
                       of this Court referred the matter on the point as mentioned above.
</p><p id="p_5">                       4.     Before considering the aforesaid points, it would be better to
                       examine the appropriate provisions of law and the Resolution of the Board
                       by which the Board authorised its Class II Officers posted in the Regional
                       Offices of the Board to file a complaint.
</p><p id="p_6">                       5.     The provisions of <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_13">Section 43</a> of the Air Act reads as thus:-

                       18/04/1991 had authorised its Chairman, Member, Secretary, All Zonal
                       Officers and Regional Officers to file complaints under their own signature
                       in the Courts of Law. The second resolution was passed by the Board in

                       second resolution Board had also published its earlier resolution in the
                       Gazette. So both the resolutions will be read conjointly. Although, the
                       Board vide its second resolution dated 04/07/2007 had also authorized
                       Class II Officers of the Board posted in the Regional Offices in the State to
                       file a complaint in a Court of Law after seeking approval of the Regional
                       Officer, but in that resolution Board had not given power to its Class II
                       Officers posted in the Regional Offices to sign the complaint as earlier
                       given by the Board vide resolution dated 18/04/1991 to its Officers whose
                       name is mentioned in that resolution. Only because the numbers of Zonal
                       Officers and Regional Officers were less in the Department to whom
                       earlier the Board had delegated the power to file the complaints by its
                       earlier notification, so for speedy disposal of the cases in the Courts
                       against the industries, Board by its second resolution had delegated the
                       power of filing complaints before the Court to it's Class II Officers also.
                       But, at the same time the Board by its second resolution did not give the
                       power of signing of the complaint to these officers. So they are not
                       competent to file the complaint by their own signature.
</p><p id="p_12">                       10.    Learned counsel further submitted that in the first resolution the
                       Board apart from filing complaint also authorised its officers whose name
                       was mentioned in that resolution to sign the complaint, while by the
                       second resolution the Board had not authorised their officers to sign the
                       complaint, but only to file the complaint. So the learned Single Judge in
                       M.Cr.C.Nos. 22745/2016 &amp; 22746/2016 (M/s Anand Mining Corporation
                       &amp; Others Vs. M.P. Pollution Control Board decided on 09/05/2018) and
                       M.Cr.C. Nos.6500/2017 &amp; 6508/2017 (M/s Nirmala Minerals Vs. M.P.
                       Pollution Control Board decided on 09/05/2018) has rightly held that the
                       complaint was not tenable because it was not filed with the sign of the
                       officers mentioned in the first resolution dated 18/04/1991 and filed by the
                       Class II Officer of the Board under his sign who was not authorized to sign
                       the complaint.

                       against the orders passed by the learned Single Judge in the above-
                       mentioned cases, which shows that the Board is satisfied from the
                       interpretation and findings as laid down by the learned Single Judge in the
                       above-mentioned petitions. Even learned Single Judge who referred the
                       matter in its order, held that the learned Bench has not considered whether
                       the defect of filing the complaint by the Class II officers under his
                       signature is curable or not, which shows that referral Judge agreed with the
                       view earlier taken by the Coordinate Bench of this Court in the
                       abovementioned petitions that the Class II Officers are not competent to
                       file the complaint on his signature. So, in the instant reference, point for
                       consideration is only that whether the defect where a complaint has been
                       filed by a person under his signature not authorized to sign the complaint,
                       is curable or not ?

                              complaint is distinct from the power to authorise the complaint is
                              not sustainable.The grant of sanction to file a complaint would be in
                              law an authorisation to file the complaint."

                       Scientist, a Class II Officer of the Board filed the complaint against M/s
                       Pacific Exports Ltd. He was authorised by the Board under resolution
                       dated 04/06/2007 to file the complaint. The said officer after getting the
                       approval of the Regional Officer filed the complaint in the Court. So, the
                       Court has rightly taken cognizance of the matter. Learned Single Judge in

                       holding that the Act of affixing signatures on the complaint and filing of
                       the same before the Court are "two independent, separate and mutually
                       exclusive actions and one is not inclusive of the order" and that authority
                       to affix signatures on the complaint had not been conferred upon Class II
                       Officers of the Board. When the Board authorised Class II Officer to file
                       the complaint, it meant they also had the power to sign the complaint.

                       Board agreed with the view earlier taken by the Coordinate Bench of this
                       Court in M.Cr.C. No. 22745/2016, M.Cr.C. No. 22746/2016, M.Cr.C. No.

                       senior counsel appearing on behalf of applicants that the learned Single
                       Judge who has made this reference, as well as the Board, are satisfied from
                       the interpretation and findings as laid down by the learned Single Judge in

                       Water Act reveals that no Court shall take cognizance except on a
                       complaint made by a Board or any officer authorised in this behalf or any
                       person who is given a prior notice of not less than 60 days in the manner
                       prescribed of his intention to make a complaint to the Board or officer
                       authorised as aforesaid. If the complaint is lodged by the State Pollution
                       Control Board itself, there is no need to take any authorisation from
                       anybody. However, where complainant filed by the Chairman or the
                       Member, Secretary or any other officer of the Board, authorisation of the
                       Board is necessary. Board may by general or special order, delegate the
                       power to the Chairman or the Member, Secretary or any other officer of
                       the Board.

                       its earlier resolution dated 18th April 1991 authorised its Chairman,
                       Member, Secretary, all the Zonal Officers, all the Regional Officers to file
                       the complaint under "the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_26">Water Act</a>" &amp; "the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_27">Air Act</a>". Thereafter, by
                       second resolution dated 4th June 2007 the Board in addition to its earlier
                       authorization, also authorised it's all Class II Officers posted in Regional
                       Offices to file the complaint on behalf of the Board for speedy disposal of
                       the cases. Difference between the above two resolutions of the Board is
                       that in the first resolution Board gave absolute power to file the complaint
                       to Chairman, Member, Secretary, all the Zonal Officers, all the Regional
                       Officers, while by the second resolution the Board authorized its Class II
                       Officers posted in Regional Offices to file the complaint with the rider that

                       they would do so only after obtaining the sanction from the Regional
                       Officers. Secondly, in the second resolution the phrase "by their signature"
                       is missing. So it only needs to be seen whether the missing phrase "by their
                       signature" has any effect.

                       match with the present case. In that case Board authorised the Chairman of
                       the Board to file complaint and said Chairman of the Board further
                       delegated that power to another officer, while in this case, the power of
                       filing complaint has not been sub delegated by the Chairman of the Board
                       to any other officer of the Board. Instead, Board itself authorised Class II
                       Officer to file a complaint by its resolution dated 20/06/2008. So that
                       judgment does not assist applicants.

                       "Authority" means the right or permission to act legally on another's behalf,
                       the power of one person to affect another's legal relation by acts done in

                       to the petition, perusal of which shows that the complainant is the Board of
                       course through its Class II Officer. In the very first paragraph of the
                       complaint, it is specifically stated that the complainant is the State Board. If
                       the complainant is the Board, it is the Board, who has filed the complaint
                       through its Class II Officer. It is not that Shri DVS Jatav, Class II Officer of
                       the Board has filed the complaint. Undisputedly, the Board is not a natural
                       person. The Board is a legal entity. Therefore, its resolutions are to be acted
                       upon by some officers of the Board representing it. So, where Board
                       authorised it's Class II Scientist officer to file the complaint, it is only him
                       who shall sign the complaint.

                       complaint under their signature in such a situation? The answer is clear that
                       they could file the complaint by their own signature without the mention of

                       the phrase "by their signature" in the previous resolution dated 18/04/1991.
                       Because, the Board is a legal person, its function will be only through the
                       person who has been authorized to act by it. Where the Board authorised a
                       person to file the complaint on its behalf such authorisation included that he
                       could present a complaint under his signature. Because according to the
                       provisions of <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_32">Section 43</a> of the Air Act and <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_33">Section 49</a> of the Water Act,
                       only authorization is needed. Which shows that the phrase "by their
                       signature" in the first resolution of the Board, is superfluous. So, in the
                       absence of the phrase "by their signature" in the second resolution it can not
                       be said that the Class II Officers of the Board posted in the Regional Offices
                       are not competent to file the complaint under their           signature. In the
                       authorisation "all the Class II Officers posted in regional offices after
                       obtaining sanction from the Regional Officers, are authorized to file the
                       cases before the Court for speedy disposal of the cases against the industries
                       in the Courts" the act of the signing of the complaint is implicit.

                       case of M/s Anand Mining Corporation &amp; Others Vs. M.P. Pollution Control
                       Board (M.Cr.C.Nos. 22745/2016 &amp; 22746/2016 decided on 09/05/2018) and
                       in the case of M/s Nirmala Minerals Vs. M.P. Pollution Control Board
                       (M.Cr.C. Nos.6500/2017 &amp; 6508/2017 decided on 09/05/2018) committed
                       mistake in holding that the Act of affixing signatures on the complaint and
                       filing of the same before the Court are "two independent, separate and
                       mutually exclusive actions and the authority to affix signatures on the
                       complaint had not been conferred upon Class II Officers of the Board and so
                       they were not competent to file the complaint under their signature.
</p><p id="p_36">                       31.    Consequently, we hold that the judgments passed in the case of M/s
                       Anand Mining Corporation &amp; Others Vs. M.P. Pollution Control Board
                       (M.Cr.C.Nos. 22745/2016 &amp; 22746/2016 decided on 09/05/2018) and in the
                       case of M/s Nirmala Minerals Vs. M.P. Pollution Control Board (M.Cr.C.
                       Nos.6500/2017 &amp; 6508/2017 decided on 09/05/2018) do not lay down the
                       correct law regarding competency of filing complaint by Class II Officer
                       under his signature and are thus, overruled on the point. We answered the
                       first question of reference that the Class II Officers of the Board are
                       competent to file the complaint under his signature after obtaining sanction
                       from the Regional Officers in the light of resolution of the Board dated 04 th
                       June, 2007 which was notified in the gazette dated 20/06/2008.
</p><p id="p_37">                       32.    There is no need to answer the second question of reference, which
                       has become only academic interest in the light of the answer to the first
                       question of the reference and the decision of that is no longer required for
                       the just decision of this petition.
</p><p id="p_38">                       33.    Matter be placed before learned Single Judge for further
                       consideration.</p><pre id="pre_2">
