     point out that most of the are a of State of Himachal





     Pradesh now stands urbanized, particularly along

     National Highways/State Highways cris scrossing the

     entire State.     The scarcity of water is an issue in





     Himachal Pradesh. Judicial notice can be taken of the

     fact that in another matter, which we are dealing with,

     it has come on record that at least in three districts of

     the   State,    distribution   of    water       through       Public

     Distribution System is below the minimum norms. In



     rural areas, particularly in these districts, distribution

     of water through priv ate tankers is being carried out,




     more so, considering the demand generated on





     account of floating tourist population.

     only request the government to take a decision, after

     holistically factoring the prevalent conditions at the

     ground level.
