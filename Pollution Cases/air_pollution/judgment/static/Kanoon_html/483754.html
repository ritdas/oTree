</p>
<p id="p_11">I.MAHANTY, J.        In this batch of writ petitions, petitioners who have set up Stone
Crushing Units at various places within the State of Orissa have prayed for being
provided with an alternate site by the Orissa Industrial Infrastructural Development
Corporation or any of the State body or authorities on payment of costs and also to
quash the notice of closure issued by the State Pollution Control Board, Orissa and/or to
keep the same in abeyance till alternate site is provided to the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_12">2.      Mr. Y. Das, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner on the outset
submitted that although he had appeared for the petitioners in those batch of writ
petitions, he had no instructions in the matter and sought for the permission of the Court
to address the Court as an amicus curiae. Learned Senior Counsel limited his prayer to
seeking a direction to the State and/or authorities to provide the petitioners with
alternate sites complying with the requirements as stipulated by the State Pollution
Control Board, within a limited period.
</p><p id="p_13">3. Mr. S.P. Mohanty, learned counsel appearing for the State Pollution Control Board,
Orissa vehemently argued that the present writ petitions are not maintainable and ought
to be rejected outright since the issues/contentions raised in the present batch of writ
petitions are covered by earlier judgment of this Court, in W.P(C) No.5503 of 2007 and
others dismissed by judgment dated 27.1.2009. He asserted that most of the petitioners
in this batch had also challenged the notification dated 17/18.7.2002 issued by the
Government of Orissa in the Forest and Environment Department in exercise of power
conferred by Sub-section (i) of <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_2">Section 19</a> of the Air (Prevention and Control of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                               2</span>



<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. The said prayer of the petitioners and others were rejected and the
writ petition was dismissed vide judgment dated 27.1.2009.
</p><p id="p_14">           In this aspect, reliance was placed by the petitioners on a judgment of the
Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/739415/" id="a_4">State of Uttar Pradesh V. Nawab Hussain</a>, AIR 1977
Supreme Court 1680 as well as the judgment of this High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1495591/" id="a_5">Dr. Gyan
Guru Das V. Central Vigilance Commissioner and others</a>, 2008 (Supp.-I) OLR 790 in
order to substantiate his contention that, it is the well settled principle of law that a plea
raised/not raised in the earlier writ petition could not be questioned in a subsequent writ
petition since such consideration is barred by the principle of Constructive Res Judicata.
</p>
<p id="p_15">4.    In the light of the aforesaid submissions and on perusing the pleadings as well as
the documents appended thereto, there is no dispute that the petitioners herein had
challenged the notification issued by the Government of Orissa, declaring the entire
State of Orissa as Air Pollution Control Area vide judgment dated 27.1.2009. A Division
Bench of this Court dismissed W.P.(C) No.16442 of 2005 and a batch of similar cases
and came to uphold the validity of the notification declaring the entire State as Air
Pollution Control Area as well as the "siting criteria" fixed by the State. The Court also
did not find any merit in the prayer of the petitioner to quash the order of sealing the
units and accordingly the batch of writ petitions stand dismissed.
</p><p id="p_16">        After dismissal of the aforesaid batch of writ petitions, the present petitioners once
again have filed the present batch of writ petitions with the prayer as noted hereinabove
and an interim order was passed by the order dated 16.7.2009 directing that till the next
listing of the case, no coercive action shall be taken against the petitioners and this
order has been extended from time to time.
</p><p id="p_17">       At the very outset, in the circumstances as noted hereinabove, we are compelled
to note our absolute concern with the manner in which the petitioners' crushing units
continue to operate in wanton disregard to all cannons of law in the face of the closure
notices issued by the State Pollution Control Board, Orissa as well as the directions of
this High Court.
</p><p id="p_18">5.    The very least that can be said in the present stage is that, the petitioners have
been adopting every means to continue operating their Stone Crushing Units by filing
multifarious petitions from time to time and consequently continue to pollute the air in
the area in which they operating and making the State Pollution Control Board into a
mere spectator.
</p><p id="p_19">6.      These very writ petitioners had filed the earlier batch of writ petitions as noted
hereinabove challenging the notification issued by the State of Orissa declaring entire
State as an Air Pollution Control Area as well as the closure notices issued by the State
Pollution Control Board which were rejected and the writ applications were dismissed.
While the Pollution Control Board, thereafter, attempted to execute the orders of this
Court (upon dismissal of the batch of writ applications), these notices issued in
purported execution or compliance of the direction of this Court, are once again
challenged in the present batch of writ petitions and once again interim orders of no
coercive action are passed against them. This, in our considered view, amounts to a
clear abuse of the process of the Court making it worse by the fact that, blatant violation
of air pollution norms continue unabated till today. Therefore, we find no justifiable legal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                              3</span>



ground to entertain the challenge to the notices of closure issued by the State Pollution
Control Board and hence reject the said prayer and vacate the interim orders.
</p><p id="p_20">7.     Insofar as the prayer of the petitioners seeking a direction to the State and/or
authorities in the State to provide the petitioners with alternate site is concerned, we are
of the considered view that such a prayer ought to be considered favourably, especially,
since not only this crushing units provides a source of livelihood to its owners or
operators but also a source of livelihood to thousands of labourers who work at such
crusher units.
</p><p id="p_21">8.     Therefore, in keeping with the interest of the promoties of such stone crushing
units as well as their workmen, and following the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court Cases in the case of <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_6">M.C. Mehta V. Union of India and another</a>, 1992 (SC) 3
256 as well as the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_7">M.C. Mehta V. Union
of India and others</a>, (1996) 4 Supreme Court Cases 750, we direct as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        (i)    All polluting stone crushing units        which   are   operating without

       forthwith
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (ii) The District Administration as well      as the Police authorities are

       license and permission etc shall be expedited and granted on priority basis.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       (v)      In order to facilitate shifting of the non-compliant and polluting stone
       crushing units, the State is directed to set up a "unified single agency" at the
       district level to act as a nodal agency to sort out all the problems of such
       industries. The single window facility shall be set up in every district within one
       month from today.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       (vi)   Appropriate site shall be identified within existing industrial estates and/or

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">       (vii)   The stone crushing units which relocate in the new industrial estate or
       existing industrial estate shall also be entitled to any incentives which are
       normally extended to new industries in new industrial estate.

              crushing units must

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      (ix) The workmen employed in the stone crushing units shall be entitled to the
      rights and benefits as indicated hereunder:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      (a) The workmen shall have continuity of employment at the new place where the
      industry is shifted. The terms and conditions of their employment shall not be
      altered to their detriment;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">      (b) The period between the closure of the industry and its restart at the place of
      relocation shall be treated as active employment and the workmen shall be paid
      their full wages with continuity of service;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">      (c) All those workmen who agree to shift with the industry shall be given one
      year's wages as "shifting bonus" to help them settle at the new location;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">      (d) The workmen employed in the industries which fail to relocate and the
      workmen who are not willing to shift along with the relocated industries, shall be
      deemed to have been retrenched with effect from 31.08.2010 provided they have
      been in continuous service (as defined in <a href="/doc/288001/" id="a_8">Section 25-B</a> of the Industrial Disputes
      Act, 1947) for not less than one year in the industries concerned before the said
      date. They shall be paid compensation in terms of <a href="/doc/1944207/" id="a_9">Section 25-F(b)</a> of the
      Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. These workmen shall also be paid, in addition, one
      year's wages as additional compensation;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">      (e) The "shifting bonus" and the compensation payable to the workmen in terms
      of this judgment shall be paid by the management on or before 16.9.2010.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">      (f)The gratuity amount payable to any workmen shall be paid in
          addition.
</blockquote><p id="p_22">9.     The direction contained hereinabove shall not be limited to the petitioners in the
present batch of writ petitions but stands extended to all similar non-compliant stone
crushing units operating throughout the State of Orissa as on date. The Industry
Secretary is directed to put out a notice in all local dalies though out the State inviting
applications from stone crushing units requiring relocation and a list shall be prepared of
all stone crushing units who respond to such notice and all such persons duly
verified/identified by the district authorities, shall be entitled to the benefits of the
aforesaid directions as well as must comply with the necessary direction as noted
hereinabove in order to be entitled to the benefits directed hereinabove.
</p><p id="p_23">10.    With the aforesaid observations and directions, we disposed of the writ petitions.
We make it clear that any violation of such directions shall be viewed very seriously by
this Court and we expect that the State Pollution Control Board and all District/Police
Administration adhere to such directions strictly both in letter and spirit and any person
found violating the same shall be dealt in accordance with the provisions of the
Contempt of Court's Act.
