                        Dated this the 10th day of July, 2018

                                        JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Hrishikesh Roy, Ag C.J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">1. The 6th respondent in the writ petition, Smt.P.Thankakutty, has filed this appeal

   to challenge the judgment dated 20.3.2017 in the W.P(C).8619/08. She is the

   wife of K.Sudhakaran, the third respondent in the writ petition, who was the

   proprietor of a flour mill by the name 'Dhanya Floor Mill' at Chowara,

   Neyyattinkara Taluk.       In the writ petition, the challenge is against Ext.P6 order

   of the Air Appellate Authority, Thiruvananthapuram, where the licensee was in

   appeal. That appeal was filed under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_2">Section 31</a> of the Air (Prevention and

   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 , to challenge the Ext.P3 order dated 30.6.2004

   of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, because the consent to operate the

   mill was denied.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2. The appellate authority, under the Ext.P6 order, considered the circumstances

   of the case, but was unable to reach a definite conclusion on the correctness of

   the negative decision. Thus, the impugned order was set aside and the matter

   was remitted back to the Pollution Control Board for fresh disposal, after due

   inspection with notice to the licensee K.Sudhakaran, the third respondent in the

   writ petition.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WA.1256/17                                  2</span><p id="p_5">




</p><p id="p_6">3. Aggrieved by the Ext.P6 decision of the Air Appellate Authority, one K.Sugatha

   Kumari, residing within the neighbourhood of the flour mill, filed the writ

   proceeding and it came to light during the said proceeding that the licensee

   K.Sudhakaran had expired. The learned Judge accordingly said that since the

   licensee had expired, the licence for the flour mill cannot inure to the benefit

   of anyone else, including his wife.    Thus it was observed that if the wife

   intends to operate the flour mill, she cannot do so on the strength of Ext.P6

   order, but will have to apply fresh and obtain licence in her own name as the

   flour mill was being operated exclusively in the name of the third respondent,

   until he died. With such observation, the writ petition was closed, granting

   liberty to the aggrieved party to pursue her remedies in the writ proceeding.

</p><p id="p_7">4. Representing the appellant/6th respondent, Sri.V.V.N.Menon, the learned

   counsel, submits that when the licensee dies, it is normal for the authorities to

   issue licence to the successor in order to enable the family to carry on the

   business.   In this context, Sri.T.Naveen, the learned counsel for the PCB,

   submits that the wife has to apply online for consent of the PCB, but the same

   is not yet done.
</p>
<p id="p_8">5. Reacting to the above projection from the PCB counsel, Sri.V.V.N.Menon, on

   behalf of the appellant as the wife of the original licensee, submits that his

   client will now apply online for the consent of the PCB and he prays for a

   direction that her application be considered on merits by the authority.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WA.1256/17                                3</span>




</p><p id="p_9">6. Having considered the above, direction is issued to the PCB to take a decision

   on merit, after hearing not only the applicant but also the objector, the writ

   petitioner.   Except to this limited extent, we do not interfere with the

   impugned judgment of the learned single Judge.       The writ appeal is thus

   disposed of accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7. The Registry should post W.P(C).3638/17, before the appropriate Bench as per

   roster.
