OWP No. 749 OF 2007    
Mangu Ram and ors   
Petitioners
State and ors
Respondent  
!Mr OP Thakur, Adv. 
^Mr AH Qazi, AAG  

Hon'ble Mr Justice Sunil Hali, Judge
Date: 16.11.2009 
:J U D G M E N T :
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Respondents 7 to 10 who are engaged in the business of manufacturing of carbon
are said to have established the said industry at Thanda Paddar, tehsil and
district Udhampur. Petitioners who are the residents of the area have filed the
present petition seeking a direction to the respondents State authorities for
closing the said industrial units of aforementioned respondents on the ground
that the said Units have resulted in polluting the entire area.
The case as projected by the petitioners is that the said industrial units
firstly manufacture charcoal from cheer timber which is collected from the
nearby forest area. By putting the said timber to fire, the charcoal is prepared
which process results in emitting huge smoke causing air pollution. Thereafter
the said charcoal is used in manufacturing carbon powder by grinding the same
which process also results in polluting the air. It is further stated that the
respondent No. 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">2</span>
7 has also established a Resin and Turpentine industry in the area under the
name and style of M/s Rajindra Resin and Turpentine. It is stated that the resin
collected from the forest area is given heat by using fire wood and the said
process not only emits smoke but also results in foul smell in the area as a
result of which it has become difficult for the persons including the
petitioners to live in the vicinity being the residents of that place where the
industrial units have been installed.
</p><p id="p_2">The further case projected by the petitioners is that the private respondents
have not only set up the industrial units in the area which can be termed as a
residential area but have also installed Generator sets of the capacity of 26.5
KW which result in noise pollution in the area. It is stated that the houses of
the petitioners as also other persons who reside in the said area are about 300
to 400 ft. away from the industrial units of these private respondents, and
therefore, it has become difficult for them to live in the area. It is stated
that the industrial units set up in the area are being run without the requisite
permission from the authorities concerned which is necessary under the
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986. It is further stated that number of
representations have been made to the authorities concerned from time to time
but no action has been taken in this regard by the said authorities.
Respondents 7 to to 10 in their objections
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">3</span>
have stated that so far as the units installed by respondent Nos. 7 and 8 are
concerned, the same are nonfunctional due to nonavailability of the required raw
material in the shape of Chir Charcoal either from the Forest department or from
the open market.It is stated that the units otherwise have been established in
the Industrial estate, Udhampur, which was totally isolated from human
inhabitation but the petitioners without obtaining any permission from the
concerned authorities have constructed their houses for residential purposes in
the said vicinity over the agriculture land and the answering respondents who
have obtained the requisite permission for establishing their units should not
be made to suffer. It is stated that the respondentUnits are registered with the
District Industries Centre, Udhampur, for putting up their respective units with
the approved trade of industrial productivity. It is further stated that the
establishment of the industrial units of the answering respondents are in the
interest of public at large also because it has generated employment avenues for
the people of Udhampur. 
</p><p id="p_3">So far as industrial unit of respondent No.9 is concerned, it is stated that the
said respondent has obtained no objection from the Principal Chief Conservator
of Forest, J&amp;K Government vide No. PCCI/Lease/NOC/U/25155 dt. 31stst of Jan'02, 
for carrying on the business of manufacturing activated Carbon. The said
respondent is also said to have applied to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">4</span>
District Officer, Pollution Control Board, Udhampur , who has forwarded the case
to the office of Regional Director, State Pollution Control Board, Jammu, for
requisite no objection. It is thus submitted that the industrial units have been
established taking due care and caution so far as installing pollution devices
is concerned so that there is no air pollution in the area.
When this matter was taken up on 20thth of Sept'07, this court directed District
Magistrate, Udhampur, for filing status report in respect of the industrial
units of the private respondents 7 to 10. In pursuance to the aforementioned
order, the District Magistrate concerned has filed the status report dt. 19thth
of Oct'07, stating therein that all the three factories mention of which has
been made in the writ petition are being run by Sh RK Guptarespondent No.10. So
far as Rajinder Rosin &amp; Turpentine Industry is concerned, the same is said to be
located in the Industrial Estate, Udhampur, and has been granted the licence for
manufacturing activated Carbon and Pinetar. The said factory is reported to be
closed for the last nine years because of non availability of raw material. So
far as No objection from the J&amp;K Pollution Control Board is concerned, the same
is said to have been issued by the concerned authority on 24thth of Jan'01,
having validity for the period ending March'01, and thereafter, the same has not
been got renewed due to the reason that the factory is closed. It is, however,
stated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">5</span>
in the report that No Objection from the Forest department has not been obtained
for carrying out the operation in the area.
</p><p id="p_4">So far as industrial units namely M/s Chinar Fine Chemicals and M/s Unique
Industrial Carbon, who have been arrayed as respondents 8 and 9 in the writ
petition are concerned, the said units have been registered with the District
Industries Centre, Udhampur, on 10thth of Feb'94 and 19thth of
March'98,respectively. The unit of M/s Chinar Fine Chemicals is said to be
closed because of non availability of raw material. The Unit is also said to
have obtained No objection from the Pollution Control Board on 23rdrd of
Sept'96, valid upto December'96 only but No Objection is said to have not
obtained from the Forest department. The third Unit namely M/s Unique Industrial
Carbon is said to be functional having permission from the Principal Chief
Conservator of Forests vide its order dt. 31stst of Jan'02. But the Pollution
certificate has not been obtained by the said Unit even though, an application
in this regard is said to have been moved by the concerned proprietor of the
Unit to the office of Regional Director, State Pollution Control Board, Jammu.
It has further been mentioned in the Status report that all the three units are
located well within the boundary of Industrial Estate Udhampur. It is, however,
stated that number of residential houses have been constructed in the vicinity
of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">6</span>
these factories as a result, the inhabitants of the area are facing lot of
difficulty due to health hazard pollutants being emitted on account of operation
of M/s Unique Industrial Carbon Factory as no pollution device has been fitted
to reduce or refine the content of carbon.
</p><p id="p_5">It be seen that there has been an overall development in every aspect of the
human life for which all of us are fully aware and every step of ours is to see
how best we can achieve in order to live a luxurious life but at the same time,
even though, we notice that with the efforts put in by us for overall
development, the quality of our environment is declining day by day. We are
performing no activity to save our environment. Due to increase of air, water
and noise pollution to a great extent every day, there is loss of vegetal cover
and excessive concentration of harmful chemicals in the atmosphere and in food
articles, resulting in environmental threat to human life. In the wake of modern
scientific and technological developments, the relationship between man and the
environment is undergoing profound changes which result in great danger to the
human society. In the United Nations Conference on Human Environment which took  
place at Stockholm in June, 1972, following proclamation was made:
"Man is both creature and moulder of his environment which gives him physical
sustenance 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">7</span>
and affords him the opportunity for intellectual, moral, social and spiritual
growth. In the long and tortuous evolution of the human race on this planet a
stage has been reached when through the rapid acceleration of science and
technology, man has acquired the power to transform his environment in countless
ways and on an unprecedented scale. Both aspects of man's environment, the 
natural and the manmade, are essential to his wellbeing and to the enjoyment of
basic human rightseven the right to life itself.
</p><p id="p_6">2.The protection and improvement of the human environment is a major issue which
affects the well being of peoples and economic development throughout the world;
it is the urgent desire of the people of the whole world and the duty of all
Governments....................
</p><p id="p_7">......................................................................"
It was keeping in view the growing environmental hazards that the Parliament
enacted the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, and also <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">The
Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, which is applicable to the State of J&amp;K
also. In terms of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_4">Section 3</a> of the said Act, the Central Government has the
power to take all such measures as it deems necessary or expedient for the
purpose of protecting and improving the quality of the environment and
preventing, controlling and abating environmental pollution whether it is water,
air or noise pollution.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">8</span>
<p id="p_8"><a href="/doc/68770664/" id="a_5">Section 3(2)</a> deals with the measures which have to be adopted with respect to
the matters enumerated in clauses (i) to (xiv) of the said Section. In terms of
<a href="/doc/27581997/" id="a_6">Section 3(2)(iv)</a>, the Central Government may lay down standards for emission or
discharge of environmental pollutants from various sources whatsoever. In terms
of <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_7">Section 5</a> of the said Act, power can be exercised by the Government with
respect to the closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry, operation or
process or stoppage or regulation of supply of electricity or water or any other
service. In terms of the provisions of the Act of 1986, referred to above, the
State Government has to see as to whether any activity is being carried out by
any industrial unit which leads to polluting the atmosphere and if it is so,
action in terms of <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_8">Section 5</a> of the aforementioned Act has to be taken against
the said unit and this has to be done in order to protect the right to
environment under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_9">Article 21</a> of the Constitution otherwise the purpose of the
Act would be defeated. What has been observed by the Apex Court in this regard
in the case reported as AIR 2004 SC 867, <a href="/doc/1875824/" id="a_10">N.D. Jayal and another v. Union of
India and others</a>, may be noticed as under:"
</p><p id="p_9">To ensure sustainable development is one of the goals of Environmental
Protection Act, 1986 (for short 'the Act) and this is quiet necessary to
guarantee 'right to life' under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_11">Article 21.</a> <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_12">If the Act</a> is not armed with the
powers to ensure sustainable development, it will become a barren shell. In
other words, sustainable development is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">9</span>
one of the means to achieve the object and purpose of the Act as well as the
protection of 'life' under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_13">Article 21.</a> Acknowledgment of this principle will
breath new life into our environmental jurisprudence and constitutional resolve.
Sustainable development could be achieved only by strict compliance of the
directions under the Act. The object and purpose of the Act'to provide for the
protection and improvement of environment' could only be achieved by ensuring
the strict compliance of its directions. The concerned authorities by exercising
its powers under the Act will have to ensure the acquiescence of sustainable
development. Therefore, the directions or conditions put forward by the Act need
to be strictly complied with. Thus the power under the Act cannot be treated as
a power simpliciter, but it is a power coupled with duty. It is the duty of the
State to make sure the fulfilment of conditions or direction under the Act.
Without strict compliance, right to environment under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_14">Article 21</a> could not be
guaranteed and the purpose of the Act will also be defeated. The commitment to
the conditions thereof is an obligation both under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_15">Article 21</a> and under the
Act......"
</p><p id="p_10">In terms of <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_16">Article 48A</a> of the Constitution of India, the State is bound to take
every step for protecting and improving the environment and also to safeguard
the forests and wild life of the country and under <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_17">Article 51A</a>, it is the
fundamental duty of every citizen to protect and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">10</span>
improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life
and to have compassion for living creatures.
</p><p id="p_11">In AIR 2005 SC 3136, In Re:Noise PollutionImplementation of the Laws for
Restricting Use of Loudspeakers and High Volume Producing Sound Systems with    
Forum, Prevention of Env. &amp; <a href="/doc/541057/" id="a_18">Sound Pollution v. UOI and another</a>, the Apex Court
while dealing with the matter involving noise pollution,
observed as under:"
</p><p id="p_12"><a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_19">Article 21</a> of the Constitution guarantees life and personal liberty to all
persons. It is well settled by repeated pronouncements of this Court as also the
High Courts that right to life enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_20">Article 21</a> is not of mere survival
or existence. It guarantees a right of persons to life with human dignity.
Therein are included, all the aspects of life which go to make a person's life
meaningful, complete and worth living. The human life has its charm and there is
no reason why the life should not be enjoyed along with all permissible
pleasures. Anyone who wishes to live in peace, comfort and quiet within his
house has a right to prevent the noise as pollutant reaching him. No one can
claim a right to create noise even in his own premises which would travel beyond
his precincts and cause nuisance to neighbours or others. Any noise which has
the effect of materially interfering with the ordinary comforts of life judged
by the standard of a reasonable man is nuisance. How and when a nuisance created 
by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">11</span>
noise becomes actionable has to be answered by reference to its degree and the
surrounding circumstances, the place and the time."
</p><p id="p_13">There is no doubt that setting up of any industrial unit in any part of State is
of great importance as it leads to generating the revenue as also creates
employment avenues for the local people but at the same time it cannot be at the
cost of degrading the environment, destroying the ecology and posing a health
hazard to the public at large. The State authorities in this regard have to take
every step to ensure that there is a complete environmental protection. An
important role in this regard has to be played by the State Pollution Control
Board, who is to improve the quality of the air and to prevent, control and
abate air pollution in the State.
</p><p id="p_14">As indicated above setting up of an industrial unit is must for the development
of a State but the authorities concerned in this regard have to keep in mind the
principle that such a development is ecologically sustainable as has been held
by the Apex Court in the case reported as AIR 2002 SC 1696, <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_21">M.C. Mehta v. Union 
of India and ors. The</a> observations made in this regard by the Apex Court may be
noticed as under:"
</p><p id="p_15">9.One of the principles underlying environmental law is that of sustainable
development. This principle requires such development to take place which is
ecologically
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">12</span>
sustainable. The two essential features of sustainable development are
</p><p id="p_16">(a) the precautionary principle and
</p><p id="p_17">(b) the polluter pays principle.
</p><p id="p_18">10.The "precautionary principle" was elucidated thus by this Court in <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_22">Vellore
Citizens Welfare Forum v. Union of India and others</a>, (1996) 5 SCC 647, inter
alia, as follows:
</p><p id="p_19">(1) the State Government and the statutory authorities must anticipate, prevent
and attack the causes of environmental degradation.
</p><p id="p_20">(2) Where there are threats of serious and irreversible damage, lack of
scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to
prevent environmental degradation.
</p><p id="p_21">(3) The "onus of proof' is on the actor or the developer to show that his action
is environmentally benign.
</p><p id="p_22">(4) It cannot be gainsaid that permission to use automobiles has environmental
implications, and thus any "auto policy" framed by the Government must,
therefore, of necessity conform to the Constitutional principles as well as
overriding statutory duties cast upon the Government under the EPA.
(5) The "auto policy" must, therefore,
</p><p id="p_23">(a) focus upon measures to "........Anticipate, prevent and attack....." the
cause of environmental degradation in this field.
</p><p id="p_24">(b) in the absence of adequate information,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">13</span>
lean in favour of environmental protection by refusing rather than permitting
activities likely to be detrimental.
</p><p id="p_25">(c) Adopt the "precautionary principle" and thereby ensure that unless and
activity is proved to be environmentally benign in real and practical terms, it
is to be presumed to be environmentally harmful.
</p><p id="p_26">(d) Make informed recommendations which balance the needs of transportation with
the need to protect the environment and reserve the large scale degradation that
has resulted over the years, priority being given to the environment over
economic issues." 
</p><p id="p_27">It is on the basis of above principle emphasised in the above judgments passed
by the Apex Court, the case in hand has to be dealt with. In the present case,
as noticed above, the grievance projected by the petitioners who are the
inhabitants of the area where the respondentindustrial units have been
established, is that by the activity performed by the said units which are
engaged in the business of manufacturing the Carbon, Resin and Turpentine, the
surrounding environment has been polluted due to the smoke and foul smell
emitted from the said units. The status report filed by the District Magistrate
concerned reveals that the respondentUnits are located within the area specified
as Industrial estate. The two industrial units namely Rajinder Rosin &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">14</span>
Turpentine and M/s Chinar Fine Chemical are said to be closed due to non
availability of raw material. It is, however, stated that the No objection from
Pollution Control Board has been obtained by these units for a limited period
and there is no renewal of the same but so far as No objection from the Forest
department is concerned, the same has not been obtained. The third unit namely
M/s Unique Industrial Carbon is in operation but no effort has been made by the
concerned to install pollution control device in the said unit.
The petitioners, on the other hand, by way of objections to the status report
have pleaded that all the three units are in operation to which effect there is
no denial either on the part of respondentUnits or official respondents.
Therefore, how these units are being allowed to run when they have not fulfill
the requisite conditions regarding installation of pollution control devices and
have not obtained necessary permission from the Forest department, is not
understandable. This would lead to nothing but a total remissness on the part of
authorities concerned in the performance of their legal duty.
The other aspect of the matter which can also not be ignored is that the private
respondents have taken a plea that the industrial units set up by them are in
the industrial area but the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">15</span>
petitioners have raised their residential houses over the agricultural land
without any permission which land is adjacent to the industrial estate.
In this regard, the concerned Deputy Commissioner has to look into the matter
and enquire as to whether the residential houses have been constructed over the
agricultural land without permission or not and whether these residential houses
existed on spot prior to the installation of the industrial units are
thereafter. After enquiry, necessary action in accordance with the law has to be
taken by him. But even otherwise, the private respondents who have installed
their units, though, in the industrial area and have been registered with the
concerned District Industries, they cannot escape their liability to set up
these units in accordance with the requirement and other requisite conditions
which are necessary to be complied with before setting up such an industrial
unit so that the hazardous substances are not emitted from these units beyond
the prescribed standards.
</p><p id="p_28">For the reasons mentioned above, this petition is admitted and disposed of with
the following directions:
</p><p id="p_29">1/That the Deputy Commissioner, Udhampur, shall hold an enquiry into the matter,
to see as to whether all the respondentindustrial units are in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">16</span>
functional;
</p><p id="p_30">2/What is the update regarding installation of pollution control devices by the
said units and whether the requisite permission has been granted by the
authorities concerned in the Forest Department and State Pollution Control Board
and whether the norms prescribed for granting such permission have been fully
complied with by the said authorities;
</p><p id="p_31">3/In order to see that the hazardous substances emitted from the said units are
not beyond the prescribed standards, the Deputy Commissioner, Udhampur, with the  
assistance of the authorities concerned in the State Pollution Control Board
shall collect the samples of air, water, soil and other substances for analysis
or test and submit its report to this court within a period of two months from
the date of receipt of a copy of this order;
</p><p id="p_32">4/The Deputy Commissioner, Udhampur, shall also hold an enquiry regarding 
construction of residential houses over the agricultural land near the
industrial units set up by the respondents to see as to whether any permission
in this regard has been obtained by the concerned persons who have raised such
construction and whether this is permitted under rules. The report in this
regard shall also be submitted to this court within the aforementioned period.
The report will indicate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">17</span>
as to how many residential houses have been constructed in the area adjacent to
the said industrial units after the same were established by the respondents;
5/The petitioners as also the private respondents shall be at liberty to
approach the Deputy Commissioner, Udhampur, who shall afford them an opportunity  
of hearing in the matter before submitting his report to this court.
Before parting with this order, it would be apt to mention that it is the
responsibility of every human being to save and improve the natural wealth and
environment in order to make the earth worth living. Taking into consideration
the present scenario and the unnatural resources created by the human being, it
becomes all the more important to use these resources with utmost care and
caution. As said by me, it is the duty of every human being to take initiatives
to protect the environment but more responsibility in this regard lies on the
shoulders of those authorities who are directly linked with the State machinery
to look into such aspects. It is the duty of the said authorities to make the
general public aware about the safety measures which should be adopted for
protecting our environment and the lead role in this regard as stated has to be
played by the different authorities in the Central and State departments.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">18</span>
<p id="p_33">As indicated above, let the report be submitted by the Deputy Commissioner
within the aforementioned period. The writ petition for that purpose shall be
kept alive and listed in the Ist week of Feb'10.
