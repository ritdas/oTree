</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">2.             The ground No.1 raised by the assessee relates to

the disallowance of Rs.5 lacs out of                              total disallowance of

Rs.46,91,849/- made by the Assessing Officer by resort to

provisions of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">section 14A</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">3.             Briefly,       the     facts         of    the     case     are     that    the

assessee had invested an amount of Rs.5038.88 lacs on

31.3.2006 and Rs.4575.77 lacs as on 31.3.2007 in various

equity       funds      having          tax    free        income.              During     the

assessment            proceedings,            the        Assessing       Officer      noticed

that     the    assessee          had         incurred          interest      expenditure.

Accordingly, he held that the provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2">section 14A</a> of

the Income            Tax   Act     were applicable               in     assessee's case.

It    was    observed       that      the      assessee         had      earned      dividend

income of Rs.46,91,849/- during the year.                                  The Assessing

Officer      computed            disallowance              under       Rule     8D    of   the

Income Tax Rules at Rs.65,30,803/-.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">4.             Before the learned CIT (Appeals), it was argued by

the    learned    counsel         for    the    assessee          that    the    assessment

order in question being for assessment year 2007-08, the

provisions       of    Rule      8D     of    the        Income    Tax     Rules     are   not

applicable in view of the ratio of Hon'ble Mumbai High Court

in the case of          Godrej &amp; Boycee Ltd. Vs. DCIT, 328 ITR 81.

The learned CIT (Appeals) noted that similar disallowance was

made        amounting       to      Rs.2,37,67,894/-              in     assessment        year

2008-09, which was deleted by the learned CIT (Appeals).                                     It
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                              3</span>




was     noted   by   the     learned         CIT   (Appeals)         that   during     the

assessment year 2005-06, the assessee had received dividend

income of Rs.25,75,000/- and a disallowance of Rs.2,50,000/-

was made by the Assessing Officer.                        This disallowance was

confirmed by the learned CIT (Appeals).                          On an appeal filed

by the assessee, the Hon'ble I.T.A.T. reduced the disallowance

to Rs.1,25,000/-.            Keeping in view the totality of the facts

and circumstances, the learned CIT (Appeals) found it fair and

reasonable to restrict the disallowance to Rs.5 lacs.


</p><p id="p_10">5.          The learned counsel for the assessee relied upon the

order    of the I.T.A.T. for assessment year 2005-06 and prayed

that a reasonable relief may be given to it.


</p><p id="p_11">6.          On    perusal         of   the    order   of       Hon'ble      I.T.A.T.   for

assessment       year       2005-06      restricting           the    disallowance      to

Rs.1,25,000/-on         a    dividend        income       of    Rs.25,75,000/-,        we

consider it fair and reasonable to restrict the disallowance to

Rs.2.5 lacs on a dividend of Rs.46,91,849/- received by the

assessee this year.           This is in consonance with the fact that

the computation as per Rule 8D of the Income Tax |Rules is

not applicable in the assessment year 2007-08 in view of the

Mandate given        by     the    Mumbai          High    Court      in the    case    of

Godrej &amp; Boycee Ltd. (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">7.          The ground No.2 raised by the assessee relates to

the disallowance of Rs.22,49,634/- out of                            expenses relating

to the payment made to PSEB for laying high power electric

lines.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                     4</span><p id="p_14">




</p><p id="p_15">8.              The facts of the case are that the assessee had paid

Rs.22,49,634/- to PSEB for electric feeder line and claimed

the same as revenue expenditure.                                     The Assessing Officer

holding the said expenses to be capital in nature disallowed

the same.         The learned CIT (Appeals) following the decision of

the Hon'ble Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court in the case of

Sriyansh Industries Ltd., reported in ITA No.277 of 2004,

dated 15.11.2013 dismissed the appeal of the assessee on this

ground.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">9.              Before us, it was brought to our notice that similar

issue was raised in assessee's own case for assessment year

2005-06, whereby while adjudicating the same the Chandigarh

Bench      of      the     Tribunal            in       ITA     No.859/Chd/2012             dated

20.3.2014 set aside the matter to the file of the Assessing

Officer to apply the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Punjab &amp;

Haryana High Court in the case of Sriyansh Industries Ltd.

(supra).        The findings of the I.T.A.T., Chandigarh are at page

&amp; Haryana High Court in the case of             Sriyansh Industries Ltd.

(supra), as directed by the I.T.A.T.         The learned CIT (Appeals)

had the benefit of the directions of the I.T.A.T., as during the

appellate    proceedings,      the   order      was    available    to    him.

However, on perusal of the order of the learned CIT (Appeals),

we see that after quoting the findings of the Hon'ble Punjab &amp;

Haryana High Court in the case of               Sriyansh Industries Ltd.

(supra), he comments as under :
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">      "The issue is squarely covered by the aforesaid decision of the
      Hon'ble P&amp;H High Court. The AO was therefore fully justified in
      treating the expenditure as capital expenditure. The disallowance
      made by the AO is confirmed. This ground of appeal is accordingly
      dismissed."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_21">10.         We do not appreciate the way learned CIT (Appeals)

has   adjudicated     the   issue,    despite    the   directions    of    the

I.T.A.T. (although in a different assessment year).                       It is

incumbent upon the authorities below to bring out the facts of

the assessee, before relying on any of the judgments.                      We,

therefore, restore the issue to the file of the learned CIT

(Appeals), to decide the issue as per the directions given by

the I.T.A.T.      He should bring all the facts on record while

applying the judgment, before reaching to any conclusion.

disallowance of Rs.2,09,58,801/- out of financial expenses

relating to the exempt unit under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">section 80IA</a> of the Act.

</p><p id="p_23">12.         The facts of the case are that the assessee had

claimed     financial        expenses          of    Rs.38,07,84,433/-.                 The

Assessing    Officer    noted       that       no   expenditure         out     of    these

financial expenses had been allocated to the units claiming

deduction    under      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">section      80IA</a>      of   the   Act.      The       Assessing

Officer was of the view that the provisions of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">section 14A</a> of

the Act were applicable to the income on which deduction

under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">section 80IA</a> of the Act was allowable.                            Therefore, the

allocated financial expenses of Rs.2,09,58,801/- to the unit

claiming    deduction        under    <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">section        80IA</a>    of    the     Act.         The

assessee made submissions challenging the said action of the

Assessing    Officer    before      the    learned        CIT (Appeals).               The

learned CIT (Appeals) held that the assessee had not raised

any objection on this issue in his written submissions or in

his grounds of appeal.             Relying on a number of judgments he

held that the assessee is not entitled to deduction under

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">section 80P(2)(d)</a> of the Act after deducting the expenditure

attributable to the earning of such income.                        In this view, he

dismissed the ground raised by the assessee.


</p><p id="p_24">13.         Before     us,    it    was        submitted         that     the        ground

specifically raised before the learned CIT (Appeals) was also

agitated    but   is   not   being    adjudicated           by    the    learned        CIT

(Appeals) in right perspective.             It was argued that no financial

expenses can be attributed to unit claiming deduction under

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">section 80IA</a> of the Act in view of the fact that the separate

books of account for both the units are maintained by the

assessee and books of account have not been rejected by the

this issue to the filed of the learned CIT (Appeals) to give a

proper finding.

</blockquote>

<p id="p_41">22.          Briefly,   the facts of the case are that the assessee

had   paid    an   amount    of   Rs.2.40   crores   as   salary   to   the

Managing Director in addition to commission amounting to

Rs.63,36,283/- and a sitting fee of Rs.8,20,000/-.                 During

the course of assessment proceedings, the Assessing Officer

noted that the remuneration paid to Managing Director in the

year 2006-07 was only Rs.1.20 crores.           He observed that the

turnover of the company had increased only by 9.8% while the

salary had been increased by 100%.               He also noted that

assessee company had not declared the dividend to the share
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                              10</span>




holders or increased the salary of other employees in the top

management by the same amount.                               He pointed out that the

Managing Director and his family members who are specified

persons       under     <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">section      40A(2)(b)</a>          of    the   Act   were    holding

substantial interest in the company and, therefore increase in

the salary was approved by practically family members only.

Keeping in view the aforesaid facts, the Assessing Officer held

that    the    increase       in    salary        by    100%        was   unreasonable.

Accordingly, he held that the increase of 50% in the salary

was    considered        as     reasonable         and       disallowed    the   balance

amount of Rs.60 lacs under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_17">section 40A(2)(b)</a> of the Act.



</p><p id="p_42">23.           Before      the      learned        CIT    (Appeals),       the    assessee

submitted an analysis of turn over, exports and return                             of net

worth as percentage increase for the year ending December,

2002 to March, 2005.               The details of employees, whose salary

had increased more than 70% was also given to the learned

CIT (Appeals).          It was submitted that the remuneration paid

to the Managing Director is duly covered by the provisions of

<a href="/doc/49242/" id="a_18">sections 198</a> and <a href="/doc/784001/" id="a_19">309</a> of the Companies Act.

appeal of assessee stating as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_45">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       7.5            In this regard, the following facts need consideration:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">       ( a ) The person to whom salary under reference has been paid is
       Managing Director of the company and is the main person
       managing all the business affairs of the company.

<p id="p_46">(b)   As   mentioned   in   the   assessment order   on   page   27,
performance of the company in various areas of performance
indicators has increased in range of 34% to 123% between the
period December, 2002 to March 2005.
</p>
<p id="p_47">(c) The company is a Public Limited Company i.e Company in
which Public is substantially interested and its shares are listed
on stock exchange.
</p>
<p id="p_48">(d) Remuneration paid to the Managing Director was duly
approved by the Board of the Directors and share holders of the
company.
</p>
<p id="p_49">(e) As per the details filed by the appellant (Annexure - 1 to this
order) there are large numbers of employees whose
remuneration has increased by 100% or more during the period
2002-05.
</p>
<p id="p_50">
7.6 Keeping in view the aforesaid facts, it cannot be said that
the remuneration paid to Managing Director during the year was
excessive. Even otherwise, as referred to in Para 7.3 above, for
the purpose of <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_20">section 40A(2)(a)</a>, whether the expenditure is
excessive or reasonable has- to be seen with respect to the fair
market value of the facilities. In the instant case, the AO has not
brought out any material to show that the remuneration paid to
the Managing Director was excessive having regard to the fair
market value of these facilities. No comparative case has been
referred to by the AO where the remuneration paid to the
Managing Director was shown to be less than the Managing
Director of the appellant's company. Merely because the salary of
the Managing Director has been increased by 100% after a period
of 3 years does not by itself show that salary is excessive.

7.7   There is another aspect to this issue. During the appellate
proceedings the appellant was asked to furnish the details of tax
paid by the Managing Director. As per the details filed by the
appellant, the Managing Director had returned an income of Rs
21745128/- and had paid tax on the returned income at the
maximum marginal rate. That being so, it is evident that both, the
appellant and its Managing Director were being taxed at the same
rate proving that there was no reason for the appellant to show
higher salary payment being paid to the Managing Director.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                          12</span>




</p><p id="p_51">      Reference in this regard may be made to the decision of the Hon'ble
      P &amp;H High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1961874/" id="a_21">CIT vs. Siyaram Garg HUF</a>
      (2011) 49 DTR 126. In this case the AO had made an addition u/s
      40A (2) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_22">I.T. Act</a> on the ground that the appellant had paid
      higher rate to its sister concern while purchasing the cotton and
      waste. The CIT(A) allowed the appeal of the appellant. On further
      appeal, the Hon'ble IT AT held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">              " On this issue, -we find that indeed, the details filed by the
              assessee showed that its sister concerns were being taxed at the
              same rate at which the assessee was being taxed, proving that
              there was no reason for the assessee to show higher rate
              purchases made by the assessee from its sister concerns. The
              assessee's sister concern had offered their income from such
              sales, which fact has not been disputed. Therefore, the AO
              erred in invoking the provisions of<a href="/doc/15791/" id="a_23"> s. 40A(2)</a> of the Act and the
              learned CIT (A) has correctly deleted the disallowance. "
</blockquote>
<p id="p_52">      The Hon'ble P&amp;H High Court upheld the order of the Hon'ble
      Tribunal and dismissed the appeal of the department.


</p><p id="p_53">25.           Before us, the learned D.R. relied upon the order of

the Assessing Officer and further submitted that the Managing

Director is being paid commission as well as sitting fee.                        The

remuneration was increased by 100% from the year 2006-07.

There    is    no   increase      in   the    salary    of   other    employees.

Therefore, the disallowance made by the Assessing Officer be

confirmed.

<p id="p_54">
</p><p id="p_55">26.           The learned counsel for the assessee while arguing

before us reiterated the submissions made before the learned

CIT (Appeals) and submitted that the Assessing Officer has

made disallowance under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_24">section 40A(2)(a)</a> of the Act without

bringing      on    record    any      comparable      instance      and    adhoc

disallowance of Rs.60 lacs has been made on this account.

In this way, it was prayed that the order of the learned CIT

the parties, perused the findings of the authorities below and

considered the material available on record.                      On perusal of

the findings given by the learned CIT (Appeals) in this regard,

we do not find any infirmity in the same.                        It is a fact of

record that the disallowance has been made on adhoc basis

though     made      under    <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_25">section    40A(2)(a)</a>    of    the    Act.         The

requirement of <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_26">section 40A(2)(a)</a> of the Act is to disallow any

expenditure    which         the   Assessing    Officer     considers      to    be

excessive or unreasonable having regard to the fair market

value of the goods, service or facilities for which the payment

is made.    However, to bring on record the fair market value of

such   facilities,    the    Assessing Officer       has to bring         certain

comparable instances of the same, which in this case the

Assessing Officer has not done.                The disallowance has been

made by the Assessing Officer holding 50% increase in salary

to be reasonable.            There is no basis before the Assessing

Officer to treat 50% of salary as reasonable.                     Thus just an

estimate    which     is    not    permitted    under      the    provisions     of

<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_27">section 40A(2)(a)</a> of the Act.           This ground of appeal raised by
