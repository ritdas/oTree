<p id="p_1">1.             The present Application, was originally filed in

the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur

Bench, as Public Interest Litigation (PIL), No.27 of 2013,

which was transferred by the Hon'ble Divisional Bench of

High Court, to this Tribunal vide order dated June 12th

                                                                  Page 2
(J) Appln. No. 157 (THC) of 2013
 2013, noting that 'controversy needs to be looked into by

the      National            Green   Tribunal'.    The     Applicant     is    a

registered Society comprising of the residents of Amravati

city and the agriculturists.

<p id="p_2">
FACTS AND LIMITATION


</p><p id="p_3">2.           The          instant    Application      is    filed   against

establishment of a coal based Thermal Power Plant

Project (TPP), of the Respondent No.5, which allegedly

would not only destroy environment of Amravati city but

would also deprive farmers of Amravati district from

irrigation           facility,     made   available   to    them    by        the

Respondent No.3, through Upper Wardha Dam. It is

grievance of the Applicant that the Respondent No.3, has

allotted 87.6 Million Cubic Meters (MCM) water for the

power plant of the Respondent No.5, from the Upper

Wardha Dam, though said water is meant for irrigation of

agricultural fields of the farmers and thus, the farmers

would be deprived of irrigation facility. The Applicant

further submits that the Respondent No.1, had approved

change in configuration of the proposed power plant from

2x660 MW to 5x570 MW, vide letter dated 15th July, 2010

and further allowed expansion of said power plant vide

letter dated 27th May, 2011. The Applicant further

submits that there are several Thermal Power Plants,

which have been approved and given necessary sanctions

                                                                         Page 3
(J) Appln. No. 157 (THC) of 2013
 by      the       various          authorities   without   assessing    the

cumulative impacts of such high spurt in the power

generation in Vidarbha region. Some of the plants

referred are M/s TSR Power Pvt Ltd- 1320MW, Wardha

Power Company, Dhamangaon -540 MW, M/s. RSI P Ltd,

Amravati-4300 MW etc. The Applicant submits that

except in Vidharbha, nowhere in the Maharashtra or for

that of matter anywhere in India, such high power

generation has been approved in one district. The

Applicant says that nearby districts Chandrapur and

Nagpur are already facing environmental consequences of

the thermal power plants. The problems in Amravati

district will be much severe due to proposed power plant.

Apprehensions are also raised about Fly Ash disposal

problem from such high coal based power generation

capacity. The Applicant has, therefore, approached this

Tribunal with following prayers:
</p>

October, 2013, submits that the MPCB has considered

the EC granted by the MoEF to the proposed power plant

of the Respondent No.5 and also, verified that the power

plant has proposed necessary pollution control systems,

and then, granted Consent to Establish to the proposed

power plant on the specific terms and conditions. The

Board has stipulated stringent emission standards like

TPM in stack emission not to exceed 50mg/Nm3 along

with requirement of adequate height of stack and fly ash

disposal conditions. The MPCB further submits that

during their visit on 15th October, 2013, one unit of 270

MW of stage-I, was in operation and the industry has

provided a common chimney with two (2) flue passes of

height of 275 meters attached to two (2) boilers, as well as

ESP having two (2) paths provided to each boiler and the

same was in operation. The MPCB has also mentioned

 compliance               of        various     other    conditions,      including

provision of ambient air quality monitoring and also

continuous online stack monitoring system. It is observed

from the visit report that some of the works are ongoing.

The affidavit dated 17th December, 2013, states that after

going through the results of stack monitoring conducted

recently,          MPCB             observed     that    the     stack   emission

parameters are found to be exceeding the standards laid

down          under           the      provisions       of     the   Environment

(Protection) Rules, 2010 and as specified in consent.

MPCB           has        sent       necessary         communication        to     the

Respondent No.5, directing it to take effective steps to

secure compliance of standards.

<p id="p_18">13.            The Respondent No.5, filed counter affidavit

highlighting various discrepancies in the entire sampling

and analysis conducted by the MPCB of the stack air

quality sampling, including site observation reports. The

main grievance of the Respondent No.5, is that the MPCB

has        failed        to        recognize    and      monitor     even        basic

information like stack gas temperature and velocity,

which are normally consistent in such large plant. It is

therefore contended by the Respondent-5 that the stack

emission            reports          produced     by     the    MPCB     are       not

technically correct and they have already brought these

discrepancies to the notice of MPCB. We asked the MPCB


                                                                                 Page 10
(J) Appln. No. 157 (THC) of 2013
 to comment on the same and in reference, the MPCB filed

another affidavit on 30th January, 2014, wherein it is

submitted that the Board has decided to constitute a

Committee to deal with the issue. The Committee's

findings were submitted by the Board, in its affidavit

dated 2nd May, 2014 and recommendations of the

Committee are as under:

Repsondent-5 was given exemption from public hearing

as stipulated in the EIA notification 2006. The Ministry of

Environment and Forests, (MoEF) Government of India,

upon specific directions of the Tribunal dated 30th

October, 2013, to clarify whether any public consultation

process was followed prior to grant of EC for expansion

 provisions of EIA Notification 2006 and the thermal power

project of Respondent-5 was exempted from public

hearing in view of its location in a notified industrial area,

in accordance with the provisions of EIA Notification. The

Ministry claims to have confirmed this fact with the

Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC)

vide their letter dated 23rd June, 2008, that additional

Amravati Industrial Area where the thermal power plant

is located, is notified as 'Industrial Area'. The Respondent

No.1- MoEF, specifically filed another affidavit on 13th

March, 2014, based on the orders of the Tribunal dated

10th March, 2014, wherein the Tribunal directed learned

Counsel           for      MOEF,   to    seek   better   clarification    of

Regulation No.7 (III) of EIA Notification, which requires

clearance by the concerned Authority. An E-mail from the

Deputy Director of MoEF, was placed on record by the

learned Counsel. Considering inconsistency in the earlier

affidavit and the present submission, the Respondent

No.4, was directed                 to   file   an affidavit through a

responsible officer in this regard. The Respondent No.4 -

<p id="p_26">16.            The Respondent No.5, filed affidavit on 21st April,

2014, which essentially claims that while granting EC to

stage-I and II projects of the Respondent No.5, the MoEF,

has       considered               all   the     aspects   including    that   of

exemption from public hearing based on understanding of

the issue at that point of time and has granted the EC

and, therefore, it is the stand taken by the Respondent

No.5, that as the EC of stage-I, was already challenged

before NEAA, which had not entertained the same and i.e.

challenge              to the E.C. Since the Respondents have

invested           such            significant     amount    in   the    project

development and even some of the units have already

started          operations,             any     adverse    interpretation     of

'requirement/exemption from public hearing' should not

be made retrospective. The steps taken so far by the

Respondents are irreversible. Respondents-5 therefore

pleaded that the Tribunal should not take any decision

with retrospective effect while interpreting the provision.

the fact that environmental monitoring conducted by the

based on their assertion; the MPCB had formed an Expert

Committee, which has accepted the issues raised by the

Respondents. The MPCB's further affidavit dated 10th

<p id="p_44">24.             The MPCB reports have mainly focused on the

compliance of conditions stipulated in consent, i.e.

mainly related to pollution control management within

the plant premises. As per the conditions of EC, the

responsibility               of    ensuring    the   compliance         of     EC

conditions is within domain of the MoEF. We find lack of

comprehensive affidavit from the MoEF on the compliance

of the above EC conditions. The project in the present

Application is a very large power plant, and it was

expected that the MoEF would regularly inspect such

plant to ensure the compliances. We are not aware

whether any such compliance monitoring has been done

by the MoEF so far. And if it is so done then, what are the

observations? In the absence of such report from MoEF,

we are unable to verify the status of surrounding

environment,                even    as   the     plant   is    now     partially

operational.

to     be       regularly          inspected     and     the    compliance     of

EC/consent conditions are holistically and scientifically

enforced            on       continuous        basis,    else   the    stringent

is that they have only assessed performance of the air

pollution control system. It is necessary that the MPCB

needs to implement measures suggested by its Expert

Committee and conduct regular inspection of the industry

in a scientific manner. Though, while appreciating the

initiative of MPCB to form an Expert Committee, we are

also concerned with the findings of MPCB Expert

Committee,               which       raises    serious     doubt      on   entire

sampling and monitoring conducted by the MPCB at such

the specialized monitoring skills required in each of

water, ambient air, stack and Hazardous waste sampling,

it is now more difficult task for the field personnel to

conduct scientific sampling and monitoring. In fact, each

of these fields of monitoring itself is a specialization and

MPCB needs to take various factors such as staff

qualifications, training, and automation in sampling,

remote monitoring etc. into account for avoiding such

discrepancies in monitoring, sampling and analysis. We

therefore expect the MPCB to consider this report of

Expert Committee and the action taken thereupon, in

next six (6) months. This is utmost necessary. The MPCB

is a specialized regulatory body created by a special

statute, wherein enormous responsibility is cast upon the

MPCB to regulate industrial emissions and also, monitor

environmental quality of air and water bodies in the state,

which is essential to protect our precious environment.

Any such non-observance of the procedure in sampling

analysis and monitoring may result into inaccurate

information                 leading   to   wrong   decisions    and

environmental disasters and therefore, this needs to be

immediately taken care of by the MPCB in most scientific

and technical manner.

<p id="p_54">31.             The Legislature has given utmost importance to

ascertain the public views in the entire EC procedure by

making provision of public hearing and consultation

before appraisal of specified development projects for

grant of EC. Similarly, reverse flow of dissemination of

information about grant of EC and the conditions

stipulated therein, are described elaborately in the EIA

Notification, 2006. The intention of legislature is very

clear, which aims to improve public consultation before

grant of EC and information dissemination about decision

taken on grant of EC, which has resulted in increased

focus on public hearing mechanism under the 2006

Notification. We have carefully perused Clause of the

relevant part (b), which reads "all projects or activities

located within industrial estates or parks [Item 7(c) of the

Schedule] approved by the concerned Authorities and

which are not disallowed in such approval." It is,

therefore, necessary to interpret this particular category

for clarity on the issue. We are aware, as mentioned by

learned Senior Counsel for the Respondent No.5 that

MoEF,          has        considered   such exemption   for   several

 projects across the country either through itself or

through State Level Environment Impact Assessment

Authority (SEIAAs) for grant of EC. We are also aware

that change of stance of MoEF, if accepted, will change

entire course of implementation of the EIA Notification.

The Tribunal is competent and authorized to deal with

disputes related to "substantial question relating to

environment (including enforcement of any legal right

relating to environment)" to implementation of Acts listed

in Schedule -I of NGT Act, 2010 and the EIA Notification

squarely falls within domain of the scope of NGT as the

same has been notified under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_8">Environment (Protection)

Act</a>, 1986, which is the Act listed in Schedule-I. The

'public hearing'/consultation is undisputedly a legal right

endowed by the EIA Notification, 2006 to the people in

the project area and also public at large. The Tribunal,

therefore, will endeavor to settle this dispute on the

requirement/exemption granted under Rule-7 (i)(III) (b) of

the EIA Notification,2006.

<p id="p_55">32.            The plain and proper reading of this clause

brings focus on two components of the sentence, namely;

"within industrial areas and parks [Item 7(c) of Schedule]"

and "approved by the concerned Authorities".

<p id="p_58">34.            Interpretation of any 'statute' can be done in

various methods like literalism, original intent, doctrinal

approach and structuralism. A plain and elaborate

reading           clearly           indicates         that    the    legislature    had

considered 'industrial estates and parks' as listed in Item

7(c) of Schedule of the EIA Notification, while granting

such exemption. It also includes the term "approved by



                                                                                   Page 26
(J) Appln. No. 157 (THC) of 2013
 the      concerned                 Authorities"   and,    therefore,    two     (2)

phrases; Industrial Estate or Parks and approved by

concerned Authorities, are linked with "Item 7(c) of

Schedule," necessarily interpreting that both these terms

need to be read in context of only provisions of the EIA

Notification, 2006. Another question that arises is

whether concerned Authorities have been notified in the

EIA        Notification?              The     Schedule     attached     to     EIA

Notification categorizes various projects/activities in the

category of threshold limits of 'A' and 'B' category.

Regulation-2 of the EIA Notification, clearly prescribes the

concerned Regulatory Authority for implementation of

rules. Regulation-2 is reproduced as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">       " 2. Requirements of prior Environmental Clearance

</blockquote><p id="p_59">35.            Further, we may also note the specific emphasis

placed on the purpose of public hearing as mentioned in

Regulation 7(i)III which is as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">           " 'Public Consultation' refers to the process by

           which the concerns of local affected persons and

           others          who     have    plausible    stake     in     the

           environmental impacts of the project or activity

           are ascertained with a view to taking into

           account all the material concerns in the project

           or activity design as appropriate."</blockquote><p id="p_60">

</p><p id="p_61">             This provision clearly indicates that public hearing

intends to ascertain all material concerns in the project

or activity design is appropriate. And therefore, the public

hearing under the EIA notification has a specific mandate

and the public in general is expected to be informed

about the project or activity design to solicit their views

and concerns. This public hearing is different in nature,

scope and process from other public hearing like under

<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_11">Land Acquisition Act</a> etc.



                                                                           Page 28
(J) Appln. No. 157 (THC) of 2013
</p><p id="p_62"> 36.            Therefore, we have no hesitation in agreeing to

the stand taken by the MoEF in their affidavit dated

13.3.2014 that "exemption from public consultation, as

provided for under Para 7(i) III. Stage (3) (i)(b) of EIA Notification

2006, is only available to the projects or activities located

within        the     industrial     estate   or parks    which have     EIA

Notification 2006 as provided for under item 7(c) of the

Schedule". The 'concerned Authorities' for interpreting this

Clause are already well defined in Regulation-2 of the

Notification. This provision only exempts such projects

located in Industrial area or park, which are already

appraised on cumulative basis for their environmental

impacts,            for       activity   inside   the    entire   industrial

area/park.
</p>
<p id="p_63">37.            Now, in view of above discussion, it is pertinent

to discuss applicability of such stand taken by the MoEF,

as now endorsed by this Tribunal. During hearing on 21st

April, 2014, the officers of MoEF were present and had

informed the Tribunal that they are informing all the

concerned about the stand taken by the MoEF for

immediate implementation of the Regulation-7, as stated

above. The compliance of such assurance is not placed on

record.          We are aware that the MoEF and SEIAA have

granted ECs to numerous projects granting an exemption

based on earlier view of the MoEF. We are aware that



                                                                       Page 29
(J) Appln. No. 157 (THC) of 2013
 many of these projects have already commissioned and a

large scale investment must have been made pursuant to

the ECs granted by the concerned Authorities. In view of

above, we are of the considered view that public hearing

can only be exempted for all the projects located within

industrial estates and parks which have been granted

necessary EC by the concerned Authorities specified

under EIA 2006 notification and which are not disallowed

in such approval. We also hold that such a proposition

shall be applicable with immediate effect, prospectively in

view of the said projects which have been granted EC

being now protected by principle of 'fait accompli' and it

would be difficult to make the entire process reversible.

The MoEF shall issue immediate directions to all the

concerned Authorities and also issue necessary orders in

this context, bringing this Judgment, to the notice of all

concerned.
