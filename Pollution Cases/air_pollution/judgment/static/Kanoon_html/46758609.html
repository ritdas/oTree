       The Writ Petition is filed under Articles 226 and 227 of
Constitution of India praying to issue to writ of certiorari
quashing the closure notice dated 31.8.2012 vide Annexure-
A issued by respondent No.2.
                                   3

       This Writ Petition coming on for preliminary hearing
this day, Dr.Jawad Rahim, J., delivered the following:-

                           ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner, M/s Madeshwara Stone Crusher is a

proprietary concern of one S.N.Adikrishna engaged in

running a stone crushing unit under licence issued by the

competent    authority    arrayed       in    this   writ   petition   as

respondent no.3.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    It is not in dispute the petitioner is a licencee and the

licence is valid to run the stone crushing unit. In this writ

action he has sought a writ of certiorari to quash the closure

notice   bearing    reference         no.PCB/MIN/SC/CO/UIN/YEL-

BYT/2012-13/846 dated 31.8.2012 vide Annexure-A issued

under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_1">Section 31(A)</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution Act</a>, 1981, by the 2nd respondent . He also seeks

issuance of a writ of mandamus to direct the 3rd respondent

(competent    authority    under       the    Act)   to     consider   its

application filed on 11.10.2012 vide Annexure-C to permit

the   petitioner   to   operate       his    crushing     unit   pending

consideration of the application, and consequential reliefs.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 4</span>


</p><p id="p_4">3.    This writ petition and several other petitions seeking

similar relief are listed for consideration and we have heard

learned counsel, Sri B.C.Aniketh for the petitioner, Sri

R.G.Kolle,   AGA,    who    accepts   notice   on    behalf   of

respondents 1 and 3 and Sri Gururaj Joshi, learned

advocate who accepts notice for respondent no.2.


</p><p id="p_5">4.     The contextual facts manifesting from the averments

in the writ petition and the submissions of the learned

counsel for the petitioner and respondents leaves no scope

for doubt that this writ action is similar to the writ action of

similarly placed owners of crushing units in which questions

raised in this writ petition were considered in detail in

W.P.41069/12 disposed of by the Division Bench of this

court on 21.11.2012 quashing the closure notice issued by

the   Karnataka     Pollution   Control   Board     arrayed   as

respondent no.2 in that writ petition and issuing a writ of

mandamus to permit the petitioner therein to continue

stone crushing activity till its application for re-locating the

unit to a safer zone was disposed of by the competent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     5</span>

authority,   i.e.   Deputy    Commissioner        (respondent   no.3

arrayed in that writ petition).
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">5.     We are satisfied the orders impugned in that writ

petition, grounds against it and the relief sought are the

same as in this writ action. Therefore, we cannot summon

ourselves to take a different view but to follow the decision

of the Division Bench in W.P.41069/12 dated 21.11.2012 in

which, while rendition of the judgment, all facts and

circumstances       have     been       taken   into   consideration.

However, to avoid any doubt, we need to extract the core of

the judgment which is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            'In the present case, by Gazette
         Notification dated 14.8.2012 safer zones in
         Haveri had been duly notified to the public.</blockquote><p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">         Section 3(3) of the Karnataka Regulation of
         Stone Crushers Act, 2011 (for short, 'the
         Act') permits a period of three months to
         existing stone crusher units to trans-locate
         themselves to safer zones. In this regard
         an application has to be filed with the
         Licensing Authority within a reasonable
         time.    Unfortunately, the Act does not
         prescribe this period. In the present case,
         the Petitioner applied to the Licensing
         Authority on 24.9.2012. It is not disputed
         that consequent upon the petitioner's
         application, the Licensing Authority till date
         has neither granted or refused the license
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                        6</span>
under the provisions of the said Act. Since
<a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_3">Section 3(4)</a> of the Act prescribes an outer
limit of six months for shifting from the
date of grant, it could be inferred that the
application has to be made within three
months of the requisite Gazetting of the
safer zones.
</p>
<p id="p_10">2. In these circumstances, the petition is
allowed by directing the respondents to
permit the operation of the petitioner at
the present site upt 23.12.2012 or till such
time the application is considered and
disposed of, by the Licensing Authority.

</p><p id="p_11">3. Learned counsel for the Karnataka State
Pollution Control Board (for short 'the
Board) submits that the petitioner did not
apply for the consent of the Board on the
expiry of the previous consent on
30.6.2012. In normal circumstances, the
contention would be well founded since no
one is permitted to operate without current
permission or consent.
</p>
<p id="p_12">4. In the circumstances of the present
case, however, a piquant situation has
arisen, inasmuch as the Pollution Control
Board cannot grant permission to the
petitioner to operate in its present site,
since it must statutorily relocate to a safer
zone as identified by the State. Needless
to add that if and when the petitioner is
granted a license to relocate to a safer
zone, conditions under <a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_4">Section 6(9)</a> of the
Act will have to e complied with as also the
permission would have to be obtained from
the Board.
</p><p id="p_13">5. With these observations, the petition is
allowed and Annexure-H dated 5.9.2012 is
quashed.'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                7</span>

</p><p id="p_14">6.     Under    the    circumstances,       Annexure-A    dated

31.8.2012 impugned in this writ petition issued by the 2nd

respondent is quashed.      In terms of the order extracted

above, this petition is also allowed directing the respondents

to permit operation of the stone crushing unit of the

petitioner at the present site till such time its application is

considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for

a period of four weeks from now, as ordered in that writ

petition.   Rule issued and made absolute.               In the

circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
