and has been taking up various social issues relating to

environment and in particular the harm caused to the

environment on account of illegal construction. He proceeds on

the premise that several accused persons have commenced

construction of a Commercial and I.T. building without adhering

to the norms contained in the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,

1986 i.e. without obtaining the Environmental Clearance from

the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority ("SEIAA")

under the EIA Notification of 2006 and thereby they have

cheated the Government. He, therefore, filed a complaint under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Section 156(3)</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code seeking police

investigation for the alleged offences under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">Sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_6">120-B</a>

Act. Being aggrieved, he preferred an appeal to the Sessions

Judge, which also resulted in dismissal by order dated 12th

December, 2018.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">3.     Mr. Aditya Pratap, learned counsel appearing for the

Applicant rests his case on certain important questions of law and

he would submit that the offence contained under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_9">Section 15</a> of

the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 is non-cognizable

whereas it would be liable to be classified as a cognizable offence

in view of the provisions<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10"> of Part-II of Schedule-I of the Criminal

Procedure Code</a>. He would submit that this special enactment

prescribes a penalty extending with imprisonment for a term of

five years or with fine which may extend to Rs.5 lakhs, or both.

According to him, this would fall within the ambit of a

'cognizable offence' to be triable by the Magistrate of First Class

but the Act has classified the offence to be 'non-cognizable'. The

second point urged by Mr. Pratap is to the effect that the learned

Sessions Judge has erroneously treated the Application under

amounting to taking cognizance of the offence and the

interpretation arrived at by him for rejecting the relief on the basis

that such an application is not sustainable in absence of sixty days'

statutory notice being given under the Act, is erroneous.

According to him, any order under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_12">Section 156(3)</a> of the

Criminal Procedure Code is at pre-cognizance stage and this is

not the initiation of trial and at this stage no cognizance is taken

within the meaning of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_13">Section 190</a> of the

Criminal Procedure Code.           Further, he would also canvas a

submission that the Sessions Judge has erred in prescribing the

criteria of locus standi in filing criminal case under the

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_14">Environment (Protection) Act</a> and he would rely on the judgment

of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1502681/" id="a_15">A.R. Antulay v.                  Ramdas

Sriniwas Nayak &amp; Anr</a>. reported in AIR 1984 SC 718 to advance

a submission that the legal principle emerging from the said

judgment is to the effect that anyone can put the criminal law

into motion unless contradicted by a statutory provision.

would be 'post-cognizance stage' against settled position in law

that the order under this section is 'pre-cognizance stage'. He

would further place reliance on the 15 members Expert Body

Report of the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee, which in

its Meeting held on 29th &amp; 30th November, 2012 and 01st

December, 2012 has noted that the project proponent has

initiated     the      construction     work   without     obtaining         the

Environmental Clearance and, hence, the SEIAA after due

verification may initiate action for violation under the

appearing for Respondent Nos.3, 4 and 5 would question the

Revision Application. Coming to the facts, Mr. Desai would

submit that the MCGM was the owner of Plot bearing No.216

and 216A situated at Dr. Annie Basant Road, Lower Parel

Division, Worli, Mumbai and the Company has acquired the

property No.216 vide Deed of Assignment from one Rhone Poluc

(India) Limited which subsequently merged into Nicholas

Piramal India Limited.          He further submits that the original

lessees of Plot No.216-A assigned the leasehold rights in favour of

one M/s. Manish Estates Private Limited ("MEPL"), which

constructed a building consisting of basement, ground and six

upper floors known as Manish Commercial Centre which

included three theaters.          It is this MEPL which sold the

commercial offices in the Manish Commercial Centre to various

purchasers and the office purchasers formed a Co-operative

Society and registered the same under the relevant statutes. It is

asserted by Mr. Desai that MEPL mortgaged Plot No.216-A in

favour of Canara Bank and this premises including the three

theaters were put up for sale by an auction by the Debt Recovery

Tribunal and this was purchased jointly by the Companies.</p><pre id="pre_4">

</pre><p id="p_8">Subsequent thereto, the lease of Plot No.216-A was also

transferred in the name of the Companies. It is then stated that

the existing theaters came to be demolished and construction

commenced in Plot No.216-A on sanction of Intimation of

Disapproval granted by MCGM, which was followed by a

Commencement Certificate. It is stated that since the total built

up area to be constructed is less than 20000 sq. mtrs. as per the

approved plan, no environmental clearance was required as per

the Environment Impact Assessment Notification 2006. The

submission of Mr. Desai is to the effect that the relevant

authorities like the SEIAA, SEAC, Environment Department and

the Police Authority were well updated about the construction

taking place on the site and it is thus emphasized that the

Respondents are not guilty of any violation of law and the

Applicant with an object of harassing the Respondents

approached the police authorities and on refusal to register an

FIR, which alleges commission of offences under the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18">IPC</a>, filed a

complaint to the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_19">Section 156(3)</a>, which came to

the same would override the provisions<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_20"> of the Code</a> of Criminal

Procedure and in case of any inconsistency between the two, the

provisions of the special law would prevail in accordance with

<a href="/doc/1250084/" id="a_21">Section 4(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure. His submission

is that there is an embargo created in taking cognizance of the

offence under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_22">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, besides

the eligibility of the complaint and the complainant, on the basis

of which the Court is competent to take cognizance of the offence

under the Act. He would place reliance on the judgment of the

also placed reliance on the judgment of this court in case of <a href="/doc/196814107/" id="a_23">Dilip

2011 SCC Online Bom. 389 in relation to an offence punishable

under Sections 43 and 52 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town

876 dealing with <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_27">Section 19</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act

that in terms of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_128">Section 43</a> of the Act one can be prosecuted only

that once the offence is cognizable, then the FIR is permissible

and the procedure contemplated in <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_131">Section 154</a> of the Code of

Criminal Procedure must follow. With this reasoning, the learned

Single Judge concluded that in absence of any provision in the

Act relating to institution, investigation, inquiry or trial,<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_132"> the Code</a>

of Criminal Procedure would apply and, therefore, the FIR was a

permissible mode and as far as taking cognizance is concerned,

the Magistrate can take cognizance on the basis of a complaint of

an authorized officer which may be filed along with the police

report. On this reasoning, the applications filed by the Petitioner

were dismissed. I am unable to accede to the reasoning adopted

by the learned Judge in Girdhari Agarwal (supra) since once the

learned Single Judge has accepted that <a href="/doc/1250084/" id="a_133">Section 4(2)</a> of the Code

of Criminal Procedure comes into picture in absence of any

provision in the special enactment, then the provisions contained

in<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_134"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure gets displaced by the

provisions of the special enactment, which includes the manner in

which the cognizance of offences to be taken is contemplated.
