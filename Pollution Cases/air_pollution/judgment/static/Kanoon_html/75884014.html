</pre><p id="p_1">                             (15.2.2018)


         The petitions under judgement have been filed by the

      company M/s. Dawat Foods Limited (hereinafter referred to as

      "the Company") and the petitioner Rajendra Kumar Wadhwan is

      a Director of the Company. The petitions have been filed

      invoking the powers of this court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">section 482</a> Cr.P.C. for

      the quashment of the proceedings in Case No.223/2011,

      prosecuting the petitioners for the offences punishable under

      <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_2">sections 43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_3">44</a> read with 47 of the Water (Prevention and

      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as "the

      <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Water Act</a>").The case was registered on the basis of a complaint

      filed by the respondent which is pending in the Court of the

      learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Raisen. The petitioner in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>


     M.Cr.C. No.5675/2011 is a Director in the Company. The Company

     is the petitioner in M.Cr.C. No.5752/2011.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.   The Company has a rice processing plant situated at Plot No.7,

     Satlapur Growth Centre, Phase II, Industrial Area, Mandideep,

     District Raisen. The petitioner Rajendra Kumar Wadhwan is stated

     to be mainly responsible for the works/assignments in the

     company, purchase of raw materials and marketing of the finished

     products and other aspects. The license under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_6">Factories Act</a>

     1948 and rules thereunder of the year 1962, have been granted.

     Annexure P1 to the petitioner is the certificate of incorporation of

     the Company. Annexure P2 is the licence to work a factory issued

     under Rule 5 of the M. P. Factories Rules 1962 dated 26.10.2010.

     Annexure P3 is a letter addressed to the Chief Inspector of

     Factories dated 29.6.2010 by which Form 4-A was submitted,

     reflecting a change in the person nominated to represent the

     company. The outgoing manager was Mr. Vikram Patel and the

     newly nominated person was the new Manager Mr. Rajesh Jaiswal.


</p><p id="p_4">3.   Before commencement of operations, the Company had sought a

     consent letter from the respondent, which was granted vide letter

     dated 13.6.2008, which is Annexure P4 to the petition. The consent

     was subject to the compliance by the Company to the general and

     special conditions relating to the treatment of effluents. The

     conditions were annexed along with the letter of consent.

     Thereafter, vide letter dated 28.4.2007, which is marked and

     annexed to the petition as Annexure P6, the respondent renewed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>


     the consent for a period of three years commencing from 1.1.2009

     to 31.12.2011.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">4.   A notice dated 10.12.2010, was issued to the Company by the

     respondent, wherein paragraph 5, the petitioners were informed

     that the scientist from the Central Laboratory of the Board, Dr. Alok

     Saxena had carried out package monitoring on 9.12.2010 of the

     Industrial Area in Mandideep upon which he detected that the

     polluted water from the processing unit of the Petitioner Company

     was being drained from the permanent pipelines into the storm

     water drain of AKVN. The sample taken was analysed and the

     same was found to be non-compliant of the standards.


</p><p id="p_7">5.   The Company replied to the said notice vide letter dated

     13.12.2010. The Company replied that it has been operating a food

     processing plant for the past two years and that it is fully

     complying with the water and the air pollution laws. The Company

     further stated that it had installed an effluent treatment plant with

     a capacity of 50 kilolitres and that there is no chemical processing

     involved at the Company's plant. With regard to the finding of

     effluents in the sample collected, the Company clarified that when

     their plant was set up in the year 2008 there was a permanent pipe

     line that was built for the removal of rain water from the premises.

     This pipe was in close proximity to the collection tank where the

     polluted water accumulated before treatment. The use of that

     pipeline was only during the monsoon season for draining rain

     water. It further clarified that the pipeline leading to the collection
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     4</span>


     tank, which brought the contaminated water to the collection tank,

     is under ground. There was a leakage in the pipeline bringing the

     untreated water to the collection tank due to which the untreated

     water drained into the pipeline which was laid down for the

     removal of rain water and through the pipeline, it entered the

     storm water drain. It further clarified that the rain water drain pipe

     has been dismantled and that the tank was sealed with cement. It

     further stated that the pipeline, through which the untreated water

     went into the collection tank, was now running over the land rather

     than underground. The photographs of the work done were

     annexed along with the reply to the notice given by the Company.

     As regards the finding of the respondent, communicated to the

     Company in the notice, that the processing unit was allowing the

     untreated water to flow over the land and were covering up the

     same with plantation, the Company has stated that 55 acres of

     land has been converted into a garden. Due to water shortage, the

     waste water was being used after treatment in the ETP. In the

     reply, the Company has also clarified that due to the contamination

     from the collection tank, the test which was done was of untreated

     water and the same not complying with the standards was natural.

     Thereafter, the Company has given the assurance that the water

     that is being used even in the plantation is the water that passes

     through the effluent treatment plant.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">6.   Upon receiving the said clarification, the respondent vide letter

     dated 4.1.2011, which is Annexure P11 to the petition, has

     observed that having received the reply of the Company the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     5</span>


     officials of the respondent carried out an on-the-spot inspection on

     23rd and 27th of December 2010 after which consent was granted to

     the Company by the Respondent, to recommence operations. All

     infrastructural requirements of the establishment were restored.

     Thereafter, a complaint dated 15.3.2011 was filed in the Court of

     the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate Raisen, by the Respondent.

     The complaint is Annexure P8 to the petition. It seeks to prosecute

     the petitioners for offences punishable under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_7">sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_8">44</a> of

     the Water Act. Upon summons being issued by the learned court

     below, the petitioners have preferred the petitions seeking the

     quashment of the said case.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">7.   Heard the learned counsels for the parties and perused the

     documents filed along with the petitions. The learned senior

     counsel for the petitioners has first of all submitted that the filing

     of the complaint case after finding the explanation given by the

     Company to be reasonable and thereafter carrying out the on-the-

     spot inspection on 23rd and 27th of December 2010 and having

     satisfied itself that the factory was now compliant of the standards

     under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Water Act</a> and thereafter restoring all infrastructural

     requirements for the recommencement of operations, was an

     admission on the part of the respondent that it was satisfied by the

     answer given by the petitioners. According to the Ld. Counsel for

     the Petitioners, the flow of effluents through the storm water drain

     was on account of the leakage in the inlet pipeline leading to the

     collection tank, which flowed into the pipeline meant to drain the

     rain water out of the premises of the Company.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     6</span><p id="p_12">


</p><p id="p_13">8.   Thereafter he has drawn the attention of this court to Annexure P8

     which is the complaint. This court has gone through the complaint

     and finds that there is no specific averment against the accused

     no.2, who is the petitioner in M.Cr.C. No.5675/2011, in relation to

     the manner in which he is responsible for the affairs of the

     Company. This, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners has

     submitted, is a fatal flaw which goes to the root of the case. He

     has referred to the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court passed

     in S. M. S. Pharmaceuticals Limited Vs. Neeta Bhalla and

     another (2005) 8 SCC 89. In this case, Hon'ble the Supreme

     Court had examined the ambit and scope of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_10">section 141</a> of the

     Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short, "the Act 1881") and

     held in paragraph 19 that it is necessary to specifically aver in the

     complaint that at the time the offence was committed, the person-

     accused was in charge of and responsible for the conduct of

     business of the Company. This averment, the Supreme Court held,

     is an essential and has to be made in a complaint and that the

     absence of such an averment in the complaint would be deficient

     of the requirements of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">section 141</a> of the Act of 1881. It further

     held, that merely being a director of a company is not sufficient to

     make a person liable under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">section 141</a> of the Act of 1881 and that

     a director cannot be deemed to be in charge of and responsible to

     the company for the conduct of its business. It held that such an

     allegation had to be averred as a fact as there is no deemed

     liability of a director. In order to rationalize the reference to this

     judgment, the learned counsel for the petitioners has referred to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     7</span>


     <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_13">section 47</a> of the Water Act, which provides for offences by

     companies. <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_14">Section 47</a> is largely in pari materia with <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_15">section 141</a> of

     the Act of 1881. The provision in a special statute for the

     prosecution of the directors or such persons who were in charge of

     and responsible to the company for the conduct of its business,

     carves out vicarious liability of such persons, where the company is

     the principal offender. In the present case also, learned senior

     counsel for the petitioners has submitted, it is the company which

     is the principal offender and that the same is undisputed. Thus, he

     submits that, the continuation of the prosecution against the

     petitioners in this case in the absence of such a specific averment

     in the complaint renders his prosecution vexatious.


</p><p id="p_14">9.   The second argument put forth by the learned senior counsel for

     the petitioners is that the offences for which the prosecution is

     sought is an act which requires mens rea of knowledge. <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_16">Section 43</a>

     of the Water Act provides for the prosecution of a person who

     violates <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_17">section 24</a> of the Water Act. <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_18">Section 43</a> provides for

     imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year and

     six months but which may extend to six years and with fine.

     <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_19">Section 24</a> prohibits the use of a stream or well for the disposal of

     polluting matter. The said section provides that no person shall

     knowingly cause or permit any poisonous, noxious or polluting

     matter to enter directly or indirectly into any stream, well, sewer or

     land. It also provides that no person shall knowingly cause or

     permit to enter into any stream or any other matter, which has the

     propensity to directly or in combination with other similar matters,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                       8</span>


      to affect the proper flow of the water of the stream leading to or

      likely to lead to a substantial aggravation of pollution due to its

      consequences. According to the learned counsel for the petitioners,

      it is clear from the above that the legislative intent reflects that the

      mens rea of knowledge must be associated with the Act forbidden

      by <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_20">section 24</a>. He has further stated that violation <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_21">section 24</a> is not

      an offence of strict liability whereby the mere act which is

      prohibited would constitute the offence in the absence of

      knowledge on the part of the doer that his actions were proscribed

      by <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_22">section 24</a>. As regards <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_23">section 44</a>, which provides for the

      punishment of imprisonment which shall not be less than one year

      and six months, but which may extend to six years and with fine,

      for the violation of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_24">sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_25">26</a> of the Act. Learned senior

      counsel for the petitioners has submitted that the complaint when

      read in its entirety does not spell out any violation by the

      petitioners of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_26">sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_27">26</a> of the Act in

      order to constitute an offence under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_28">section 44</a> of the Act.


</p><p id="p_15">10.   Thirdly, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners has referred

      to Annexure P12 which is a letter issued by the Member-Secretary

      of the respondent-Board to the Regional Officer at the Regional

      Office at Bhopal, asking him to register a case against the

      Company for an offence under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_29">section 44</a> of the Water Act.

      Learned senior counsel for the petitioners has referred to <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_30">section

      49</a> of the Water Act which provides for the cognizance of the

      offences under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_31">Water Act</a>. The said section commences with a

      negative provision that no court shall take cognizance of any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                      9</span>


      offence under the Act, except on a complaint made by a Board or

      any officer authorized by such Board on its behalf. Learned senior

      counsel for the petitioners has stated that the Board had only

      delegated this function by the letter dated 7.2.2011, which is a

      specific order, delegating its power to the Regional Officer to

      register the complaint. Thereafter he has referred to Annexure P13

      which is a letter dated 15.3.2011 by which the Regional Officer is

      stated to have redelegated this power to Mr. H. K. Tiwari, who is

      the Assistant Engineer with the Board and who has filed the

      complaint in question. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners

      has submitted that this act was unlawful as <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_32">section 49</a> does not

      provide for re-delegation. He has further submitted that Annexure

      P12 categorically asked the Regional Officer only to register a case

      against the Company. It gave no permission to prosecute the

      petitioner Rajendra Kumar Wadhwan. On these grounds, the

      learned senior counsel for the petitioners has submitted that the

      case against the petitioners is liable to be quashed.


</p><p id="p_16">11.   Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent has drawn the

      attention of this court to the application for vacating stay filed by

      the respondent in M.Cr.C. No.5752/2011. He has firstly drawn the

      attention of this court to Annexure R-1 to the said application,

      which is an office order dated 20.9.2007 issued by the respondent-

      Board and refers to a Board's resolution dated 4.6.2007 by which

      the Board had delegated the powers of initiating cases on behalf of

      the Board, to Class II employees of the Board, after taking the

      consent of the Regional Officer. Learned counsel for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                    10</span>


      respondent, on the basis of the said document, has argued that the

      office order reflects that the power to file cases was delegated in

      the year 2007 itself to the Class II employees of the Board and that

      the Assistant Engineer, who has filed the complaint against the

      petitioners herein, falls under that category. As regards the re-

      delegation by the Regional Officer vide letter dated 15.3.2011,

      which is Annexure P13, filed in M.Cr.C. No.5675/2011, the learned

      counsel for the respondent has submitted that the said letter was

      in line with the office order dated 20.9.2007 passed by the Board

      as this was only a consent given by the Regional Officer to the

      Assistant Engineer H. K. Tiwari. The other documents that have

      been filed by the respondent are the same documents which have

      been filed by the petitioners herein in M.Cr.C. No.5675/2011 about

      which the reference has already been given to by this court.

      registration of the complaint notwithstanding the letter issued by

      the respondent to the complainant-Company dated 4.1.2011

      granting them permission to re-commence operations, the learned

      counsel for the respondent has stated that both operate on

      different levels. He has argued that the complaint is maintainable

      because an offence was committed. The letter dated 4.1.2011 has

      only permitted the Company to re-commence operations as the

      anomalies pointed out by the Board vide its notice dated

      10.12.2010 were rectified and removed by the petitioners herein.

</p><p id="p_18">13.   The learned counsel for the respondent has also referred to the

      provisions of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_35">section 24</a> of the Water Act and has submitted that

      the very act of the petitioners of discharging effluents not meeting

      the standards resulted in the violation of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_36">section 24</a>. Thus, he

      states that the offence under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_37">section 43</a> is clearly constituted. As

      regards <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_38">section 25</a>, the learned counsel for the respondent has

      submitted that <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_39">section 25</a> prohibits new outlets and new

      discharges. He further submits that the very fact that the effluent

      before treatment escaped into the drain pipe meant to evacuate

      the rain water from the premises, itself constitutes an offence

      under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_40">section 25</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">14.   Learned counsel for the respondent has thereafter submitted the

      even though the order of the Board to the Regional Officer does

      not make out a requirement for the prosecution of the Director of

      the Company, the same was essential as offences under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_41">sections

      43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_42">44</a> have a mandatory term of imprisonment. He has argued

      that the Company being an incorporeal entity cannot be made to

      suffer imprisonment and, therefore, it was essential to make the

      petitioner Rajendra Kumar Wadhwan as the second accused in this

      case. The respondent has referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble

      Supreme Court passed in R. Kalyani Vs. Janak C Mehta and

      others (2009) 1 SCC 516 and has drawn the attention of this

      court to paragraph no.15, in which Hon'ble the Supreme Court has

      held that the inherent jurisdiction to quash a criminal proceeding

      ought not to be exercised ordinarily and, in particular, where a first

      information report is sought to be quashed unless the allegations
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                               12</span>


contained therein, even if given face value and taken to be correct

in its entirety, disclose no cognizable offence. Hon'ble the Supreme

Court further held that except in very exceptional circumstances

the court exercising jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_43">section 482</a> Cr.P.C. would not

look into any document relied upon by the defence. It is also laid

down that inherent power should be exercised very sparingly and

where the allegations made in the first information report disclose

commission of an offence, the court shall not go beyond the same

and pass an order in favour of the accused to hold absence of any

mens rea or actus reus. The learned counsel for the respondent

has emphasized much upon this judgment in order to nullify the

arguments of the learned senior counsel for the petitioners, that

the existence of knowledge or its absence cannot be gone into, in

the exercise of inherent powers. However, it would be relevant to

point out here that in para 16 of the judgment Hon'ble the

Supreme Court has also observed that no hard and fast rule can be

laid down and that each case has to be considered on its own

merits. The next judgment that has been referred to by the learned

counsel for the respondent is Monica Kumar (Dr.) and another

Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others (2008) 8 SCC 781.

Learned counsel for the respondent has referred to paragraph 34

of the judgment that inherent power can and should be exercised

to quash the proceedings only where it manifestly appears that

there is a legal bar against the institution and continuance of a

case like want of sanction or, where the allegations in the first

information report or the complaint taken at their face value and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                     13</span>


      accepted in their entirety do not constitute the offence alleged and

      lastly, where the allegations constitute an offence but there is no

      legal evidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the

      charge.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">15.   Having heard the contesting views and having gone through the

      records of this case, this court is of the opinion that the petitions

      deserve to be allowed for the following reasons.


</p><p id="p_23">16.   Firstly, the undisputed facts on record go to show that the incident

      which has been related to was an accident and something that was

      beyond the control of the Company. The facts go to reveal that

      when the operations commenced in the year 2008, the pipeline

      that was laid down by the Company for the evacuation of the rain

      water into the storm water drain of the AKVN, passed in close

      proximity to the collection tank where the effluent accumulated

      before treatment. The pipeline bringing the contaminated effluents

      into the container tank, which was underground, suffered a

      fracture on account of which the untreated effluent water through

      seepage entered the pipeline meant to drain out the rain water as

      a result of which the effluent drained out into the storm water

      drain of the AKVN from where the samples were collected. Upon

      the same being brought to the notice of the Company by the

      respondent, corrective measures were employed and the problem

      was set right. The pipeline bringing the untreated effluent to the

      collection tank, which initially was underground, was brought on

      the surface thereby ensuring that the contamination of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                     14</span>


      untreated water does not take place through seepage into the rain

      water drain pipe. The reply given by the Company to the

      respondent that the water that was used for the purpose of

      gardening was water that passed out from the effluent treatment

      plant after purification and that the same was used as there was a

      shortage of water to maintain the garden sprawled over fifty acres

      of land, was acceptable to the respondent. Satisfied with the reply

      given   by   the   Company,        the   respondent     permitted      the

      recommencement      of   operations      and   also   directed   for   all

      infrastructural support to be restored so that the Company may

      function. Thus, this court is of the view that a mere accident, which

      was way beyond the control of the petitioners to have noticed on

      their own, which when brought to the notice of the Company, was

      promptly rectified, should not have been subjected to prosecution

      for the offences under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_44">sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_45">44</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">17.   Secondly, as regards the offence under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_46">section 43</a>, which made a

      violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_47">section 24</a> of the Water Act an

      offence, the very wordings of the section make it apparent that the

      mens rea of knowledge had to be manifest in the person violating

      the said provision. The complaint case does not reflect or have any

      allegation that the Company had the requisite knowledge of the

      contamination that was taking place. The undisputed facts would

      also go to show that the pipeline bringing the contaminated water

      to the collection tank was passing underground and, therefore, a

      rupture in that pipeline was not something that was detectable

      easily. By way of rectification, the complainant-Company has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                      15</span>


      brought the said pipeline to the surface to ensure that any future

      leak is readily visible and can be rectified. Under the circumstances,

      the requisite knowledge for the violation of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_48">section 24</a> itself is

      absent from the material on record and, therefore, the offence

      under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_49">section 43</a> of the Water Act is not prima facie constituted.


</p><p id="p_26">18.   As regards the offence under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_50">section 44</a>, which the learned counsel

      for the respondent has stated was punishable because <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_51">section 25</a>

      of the Water Act was violated as there was a restriction placed

      upon the Company of establishing any new outlets or new

      discharges and the fact that untreated effluent was being drained

      into the storm water drain of AKVN, prima facie proved that the

      provision of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_52">section 25</a> was violated and, therefore, the petitioners

      were amenable to be proceeded and punished under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_53">section 44</a> of

      the Water Act. The facts on record go to show that no new outlets

      or discharges were put in place by the petitioners and, as already

      stated hereinabove, the drainage of the untreated effluent into the

      storm water drain happened on account of a technical fault which

      was subsequently rectified and the same cannot be understood as

      a new outlet or a new discharged being put in place by the

      Company.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">19.   Thirdly, the delegation to the Regional Officer by the Member-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      Secretary of the Board to institute a case punishable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_54">section

      44</a> of the Water Act, the said letter specifically states that it is only

      the Company which is to be prosecuted and not anyone else.

      However, the complaint has gone beyond the mandate of the letter
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                      16</span>


      dated 7.2.2011 and the Director of the Company also has been

      made an accused. There is no allegation against the petitioner in

      M.Cr.C. No. 5675/2011 in the entire complaint. The judgment of

      Hon'ble the Supreme Court in S. M. S. Pharmaceuticals Limited

      Vs. Neeta Bhalla and another referred to hereinabove squarely

      applies for a prosecution of a director under the provisions of the

      <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_55">Water Act</a> as <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_56">section 47</a>, providing for vicarious liability of the

      directors and their prosecution for offences committed by

      companies is in perimetria with <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_57">section 141</a> of the Act 1881 in

      which Hon'ble the Supreme Court has held that there must be a

      specific averment that the director was a person in charge of and

      responsible for the conduct of the business of the Company. Under

      the circumstances, in the absence of the specific averment and the

      fact that <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_58">section 47</a> of the Water Act is in pari materia with <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_59">section

      141</a> of the Act of 1881, the said ratio would be squarely applicable

      in this case and, therefore, the petitioner in M.Cr.C. No.5675/2011

      cannot be proceeded against.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">
</blockquote><p id="p_29">20.   Fourthly, the contention of the learned counsel for the respondent

      that it was necessary to make the Director of the Company as an

      accused in this case and that the Company could not have been

      prosecuted in absence of the Director as offences under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_60">sections

      43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_61">44</a> have a mandatory jail term, is untenable. Whether, the

      prosecution of a director is essential in an offence for which a

      mandatory jail term along with fine is provided for is no longer res

      integra, the same having been considered and settled by a

      Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Standard Chartered
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                     17</span>


      Bank and others Vs. Directorate of Enforcement and others

      (2005) 4 SCC 530. In paragraph 29 of the judgment, it was

      argued before Hon'ble the Supreme Court that when an offence

      punishable with imprisonment and fine is alleged against the

      company, the court is not left with any discretion to enforce any

      one of them and consequently the company being a juristic person

      cannot be prosecuted for the offence for which custodial sentence

      is a mandatory punishment, was negated by Hon'ble the Supreme

      Court and it held that if custodial sentence is the only punishment

      prescribed for the offence then a company cannot be prosecuted.

      But, where custodial sentence and fine are prescribed modes of

      punishment, the court can impose the sentence of fine on a

      company which is found guilty, as the sentence of imprisonment is

      impossible to be carried out. Hon'ble the Supreme Court placed its

      reliance upon the rule of law enunciated in the legal maxim lex non

      cogit ad impossiblia or that the law shall not expect the

      performance of the impossible. Therefore, the contention of the

      learned counsel for the respondent fails.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">21.   The learned counsel for the respondent has also argued that the

      petitioners have come up only against a process having been

      issued and nothing further having been done, their defences can

      be looked into by the trial court itself. As regards the said

      contention, Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of Pepsi Foods

      Limited Vs. Special Judicial Magistrate (1998) 5 SCC 749

      has held in paragraph 28 that "summoning of an accused in a

      criminal case is a serious matter. Criminal law cannot be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                               18</span>


set into motion as a matter of course. It is not that the

complainant has to bring only two witnesses to support his

allegations in the complaint to have a criminal law set into

motion. The order of the Magistrate summoning the

accused must reflect that he has applied his mind to the

facts of the case and the law applicable thereto". In

paragraph 29, while dealing with the contention that the grounds

taken by the petitioner in that case for quashment under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_62">section

482</a> Cr.P.C, can well be looked into by the trial court at the stage of

framing charges was negated by Hon'ble the Supreme Court which

held "no doubt the Magistrate can discharge the accused at

any stage of the trial if he considers the charge to be

groundless, but that does not mean that the accused

cannot approach the High Court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_63">section 482</a> Cr.P.C.

or <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_64">Article 227</a> of the Constitution to have the proceedings

quashed against him when the complaint does not make

out any case against him and still he must undergo the

agony of a criminal trial". In this case, the learned court below

failed to appreciate that the genesis of the case itself was an

inadvertent accident which was beyond the control of the

petitioner-company. It also failed to appreciate that when the said

problem was brought to the notice of the petitioner-company, it

promptly rectified the same and the respondent satisfied itself by

an on-the-spot inspection on 23rd and 27th of December 2010 and

only thereafter gave it the green signal to recommence operations.

In such a situation, the filing of the complaint case against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                     19</span>


      petitioners was completely uncalled for. The same, though not

      intentional, but has in effect resulted in an abuse of process.


</p><p id="p_32">22.   Learned counsel for the respondent has also referred to sub-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      section (2) of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_65">section 47</a> which provided for that notwithstanding

      anything contained in sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_66">section 47</a> where an

      offence under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_67">Water Act</a> was committed by a company and it is

      proved that the offence has been committed with the consent or

      connivance of, or is attributable to any neglect on the part of any

      director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company, they

      shall be deemed guilty of that offence. Under the circumstances,

      learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that even the

      element of negligence was sufficient enough to constitute the

      offence under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_68">section 43</a>. However, as <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_69">section 24</a> of the Water Act

      specifically provides for the knowledge by the offender of his

      actions, which is a conscious inclusion by the legislature, intending

      that a person who does not have the requisite knowledge about his

      action or the consequences could not be deemed to have

      contravened the provisions of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_70">section 24</a> of the Water Act. Thus, a

      negligent act would not result in the contravention of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_71">section 24</a> of

      the Water Act. Besides, the rupture of the underground pipeline

      was not an act of negligence. It was an act which was impossible

      for the petitioners herein to have prevented despite having taken

      the greatest care. Nowhere in the complaint is it mentioned that

      the rupture of the pipeline, which passed underground, happened

      on account of the negligence of the petitioner-company. Under the

      circumstances, the said contention is rejected.

      allowed and the proceedings against the petitioners in Sessions

      Trial No.223/2011 pending in the Court of the learned Chief Judicial
