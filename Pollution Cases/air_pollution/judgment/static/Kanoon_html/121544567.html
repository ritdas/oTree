<p id="p_1">(Order of the Court was made by  S.Manikumar,J)

	Claiming himself to be a public interest litigant, petitioner has filed the instant public interest litigation, for a direction to the respondents, 1 to 7, to consider his representation, dated 28/3/2018, to take necessary legal action, against the unauthorised and unapproved indiscriminate sucking/withdrawal of ground water, in the area including Madhavaram, Mathur, Manjampakkam, Assisi Nagar, Kampan Nagar, GKM Colony, Ring Road Housing Sector, Vadaperumpakkam and Milk Colony road.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2.  The people living in  Madhavaram, Assisi Nagar, GKM Colony, Kamban Nagar, Shanthi Colony, MGC Nagar, Manjampakkam, Ring Road Housing Sector and Mathur, have given several complaints, to the authorities concerned, in connection with the theft of ground water, in their area.  Since no action has been taken, people living in the said areas have written a complaint, to Special Cell of the Hon'ble Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, dated 14/9/2015.  On 30/1/2017, members of Mathur Village Resident Welfare Association had conducted one day fasting to invite attention of the local body officials and the Police authorities and on 11/5/2017, sixth respondent had conducted an inspection and disconnected around 7 borewells and their electricity connection.  This was published in the local Tamil daily newspaper 'Dinamalar' on 12/5/2017, but the raid was conducted only as an eye wash to the local public.  At present, the disconnected borewells are working and the miscreants are using illegal electricity connection which results in huge loss of electrical energy.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3.  It is the contention of the petitioner that once the precious ground water is sucked limitlessly, it would cause serious repercussion in future.    Commercial use of water for private gain without any approval from the authorities concerned is an offence.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4.  Counter affidavit was filed on behalf of the second respondent, wherein it is stated as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_5">	Government of Tamil Nadu, introduced Act 27 of 1907 to regulate the extraction and to conserve ground water in certain areas in the State of Tamil Nadu.  The said Act has been published in T.N.G.G.(Extraordinary Issue No.388/Part IV-Section 2 dated 17/6/1987.  Tamil Nadu Groundwater (Development and <a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_2">Management) Act</a>, 2003 in the Tamil Nadu Ordinance No.4 of 2013 has made an Ordinance to repeal the Tamil Nadu Groundwater (Development and <a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_3">Management) Act</a>, 2003 which initially dealt with protection of groundwater resources, provide safeguards against  hazards of over exploitation and to ensure planned development and proper management of this vital and limited resource.  Following the above Act, an amendment Act 43/2008 for Chennai Metropolitan Area Ground Water (Regulation) Act 1987 was introduced, Chennai Metropolitan Area Ground Water (Regulation) Amendment Act, 2008 in respect of erstwhile Chengalpattu District and now applied to Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur Districts.  Hence it gave emergence to G.O.(Ms) No.51/PW (R2) Department, dated 11/2/2004.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	The following Government Orders have been issued regarding Ground Water Development:-
</p>



<p id="p_7">G.O.(Ms) No.51/PW(R2) Dept dated 11/2/2004
Categorisation of Panchayat Union Blocks as (1) Over exploited (2) Critical (3) Semi critical and (4) sage.  Accordingly,  this Madhavaram Taluk comes under the Semi-critical Block (Below 70% and 90%)
G.O.(Ms.) No.52/PW (R2) Dept dated 2/3/2012
</p><p id="p_8">(i).  A category  For over exploited and critical Blocks where ground water extraction is 90% and above
</p><p id="p_9">(ii).  B Category  For semi-critical and safe blocks where ground water extraction is below 90%

	No schemes should be formulated in over-exploited and critical blocks notified as A-category.  As regards B category, schemes should be formulated through State ground and Surface Water Resources Centre of Water Resources Department and the Chief Engineer/State Ground &amp; Surface Water Resources Data Centre will issue No Objection Certificate for ground water clearance.
</p>	


<p id="p_10">G.O.(Ms) No.142/PW(R2) department dated 23/7/2014

Categorisation of Firkas as overexploited, critical, semi-critical, safe and Saline for groundwater.  Madhavaram Taluk is categorised under Semi-critical area comprising Madhavaram Firka (1) and Redhills (2)
The Hon'ble National Green Tribunal in its order dated 25/5/2017 of Suo Moto Appeals 26 to 34 of 2017
States that No Objection Certificate (NOC) has to be given by the Metropolitan Area Ground Water (Division) of CMWS &amp; SB. Until the Board passes any order on consent, the petitioner is only permitted to run his unit with the transported water from outside Madhavaram Taluk.  It also states that even in cases where the transportation of water is permitted, the same must be only after obtaining consent from the Board.  The Board has to make impact assessments before the request of NOC is processed to the Drinking Water packaging units. It declares that the Tahsildar shall always be entitles to visit the units to ensure that water is not illegally drawn in places where the packaged drinking water activities are being carried on.  It also affirms that at any rate, the petitioner should not be allowed to extract ground water through borewells installed within the petitioner's premises itself.
</p>


<p id="p_11">	It is necessary to state that Madhavaram Taluk was categorised into Semi-Critical Zone in 2011 by the Central Ground Water Board and the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board, based on the extraction rate; therefore, presently Madhavaram Taluk is in Category - B.  The G.O (MS) No.113/PW(R2) Department dated 9/6/2016 affirms that in Semi-Critical and Safe Blocks "Notified as B Category Blocks", all the schemes should be formulated through the State Ground and Surface Water Resources Data Centre of the Water Resources Department and the Chief Engineer, State Ground and Surface Water Resources Data Centre, would issue "No Objection Certificate" for ground water clearance.  With reference to the above G.Os, the District Collector, Tiruvallur has given suitable instructions to monitor the extraction and transportation of ground water by the units and to verify the genuineness of the companies/water units as regards requirements of NOC/Licenses for running the units or companies as the case may be.  According to the instructions, the Revenue Divisional Officer, Ambattur and the Tahsildar, Madhavaram are taking effective action regularly.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	It is further submitted that nearly 41 units are functioning in and around Madhavaram without proper permission.  Out of which, some of them are involved in extracting of ground water and few of them getting water from outside and manufacturing packaged drinking water and carrying out business.  Further, the District Collector, Tiruvallur is conducting periodical review meetings every month and watching the progress of action taken on the illegal movement on the extraction of Groundwater through bore wells and transport action of water through Tanker Lorries with top priority.  It is necessary to state that under the instructions of the District Collector, teams are also formed, headed by the RDO, Ambattur, surprise inspections are mode, raids conducted and stringent action are being taken on the illegal extraction of ground water.
</p>
<p id="p_13">	Officials are taking drastic actions against the erring units without waiting for any complaints in a routine manner by conducting frequent raids and inspections with other departmental Officers concerned to regulate and control the ground water Management in Madhavaram Taluk.
