Reason:

<p id="p_4">2.    On 06 June, 2013, when Ms. Vishakha Wadekar, was driving her car with
her young daughter, Sanskruti Wadekar she had no inkling that danger lurked
round the corner of the highway; over-mining at the height of 75 x 30 ft, in Gut
No. 112, resulted in the destruction of a small hill by the side of the national
highway. The resultant debris and a part of the hill collapsed and slid down to the
road, claiming the lives of Ms. Vishakha and her daughter. The directions made by
the Pune bench of the National Green Tribunal, on an application by a registered
organization, (the respondent in the appeal, the Aam Aadmi Lokmanch, hereafter
“Lokmanch”) are the subject matter of the appeals (CA 6932/2015 by NHAI; CA
5971/2019; CA 11803/2018 and CA 6862/2018) before this court. The other
appeals by special leave question the judgments and orders of the Bombay High
Court, which upheld the regulations framed pursuant to the order of the NGT. The
High Court negatived the challenge to those regulations in the writ petitions
presented before it.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.    The facts in brief are that the National Highways Authority of India
(hereafter “NHAI”) had entered into an agreement with M/s P.S. Toll Road (Pvt.)
Ltd., a unit/undertaking of Reliance Infrastructure Ltd. (which is arrayed as the
ninth respondent; PS Toll Road (Pvt.) Ltd. hereafter referred to as “the
concessionaire”) on 10.03.2010 for the maintenance and operation of the Pune-
Satara section of National Highway No. 4, to an extent of 140 kms. The scope of
the agreement included construction of the project (i.e. the highway stretch) as well
as its operation and maintenance for a period of 24 years. The agreement included
stipulations mandating safety to the highway users (clause 18.1.1). The NHAI was
duty bound to appoint experienced safety consultants for carrying out safety audits
of Project Highways (clause 18.1.2), the expenditure for which was to be borne by
the concessionaire (clause 18.1.3). An elaborate highway monitoring mechanism
was also contemplated by the agreement (clause 19.1) through which by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                          3</span>

seventh of each month, an independent engineer was to furnish a report after due
inspection (of the operation and maintenance arrangements), containing defects or
deficiencies (clauses 19.2). Additionally, the independent engineer was to require
the concessionaire to carry out specified tests for confirming that the highway was
operated in accordance with applicable standards (clause 19.3). Other stipulations
included, inter alia, requirements that the concessionaire had to carry out remedial
measures (Clause 19.4.1) within a period of 15 days after receipt of the report of
the independent engineer. The concessionaire was put to terms in that if relevant
repairs or remedial measures were not undertaken, the NHAI could recover
damages in terms of Clause 17.8.1 Another obligation cast on the concessionaire
was to send a periodic report of various occurrences, including “unusual
occurrences on the Project Highway” such as death or injury to any person (clause
19.6), any obstruction, or “flooding of Project Highway”.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.       In the meanwhile, the fifth respondent (who has filed CA 5971/2019 against
the NGT’s order, hereafter referred to as “Rathod”) on 03.01.2011 applied to the
Government of Maharashtra for a license to extract minor minerals. This license
was sought in respect of land bearing survey number 112A to look more to an
extent of 5 acres and 93 cents. The license was granted by the appropriate authority
of the government. By clause 1 of the terms of this license, the period of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">1</span>
  In terms of Clause 19.4.2, the measure of damages which NHAI could recover was calculable in terms of each
days delay in complying with the remedial measures suggested by the engineer, based on the “higher (a) 0.5% of
the Average Daily Fee and (b) 0.1% of the cost of such repair or repair estimated by the Independent Engineer” The
same clause (17.8.1) stated that:
</p><p id="p_7">          “Notwithstanding anything contained in this agreement, should the actual traffic exceed the design
capacity during any year or part thereof and the Concessionaire fails to repair or rectify any defect or deficiency set
forth in the Maintenance Requirements within the period specified therein, it shall be deemed to be in breach of this
agreement and the Authority shall be entitled from such date to recover damages, to be calculated and paid for each
day of the delay until the breach is cured, at the higher of (a) 5% (five percent) of Average daily fee and 1% (one
percent) of the cost of such repair or rectification as estimated by the Independent Engineer, for the balance period
of the concession. The recovery of such damages shall be without prejudice to the rights of the Authority under this
agreement, including the right of termination thereof.”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                          4</span>

license was two months; clause 5 stated that for extraction and minor minerals
digging, work could not exceed more than 20 feet down side of the land surface.
</p>
<p id="p_8">5.    Apparently soon after the license was taken over, certain demands were
made regarding construction of a connecting road to the village. The materials on
record by way of letters written to the local panchayat are to the effect that as a
result of construction of the highway and due to the passage of time the existing
road had been washed away. Consequently, the 2 km stretch from the left side of
the new tunnel going up to the village was virtually non-existent. The panchayat
requested that the road should be strengthened and widened.
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.    On 31.01.2011, the local authorities of the State government issued a show
cause notice to Rathod alleging that debris were stored illegally on the site. It was
alleged that this was contrary to Section 48 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue
Code, 1966 (hereafter “land revenue code”). Again, on 16.06.2011, the local
panchayat issued a notice (which is on the record) stating that as a result of mineral
extraction, the natural flow of rainwater was being obstructed. The notice also
added that two heavy machines in non-performing condition were lying idle on the
land and two JCB machines were also stationed there. Rathore evidently received
these notices; this is attested by his replies to the Tehsildar and other local
authorities. After obtaining a report from the local officials, the Tehsildar, Bhor
issued an order directing payment of ₹ 1,271,200 by Rathod for violation of the
land revenue code on account of illegal extraction and use of minor minerals.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.    This activity of excavation and piling of debris, did not go unnoticed on the
part of NHAI; it wrote to the Collector of Pune, pointing out that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       “…large scale and indiscriminate excavation in the upper side hills of
       New Katraj Tunnel at both ends is in progress. Due to this excavation,
       drainage system above and near tunnel has been affected. This may
       lead to seepage of water inside tunnel roof thereby collapse of walls
       and ceiling of tunnel resulting in collapse of tunnel and may lead to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         5</span>

       major mishap. The collapse in tunnel will block the entire traffic of
       NH4 from Mumbai/Pune to Bangalore and vice versa leading to
       chaotic situation.”
The letter also mentioned specifically that Rathod had been notified; it sought
action from the state government.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">8.    In the early hours of the morning of 6th June, 2013, due to the monsoon,
there was heavy rainfall at Mauje Shindewadi Tehsil, Bhor and the surrounding
areas. Water flowing through the hills at Mauje Shindewadi entered the road near
the octroi post of the Pune Municipal Corporation, at Mauje Shindewadi Tehsil
Bhor, District Pune, on NH-4, with great force. This created an obstacle in the form
of a large sheet of water. Under these conditions, when the Alto car driven by
Vishakha Wadekar and her daughter Sanskruti, was obstructed, they alighted to
wade across to safety; however, the water gushed with great intensity and swept
them away, resulting in their death. The resulting magisterial inquiry under Section
176, Code of Criminal Procedure resulted in a report dated 04.10.2013. The Sub-
Divisional Magistrate who inquired into the incident appointed an expert, whose
report was considered; he also visited the site and held several hearings. During the
hearings, pursuant to notices issued to various parties, the statements of Rathod,
the local police authorities, eyewitnesses (Abhay Arvind Ranade, Vineet Vasant
George and relatives of the deceased), the Project Director (General Manager) of
NHAI, the team leader of the independent engineering firm associated with
checking quality of maintenance of the highway, etc. were recorded.
</p>
<p id="p_12">9.    Soon after the incident, the Lokmanch, through its president, filed an
application under Section 14(1) read with <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_1">Sections 16</a> and <a href="/doc/175098716/" id="a_2">18</a> of the National Green
Tribunal Act, 2010 (hereafter “the NGT Act”), seeking mandatory injunction to
restore natural contours at the foot base of the hill that had been destroyed by
Rathod. Besides, general relief by way of directions to other respondents to take
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                          6</span>

necessary action for the protection of hills from destruction and for maintaining
foot base design of the hills in the natural survey was sought.
</p>
<p id="p_13">10.    The material produced before the NGT by the State of Maharashtra in the
form of an affidavit revealed that large scale destruction of hills by individuals and
concerns who had been given short term mining licenses, had occurred. According
to the affidavit, there were 62 cases, and in many cases “hill-cutting” was resorted
to by developers. The state had apparently imposed fines and penalties for these
illegal activities.
</p>
<p id="p_14">11.    The NGT, in its impugned order, commenting on the role of Rathod, held as
follows, while justifying the imposition of liability upon that respondent:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        “It appears from the record that land Survey No. 112, is owned by the
        Respondent Nos. 5 and 6 and their family members. There are hills in
        the said land. They illegally cut hills without permission and extract
        minor mineral, which reduced height of hill, circumference of the hill
        and or peripheral nature, surface of the hill in question. Acts of the
        Respondent Nos. 5 and 6 made the area of hill fragile, susceptible to
        danger to the ecology and support of natural soil. In such a case, mere
        recovery of additional royalty would not be a proper remedial measure.
        At many places, the hill cutting is noticed prior to and after the
        pathetic incident and now inquiry is undertaken by the concerned
        revenue officials.”
</blockquote><p id="p_15">12.    Thereafter, the NGT based on its reasoning that the regulation of some
activities, especially involving anything affecting hills has to be strictly regulated,
directed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        “12. The question may arise as to what is the meaning of expression
        'Hill'. General perception is that it would depend upon ocular
        assessment of the area, which is rounded land that is higher than the
        land surrounded by it, but is not expected to be as high as mountain. In
        other words, it is usually rounded natural elevation of land, lower than
        a mountain. There is no particular definition of the word 'Hill'. The
        Oxford Dictionary gives meaning of word 'Hill' as follows:
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  7</span>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     Hill - noun a naturally raised area of land, not as high or
     craggy as a mountain, a sloping stretch of road: they were
     climbing a steep hill in low gear, a heap or mound of
     something, a hill of sliding shingle.
</blockquote><p id="p_16">The wordbook has given meaning of expression 'Hill' as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     231 "Hill is an elevation of the earth's surface that has a
     distinct summit. It has much less surface area than a mountain
     and is lower in elevation. Hills rise less than 305 metres above
     the surrounding area, whereas mountains always exceed that
     height. However, a hill is not simply Small Mountain. It is
     formed in a considerably different way.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     Hills may be classified according to the way they were
     formed and the kinds of materials they are made of. There are
     two types, constructional and destructional. Constructional
     hills are created by a built-up of rock debris or sand deposited
     by glaciers and wind. Oval-shaped landforms called drumlins
     and sand dunes are samples of this type. Destructional hills are
     shaped by the deep erosion of areas that were raised by
     disturbances in the earth's crust. Such hills may consist of
     limestone overlying layers of more easily eroded rock."
</blockquote><p id="p_17">13. Draft Development Control Regulation Plan (DCR) of Pune is yet
not approved by the PMC or Government. The cutting of hill by the
Respondent Nos. 5 and 6, created destruction to render a part of land
useless, including development thereof for plantation of trees. It goes
without saying that the destruction of hill could not have occurred
without connivance or at least purposeful act or omission by the
Project Proponent i.e. NHAI (Respondent No. 9). It is in the affidavit of
Mr. Rajeskumar Kundal, that agreement requires to take necessary
steps for stoppage of illegal construction activity at Katraj hill top.
However, a Notice dated 25th April, 2011, was issued to the
Respondent No. 5 and copy of the same was marked to the Tehsildar,
Bhor before occurrence of the incident. The Collector, Pune was
requested to look into the matter. The authorities were thus, asked to
take appropriate steps for stoppage of illegal activity in order to avoid
major mishap and to ensure not to occur. They stated that one Mrs.
Vishakha Vadekar, and her daughter died due to water flow, which
gushed from the hill top and poured on the road.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                   8</span>

<p id="p_18">14. We do not find any significant material to show that the Respondent
No. 9 (NHAI) has taken reasonable steps to avoid the untoward
incident. We do not find copies of the complaint made by NHAI to the
authority. Assuming for a moment that such communications were
made at the fag end of April, 2011, yet, it was responsibility of NHAI to
persuade said authority or the higher authority about inaction after
2011. The incident of raining in which Mrs. Vishakha Vadekar and her
daughter had flown away, is said to have occurred on 10th July, 2013.
Obviously, the Respondent No. 9, appears to have kept silence for
about two (2) years, inspite of knowledge that the work of hill cutting
was going on. In our opinion, NHAI (Respondent No. 9) perhaps was
likely to be impliedly benefited due to the illegal act of hill cutting due
to availability of murum, stones and soil for the work for its project.
The contractor of NHAI was, therefore, interested in keeping the
fingers crossed.
</p><p id="p_19">15. Considering probability and circumstances appearing on record,
we have no hesitation in holding that there took place degradation of
environment to large extent due to hill cutting at Katraj. We have
further no hesitation in holding that the hill cutting occurred due to
illegal acts of the Respondent Nos. 5, 6 and with or due to act of
omission of the Respondent No. 9. They are liable to pay compensation
to the legal representatives of the victims of incident in question. They
are also liable to pay restitution charges and penalty for causing
damage to the environment, in order to avoid such incident in future.
</p><p id="p_20">16. We deem it proper to give certain further directions to the
concerned authority. In keeping with these findings, we direct:
</p><p id="p_21">17. a) The Respondent Nos. 5, 6 and 9 shall pay amount of Rs. 50

Rathod, the NHAI and three other appellants (Patel India Pvt Ltd, Fern
Constructions (India) Ltd and D.B. Realty Ltd.) have preferred appeals against the
impugned order of the NGT; their grievance is from the general directions issued in
the impugned order, implicating buildings near hills.
</p>
<p id="p_27">13.   In the second set of matters, i.e. the appeals by special leave, the facts are
that acting on the directions of the NGT, the State of Maharashtra invoked its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                         10</span>

powers under Section 154 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act,
1966 (for short "MRTP Act") and directed, by a notification/circular dated
14.11.2017 that development (relating to construction) was impermissible in an
area abutting hills up to 100 feet.
</p>
<p id="p_28">14.   By the impugned common judgment, the High Court held that there was no
denial that the power to issue such directions or circulars existed by way of the
amended <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_5">Section 154</a> and that such power was essential. The court further held that
no individual or entity could claim any absolute right and contend that he could
develop or construct anywhere and that the directions contained in the notification
supplemented bye-laws and building codes already in place in Mumbai and Pune.
It was also observed that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">        “In Regulation 2 we have the definitions and as far as Part II is
        concerned, that is general planning and building requirements.
        Regulation 11.1 says that no piece of land shall be used as site for
        construction of building if the site is hilly and having gradient more
        than 1:5. Thus, these stipulations are already in place. What the
        National Green Tribunal brought to the notice of the authorities is in-</blockquote>
<p id="p_29">        discriminable cutting of hills in the Katraj Ghat. This unauthorized
        construction by breaking of hills resulted in an accident. That is why
        the NGT directed that on hill tops and hill slopes and the portion at the
        foot of the hill and surrounding 100 feet, no construction activity
        should be permitted and no development permission be issued and
        such directions be issued to the Municipal Corporations and
        Municipal Councils. Bearing in mind that there are in place legal
        provisions restricting the development activity on hill top and hill
        slope zones, all that the NGT and this Government Resolution directs
        is that in cases where there has already been a permitted development
        activity within 100 feet of the hill, then, no permission for additional
        construction be granted nor any development be permitted by
        sanctioning additional Floor Space Index (FSI) or Transferable
        Development Rights (TDR). In the event in sanctioned development
        plans if area of the above nature is in buildable zone, then, for
        carrying out development in such zone and while granting individual
        development permissions, an area of 100 feet surrounding the hills
        should be demarcated as non-buildable. It can be used as open space,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                  11</span>

road etc. We are surprised that an order and direction of the NGT
traceable to and in accordance with the planning law it challenged
before us. Further, the directions of the State Government, which are
but reiteration of the existing regulations, are under challenge. The
impugned Government Resolution is in consonance with the provisions
of the MRTP Act and the constitutional mandate enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_6">Article
21</a> and <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_7">48</a> thereof.
</p><p id="p_30">24. We are not in agreement with Dr. Sathe, Mr. Godbole and Dr. Saraf
that merely because such directions are issued in exercise of the
powers conferred by sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_8">section 154</a>, the development
Plan for the limits of the Municipal Corporations, namely Pune and
Mumbai is altered or modified. We are also not impressed by their
argument that by such a Government Resolution, a modification is
brought about in the Development Control Regulations and all this is
without recourse to the specific powers conferred by the MRTP Act. In
other words, these are bypassed and by a Government Resolution, the
above stand amended. In that regard our attention has been invited to
the provisions in the MRTP Act enabling modifications or changes in
the Development Plan and the procedure prescribed in that behalf.
</p><p id="p_31">25. We do not see any modification to the plan being brought about by
the subject Government Resolution. If at all, the directions therein
complement the provisions of the Development Control Regulations for
the cities of the Mumbai and Pune or the concerned Municipal
Corporation/Municipal Council areas. As it is, there was no permission
to construct buildings other than a electric sub-stations, water works
etc. on hill tops. As far as these slopes are concerned, by their very
nature, a hill slides down and if the slope is steep, then, no
construction activity can be carried out. There is no guarantee or
assurance that any construction activity in such areas would be able to
withstand a landslide or accidents, resulting from erosion of the hills
on account of natural reasons. It is experienced that human
intervention is necessarily not responsible for a landslide, mudslide
etc. On account of natural causes and calamities, such events can
occur. Apart from that, the occurrence increases because of human
intervention including a construction activity carried out at the foot of
the hill or on top thereof. It is also possible if the hill is cut from its
sides indiscriminately. It is also possible if there is damage to a hill
while extracting minor minerals. The hill then becomes uneven. Then,
it is not possible to prevent any calamity. Hence, in order to take care
of the natural calamities and which have occurred in various places in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                           12</span>

          the State of Maharashtra recently and also on account of unrestricted
          and unregulated breaking and cutting of the hills resulting in accidents
          endangering human life and safety that these supplemental directions
          have been issued. If they are for efficient administration of the Act and
          if they subserve larger public interest, then no fault can be found with
          the Government Resolution. Each of the operative directions, namely,
          serial Nos. 1, 2 and 3 of this Government Resolution subserve this
          object and purpose. If the Government Resolution has been issued after
          the attention of the Government has been invited to an accident in
          Katraj Ghat occurring due to unauthorized and illegal cutting of hills,
          then, it is not as if the State Government has construed it as a
          command or a binding order and issued the subject Government
          Resolution. The attention of the State Government being invited to such
          illegal and unauthorized so also uncontrolled, unregulated and
          unrestricted hill-cutting, that in order to prevent the same, the
          Government stepped in. It took recourse to its power conferred by
          section 154 of the MRTP Act in order to prevent future occurrences of
          this nature. If accidents and calamities can be prevented by timely
          intervention of the State Government in this manner, then, we do not
          think that on the specious and unsubstantiated pleas of the petitioners,
          we should strike down the Government Resolution.”
</p><p id="p_32">15.      The NHAI in its appeal contends that the NGT fell into error in issuing
sweeping directions against it without considering that was no evidence to
establish that it was in any way responsible for the degradation of the environment,
which led to the tragedy. It is urged by Senior Counsel Mr P.S. Narasimha that the
NGT’s findings are contrary to established facts and have also resulted in grave
miscarriage of justice. He highlighted that there was no material on record to
establish that the NHAI was in any way culpable or had failed to perform a public
duty or neglected to avert a foreseeable calamity. Elaborating on this, it was urged
that the illegal mining activity was not carried on within the right-of-way or the
carriageway of the highway. What occurred was the result of an act of God, i.e.
extremely heavy rains, which resulted in flooding on the highway caused entirely
on account of the debris collected which acted to obstruct the smooth flow of
water.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                          13</span>

<p id="p_33">16.   It was highlighted that in any case, the NHAI could not be held responsible
or made liable for the occurrence which led to the tragedy. Mr Narasimha also
argued that the NGT did not return any finding that the construction of the highway
was in any way contrary to environmental clearances or permissions secured by the
NHAI. Therefore, the findings of the Tribunal in so far as they pertained to the
neglect or alleged omission of the NHAI, were contrary to law. He urged that the
findings were illogical and irrational, and deserve to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_34">17.   The NHAI also highlights that it wrote letters to the local administration on
24.04.2011 and 15.07.2011, seeking its intervention on account of the illegal
mining and activities and hill destruction, for which Rathod was responsible.
However, the State government did not take any action. Likewise, Rathod did not
take any remedial steps or cease the activity. The resultant tragedy entirely on
account of the omissions of the state's authorities to take action and the neglect and
culpable negligence on the part of Rathod, was the cause of the tragedy and the
events which led to the loss of two lives. It was also emphasized that the direction
to pay compensation was contrary to legal principles and undermined the law. It
was argued that neither the NHAI nor its concessionaire had any control over the
activities of the state, which granted the mining licences. Rathod, the licensee, had
continued illegal mining in the vicinity causing the accumulation of debris. This in
turn, resulted in the obstruction of a culvert which resulted in collection of a large
volume of water. A huge sheet of water gushed out into the highway, sweeping
away the car, tragically resulting in the death of two individuals. It was argued that
in these circumstances, the NHAI could not be saddled with the responsibility of
either paying damages to the dependents and legal representatives of the deceased
nor could it be made liable to restore the environment through the payment of ₹ 50
lakhs or any part of it.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                         14</span>

<p id="p_35">18.   Rathod urges that the NGT’s findings against him are contrary to law. He
argues that the NGT did not implead those who had standing, i.e. the legal
representatives of the deceased; in fact, they had filed a civil suit, claiming
compensation against him, as well as the NHAI and the state, for alleged
negligence and tortious liability. In those proceedings, the court is bound to record
evidence and render findings based on the facts. The NGT could not thus have
unilaterally, based on a one-sided view of the materials, held that he was liable.
</p>
<p id="p_36">19.   It was submitted that the allegation that Rathod was primarily responsible
for degradation of the hill, which clogged the culverts and water channels,
resulting in the tragedy, was contrary to the facts. Mr. Vijay Verma, counsel for
Rathod, relied on some portions of the magisterial report to say that the NHAI had
the report of an independent engineer, who had pointed to certain deficiencies on
the part of the concessionaire. Therefore, to hold him responsible for the tragedy,
and direct him to pay a huge sum of ₹ 15 lakh and further pay amounts towards
environmental damage, was unwarranted.
</p>
<p id="p_37">20.   It was argued that the NGT could not have issued directions with respect to
payment of any sums, in the absence of any application by the legal representatives
of the deceased. It is further argued in Rathod’s appeal that apart from issuing
notice for recovery of amounts towards alleged illegal mining, neither the state
authorities nor the NHAI took any positive remedial action for strengthening the
culvert and the catch water drains which were in disrepair, and constructed on the
hill above the tunnel for drainage of rainwater. The masonry on the culvert for
draining water was choked due to lack of maintenance. Such maintenance was the
sole responsibility of the concessionaire and for that, the NHAI had to be held
liable. It is also highlighted that Section 18 of the NGT Act mandates that the
procedure established by the statute to exercise jurisdiction had to be followed.
Since the legal heirs of the deceased had not applied to the NGT for any relief and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                         15</span>

had instead approached the civil court claiming compensation on account of wilful
neglect and culpable inaction on the part of NHAI, the NGT ought to have left the
matter for proper decision in accordance with the evidence led. Instead the NGT
took upon itself the task of a judging the appellant as one of those responsible for
the incident. It is emphasised that the mining activity carried on was in accordance
with the license and if there was any irregularity that was cured on payment of
fine. So far as the collection of debris which ultimately led to the overflow of water
and the deaths of two individuals goes, it is argued that the proper functioning of
the drainage system would have ensured that such collection of vast quantities of
water would not have occurred. Therefore, the inaction of the NHAI in taking
timely action and intervening with the state authorities, led to the tragic incident.
The responsibility for this incident could not have been placed at the doorstep of
Rathod. The actions of Rathod, it is stated were too remote and could not have
been the subject of damages at all.
</p>
<p id="p_38">21.   In the appeals (by special leave as well as the statutory appeals by third
parties), where the grievance is on account of the directions issued by the State of
Maharashtra under Section 154 of the MRTP Act, the third party appellants
challenge the order of the NGT arguing that the provisions of the NGT Act,
especially <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_9">sections 14</a>, and <a href="/doc/118523255/" id="a_10">19</a> do not authorise that tribunal to issue sweeping and
unilateral directions requiring stoppage and cessation of all manner of building
activity or developments within hundred feet of hill slopes. It is highlighted that
such sweeping directions are illogical and are not based on any scientific study or
analysis. It is argued that the NGT has issued general directions couched in a vague
manner in para 17 (e) of its order.
</p>
<p id="p_39">22.   These appellants argue that the Bombay High Court also fell into error and
did not appreciate that the entire basis of the Directions/Resolution of 14.11.2017
by the State of Maharashtra were the directions issued by the NGT. Highlighting
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                          16</span>

various provisions of the MRTP Act, learned counsel argued that wherever
development codes were formulated, they were in accordance with established
principles, after following the prescribed procedure. Based upon these codes and
the building regulations framed by various town planning departments, clearances
and permissions/approval for development and construction were issued. It was
argued that the mandatory and sweeping nature of the directions in para 17 (e) by
the NGT has resulted in these directions being embodied in the impugned
resolution, which has a catastrophic effect on those clearances.
</p>
<p id="p_40">23.   Learned senior counsel, Mr. Shyam Divan, highlights that apart from the fact
that the definition of ‘hill’ is vague, and even the regulations under the MRTP Act
are silent in this regard, the NGT failed to consider that the impact of its directions
and the impugned notification, in hilly terrains where the population is
concentrated in particular areas, in small towns, semi urban and rural areas would
be devastating inasmuch as all nature of buildings would be banned. It is pointed
out that hill development is based upon consideration of individual local soil
conditions, the stability of the surrounding terrain, etc. All these are taken into
account by individual local town planning authorities when they permit or refuse
permission to individual development or construction projects. The uniform
adoption of the “no construction within the hundred feet area” rule, it is submitted,
is completely contrary to well-established principles of town planning.
</p>
<p id="p_41">24.   It is argued that the directions issued by the state government impugned in
the writ petitions before the Bombay High Court, are contrary to the provisions of
the MRTP Act inasmuch as they amount to supplanting provisions of the existing
master plan and other development codes, which have the force of law and were
framed after widespread consultations. It is pointed out that the provisions of the
MRTP Act require that any change in such codes or master plans would have to be
made after mandatory due consideration of objections, which are to be preceded by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                            17</span>

publication of the proposals. By directing the state government to follow the order
in paragraph 17(e), the NGT in fact made directions contrary to law. It is argued
that the state also acted contrary to the express provisions of the MRTP Act
inasmuch as it did not follow the procedure required by the Act to change the
master plan and the development codes.
</p>
<p id="p_42">25.       It is further submitted that the NGT’s directions were the basis of the state
government's notification. It was argued that the state government’s blind
adherence to these directions amounted to abdication of its duties, was in
contravention of express provisions of the MRTP Act and also amounted to acting
on the dictates of another authority. It was submitted that for these reasons, the
impugned notification cannot be sustained. Counsel relied on the decision of this
court in <a href="/doc/126942623/" id="a_11">Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board v. Sterlite Industries (I) Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>. 2
to highlight that the NGT has a narrow and circumscribed jurisdiction in regard to
issuing directions as well as ordering compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_43">26.       The Lokmanch justified the order of the NGT and blamed the NHAI, the
concessionaire, Rathod and the state government for not taking adequate and
timely measures in public interest. It is alleged that proper channels were not
created and maintained alongside the highway to avoid water clogging on the main
carriageway. It is argued that existing water channels were extremely narrow and
were incapable of handling significant volumes, and that even those channels were
clogged due to construction debris which had fallen on the sides. It is pointed out
that under <a href="/doc/343012/" id="a_12">Section 4</a> of the National Highways Act, 1956 (hereafter “<a href="/doc/1222415/" id="a_13">Highways
Act</a>”) “highways” include lands appurtenant thereto, all bridges, culverts, tunnels,
causeways and other structures constructed on or over the highway and all fences,
trees, posts, etc. The duty of keeping them in good repair, clearly was that of the
NHAI and the concessionaire.

<p id="p_45">27.   So far as the Rathod’s role is concerned, learned counsel, Ms. Shilpa
Chohan, submitted that the NGT acted well within its rights and acted within its
jurisdiction in entertaining and proceeding with the application, under <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_14">Sections 14</a>
read with 16 and 18 of the NGT Act. The Lokmanch sought mandatory injunction
to restore the natural contour at the foot base of the hills, particularly the hill that
was destroyed by the private respondents. It was submitted that apart from the
enquiry report of the magistrate /sub-divisional officer, a report was also
commissioned by the NGT through the local tehsildar; that report dated
15.09.2014 disclosed that unauthorised hill destruction under the pretext of minor
mineral extraction was widespread during 2011-2013. This report showed that as
many as 62 cases of hill destruction (mostly indulged in by developers), came to
light. Many of these occurred without obtaining any permit or authorisation and
were plainly illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_46">28.   It is argued further that the private respondents were permitted to extract
minor minerals only for a short period. However, they exceeded not only the
permit, but also went further and destroyed the hill for the purpose of mining
minerals. This over-mining as well as hill destruction was not within the
permission or the terms of the license. It is highlighted that “hill cutting” or hill
destruction causes shortening of hills, poses a potential danger of soil erosion and
reduces vegetation, forestry, flora and fauna, and deprives natural support to the
earth, therefore ultimately posing an environmental hazard to nearby areas,
including residential areas. It is argued that the destruction of hills results in the
distortion of the flow of streams and rivers, which change their courses resulting in
heavy loss to human life and also to flora and fauna, besides at times, destruction
of property. It is submitted that the NGT's decision requiring payment of
compensation was within its jurisdiction; to support this, learned counsel relied
upon the provisions of Schedule II to the NGT Act, particularly referring to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                          19</span>

heads of compensation relief for damages that can be claimed and granted, i.e.
death, permanent, temporary, or total, or partial disability or other injury, damages
to private property, expenses incurred by the government for any administrative or
legal action, or to cope with any harm or damage, including compensation for
environmental degradation and restoration of the quality of the environment. It was
submitted that the statutory basis for calculating these damages under Schedule II
to the NGT Act is provided by <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_15">Section 15</a>, which empowers the NGT to provide
relief and compensation to victims of pollution in terms of Schedule I for
restitution of property, restitution of environment, and also importantly <a href="/doc/139918683/" id="a_16">Section 17</a>,
which empowers the NGT to direct the payment of compensation on account of
death of or injury to any person or damage to property, under all any of the heads
specified in Schedule II, which is the result of any accident or is an adverse impact
of any activity or operational process. It is submitted that there is nothing in the
enactment which confines the jurisdiction of the NGT to adjudicate complaints,
especially those relating to fatalities caused by environmental damage, to
applications initiated by legal representatives or persons directly affected. It is
submitted that if a particular accident or incident is so widespread as to affect an
entire area, it would be well within the jurisdiction of the NGT to entertain an
application made by anyone. Learned counsel highlighted the difference in
phraseology between <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_17">Sections 15</a> and <a href="/doc/139918683/" id="a_18">17</a> on the one hand, and <a href="/doc/175098716/" id="a_19">Section 18</a> on the
other. It is submitted that <a href="/doc/99517951/" id="a_20">Section 18(2)</a> clearly is without prejudice to the
provisions contained in <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_21">Section 16</a> and primary jurisdiction can be invoked by the
Tribunal upon being moved by anyone in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_47">29.       Ms. Chohan cited the decision of this court in Mantri Technoze Pvt. Ltd. v
Forward Foundation3 to say that the NGT could legitimately issue directions
which are binding on all other statutory authorities. She also relied on <a href="/doc/161532715/" id="a_22">Section 33</a>

of the NGT Act, emphasizing that the enactment overrides all other enactments.
Reliance was also placed on the decision in <a href="/doc/52367199/" id="a_25">Hanuman Laxman Aroskar v. Union of
India</a>.4

</p><p id="p_48">30.      The State of Maharashtra supported the arguments made on behalf of the
Lokmanch. It was pointed out that the jurisdiction to issue general directions to
preserve and protect the environment, through restitution orders is found in Section
15(1)(c) of the NGT Act. It is also submitted that the power and jurisdiction to
order compensation in the case of death, is independent and can be invoked in case
of fatal accidents, as is evident from the provisions of Schedule II. The state further
argues that the judgment of the Bombay High Court too is unexceptionable,
inasmuch as it correctly appreciated and upheld the exercise of regulatory power
under Section 154 of the MRTP Act. Counsel urged that the said provision was
amended in 2015 and in the absence of any challenge to it, the exercise of power
after due consideration of relevant factors, could not be countenanced.

<p id="p_49">The Issues

</p><p id="p_50">31.      Four issues arise for consideration. Firstly, the jurisdiction of the NGT to
award compensation; secondly the merits and soundness of the NGT’s decision to
award compensation and the legal principles applicable; thirdly, the NGT’s wide
directions with respect to the ban on construction in and around foothills and lastly,
the vires of the directions/notifications issued under <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_26">Section 154</a>, MRTP Act.

Under <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_61">Section 14</a>, the NGT has the power to adjudicate upon disputes relating to
“civil cases where a substantial question relating to environment (including
enforcement of any legal right relating to environment), is involved” relating to the
implementation of “the enactments specified in Schedule I” [<a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_62">Section 14</a> (1)]. The
other provisions [<a href="/doc/139274824/" id="a_63">Sections 14(2)</a> and (3)] are incidental to the primary jurisdiction
under <a href="/doc/174072768/" id="a_64">Section 14(1)</a>. <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_65">Section 15</a>, on the other hand, is couched in wide terms.
<a href="/doc/177298014/" id="a_66">Section 15(1)</a> provides that compensation or damages can be given by the NGT to
“victims of pollution and other environmental damage arising under the
enactments specified in the Schedule I” [<a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_67">Section 15</a> (1)(a)]; for restitution of

prescribes the period of limitation for applications. <a href="/doc/129625484/" id="a_72">Section 15(4)</a> enables the NGT
to, having regard to the damage to public health, property and environment,

      “divide the compensation or relief payable under separate heads

restitutionary directions in cases where the violation (i.e. harm caused due to
pollution or exposure to hazards, etc.) are the result of infraction of any enactment
listed in the first schedule. Yet, that, interpretation, in the opinion of this court, is
not warranted.
</p>
<p id="p_95">37.    The reference to Schedule II, in <a href="/doc/129625484/" id="a_84">Section 15(4)</a> is not merely by way of events
which are actionable in relation to harm caused due to the acts resulting in
violation of any enactment under Schedule I. The wide language of that provision
enables the tribunal (NGT) to direct, inter alia, payment of compensation, “having
regard to the damage to public health, property and environment”. This
interpretation is borne out by a reading of <a href="/doc/5956797/" id="a_85">Section 17(2)</a> regarding the
apportionment of liability for payment of compensation.

<p id="p_96">38.    In the decision of this court reported as <a href="/doc/870673/" id="a_86">Hinch Lal Tiwari v. Kamala Devi5</a>,
this court held that ponds constituted public utility and were meant for common

filling up of ponds was illegal. Recently, in <a href="/doc/36215757/" id="a_87">Jitendra Singh v. Ministry of

It may thus be observed that minerals have been classified into major
and minor minerals based on their end use rather than level of
production, level of mechanisation, export and import, etc. There do
exist some minor mineral mines of silica sand and limestone where the
scale of mechanisation and level of production is much higher than
those of industrial mineral mines. Further, in terms of the economic
cost and revenue, it has been estimated that the total value of minor
minerals constitutes about 10% of the total value of mineral
production whereas the value of non-metallic minerals comprises only
3%. It is, therefore, evident that the operation of mines of minor
minerals need to be subject to some regulatory parameters as that of
mines of major minerals.
</p>
<p id="p_109">     Further, unlike India there does not exist any such system based
on end usage in other countries for classifying minerals into major
and minor categories. Thus, there is a need to relook at the definition
of ‘minor minerals’ per se.
</p>
<p id="p_110">     It is, therefore, recommended that the Ministry of Mines along
with Indian Bureau of Mines, in consultation with the State
Governments may re-examine the classification of minerals into major
and minor categories so that the regulatory aspects and environment
mitigation measures are appropriately integrated for ensuring
sustainable and scientific mining with least impacts on environment.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                  36</span>

      At present, most of the State Governments have not made it
 mandatory for preparation of mining plan in respect of minor
 minerals. In some States like Rajasthan, eco-friendly mining plans are
 prepared, which are approved by the State Mining Department. The
 eco-friendly mining plans so prepared, though conceptually welcome,
 are observed to be deficient and need to be made comprehensive in a
 manner as is being done for major minerals. Besides, the aspects of
 reclamation and rehabilitation of mined out areas, progressive mine
 closure plan, as in vogue for major minerals could be introduced for
 minor minerals as well.
</p>
<p id="p_112">      It is recommended that provision for preparation and approval of
 mine plan, as in the case of major minerals may appropriately be
 provided in the rules governing the mining of minor minerals by the
 respective State Governments. These should specifically include the
 provision for reclamation and rehabilitation of mined out area,
 progressive mine closure plan and post mine land use.
</p>
<p id="p_113"> 4.6. Creation of separate corpus for reclamation/rehabilitation of
 mines of minor minerals

 Mining of minor minerals, in our country, is by and large an
 unorganised sector and is practised in haphazard and unscientific
 manner. At times, the size of the leasehold is also too small to address
 the issue of reclamation and rehabilitation of mined out areas. It may,
 therefore, be desirable that before the concept of mine closure plan for
 minor minerals is adopted, the existing abandoned mines may be
 reclaimed and rehabilitated with the involvement of the State
 Government. There is thus, a need to create a separate corpus, which
 may be utilised for reclamation and rehabilitation of mined out areas.
 The respective State Governments may work out a suitable mechanism
 for creation of such corpus on the ‘polluter pays’ principle. An
 organisational structure may also need to be created for undertaking
 and monitoring these activities.

4.8. Uniform minor mineral concession rules
 The economic value of the minor minerals excavated in the country is
 estimated to contribute to about 9% of the total value of the minerals
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                 37</span>

whereas the non-metallic minerals contribute to about 2.8%. Keeping
in view the large extent of mining of minor minerals and its significant
potential to adversely affect the environment, it is recommended that
model mineral concession rules may be framed for minor minerals as
well and the minor minerals may be subjected to a simpler regulatory
regime, which is, however, similar to major minerals regime.

 5.0. Conclusion
</pre><p id="p_116">Mining of minor minerals, though individually, because of smaller
size of mine leases is perceived to have lesser impact as compared to
mining of major minerals. However, the activity as a whole is seen to
have significant adverse impacts on environment. It is, therefore,
necessary that the mining of minor minerals is subjected to simpler
but strict regulatory regime and carried out only under an approved
framework of mining plan, which should provide for reclamation and
rehabilitation of the mined out areas. Further, while granting mining
leases by the respective State Governments location of any eco-fragile
zone(s) within the impact zone of the proposed mining area, the linked
rules/notifications governing such zones and the judicial
pronouncements, if any, need be duly noted. The Union Ministry of
Mines along with the Indian Bureau of Mines and respective State
Governments should therefore make necessary provisions in this
regard under the Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_136">Regulation)
Act</a>, 1957, Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 and adopt model
guidelines to be followed by all States.”

</p><p id="p_117">20. The Report clearly indicates that operation of mines of minor
minerals needs to be subjected to strict regulatory parameters as that
of mines of major minerals. It was also felt necessary to have a relook
to the definition of “minor minerals” per se. The necessity of the
preparation of “comprehensive mines plan” for contiguous stretches
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                38</span>

<p id="p_118">21. Further, it was also recommended that the States, Union
Territories would see that mining of minor minerals is subjected to
simpler but strict regulatory regime and carried out only under an
approved framework of mining plan, which should provide for
reclamation and rehabilitation of mined out areas. Mining plan
should take note of the level of production, level of mechanisation,
type of machinery used in the mining of minor minerals, quantity of
diesel consumption, the number of trees uprooted, export and import
of mining minerals, environmental impact, restoration of flora and
host of other matters referred to in the 2010 Rules. A proper
framework has also to be evolved on cluster of mining of minor
minerals for which there must be a Regional Environmental
Management Plan. Another important decision taken was that while
granting of mining leases by the respective State Governments,
location of any eco-fragile zone(s) within the impact zone of the
proposed mining area, the linked rules/notifications governing such
zones and the judicial pronouncements, if any, need to be duly noted.

</p><p id="p_122">50.        By virtue of a notification,15 environmental clearance is necessary even for
minor mineral extraction where the area of operation is less than 5 hectares; the
procedure has been outlined under Appendix XI of that notification. Clearly,
therefore, mining of even minor minerals, when resorted to on a large scale (i.e.
where more than a few leases or permits are granted), has a potential impact on the
environment. In the facts of this case, the state had granted no less than 62 minor
mineral permits in the vicinity; unauthorized activity (in the form inter alia, of
over-mining and piling of debris) had resulted in the imposition of the penalty.
Clearly, there was violation of the EPA in the present case, because Rathod’s
mining lease covered an area in excess of 5 hectares; it fell within the regulatory
notification of 2006. There is nothing on record to show that the relevant clearance
was obtained by Rathod. Plainly, therefore, the facts of the present case disclosed
violation of the EPA- an enactment listed in Schedule I of the NGT Act. This meant
that the NGT’s jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/40240045/" id="a_139">Section 15(1)(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/139918683/" id="a_140">Section 17</a> could not have
been disputed.
</p>
<p id="p_123">51.        This court is of the considered opinion that the expression “environment”
and “environmental pollution” have to be given a broader meaning, having regard
to Parliamentary intent to ensure the objective of the EPA. It effectuates the
principles underlying <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_141">Article 48A</a> of the Constitution of India. The EPA is in
essence, an umbrella legislation enacting a broad framework for the central
government to coordinate the activities of various central and state authorities
established under other laws, such as the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_142">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_143">Air Act</a>. The EPA also
effectively enunciates the critical legislative policy for environment protection. It
changes the narrative and emphasis from a narrow concept of pollution control to a
wider facet of environment protection. The expansive definition of environment

that includes water, air and land “and the interrelation which exist among and
between water, air and land, other human creatures, plants, micro-organisms and
property” give an indication of the wide powers conferred on the Central
Government. A wide net is cast over the environment related laws. The EPA also
empowers the central government to comprehensively control environmental
pollution by industrial and related activities. For these reasons, and in view of the
above discussion, it is held that the NGT correctly assumed jurisdiction, having
regard to the nature of the accident in the facts of this case.

<p id="p_124">II.    Was the direction to pay compensation towards death, and damages towards
restitution justified?
</p><p id="p_125">52.   In the present case, the deceased were concededly travelling on the highway.
The incident of flooding occurred, and was caused due to clogging of the water
channels. The report of the sub divisional magistrate indicated that the Inspecting
Engineer (Arvi Associates, a firm) had given a report after inspection. On behalf of
the independent engineering firm appointed by the NHAI, an oral deposition was
given before the sub-divisional officer. It was stated that the roadside channel and
culvert from where water is disposed of, had been rendered screen blinded and a
pipeline of 1.2 m diameter existed there for disposal of water. The necessity of
remedial action was communicated to the concessionaire, before the occurrence of
the accident. It was also stated that in terms of the instructions of the NHAI, the
concessionaire was informed about the deficiency on 15.05.2013 and by a further
letter dated 04.06.2013. An action plan for completing pre-monsoon work was
sought from the concessionaire. However, the concessionaire did not submit an
action plan despite lapse of one month.
</p>
<p id="p_126">53.   The SDO’s report noted that the culvert had been constructed from the new
tunnel and was existing from 2004. Apparently a 1m diameter pipe was positioned
in the culvert and had made a causeway. One hotel also had constructed an

approach road and placed a 950 MM pipe. The existing drainage capacity of the
octroi post and the hotel was insufficient due to heavy rains as a result of which
rainwater was not totally drained. This water started accumulating on the road.
Certain ramps were also constructed by Tata Motors for its convenience; they were
removed by the concessionaire; nevertheless, the ramps were prepared again. The
existing cross drainage provision was of a sub-culvert -type structure and the size
at the time of the old highway was 1m x 1 m. The report further observed that the
natural drainage and sides of hills of the highway was adversely affected and had
been tampered with. The disposal of water on the right side overhead of the tunnel
through the cross train on the old highway via the catch drain and subsequently the
channels for the water flow were choked due to development work and adversely
affected the clearance of rain water. The report indicates that after the accident on
06.06.2013, the local administration cleared the debris which had created
obstacles, to facilitate the free flow of water into the catch drain culvert and further
flow of water.

</blockquote><p id="p_129">56.        Acting in furtherance of its powers, the NHAI entered into an agreement
with the concessionaire for the construction, operation and maintenance of the
highway in question (i.e. the stretch of 140 kms on which the accident occurred).
The question is whether the NHAI, which indisputably owns and controls the
highway, and on whose behalf it was constructed, and for which the maintenance
and operation agreement was entered into, led to a duty of care, to the users (of the
highway).
</p>
<p id="p_130">57.        This issue had arisen in <a href="/doc/1075762/" id="a_148">Rajkot Municipal Corpn. v. Manjulben Jayantilal
Nakum16</a> in the context of certain facts. The deceased used to travel on a railway
season ticket to Rajkot to attend to his office work. One day whilst he was on the
footpath on the way to his office, a roadside tree suddenly fell on him, resulting in
serious injuries on the head and other parts of the body, and later died in the
hospital. The High Court allowed the writ petition. This court noted the distinction
between a common law duty of care owed to members of the public, and whether
liability could be imposed upon a local authority for breach of its statutory duty.
The court noticed previous English decisions17 and stated that
            “18. The question emerges as to when would the breach of statutory
            duty under a particular enactment give rise to tortious liability? The
            statutory duty gives rise to civil action. The statutory negligence is sui
            generis and independent of any other form of tortious liability. It
            would, therefore, be of necessity to find out from the construction of
            each statutory duty whether the particular duty is general duty in
            public law or private law duty towards the plaintiff. The plaintiff must
            show that (a) the injury suffered is within the ambit of statute; (b)
            statutory duty imposes a liability for civil action; (c) the statutory duty
            was not fulfilled; and (d) the breach of duty has caused him injury.
            These essentials are required to be considered in each case. The
            action for breach of statutory duty may belong to the category of
            either strict or absolute liability which is required, therefore, to be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                  44</span>

considered in the nature of statutory duty the defendant owes to the
plaintiff; whether or not the duty is absolute; and the public policy
underlying the duty. In most cases, the statute may not give rise to
cause of action unless it is breached and it has caused damage to the
plaintiff, though occasionally the statute may make breach of duty
actionable per se. The burden, therefore, is on the plaintiff to prove on
balance of probabilities that the defendant owes that duty of care to
the plaintiff or class of persons to whom he belongs, that defendant
was negligent in the performance or omission of that duty and breach
of duty caused or materially contributed to his injury and that duty of
care is owed on the defendant. If the statute requires certain
protection on the principle of volenti non fit injuria, the liability
stands excluded. The breach of duty created by a statute, if it results in
damage to an individual prima facie, is tort for which the action for
damages will lie in the suit. One would often take the Act, as a whole,
to find out the object of the law and to find out whether one has a
right and remedy provided for breach of duty. It would, therefore, be
of necessity in every case to find the intention of legislature in
creating duty and the resultant consequences suffered from the action
or omission thereof, which are required to be considered. No action
for damages lies if on proper construction of statute, the intention is
that some other remedy is available. One of the tests in determining
the intention of the statute is to ascertain whether the duty is owed
primarily to the general public or community and only incidentally to
an individual or primarily to the individual or class of individuals and
only incidentally to the general public or the community. If the statute
aims at duty to protect a particular citizen or particular class of
citizens to which the plaintiff belongs, it prima facie creates at the
same time corelative right vested in those citizens of which plaintiff is
one; he has remedy for enforcement, namely, the action for damages
for any loss occasioned due to negligence or for failure of it. But this
test is not always conclusive.
</p>
<p id="p_131">19. Duty may be of such paramount importance that it is owed to all
the public. It would be wrong to think that on an action, the duty could
be enforced by way of damages when duty is owed to a section of
public and cannot be enforced if an individual sustains damages to
whom the Corporation owes no duty and no private interest is
infringed. Breach of statutory duty, therefore, requires to be examined
in the context in which the duty is created not towards the individual,
but has its effect on the right of individual vis-à-vis the society.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                  45</span>

<p id="p_132">Statutory duty generally is towards public at large and not towards an
individual or individuals and the corelative right is vested in the
public and not in private person, even though they may suffer
damages. The duty in such a case is to be enforced by way of criminal
prosecution or by way of injunction at the suit under Section 192 of
CPC or with leave of court under Order I, Rule 8 CPC by public-
spirited person or in any appropriate manner to enforce the right and
not by way of private action for damages. In that situation, the
legislature, while recognising the private right vested in an injured
individual, may intend that it shall be maintained solely by some
special remedy provided for a particular case and not by ordinary
method of an action for damages as penalty or compensation.

</p><p id="p_134">24. Generally, a public authority entrusted with no statutory
obligation to exercise a power, does not come under common law duty
of care to do so but by conduct the public authority may place itself in
such a situation that it attracts the duty of care which calls for
exercise of the power. Common illustration is provided by an action in
which an authority in the exercise of its functions, if it had created a
danger, thereby subjecting itself to a duty of care for the safety of
others which must be discharged by an exercise of its statutory power
or by giving necessary warnings. It is the conduct of the authority in
creating the danger that attracts the duty of care as envisaged in
Sheppard v. Borough of Glossop [(1921) 3 KB 132 : 1921 All ER Rep
61, CA] . The statute does not by itself give rise to a civil action but it
forms the formulation on which the common law can build a cause of
action….
</p><p id="p_135">  XXXXXX                 XXXXXX                      XXXXXX

</p><p id="p_136">39. It can be seen that ordinarily the principle of the law of negligence
applies to public authorities also. They are liable to damages because
by a negligent act or failure to act when they are under a duty to act
or for a failure to consider whether to exercise a power conferred on
them with the intention that it would be exercised if and when public
interest requires it. Where the public authority has decided to exercise
a power and has done it negligently a person who has acted in
reliance on what the public authority has done, may have no difficulty
in proving that the damages which he has suffered have been caused
by the negligence. Where the damage has resulted from a negligent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                           46</span>

         failure to act there may be greater difficulty in proving causation and
         requires examination in greater detail. …”
</p><p id="p_137">58.     In the UK, the duty of a highway authority was described by Diplock L.J. in
Griffiths v. Liverpool Corporation18 as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_54">          “The duty at common law to maintain, which includes a duty to repair
          a highway, was not based in negligence but in nuisance. It was an
          absolute duty to maintain, not merely a duty to take reasonable care to
          maintain, and the statutory duty which replaced it was also absolute.”
Again, Diplock, LJ stated in Burnside v. Emerson19 described the duty as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_55">          “in such good repair as renders it reasonably passable for the
          ordinary traffic of the neighbourhood at all seasons of the year
          without danger caused by its physical condition.”
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_56">59.     Later, in Haydon v. Kent County Council20 Lord Denning M.R. explained
that while the duty to maintain the highway meant an absolute duty to ensure that it
was in a condition to be used as a highway and to ensure safety, it did not include
the duty to ensure at all times that the road surface was kept clean. It was clarified
however, that the issue had to be considered in each case, and it was to be
considered whether the authority had taken reasonable steps to keep it in good
repair after being notified about obstruction:

<blockquote id="blockquote_57">          “If <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_149">section 41</a> is to be construed as capable of imposing a duty to take
          remedial measures to deal with ice and snow on a highway, or
          footway, which is in good physical repair, so that whether in
          particular circumstances that duty has arisen is to be decided ‘as a
          question of fact and degree,’ it would seem that the facts relevant to
          determining whether the duty has arisen would be essentially similar
          to those relevant to deciding whether a breach of the duty has been
          proved and whether the statutory defence under <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_150">section 58</a> has been
          made out. Parliament did not define those facts for the purpose of

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_58">60.        In Stovin v Wise21, the defendant emerged from a side road and ran down the
plaintiff, because she was not keeping a proper look-out. When she was sued for
damages, the defendant joined the County Council as a third party because the
visibility at the intersection was poor and they said that the Council, which had the
duty to maintain the road should have done something to improve it. The council
had statutory powers which would have enabled the necessary work to be done and
there was evidence that the relevant officers had decided in principle that it should
be done, but they had not taken steps to do it. The House of Lords held that there
was no duty of care in private law based on the statutory duty, and that “Drivers of
vehicles must take the highway network as they find it”. It was held that statutory
power could not be converted into a common law duty. The council had done
nothing which, apart from statute, would have attracted a common law duty of
care. It had done nothing at all. The only basis on which it was a candidate for
liability was that Parliament had entrusted it with general responsibility for the
highways and given it the power to improve them and take other measures for the
safety of their users. Lord Hoffmann observed,

            “In summary, therefore, I think that the minimum preconditions for
            basing a duty of care upon the existence of a statutory power, if it can
            be done at all, are, first, that it would in the circumstances have been
            irrational not to have exercised the power, so that there was in effect a
            public law duty to act, and secondly, that there are exceptional
            grounds for holding that the policy of the statute requires
            compensation to be paid to persons who suffer loss because the power
            was not exercised.”

per se extend to a private duty of care to take special measures, unless exceptional
features were proved, was followed in Gorringe v. Calderdale Metropolitan
Borough Council22. The entire law was re-examined and the correct position,
restated in a recent judgment by the UK Supreme Court in Robinson v. Chief
Constable of West Yorkshire Police23, which observed as follows:

            every act done without legal justification as any other citizen”: The
            Law of the Constitution, 3rd ed (1889), p 181. An important exception
            at common law was the Crown, but that exception was addressed by
            the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, <a href="/doc/146113629/" id="a_152">section 2</a>.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_60">            33. Accordingly, if conduct would be tortious if committed by a
            private person or body, it is generally equally tortious if committed by
            a public authority: see, for example, Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home
            Office [1970] AC 1004, as explained in Gorringe’s case 2004 (1)
            WLR 1057, para 39. That general principle is subject to the possibility
            that the common law or statute may provide otherwise, for example by
            authorising the conduct in question: Geddis v Proprietors of Bann
            Reservoir (1878) 3 App Cas 430. It follows that public authorities are
            generally under a duty of care to avoid causing actionable harm in
            situations where a duty of care would arise under ordinary principles
            of the law of negligence, unless the law provides otherwise.</blockquote>
<p id="p_139">            34. On the other hand, public authorities, like private individuals
            and bodies, are generally under no duty of care to prevent the
            occurrence of harm: as Lord Toulson JSC stated in Michael’s case
            [2015] AC 1732, para 97, “the common law does not generally
            impose liability for pure omissions”. This “omissions principle” has

been helpfully summarised by Tofaris and Steel, “Negligence Liability
for Omissions and the Police” [2016] CLJ 128:
</p><p id="p_140">“In the tort of negligence, a person A is not under a duty to take care
to prevent harm occurring to person B through a source of danger not
created by A unless (i) A has assumed a responsibility to protect B
from that danger, (ii) A has done something which prevents another
from protecting B from that danger, (iii) A has a special level of
control over that source of danger, or (iv) A’s status creates an
obligation to protect B from that danger.”
35 As that summary makes clear, there are certain circumstances in
which public authorities, like private individuals and bodies, can
come under a duty of care to prevent the occurrence of harm: see, for
example,
Barrett v Enfield London Borough Council [2001] 2 AC 550 and
Phelps v Hillingdon London Borough Council [2001] 2 AC 619, as
explained in Gorringe’s case 2004 (1) WLR 1057, paras 39–40. In the
absence of such circumstances, however, public authorities generally
owe no duty of care towards individuals to confer a benefit upon them
by protecting them from harm, any more than would a private
individual or body: see, for example, Smith v Littlewoods
Organisation Ltd [1987] AC 241, concerning a private body, applied
in Mitchell v Glasgow City Council [2009] AC 874, concerning a
public authority.
</p><p id="p_141">36 That is so, notwithstanding that a public authority may have
statutory powers or duties enabling or requiring it to prevent the harm
in question. A well known illustration of that principle is the decision
of the House of Lords in East Suffolk Rivers Catchment Board v Kent
[1941] AC 74. The position is different if, on its true construction, the
statutory power or duty is intended to give rise to a duty to individual
members of the public which is enforceable by means of a private
right of action. If, however, the statute does not create a private right
of action, then “it would be, to say the least, unusual if the mere
existence of the statutory duty [or, a fortiori, a statutory power] could
generate a common law duty of care”: Gorringe’s case 2004 (1) WLR
1057, para 23.

           40 However, until the reasoning in the Anns case was repudiated, it
           was not possible to justify a rejection of liability, where a prima facie
           duty of care arose at the first stage of the analysis from the
           foreseeability of harm, on the basis that public bodies are not
           generally liable for failing to exercise their statutory powers or duties
           so as to confer the benefit of protection from harm. Instead, it was
           necessary to have recourse to public policy in order to justify the
           rejection of liability at the second stage. That was accordingly the
           approach adopted by the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal in a
           series of judgments, including Hill’s case [1989] AC 53. The need to
           have recourse to public policy for that purpose has been superseded
           by the return to orthodoxy in Gorringe’s case. Since that case, a
           public authority’s non-liability for the consequences of an omission
           can generally be justified on the basis that the omissions principle is a
           general principle of the law of negligence, and the law of negligence
           generally applies to public authorities in the same way that it applies
           to private individuals and bodies.
</p><p id="p_143">           41 Equally, concerns about public policy cannot in themselves
           override a liability which would arise at common law for a positive
           act carried out in the course of performing a statutory function: the
           true question is whether, properly construed, the statute excludes the
           liability which would otherwise arise: see Gorringe’s case 2004 (1)
           WLR 1057, para 38, per Lord Hoffmann.
</p><p id="p_144">           42 That is not to deny that what might be described as policy
           considerations sometimes have a role to play in the law of negligence.
           As explained earlier, where established principles do not provide a
           clear answer to the question whether a duty of care should be
           recognised in a novel situation, the court will have to consider
           whether its recognition would be just and reasonable.”
</p><p id="p_145">62.       In Yetkin v. Mahmood24, where injury was caused to a highway user by
shrubs which had overgrown and impeded visibility, the court upheld the claim for
damages. The court observed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_61">           “…The planting of vegetation in the raised beds of the central
           reservation is obviously a reasonable exercise of the authority’s
           powers but to plant shrubs which will grow so large as to obscure the
           view and then not to ensure that they are trimmed back is a negligent
           exercise of those powers. The judge held that that failure was a cause

            of this accident. It is not suggested that he was not right so to hold. I
            have no doubt that, in the circumstances of this case, the local
            authority had a common law duty of care towards the claimant,
            notwithstanding her own negligence, that that duty was breached and
            that the breach was a cause of the accident. There was no need for the
            judge to consider whether the danger created by the bushes amounted
            to a trap or enticement. It follows in my judgment that the judge erred
            in dismissing the claim. He should have held that primary liability
            was established.”
</blockquote><p id="p_146">63.        A similar approach was indicated by this court in <a href="/doc/1233135/" id="a_153">Municipal Corpn. of Delhi
v. Sushila Devi25</a> (where a tree fell on a passer-by causing injury) the court upheld
the findings that the municipal corporation was liable, stating that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_62">            “13. By a catena of decisions, the law is well settled that if there is a
            tree standing on the defendant's land which is dried or dead and for
            that reason may fall and the defect is one which is either known or
            should have been known to the defendant, then the defendant is liable
            for any injury caused by the fall of the tree (see Brown v. Harrison
            [1947 WN 191 : 63 TLR 484], Quinn v. Scott [(1965) 1 WLR 1004 :
            (1965) 2 All ER 588] and Mackie v. Dumbartonshire County Council

            the side of the road whereon persons lawfully pass by, extends to
            guarding against what may happen just by the side of the premises on
            account of anything dangerous on the premises. The premises must be
            maintained in a safe state of repair. The owner/occupier cannot
            escape the liability for injury caused by any dangerous thing existing
            on the premises by pleading that he had employed a competent person
            to keep the premises in safe repairs. In Municipal Corpn. of Delhi v.</blockquote>
<p id="p_147">            Subhagwanti [AIR 1966 SC 1750] a clock tower which was 80 years'
            old collapsed in Chandni Chowk, Delhi causing the death of a number
            of persons. Their Lordships held that the owner could not be
            permitted to take a defence that he neither knew nor ought to have
            known the danger. “[T]he owner is legally responsible irrespective of
            whether the damage is caused by a patent or a latent defect,” — said
            their Lordships. In our opinion the same principle is applicable to the
            owner of a tree standing by the side of a road. If the tree is dangerous
            in the sense that on account of any disease or being dead the tree or
            its branch is likely to fall and thereby injure any passer-by then such a

            tree or branch must be removed so as to avert the danger to life. It is
            pertinent to note that it is not the defence of the Municipal
            Corporation that vis major or an act of God such as a storm, tempest,
            lightning or extraordinary heavy rain had occurred causing the fall of
            the branch of the tree and hence the Corporation was not liable.”

          This approach that a statutory corporation or local authority can be held
liable in tort for injury occasioned on account of omission to oversee, or defective
supervision of its activities contracted out to another agency, was also followed in
Vadodara Municipal Corporation v Purshottam V. Muranji26.
</p><p id="p_148">64.       The terms of the agreement which the NHAI entered into with the
concessionaire clearly contemplated the safety of highway users (Clause 18.1.1)
and an elaborate highway monitoring mechanism (Clause 19.1). The agreement
also required any unusual occurrences to be reported; an independent engineer was
required to, and did inspect the highway. The reports of the inspecting engineer
reveal that the deficiencies by way of narrowing of water channels, and the unusual
collection of debris, were noted. Even before the incident, the NHAI was alive to
this; it had separately written to Rathod, and later to the local administration about
it through its letter dated 15.04.2011. That letter is revealing; it inter alia, states
that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_63">                 “During pre-monsoon rains all the excavated muck has been
            carried to NH4 alongwith rain water and block Satara bound traffic
            lane for quite some time. The problem will be severe during heavy
            rains of July and August.

</blockquote><p id="p_149">65.       Having regard to the duty imposed on the NHAI by virtue of <a href="/doc/343012/" id="a_154">Sections 4</a> and
<a href="/doc/1713036/" id="a_155">5</a> of the Highways Act, read with Section 16 of the NHAI Act, there can be no

highway, including the stretch upon which the accident occurred. The report of the
sub-divisional officer clearly shows that inspection reports were furnished to the
NHAI shortly before the incident, highlighting the deficiencies; also, the NHAI’s
correspondence with Rathod, and the local administration, reveal that it was aware
of the danger and likelihood of risk to human life, and the foreseeability of the
event that actually occurred later. Further, letters addressed by the local
administration and the NHAI to Rathod similarly show that it was incumbent upon
him to take remedial action. The failure of the NHAI to ensure remedial action, and
likewise the failure by Rathod to take measures to prevent the accident, prima
facie, disclose their liability.
</p><p id="p_150">66.    The absence of legal representatives or heirs of the deceased in the
proceedings, or the fact that they had initiated independent civil action, in the
opinion of this court, was not an impediment, nor could it have precluded the NGT
from exercising its jurisdiction, given the gravity of the matter and the danger
posed to the members of the public. The initiation of civil action did not mean that
the NGT had to either reject the application (as far as it claimed relief for the
accident), or await the outcome of the civil suit. This position is clear from the
proviso to <a href="/doc/15078109/" id="a_156">Section 18(1)</a> which reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_65">              “Provided that where all the legal representatives of the
        deceased have not joined in any such application for compensation or
        relief or settlement of dispute, the application shall be made on behalf
        of, or, for the benefit of all the legal representatives of the deceased
        and the legal representatives who have not so joined shall be
        impleaded as respondents to the application.”

</blockquote><p id="p_151">67.     The above provision clearly implies that an application without impleading
the legal heirs cannot be rejected. At the most, the tribunal has to implead all legal
heirs. In the present case, that procedure was not followed. However, the legal
heirs have instituted a suit. The ends of justice would be served if that suit (Special
Civil Suit No. 890 of 2014 before the Court of the Civil Judge Senior Division,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">                                           54</span>

Pune) is directed to revive and continue it; a direction is issued to the concerned
court (Court of the Civil Judge Senior Division, Pune). The directions in this
regard by the NGT, towards payment of compensation are to be regarded as
indicative of a prima facie determination. Consequently, the direction to the NHAI
and Rathod, jointly making them liable to pay ₹ 15 lakhs is justified. It is clarified
that the civil suit will now proceed, and based on evidence, the court would finally
decide the issue of liability, and make such further consequential orders or decrees
as may be found necessary in this regard, towards apportioning of liability of the
NHAI, Rathod, the state or any other party (including the concessionaire). This
court’s order shall not be treated as conclusive; the trial court shall independently
proceed to evaluate the evidence and hear the parties on the merits of their
submissions. The restitutionary order by the NGT, directing payment by Rathod
and NHAI of ₹ 10 lakhs too, in this court’s opinion, cannot be found to be at fault.
It is upheld. The NHAI and Rathod shall comply with the directions of the NGT
and deposit the sum of ₹ 15 lakhs with the said court within four weeks, in equal
proportion. The sum ₹ 10 lakhs shall be deposited in the same proportion, in court,
to be disbursed to the state government for restoring the environment and carrying
out afforestation/planting of trees etc.


Point Nos III and IV: Correctness of NGT’s directions contained in Para 17 (e) of
its impugned order, and the legality of the order/notification of the state of
Maharashtra, issued under Section 154, MRTP Act

</p><p id="p_152">68.   As to the third point, two issues arise for consideration - firstly, the power of
the NGT to issue directions banning development and building activities of the
kind contained in Para 17(e) of its impugned order, and secondly, the correctness of
the procedure adopted while issuing such directions, in this case.

any question arising in a suit involves any scientific investigation
which cannot, in the opinion of the Court, be conveniently conducted

the Court, be conveniently conducted before the Court, the Court may,
if it thinks necessary or expedient in the interests of justice so to do,
issue a commission to such person as it thinks fit, directing him to
inquire into such question and report thereon to the Court. Rule 10-A
is enabling power to the courts to obtain report from such persons as
it thinks fit when any question involves with the scientific
investigation. The powers under Rule 10-A which are to be exercised
by the Court can very well be used by NGT to obtain reports by
experts. NGT as per the statutory scheme of NGT has to decide
several complex questions pertaining to pollution and environment.
The scientific investigation and report by experts are necessary
requirements in appropriate cases to come to correct conclusion to
find out measures to remedy the pollution and environment. We do not,
thus, find any dearth of jurisdiction in NGT to appoint a committee to
submit a report. We may further say that while asking an expert to
give a report, NGT is not confined to the four corners of Rule 10-A

and Procedure) Rules, 2011 (framed under Sections 4(4) and 35 of the NGT Act). 29
This court then held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_73">          “160. Rule 24 empowers the Tribunal to make such orders or give
          such directions as may be necessary or expedient to give effect to its
          order or to secure the ends of justice. Rule 24 gives wide powers to
          the Tribunal to secure the ends of justice. Rule 24 vests special power
          to the Tribunal to pass orders and issue directions to secure the ends
          of justice. Use of words “may”, “such orders”, “gives such
          directions”, “as may be necessary or expedient”, “to give effect to its
          orders”, “order to prevent abuse of process”, are words which enable
          the Tribunal to pass orders and the above words confer wide
          discretion.

          fulfil the objective of the NGT Act, 2010, NGT has to exercise a wide
          range of jurisdiction and has to possess wide range of powers to do
          justice in a given case. The power is given to exercise for the benefit
          of those who have right for clean environment which right they have
          to establish before the Tribunal. The power given to the Tribunal is
          coupled with duty to exercise such powers for achieving the objects.

not restitutionary, in the sense of restoring the environment to the position it was
before the practise impugned, or before the incident occurred. The NGT’s
jurisdiction in one sense is a remedial one, based on a reflexive exercise of its
powers. In another sense, based on the nature of the abusive practice, its powers
can also be preventive.
</p><p id="p_174">72.        As a quasi-judicial body exercising both appellate jurisdiction over
regulatory bodies’ orders and directions (under <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_179">Section 16</a>) and its original
jurisdiction under Sections 14, 15 and 17 of the NGT Act, the tribunal, based on
the cases and applications made before it, is an expert regulatory body. Its
personnel include technically qualified and experienced members. The powers it
exercises and directions it can potentially issue, impact not merely those before it,
but also state agencies and state departments whose views are heard, after which
general directions to prevent the future occurrence of incidents that impact the
environment, are issued.
</p>
<p id="p_175">73.        Courts in the US, notably the US Supreme Court, have been faced with
problems arising from regulatory adjudication. The scope of such decision making
which resembles an adjudicatory outcome by courts, was considered in <a href="/doc/168701962/" id="a_180">Securities
Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp</a>.30 This case arose from an order of the
Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) refusing to approve a utility company's
bankruptcy reorganization plan, due to that plan's favourable treatment of
management's stock purchases during the reorganization period. The SEC
originally had based its disapproval on its understanding of general corporation law
principles. The Supreme Court initially struck down that decision as a misreading
of the principles. On remand, the SEC reaffirmed its rejection of the reorganization
plan. But this time, the SEC relied on its interpretation of the standards of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">30</span>
     332 U.S. 194 (1947)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">                                             59</span>

Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. When the Supreme Court decided
the appeal for the second time, it affirmed the SEC's order. The court clarified that
SEC would be allowed to establish such an interpretation by means of a
particularized order rather than a general regulation and observed that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_75">            “Not every principle essential to the effective administration of a
            statute can or should be cast immediately into the mold of a general
            rule. Some principles must await their own development, while others
            must be adjusted to meet particular, unforeseeable situations. In
            performing its important functions in these respects, therefore, an
            administrative agency must be equipped to act either by general rule
            or by individual order. To insist upon one form of action to the
            exclusion of the other is to exalt form over necessity. In other words,
            problems may arise in a case which the administrative agency could
            not reasonably foresee, problems which must be solved despite the
            absence of a relevant general rule. Or the agency may not have had
            sufficient experience with a particular problem to warrant rigidifying
            its tentative judgment into a hard and fast rule. Or the problem may
            be so specialized and varying in nature as to be impossible of capture
            within the boundaries of a general rule. In those situations, the
            agency must retain power to deal with the problems on a case-to-case
            basis if the administrative process is to be effective. There is thus a
            very definite place for the case by case evolution of statutory
            standards. And the choice made between proceeding by general rule
            or by individual, ad hoc litigation is one that lies primary in the
            informed discretion of the administrative agency.”

</blockquote><p id="p_176">74.       Similar observations were made by this court in <a href="/doc/395434/" id="a_181">PTC India v. Central
Electricity Regulatory Commission31</a>. The court stated as follows, after analysing
the provisions of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_182">Electricity Act</a> 2003:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_76">            “49. On the above analysis of various sections of the 2003 Act, we
            find that the decision-making and regulation-making functions are
            both assigned to CERC. Law comes into existence not only through
            legislation but also by regulation and litigation. Laws from all three
            sources are binding. According to Professor Wade, “between

     2010 (4) SCC 603

       legislative and administrative functions we have regulatory
       functions”. A statutory instrument, such as a rule or regulation,
       emanates from the exercise of delegated legislative power which is a
       part of administrative process resembling enactment of law by the
       legislature whereas a quasi-judicial order comes from adjudication
       which is also a part of administrative process resembling a judicial
       decision by a court of law.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_77">       50. Applying the above test, price fixation exercise is really legislative
       in character, unless by the terms of a particular statute it is made
       quasi-judicial as in the case of tariff fixation under <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_183">Section 62</a> made
       appealable under <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_184">Section 111</a> of the 2003 Act, though <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_185">Section 61</a> is an
       enabling provision for the framing of regulations by CERC. If one
       takes “tariff” as a subject-matter, one finds that under Part VII of the
       2003 Act actual determination/fixation of tariff is done by the
       appropriate Commission under <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_186">Section 62</a> whereas <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_187">Section 61</a> is the
       enabling provision for framing of regulations containing generic
       propositions in accordance with which the appropriate Commission
       has to fix the tariff. This basic scheme equally applies to the subject-
       matter “trading margin” in a different statutory context as will be
       demonstrated by discussion hereinbelow.”

</blockquote><p id="p_177">75.   The NGT’s directions, though placed in the context of its adjudicatory role,
have a wider ramification in the sense that its rulings constitute the appropriate
norm which are to be followed by all those engaging in similar activities.
Therefore, its orders, contextually in the course of adjudication, also establish and
direct behaviour appropriate for future guidance. In these circumstances, given the
panoply of the NGT’s powers under the NGT Act, which include considering
regulatory directions issued by expert regulatory bodies under the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_188">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_189">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and the Biodiversity Act, 2002 it has to be held that general
directions for future guidance, to avoid or prevent injury to the environment for
appropriate assimilation in relevant rules, can be given by the NGT.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">                                           61</span>

<p id="p_178">76.   Turning next to the question of the correctness of the general directions
contained in Para 17(e) of the NGT’s order, this court has no manner of doubt that
such directions were improper and not justified in the facts of this case. What the
NGT had before it, was the report of the SDM and a report commissioned about
the nature of the incident. Based on these limited inputs, the tribunal concluded-
without any rationale and based on no scientific or technical evidence, or experts’
opinion, that development and construction should not be carried out within 100
feet of a “lowest slope i.e. incline of any hill within its territorial limits, as well as
hill-tops”. The decisions of this court, including the All Dimasa Students Union
case (f.n. 9); Mantri Technoze Pvt. Ltd case (f.n.3); the Hanuman Laxman Aroskar
case (f.n. 4) and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board case (f.n. 2) all show that
the NGT resorted to the appointment of technical and scientific experts in the
relevant field, who studied the issue, made site inspections and furnished reports.
Such reports were subjected to discussion by the parties before the NGT, who were
also given the opportunity of objecting to or making representations against such
reports. Based on a final consideration of all these materials, and the submissions
of parties before it, the NGT proceeded to issue directions. This procedure was
wholly overlooked by the NGT in the present case. As a result, it is held that the
said tribunal’s directions were improper and are procedurally indefensible. The
directions contained in Para 17(e) are therefore set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_179">77.   To consider the last issue, i.e. validity of the notification/direction issued by
the state government, it is necessary to briefly outline provisions of the MRTP Act.
The MRTP Act was framed and enacted for the purpose of use, planning and
development in the regions (of Maharashtra). This was through the establishment
of Regional Planning Boards, New Town Development Authorities and Special
Planning Authorities, as the case may be, for specified “notified areas”. <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_190">The Act</a>
provides for the preparation of development plans, appointment of Special
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">                                         62</span>

Planning Authorities for notified areas, and creation of new towns for designated
areas by means of development authorities. The MRTP Act also enables
compulsory acquisition of land for public purposes in respect of the plans and for
purposes connected therewith. <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_191">The Act</a> provides for an elaborate procedure for
preparation of the regional plan by a Regional Planning Board (“the board”) and
development plan by any planning authority. The board has to follow the procedure
contained in Chapter II(C). <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_192">Section 16</a> provides the procedure – the regional boards
have to (after necessary survey) prepare land-use maps for the region, and prepare
a draft regional plan, after which they have to publish a notice about the plan in the
Official Gazette, inviting objections and suggestions from any person with respect
to the draft plan. The board has to refer the objections, suggestions and
representations received by it to the Regional Planning Committee (“the
committee” hereafter) appointed under <a href="/doc/82509859/" id="a_193">Section 10</a> for consideration and report.
The committee, after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the affected
persons has to submit its report to the board, after which the board has to prepare
the regional plan after considering the suggestions, objections and representations
and the report of the committee. This is to be submitted to the State Government
for approval. On approval of the plan by the State Government under <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_194">Section 15</a>,
the final regional plan has to be published under <a href="/doc/139918683/" id="a_195">Section 17</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_180">78.   Chapter III deals with the procedure for preparation of development plans by
a planning authority. <a href="/doc/103424754/" id="a_196">Section 23</a> provides that the planning authority should make a
declaration of its intent to prepare such a plan and publish the same in the Official
Gazette, inviting suggestions or objections from the public within a period of not
less than sixty days from the publication of the notice in the Official Gazette.
Thereafter under <a href="/doc/163209200/" id="a_197">Section 26</a>, the planning authority has to prepare a draft
development plan, not later than two years from the date of notice published under
<a href="/doc/103424754/" id="a_198">Section 23</a>, and publish the notice in the Official Gazette stating that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">                                        63</span>

development plan has been prepared, once again inviting objections or suggestions
from any person with respect to the draft plan within a period of sixty days from
the notice. <a href="/doc/86743522/" id="a_199">Section 27</a> provides that the planning authority having regard to, and
guided by the proposals made in the regional plan, shall not carry out any
modification therein without prior concurrence of the Regional Planning Board.
<a href="/doc/106221633/" id="a_200">Section 28</a> mandates the planning authority to consider suggestions or objections
received by it under <a href="/doc/181736980/" id="a_201">Section 26(1)</a> and provide a reasonable opportunity of being
heard to any person including the representatives of the Government who may
have filed any objections or suggestions, and thereafter modify or change the plan
in such manner, as provided under <a href="/doc/106221633/" id="a_202">Section 28(4)</a>. <a href="/doc/115054998/" id="a_203">Section 29</a> further provides for
modification of the draft development plan, which is of substantial nature. By this,
a planning authority or the Town Planning Officer is required to publish a notice in
the Official Gazette inviting objections and suggestions from any person with
respect to the proposed modification not later than sixty days from the date of such
notice. The section then requires the authority concerned to consider all objections
and suggestions received by it and give a reasonable opportunity of being heard to
any person including representatives of government departments who may have
filed any objections or made any suggestions in respect of the draft development
plan before making such modifications or changes in the draft development plan.
<a href="/doc/3100738/" id="a_204">Section 30</a> requires the planning authority to submit the draft plan to the State
Government for approval, within twelve months from the date of publication of the
notice under <a href="/doc/163209200/" id="a_205">Section 26</a> that the draft plan has been prepared. <a href="/doc/49527452/" id="a_206">Section 31</a> provides
that the State Government may, after consulting the Director of Town Planning by
notification in the Official Gazette, sanction the draft development plan submitted
to it for the whole area, or separately for any part thereof, either without
modification, or subject to such modifications as it may consider proper, or return
the draft development plan to the planning authority for modifying the plan as it
may direct, or refuse to accord sanction. It further provides that where the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">                                        64</span>

modifications proposed to be made by the State Government are of a substantial
nature, the State Government has to follow the procedure contemplated under
<a href="/doc/106221633/" id="a_207">Section 28</a> to give a reasonable opportunity of hearing to the objectors before
finalizing the modification.
</p>
<p id="p_181">79.   <a href="/doc/55482189/" id="a_208">Section 37</a> confers powers on a planning authority to carry out such
modification in a final development plan as will not change its character. This
power could be exercised by a planning authority after publishing a notice in the
Official Gazette and in such other manner as may be determined by it inviting
objections and suggestions from any person with respect to the proposed
modification, not later than one month from the date of such notice. This section
also enjoins the planning authority to serve notice on all persons affected by the
proposed modification and, after giving a hearing to any such persons, submit the
proposed modification (with amendments, if any) to the State Government for
sanction. <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_209">Section 40</a> provides for appointment of a Special Planning Authority for
developing certain notified areas, and <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_210">Section 40(1)(c)</a> provides that the State
Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette appoint Bombay
Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA) established under the
Bombay Metropolitan Region Development Authority Act, 1974 to be the Special
Planning Authority for developing any undeveloped area specified in the
notification as a notified area. <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_211">Section 116</a> then lays down that a Special Planning
Authority shall have all the powers of a planning authority as provided in Chapter
VII of the MRTP Act for the special purpose of acquisition of such land in the
notified area either by agreement or under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_212">Land Acquisition Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_182">80.   So far as plans and developments that were approved before the impugned
notification was issued, this court is of the opinion that they cannot be disturbed
and the right of the applicants, be they developers, builders or owners of land or
plots, cannot be prejudiced or adversely affected. This is evident from a ruling of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                                              65</span>

this court in <a href="/doc/1737598/" id="a_213">T. Vijayalakshmi v. Town Planning Member32</a>. This court stated that
town planning legislations (like the MRTP Act) are regulatory; and that when a
development plan is in force during the proposal for its amendment, courts should
not interfere with them on the assumption that the approved plan for building or
development, would not be eventually permitted. It was held that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_78">            “Whether the amendments to the said comprehensive development
            plan as proposed by the Authority would ultimately be accepted by the
            State or not is uncertain. It is yet to apply its mind. Amendments to a
            development plan must conform to the provisions of the Act. As
            noticed hereinbefore, the State has called for objection from the
            citizens. Ecological balance no doubt is required to be maintained
            and the courts while interpreting a statute should bestow serious
            consideration in this behalf, but ecological aspects, it is trite, are
            ordinarily a part of the town planning legislation. If in the legislation
            itself or in the statute governing the field, ecological aspects have not
            been taken into consideration keeping in view the future need, the
            State and the Authority must take the blame therefor. We must assume
            that these aspects of the matter were taken into consideration by the
            Authority and the State. But the rights of the parties cannot be
            intermeddled with so long as an appropriate amendment in the
            legislation is not brought into force.”

under the MRTP Act, under <a href="/doc/55482189/" id="a_214">Section 37</a>, is in the nature of a legislative function.
This court had observed under <a href="/doc/758867/" id="a_215">Pune Municipal Corpn. v. Promoters and Builders

Government may do so with or without modifications. The
Government could impose such conditions as it deems fit. It is also
permissible for the Government to refuse the sanction. This is the true

an amendment so as to change the basic character of the development
plan. The proposed amendment could only be minor within the limits
of the development plan. And for such minor changes it is only normal
for the Government to exercise a wide discretion, by keeping various
relevant factors in mind. Again, if it is arbitrary or unreasonable the
same could be challenged. It is not the case of the respondents herein
that the proposed change is arbitrary or unreasonable. They
challenged the same citing the reason that the Government is not
empowered under the Act to make such changes to the modification.

<p id="p_184">5. Making of DCR or amendments thereof are legislative functions.
Therefore, <a href="/doc/55482189/" id="a_217">Section 37</a> has to be viewed as repository of legislative
powers for effecting amendments to DCR. That legislative power of
amending DCR is delegated to the State Government. As we have
already pointed out, the true interpretation of <a href="/doc/55482189/" id="a_218">Section 37(2)</a> permits
the State Government to make necessary modifications or put
conditions while granting sanction. In <a href="/doc/55482189/" id="a_219">Section 37(2)</a>, the legislature
has not intended to provide for a public hearing before according
sanction. The procedure for making such amendment is provided in
<a href="/doc/55482189/" id="a_220">Section 37</a>. Delegated legislation cannot be questioned for violating
the principles of natural justice in its making except when the statute
itself provides for that requirement. Where the legislature has not
chosen to provide for any notice or hearing, no one can insist upon it
and it is not permissible to read natural justice into such legislative
activity. Moreover, a provision for “such inquiry as it may consider
necessary” by a subordinate legislating body is generally an enabling
provision to facilitate the subordinate legislating body to obtain
relevant information from any source and it is not intended to vest any
right in anybody. (<a href="/doc/1646640/" id="a_221">Union of India v. Cynamide India Ltd</a>. [(1987) 2
SCC 720], SCC paras 5 and 27. See generally <a href="/doc/1417820/" id="a_222">H.S.S.K. Niyami
v.Union of India</a> [(1990) 4 SCC 516] and <a href="/doc/799736/" id="a_223">Canara Bank v. Debasis
Das</a> [(2003) 4 SCC 557: 2003 SCC (L&amp;S) 507].) While exercising
legislative functions, unless unreasonableness or arbitrariness is
pointed out, it is not open for the Court to interfere. (See generally
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">                                              67</span>

            ONGC v. Assn. of Natural Gas Consuming Industries of Gujarat
            [1990 Supp SCC 397].) Therefore, the view adopted by the High
            Court does not appear to be correct.
</p>
<p id="p_185">82.       This issue was again underscored by this court in <a href="/doc/172460732/" id="a_224">Machavarapu Srinivasa
Rao v. Vijayawada, Guntur, Tenali, Mangalagiri Urban Development Authority</a>,34
where it was held as follows, in respect of provisions of the Andhra Pradesh
(Urban Areas) Development Act, 1975:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_80">            “20. An analysis of the above-noted provisions shows that once the
            master plan or the zonal development plan is approved by the State
            Government, no one including the State Government/Development
            Authority can use land for any purpose other than the one specified
            therein. There is no provision in the Act under which the Development
            Authority can sanction construction of a building, etc. or use of land
            for a purpose other than the one specified in the master plan/zonal
            development plan. The power vested in the Development Authority to
            make modification in the development plan is also not unlimited. It
            cannot make important alterations in the character of the plan. Such
            modification can be made only by the State Government and that too
            after following the procedure prescribed under <a href="/doc/144692433/" id="a_225">Section 12(3)</a>.”

</blockquote><p id="p_186">83.       In a decision which concerned change in development plan under the MRTP
Act, this court observed that any changes in a development or master plan involve
consultations and a high degree of expertise, in <a href="/doc/1679416/" id="a_226">MIG Cricket Club v. Abhinav
Sahakar Education Society35</a> :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_81">            “28. It is well settled that the user of the land is to be decided by the
            authority empowered to take such a decision and this Court in
            exercise of its power of judicial review would not interfere with the
            same unless the change in the user is found to be arbitrary. The
            process involves consideration of competing claims and requirements
            of the inhabitants in present and future so as to make their lives
            happy, healthy and comfortable. We are of the opinion that town
            planning requires high degree of expertise and that is best left to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">34</span>
     (2011) 12 SCC 154
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">35</span>

            decision of the State Government to which the advice of the expert
            body is available. In the facts of the present case, we find that the
            power has been exercised in accordance with law and there is no
            arbitrariness in the same.”


</blockquote><p id="p_187">84.        Now, under the provisions of the MRTP Act36, regional plans and
development plans have to take into account features such as soil conservation,
preservation of natural features, prevention of flooding etc, while factoring
planning for each city or area concerned. In turn, such regional and development
plans would constitute the blueprint for local town planning authorities to grant or
refuse permission to individual applicants. In these circumstances, the use of
Section 154 of the MRTP Act, in the present case, in fact amounted to a
modification of all plans - regional, development, etc. Such modification (by way
of absolute prohibition in construction) was not preceded by any manner of public
consultation, much less previous invitation of objections or consideration of the
views of affected parties. It is in this background that one has to consider the
argument of the state, which found favour with the High Court, that such
notification was issued in public interest.
</p>

<p id="p_188">85.        The unamended Section 154 of the MRTP Act read as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_82">         “154 Control by the State Government
            (1) Every Regional Board, Planning Authority and Development
            Authority shall carry out such directions or instructions as may be
            issued from time to time by the State Government for the efficient
            administration               of               this              Act.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_83">            (2) If in, or his connection with, the exercise of its powers and
            discharge of its functions by the Regional Board, Planning Authority

       and the State Government, the decision of the State Government on
       such dispute shall be final.”

</blockquote><p id="p_189">86.   <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_230">Section 154</a> (1) was amendment by a substitution (with effect from
22.04.2015). The new provision [<a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_231">Section 154</a> (1)] reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_84">       “154. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or the rules
       or regulations made thereunder, the State Government may, for
       implementing or bringing into effect the Central or the State
       Government programmes, policies or projects or for the efficient
       administration of this Act or in the larger public interest, issue, from
       time to time, such directions or instructions as may be necessary, to
       any Regional Board, Planning Authority or Development Authority
       and it shall be the duty of such authorities to carry out such directions
       or instructions within the time-limit, if any, specified in such
       directions or instructions.”

</blockquote><p id="p_190">87.   Directions can be issued “notwithstanding” any other provisions of the Act,
“for implementing or bringing into effect the Central or the State Government
programmes, policies or projects or for the efficient administration of this Act or in
the larger public interest, issue, from time to time.” No doubt, the non-obstante
clause has an overriding effect on other provisions of the Act. However, if one
keeps in mind that the preparations of regional and development plans are in terms
of specific provisions which outline detailed procedures that have to be necessarily
followed, in the absence of which, time and again courts have intervened and held
that such modifications (without following prescribed procedure or without
prescribed consultations) are illegal, the power has to be resorted to for good and
adequate reasons. The direction, impugned in the present case, on the face of it, is
not premised on any central or state government programmes, policies or projects.
The impugned notification reads as follows:

 The Development schemes are prepared for area in jurisdiction of
 planning authorities under the Maharashtra Regional Development
 and Town Planning Act, 1966. In the context of unauthorised
 constructions undertaken by hill cutting, at Katraj Ghat District Pune,
 the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal, Pune has, by order dated 19
 May 2015 in Application Number 4/2014, issued orders and instructed
 to inform all Mahanagar Palik/Nagarpalika in the state not to give any
 development permission for constructions on the hilltop and 100 feet
 distance from the hill slopes. A provision already exists in development
 control regulations that no development is permissible on the hilltop
 and no hill slopes having a gradient of more than 1:5. Considering the
 order dated 19 May 2015 of the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal in
 exercise of powers under section 154 of the Maharashtra Regional
 Town Development and Town Planning Act 1966 the following the
 directions were issued to all planning authorities in the state:
</blockquote>

<p id="p_191">DIRECTIONS
</p><p id="p_192">1. The planning authorities while preparing development plan for area
   in their jurisdiction or amending them in respect of undeveloped
   portion abutting the hills upto 100 feet should be shown as No
   development/Open space Reservation.
</p><p id="p_193">2. In the event the 100 area abutting hills, has already been developed,
   in that area no permission be granted for additional FSI or TDR.

   Development Zone as per sanctioned Development plan, then while
   granting permission for Development for further 100 feet area
   abutting/contiguous thereto should be permitted only for non-
   buildable purposes such as open space, road et cetera.

</p><p id="p_196">88.       There are several authorities for the proposition that though an administrative
order need not necessarily comply with principles of natural justice such as granting
hearing, yet, administrative decisions or orders have to be based on some reasons. <a href="/doc/682224/" id="a_232">In
Shri. Sitaram Sugar Mills Company v. Union of India</a>,37 (which concerned the zoning
regulations for the purpose of levy sugar under the relevant statutory order, in terms of
the <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_233">Essential Commodities Act</a>), the Supreme Court held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_86">            “Power delegated by statute is limited by its terms and subordinate to
            its objects. The delegate must act in good faith, reasonably, intra vires
            the power granted, and on relevant consideration of material facts.
            All his decisions, whether characterised as legislative or
            administrative or quasi-judicial, must be in harmony with the
            Constitution and other laws of the land. They must be “reasonably
            related to the purposes of the enabling legislation”. If they are
            manifestly unjust or oppressive or outrageous or directed to an
            unauthorised end or do not tend in some degree to the
            accomplishment of the objects of delegation, court might well say,
            “Parliament never intended to give authority to make such rules; they
            are unreasonable ultra vires.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_87">            A repository of power acts ultra vires either when he acts in excess of

            in bad faith or for an inadmissible purpose or on irrelevant grounds
            or without regard to relevant considerations or with gross
            unreasonableness.”


</blockquote><p id="p_197">89.       <a href="/doc/116404795/" id="a_234">In Cellular Operators Association v. Telecom Regulatory Authority of
India</a>,38this court held that subordinate regulatory legislation, can be set aside in
judicial review, if they show no rationale or are arbitrary:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_88">            “62. In view of the aforesaid, it is clear that the Quality of Service
            Regulations and the Consumer Regulations must be read together as
            part of a single scheme in order to test the reasonableness thereof.</blockquote>

The countervailing advantage to service providers by way of the
allowance of 2% average call drops per month, which has been
granted under the 2009 Quality of Service Regulations, could not
have been ignored by the impugned Regulation so as to affect the
fundamental rights of the appellants, and having been so ignored,
would render the impugned Regulation manifestly arbitrary and
unreasonable.
</p><p id="p_199">63. Secondly, no facts have been shown to us which would indicate
that a particular area would be filled with call drops thanks to the
fault on     the part of the service providers in which consumers
would be severely         inconvenienced. The mere ipse dixit of the
learned Attorney General, without any facts being pleaded to this
effect, cannot possibly make an unconstitutional regulation
constitutional. We, therefore, hold that a strict penal liability laid
down on the erroneous basis that the fault is entirely with the service
provider is manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable. Also, the payment
of such penalty to a consumer who may himself be at fault, and which
gives an unjustifiable windfall to such consumer, is also manifestly
arbitrary and unreasonable. In the circumstances, it is not necessary
to go into the appellants' submissions that call drops take place
because of four reasons, three of which are not attributable to the
fault of the service provider, which includes sealing and shutting down
towers by municipal authorities over which they have no control, or
whether they are attributable to only two causes, as suggested by the
Attorney General, being network-related causes or user-related
causes. Equally, it is not necessary to determine finally as to whether
the reason for a call drop can technologically be found out and
whether it is a network-related reason or a user-related reason.
</p><p id="p_200">XXXXXX                   XXXXXX                     XXXXXX
</p><p id="p_201">66. The reason given in the Explanatory Memorandum for
compensating the consumer is that the compensation given is only
notional. The very notion that only notional compensation is awarded,
is also entirely without basis. A consumer may well suffer a call drop
after 3 or 4 seconds in a voice call. Whereas the consumer is charged
only 4 or 5 paise for such dropped call, the service provider has to
pay a sum of rupee one to the said consumer.
</p><p id="p_202">This cannot be called notional at all. It is also not clear as to why the
Authority decided to limit compensation to three call drops per day or
how it arrived at the figure of Re 1 to compensate inconvenience
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">                                          73</span>

       caused to the consumer. It is equally unclear as to why the calling
       party alone is provided compensation because, according to the
       Explanatory Memorandum, inconvenience is suffered due to the
       interruption of a call, and such inconvenience is suffered both by the
       calling party and the person who receives the call. The receiving party
       can legitimately claim that his inconvenience when a call drops, is as
       great as that of the calling party. And the receiving party may need to
       make the second call, in which case he receives nothing, and the
       calling party receives Re 1 for the additional expense made by the
       receiving party. All this betrays a complete lack of intelligent care and
       deliberation in framing such a regulation by the Authority, rendering
       the impugned Regulation manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable.”


</p><p id="p_203">90.       In the present case, the State of Maharashtra has not shown any material
or file containing the reasons behind the directive of 14.11.2017. It is not in dispute
that the direction was consequential to, and solely based on the directions of the
NGT in Para 17(e). As noticed earlier, those directions were not based on any
scientific evidence or report of any technical expert. Furthermore, even the
impugned notification does not specify what constitutes “hills”, and how they can
be applied in towns and communities set in undulating areas and hilly terrain. This
is not only vague, but makes the directions arbitrary as they can be applied at will
by the concerned authorities. More importantly, they amount to a blanket change of
all regional and development plans. While such directions can be issued, if
situations so warrant, such as in extraordinary or emergent circumstances, the
complete absence of any reasons why the state issued them, coupled with the lack
of any supporting expert report or input, renders it an arbitrary exercise. That they
are based only on the NGT’s orders, only underlines the lack of any application of
mind on the part of the State, while issuing them.
</p>
<p id="p_204">91.       For the above reasons, we hold that the impugned judgment of the
Bombay High Court cannot be sustained; it is set aside. Consequently, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">                                         74</span>

directions in the notification under <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_235">Section 154</a> (dated 14.11.2017) are hereby
quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_205">92.   In view of the above discussions, CA 6932/2015 and CA 5971/2019 are
hereby disposed of in terms of the directions in this judgment. The other appeals by
special leave by third parties, against the NGT’s order, and the order of the NGT,
are partly allowed in the above terms. There shall be no order on costs.
