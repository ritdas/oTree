RAKESH KUMAR JAIN, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            The appellant/board has challenged the validity of order dated

10.1.2012 passed by the learned Single Judge by which order dated

6.7.2010 declining the prayer of the petitioner for promotion to the post of

Environmental Engineer has been quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            The facts of the case are that the petitioner/respondents No.1

herein is a diploma in Mechanical Engineering and was appointed as Junior

Environmental Engineer (for short 'JEE') on 7.5.1986 and promoted as

Assistant Environmental Engineer (for short 'AEE) on 12.10.1993.        The

appellant framed draft service rules under <a href="/doc/1662929/" id="a_1">Section 12</a> of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short 'the Act') in the
 LPA No.800 of 2012 (O&amp;M)                                            [2]
                                 *****

year 1990 which was approved by the State Government. However, the

Government vide its letter dated 15.3.1996 sent its draft service

regulations to the appellant/Board for getting the same approved from the

Members of the Board by circulation but those service regulations of 1996

which were approved by the Board in its 105th meeting held on 13.9.1996

were not approved by the State Government under <a href="/doc/1662929/" id="a_3">Section 12</a> of the Act.

The appellant has been applying the draft Rules which have been

approved by the State Government which prescribes qualification of

Environmental Engineering should be at least 2nd Class in Environmental

Engineering or in Civil / Environmental / Mechanical Engineering with at

least 8 years experience as AEE. The appellant/board promoted S.P. Rathi

as Environmental Engineer on 11.5.2000, who was degree-holder and one

Chand Saini was also promoted on 3.10.2002, who too was degree-holder.

On 5.10.2004, the Statutory Service Regulations framed under the Act

were enforced after due approval by the State Government in terms of

which AEE Sumit Amrohi was promoted as Environmental Engineer as he

was also a degree-holder. The petitioner/respondents No.1 herein along

with other submitted a detailed representation on 29.7.2004 in which it

was claimed that the diploma holders be also included for promotion as

Environmental Engineer but since no decision was taken on this

representation, he filed CWP No.5914 of 2010 which was disposed of by

this Court on 1.4.2010 with direction to the Government to take decision.

It was in compliance of the said order, the representation of the

petitioner/respondent No.1 herein was considered and declined by a

speaking order on 6.7.2010 in which it was also mentioned that there were
 LPA No.800 of 2012 (O&amp;M)                                                     [3]
                                    *****

two past precedents of promoting R.K. Sharma and Bhagwan Singh in

1996 who were also diploma-holders but their promotions were approved

by the Board and recommended to the Government, which accepted the

proposals after giving the required relaxation in qualification.           In the

impugned order dated 6.7.2010, it is also mentioned that the Board had

recommended for relaxation vide its letter dated 1.2.2008 but the

Government had not found any exceptional circumstance for giving the

relaxation in qualification to the petitioner/respondent No.1 herein because

his service record was not of meritorious performance. It was also one of

the reasons that they cannot claim any legal right on the basis of draft

service regulations which have never been notified.

</p><p id="p_3">             Counsel for the appellant/Board has submitted that the

learned Single Judge has erred in taking note of the fact that the draft

service rules wherein diploma-holder was also sought to be made eligible

for promotion was sent to the Government and in the notified Rules dated

5.10.2004 it was specifically provided that the possession of degree was

mandatory requirement along with eight years of service for being

promoted to the post of Environmental Engineer. The promotions made

prior to the finalization of the rules were not under the draft rules rather

the same were approved by the Government and all the persons so

promoted after 1996 till 2006 possessed the qualification prescribed under

the notified regulations, no relaxation whatsoever with respect to any

qualification or eligibility as per the notified rules has been granted.

</p><p id="p_4">             On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.1 has

submitted that the Draft Service Rules were applied in all cases of
 LPA No.800 of 2012 (O&amp;M)                                                   [4]
                                    *****

promotion. Although respondent No.1 was having requisite experience for

the promotional post but he was not a Degree holder which was not a

condition in the Draft Service Rules. He further submitted that the Board

was applying Draft Service Rules till it was finalized in the later part of the

year 2004 and at the time when his case was considered in January 2004,

as per the Draft Service Rules even a person with a diploma was entitled

to be considered for promotion provided he had 10 years of service. He

has also referred to the instances of R.K.Sharma and Bhagwan Singh who

were similarly placed and were promoted by virtue of the Draft Service

Rules. He further relied upon a decision of the Supreme Court in the case

of   Chandigarh     Administration      through     The    Director    Public

Instructions (Colleges), Chandigarh v. Usha Kheterpal Waie and

others, (2011) 9 Supreme Court Cases 645 to contend that the service

condition of the employees can be regulated in terms of draft rules

provided there is clear intention to enforce those rules in near future.

</p><p id="p_5">            We have heard learned counsel for the parties, perused the

record and are of the considered opinion that there is no error in the order

of the learned Single Judge who has quashed the impugned order and

held respondent No.1 entitled to be considered for promotion. It is not

denied by the appellant that the case of the respondent No.1 was taken up

for consideration in January 2004, whereas the Draft Service Rules were

finalized in the later part of the year 2004, meaning thereby when the case

of respondent No.1 was considered, only the Draft Service Rules were

applicable which provided for 10 years' experience with Diploma and the

qualification of Degree came with the finalization of the Draft Service Rules
 LPA No.800 of 2012 (O&amp;M)                                             [5]
                                 *****

in the later part of the year 2004. It is also not denied by the appellant

that the similarly situated other two employees, namely, R.K.Sharma and

Bhagwan Singh, were promoted in terms of the Draft Service Rules which

means that the Draft Service Rules were regulating the service conditions

of the employees of the Board who had a clear intention to enforce the

same in near future. In this regard, the decision of the Supreme Court in

Chandigarh Administration's case (supra) is fully applicable in favour

of the respondent No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            In view of the aforesaid discussion, finding no merit in the

present appeal, the same is hereby dismissed.
