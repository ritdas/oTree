<p id="p_1">           Common issues based on common facts involved in

these writ petitions and therefore, they were heard jointly and

are being disposed of by this common judgment.

</p><p id="p_2">     2. The first petitioner in WPC No.8800/2011 is the

Managing Partner of A.J. Rubbers and the second petitioner is

the Managing Partner of J.S Rubbers.                      They had been

conducting the said factories on the strength of the licenses

issued by the Kumaranalloor Grama Panchayat that, later,

merged    with     Kottayam Municipality               with     effect from

1.11.2010. In short, presently the said factories lie within the

jurisdiction of the Kottayam Municipality. The contention of

the petitioners in      the said writ petition is that the factories

had been functioning on the strength of the licences issued by

the Kumaranelloor Grama Panchayat.                   They possessed the

requisite consent to operate from the Kerala State Pollution

Control Board besides the requisite licences from the

Factories and Boilers department. In short, according to them

WPC.2254/2011 and connected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                : 2 :</span>


the aforesaid factories had been functioning after obtaining all

statutory licences, consents and permits. While so, against

the very functioning of the said companies      there arose a

public agitation.     Earlier, Ext.P6 order was issued by the

Panchayat as on 30.7.2010. As per Ext.P6 the licences issued

in respect of the above factories were cancelled and the

petitioners were directed to close down the functioning of the

factories. However, obviously Ext.P6 holds out an assurance

of reconsideration on production of consent of the nearby

residents. Later, the petitioners have submitted Exts.P12 and

Ext.P14 explanation/objections. Ext.P13 would reveal the

receipt of Ext.P12 objection submitted by the first petitioner

and Ext.P15 would reveal the receipt of Ext.P14 submitted by

the second petitioner. The grievance of the petitioners is that

the respondents are not taking any action even on receipt of

Exts.P12 and P14.         At the same time, on account of the

cancellation of the licences as per Ext.P6 the petitioners are

not in a position to run their factories. WPC No.4870/2011

has also been filed by the very same petitioners challenging

Ext.P6 therein and also with a prayer to issue a writ of

WPC.2254/2011 and connected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               : 3 :</span>


mandamus commanding the 2nd respondent to consider and

dispose of Exts.P7 and P8 after affording opportunity of being

heard. Though in the writ petition Ext.P6 has been described

as an order passed by the secretary of the Panchayat bearing

No.A1-5180/09 dated 18.10.2010 a scrutiny of the same would

undoubtedly reveal that the said order and the order referred

to as Ext.P6 in WPC No.8800 of 2011 are one and the same

viz., the order of the Secretary of the Panchayat bearing

No.A1 5080/2009 dated 30.7.2010. The petitioners could not

maintain two writ petitions challenging the very same orders.

Exts.P7 and P8 appear to be the appeals preferred

respectively by the petitioners against an order dated

18.10.2010 bearing No.A1-5080/2009 issued by the Secretary,

Kumaranelloor Grama Panchayat. However, copy of the order

dated 18.10.2010 bearing No.A1-5080/2009,       described as

Ext.P6 in the writ petition, has been subsequently, produced

as Ext.P10 in the writ petition. WP(C)No.2254/2011 is filed by

a resident of Perumbaikadu raising grievance against the

functioning of the aforesaid two factories in one building

without any licence. The main prayer in the said writ petition

WPC.2254/2011 and connected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               : 4 :</span>


is to issue a writ of mandamus commanding the respondents 5

and 6 immediately stop all further manufacturing and

processing activities in their establishment, without proper

and valid licences from all statutory authorities concerned and

to issue a writ of mandamus commanding respondents 2 and 4

not to issue licences to respondents 5 and 6, without affording

an opportunity to the petitioner to raise her objections.   WP

(C)No.9455/2011 has been filed by 24 other residents of

Perumbaikadu virtually, seeking the same reliefs as sought by

the petitioner in WP(C) No.2254/2011. The petitioners are

raising serious allegations regarding the functioning of the

aforesaid two factories. It is contended that they are using

motors which are far in excess of the permitted Horse Power.

That apart, it is contended that the said factories had been

operating without the prior consent prescribed under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">section

25</a> of the Water Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution Act</a>, 1974.

Later, they moved the Human Rights Commission and based

on a report submitted by the Panchayat, the Human Rights

Commission directed the Panchayat to take immediate steps to

stop the activities in the aforesaid factories. Ext.P8 is the

WPC.2254/2011 and connected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  : 5 :</span>


order passed by the Human Rights Commission. The very

contention of the petitioners in WP(C)Nos.8800/2011 and

4870/2011, viz., the Managing Partners of the aforesaid two

factories is that they were absolutely unaware of any

proceedings before the Human Rights Commission and they

were not put on notice regarding any such proceedings. It

appears to be true as Ext.P8 order referred above did not

suggest anything to the effect that before passing the same

the petitioners or any other persons on their behalf were

heard. In fact, H.R.M.P No.2696 of 2009 was closed with the

following recommendation:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "In view of the above report and in view of the
     averments in the complaint and also in view of the
     admission of the Secretary, Kumaranalloor Grama
     Panchayat before me steps have to be taken by the said
     Panchayat to solve the problem faced by the petitioner
     and other residents and initiate steps by taking follow
     up action as per the notice dated 30.10.2009 which was
     already issued by the said Panchayat. The Panchayat
     will give an opportunity to the owners who are running
     the factory as well as to the residents in the area
     including the petitioner to plead their case and
     thereafter pass appropriate orders according to law.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                   The petition is closed with the above
     recommendation. Send a copy of this order each to the
     petitioner and the Secretary, Kumaranalloor Grama
     Panchayat.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">Though a notice dated 30.10.2009 is referred to in Ext.P8

order of the Human Rights Commission the said order has not

WPC.2254/2011 and connected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               : 6 :</span>


been referred to in Ext.P6 order dated 30.7.2010 in WP(C)

No.8800/2011       As per Ext.P8 order dated 14.9.2010 the

Human Rights Commission directed the Panchayat to give

opportunity to the owners of the factory viz., the petitioners

in WP(C) No.8800/2011, as well as the residents in the area to

plead their respective case and thereafter, to pass appropriate

orders according to law. Essentially, the contention of the

petitioners in WP(C) Nos.2254/2011 and 9455/2011 is that in

view of Ext.P6 order dated 30.7.2010 referred to in WP(C)

No.8800/2011 and WPC NO.4870/2011 the petitioners in WP

(C) No.4870/2011 and WP(C) No. 8800/2011 viz., the owners

of the two factories, are not legally entitled to run the

factories as the very licences were cancelled as per the said

order.   It is further contended that against Ext.P6 order

whereby the licences were cancelled, the petitioners in WPC

No.4870/2011 and 8800/2011 have not preferred any appeals

and therefore, the order of cancellation have become final. In

short, in view of the said circumstances the petitioner are not

legally entitled to run the factories in question, it is

contended. I do not think that this Court should consider the

WPC.2254/2011 and connected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              : 7 :</span>


rival contentions raised in these writ petitions at this stage.

As already noticed hereinbefore, as per Ext.P6 order whereby

the licences issued to the petitioners in WPC Nos.4870/2011

and 8800/2011 to run K.J Rubbers and J.S Rubbers were

cancelled. The petitioners were virtually, given time to raise

their objections. Of course, as per Ext.P6 an offer for

reconsideration was made only in case the petitioners therein

produced the No Objection Certificate from the nearby

residents. Obviously, the question is whether the petitioners

in WP(C) NO.4870/2011 and 8800/2011 could be compelled

for production of such No Objection certificate? The answer

to the said question would depend upon the fact as to whether

licences were issued by the Panchayat earlier and the issue

now, pertains is only one relating renewal of an already

existing licence. Of course, those aspects cannot and will not

stand in the way of consideration of the pollution aspects.

Even in the absence of non production of No Objection

Certificate, the rights if any, of the petitioner in WPC

Nos.4870/2011 and 8800/2011 are to be considered.

Therefore, the respondent authorities cannot contend that

WPC.2254/2011 and connected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 : 8 :</span>


such a consideration/re-consideration would be made only in

case the No Objection Certificate has been produced from the

nearby residents. In this context, it is to be noted that as per

Ext.P8 in WP(C) No.9455/2011 the Human Rights Commission

directed the petitioner to take appropriate decision in the

matter after affording opportunity to the petitioners in WP(C)

Nos.8800/2011 and 4870/2011 and also to the other residents,

to plead their case. In fact, thereafter, Ext.P9 notice No.A1-

5080/09 dated 27.12.2010(Ext.P9 in WPC No.4870/2011) was

issued to the petitioners in WPC No.4870/2011.            It was

informed that appeals preferred by the petitioners therein

against Ext.P10 order viz., the order dated 18.10.2010, would

be forwarded to the Kottayam Municipal Council, the second

respondent therein.       As already noticed the petitioners have

started and continued with the functioning of factories in

question based on the licences, permits and consents issued

by the competent authorities, viz., the Kumaranalloor Grama

Panchayat. Therefore, the question whether those licences

are liable to be cancelled is bound to be considered in

accordance with the provisions. It is required to be

WPC.2254/2011 and connected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               : 9 :</span>


considered, in accordance with law, especially because the

licenses were cancelled without actually affording the

petitioners in WP(C) No. 8800/2011 an opportunity of being

heard. I may hasten to add, before taking the drastic steps of

cancellation of permits it would have been only appropriate to

afford opportunity to them. Since as per Ext.P6 the licences

have already been cancelled and the petitioners have raised

all their contentions as per Exts.P12 and P14 before the

second respondent in WPC No.8800/2011, I am of the

considered view that the second respondent in the said writ

petition is bound to consider the objections raised by the

petitioner in WPC No.8800/2011 as per Exts.P12 and P14 in

accordance with law. The order of cancellation is also liable to

be reconsidered after affording an opportunity to the

petitioners    in   WPC     No.8800/2011. Necessarily     while

considering the objections raised by the petitioners therein

the petitioners and all other parties concerned viz., the

Managing Partners of the aforesaid factories and petitioners

in WP(C) Nos.2254/2011 and 9455/2011 are also to be

afforded with opportunity of being heard before taking a

WPC.2254/2011 and connected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                               : 10 :</span>


decision on the aforesaid issues. Taking note of the fact that

the petitioners are not able to run the factories on account of

the cancellation of the permits as per Ext.P6 and also by virtue

of the interim order passed by this Court on 18.3.2011, I am of

the view that an expeditious decision on the issue is required.

Therefore, these writ petitions are disposed of with a direction

to the second respondent in WPC No.8800/2011 to consider

Exts.P12 and P14 and also the appeals preferred by them

against Ext.P10 orders in WPC No. 4870/2011 and pass orders

thereon, in accordance with law. Before passing any orders

thereon, the petitioners in WPC No.4870/2011, petitioners in

WPC Nos.2254/2011 and WPC No.9455/2011 and all the

concerned party respondents shall also be afforded with an

opportunity of being heard. This shall be done expeditiously,

at any rate, within a period of two weeks from the date of

receipt of copy of this judgment.
