     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                           ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">D.H.WAGHELA, C.J. (Oral) :
</p>
<p id="p_2">     The petitioner herein has invoked Articles 226 and 227

of the Constitution with the prayer to quash order dated

28.8.2012 of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board

whereby the petitioner is directed, in exercise of powers

conferred under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">Section 31A</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 read with Rule 20-A of the Karnataka
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   3</span>
Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1983 to close

down the operation of their stone crusher forthwith and

directed the Deputy Commissioner, Hassan District to cease

the said stone crusher immediately, if the crushing unit has

not stopped the operation after the impugned order and also

directed   the   Managing   Director   of   the   Chamundeshwari

Electricity Supply Company, Mysore to stop the power supply

to the unit of the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">      2. In view of the background elaborately articulated in

the impugned order dated 28.08.2012 and in view of the

observations made by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1436850/" id="a_3">Bhopal Gas Peeditha

Mahila Udyog Sangathan and Others vs. Union of India and

others</a> ((2012) 8 SCC 326), more particularly in paragraphs 40

and 41 thereof, the first prayer to quash the impugned order

as aforesaid is not pressed by the petitioner with liberty to

take alternative remedies available to the petitioner as may be

necessary and advised.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">      3.   Learned   counsel     Mr.Roopesh   appearing   for   the

petitioner fairly conceded that the petition would not survive

for pressing the second prayer for a writ of mandamus

directing the State of Karnataka in its Department of Mines

and Geology to consider the application filed by the petitioner

for grant/renewal of licence for stone crushers under the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span>
provisions of the Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers Act,

2011 in so far as the application dated 11.02.2013 made

therefor is required to be processed and disposed within three

months by the provisions of <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_4">Section 3</a> of the said Act. Besides

that, the learned Additional Government Advocate Mr.Kolle

appearing for respondent no.1 fairly stated, on instructions,

that the Licensing Authority under the aforesaid Act shall

dispose of application of the petitioner within the prescribed

period. Therefore, the petition does not survive for any further

orders and it is disposed accordingly with no order as to costs.
