HEADNOTE:
    The Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,	1974
was  enacted  inter alia to provide for the  prevention	 and
control of water pollution, the maintaining or restoring  of
wholesomeness  of  water, etc. <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_7">Section 25</a> of  the  said	 Act
provides  that	no person shall without the consent  of	 the
State  Board, bring into use any new or altered	 outlet	 for
the  discharge of sewage or trade effluent into a stream  or
well, or begin to make any new discharge of sewage or  trade
effluent  into a stream or well. <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_8">Section 26</a> lays  down	that
persons	 discharging sewage or trade effluent into a  stream
or  well before the commencement of the Act shall apply	 for
consent within a period of three months of the	Constitution
of State Board. Thereafter the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_9">Control
of Pollution) Cess Act</a>, 1977 was enacted to provide for	 the
levy  and  collection of cess on water consumed	 by  persons
carrying  on  certain industries, Power (Thermal  &amp;  Diesel)
Generating  Industry was one such industry included at	item
No.  14 in Schedule I to the Act. <a href="/doc/1632123/" id="a_10">Section 3</a> of the 1977	 Act
provides that there shall be levied and collected a cess for
the purposes of the 1974 Act and utilisation thereunder. The
cess under the Act is made payable by every person  carrying
on any specified industry and the same has to be  calculated
on the basis of the water actually consumed at rates  speci-
fied  in  the Schedule. <a href="/doc/1295217/" id="a_11">Section 7</a> of the  Act  provides	 for
rebate.
    The appellant has established a Thermal Power Station on
the bank of River Chambal for generating energy. It consumes
water from the river for condensor cooling. After the  water
is  used for cooling, it is treated as a trade	effluent  in
the  neutralisation plant before it is discharged  into	 the
river. According to the appellant, the temperature,
121
after following the prescribed procedure, is brought down to
below
    40	C, when it is discharged into the river. The  appel-
lant  had  also installed a 0.4 MGD plant for  treatment  of
sewage.	 According  to the appellant both these	 plants	 are
working	 satisfactorily. The appellant, as required  by	 the
rules, submitted monthly returns of the water consumed	from
the  river for its Thermal Station for the period from	July
1983  to  January 1984 and February 1984 to June  1984.	 The
respondent authority. assessed the cess at Rs.13,13,710	 for
the first period and Rs.9,42,013 for the subsequent  period.
No rebate was allowed under <a href="/doc/1295217/" id="a_12">Section 7</a> of the 1977 Act on the
ground	that  the so-called neutralisation plant was  not  a
plant  for the treatment of sewage or trade effluent  within
the meaning of the said provision.
    The	 appellant  filed  an appeal under  <a href="/doc/293550/" id="a_13">section  13</a>,  in
respect	 of  the cess claimed for the period  July  1983  to
January 1984, but the appellate authority dismissed the same
holding	 that the cess was correctly assessed and  that	 the
appellant was not entitled to rebate. As regards the  period
from  February 1984 to June 1984. the appellant submitted  a
review	petition  which was rejected by	 respondent  No.  2.
Thereupon,  the	 appellant  filed  separate  writ  petitions
before	the  High Court challenging the	 assessment  orders.
Both  the writ petitions were dismissed by the	High  Court.
The  High Court opined that there was nothing on  record  to
show that the appellant had applied for consent of the State
Board to install a plant either under <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_14">section 25</a> or  <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_15">section
26</a>  of the 1974 Act nor was there any evidence to show	that
such consent was given. It accordingly held that the author-
ities  under  the Act had rightly disallowed  the  claim  of
rebate to the appellant under <a href="/doc/1295217/" id="a_16">section 7</a>. Against the  orders
of the High Court as also against various assessment  orders
which were passed subsequent to the orders of the High Court
the  appellant	has  filed these  appeals,  after  obtaining
special leave.
    Allowing  the  appeals, and remanding the cases  to	 the
Assessing Authority for fresh disposal, this Court
    HELD:  A  plant has undoubtedly been installed  for	 the
treatment  of  sewage  and no dispute  in  that	 behalf	 was
raised.	 However, as the bulk consumption of water from	 the
river is used at the condensor cooling plant the question is
whether the appellant can be said to have installed a  plant
for the treatment of a trade effluent. [130G]
    The	 Appellate  Authority took the view that a  150	 fl.
long channel meant for carrying the trade effluent cannot be
described  as treatment plant. The appellant contended	that
the treatment plant installed
122
by  it	comprised of an arrangement to lift the water  to  a
height	of 2211. and then drop it from that height  into  an
open channel so that it cools down on coming in contact with
the  atmosphere and then flows towards and into	 the  river.
[130H; 131A]
    <a href="/doc/1295217/" id="a_17">Section 7</a> as well as Rule 6 do not envisage the  Board's
consent under <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_18">Section 25(1)</a> of the 1974 Act as a  sine-clua-
non.  Under <a href="/doc/1295217/" id="a_19">Section 7</a> the consumer has only to show that  he
has  installed a plant for the treatment of sewage or  trade
effluent  and  that it functioned  successfully	 during	 the
relevant period to earn rebate. <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_20">Section 25(1)</a> operates in  a
different field and has nothing to do with a plant installed
for the treatment of a trade effluent although the grant  of
consent to a new outlet can be conditional on the  existence
of  a plant for the satisfactory. treatment of effluents  to
safeguard  against  pollution of the water  in	the  stream.
[131C-E]
    Since  the Board's consent under <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_21">Section 25(1)</a>  was	 not
imperative  that  part of the High Court's order  cannot  be
sustained. [131E]

    On 7th December. 1977, the President gave his assent  to
the  Water  (Prevention	 and  Control  of  Pollution)	Cess
act,1977(Act No. XXXVI of 1977), (hereinafter referred to as
'the  1977  Act'). <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_42">This Act</a> was enacted to provide  for	 the
levy  and collection of a cess on water consumed by  persons
carrying  on certain industries, with a view to augment	 the
resources  of  the statutory Boards for the  prevention	 and
control of water pollution. <a href="/doc/20025395/" id="a_43">Section 2(c)</a> defines  "specified
industry"  to mean "any industry specified in  Schedule	 I".
Power (Thermal &amp; Diesel) Generating Industry is included  at
item No. 14 in Schedule I to the Act. <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_44">Section 3</a> which is the
charging  section  inter alia provides that there  shall  be
levied and collected a cess for the purposes of the 1974 Act
and  utilisation thereunder. The Cess under sub-section	 (1)
is  made payable by every person carrying on  any  specified
industry  to  be calculated on the basis of  water  actually
consumed  for any of the purposes specified in column  1  of
Schedule  II, at such rate not exceeding the rate  specified
in the corresponding entry in column 2 thereof. Schedule  II
enumerates  in	column	1 the purposes for  which  water  is
consumed and sets out the maximum rate of cess therefore  in
column 2. The rare of cess for industrial cooling is  three-
fourths of a paisa, per
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">125</span>
kilolitre, while it is one paisa per kilolitre for  domestic
purpose.  Where water gets polluted and the  pollutants	 are
easily bio-degradable, the rate is 2 paise per kilolitre but
where  the pollutants are not easily bio-degradable and	 are
toxic, the rate is two and a half paise per kilolitre. It is
obvious	 that  the  rate of cess depends on  the  degree  of
pollution.  It	may also be noticed at this stage  that	 the
cess  is  to be calculated on the basis of the	water  'con-
sumed'	for  any of the purposes specified in  column  1  of
Schedule  II at the rate set out in the notification  issued
by the Central Government not exceeding the rates  specified
in  column  2 of the said schedule. <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_45">Section 4</a>  provides	 for
affixing of meters for the purposes of measuring and record-
ing the quantity of water consumed. <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_46">Section 5</a> requires every
person	carrying on any specified industry and	every  local
authority,  liable to pay the cess under <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_47">section 3</a>, to	fur-
nish returns in such forms and at such intervals  containing

charged with the duty to make an inquiry as to the  particu-
lars stated in the return and then pass an assessment  order
stating	 the amount of cess payable by the concerned  person
or  local  authority, as the case may be.  <a href="/doc/159242890/" id="a_49">Section  14</a>	pre-
scribes	 a penalty for failure to file a return and  <a href="/doc/181903687/" id="a_50">section

under  <a href="/doc/156059896/" id="a_53">section	13</a>  within the prescribed  time.  <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_54">Section  7</a>
provides  for a rebate if the cess is payable. It  reads  as
under:

rebate	of  seventy  per cent of the cess  payable  by	such
person or, as the case may be, local authority."
The  expressions 'sewage' and 'trade effluents'	 having	 not
been  defined  would  have the	same  meanings	respectively
assigned to them under the 1974 Act. <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_55">Section 17</a> empowers the
Central	 Government to make rules for carrying out the	pur-
poses of the Act. Under that section, the Central Government
made  the  Water (Prevention &amp; Control	of  Pollution)	Cess
Rules, 1978, (hereinafter called 'the Rules'). Rule 6 there-
of  deals  with	 rebate. Under that rule  where	 a  consumer
instals	 any  plant  for the treatment of  sewage  or  trade
effluent such consumer becomes entitled to the rebate  under
<a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_56">section 7</a> on or from the expiry of 15 days from the

long as it functions successfully.
</p><p id="p_10">    The	 appellant,  the Rajasthan State  Electricity  Board
constituted'  in  1957 under <a href="/doc/721761/" id="a_57">section 5</a>	of  the	 Electricity
(Supply)  Act, 1948, established a Thermal Power Station  on
the bank of River Chambal in Kota for generating energy.  It
admittedly  consumes  water  from the  river  for  Condensor
Cooling.  The  water drawn from the river  is  filtered	 and
thereafter  passes  through an enclosed	 pipeline  over	 the
condensor unit for cooling the condensor, After the water is
used  for cooling, it is treated as a trade effluent in	 the
neutralisation plant installed by the appellant at consider-
able expense with a view to preserving the wholesomeness  of
water before it is discharged into the river. After  conden-
sor  cooling,  the water passes through an  enclosed  under-
ground steel pipeline of the length of about 478 meters upto
the  seal pit. On reaching the seal pit the water is  pumped
to  a height of about 22 feet from where it is made to	fall
into an open channel and is then carried in that channel  to
a  distance  of about 150 feet before it  plunges  into	 the
river.	In  this manner the water at the seal pit  comes  in
contact with air. Its temperature is reduced firstly by	 the
22 feet fall into the open channel and thereafter by  cover-
ing  a distance of about 150 feet before getting  merged  in
the river or stream. The temperature is thus brought down to
below  40 deg.C, the standard prescribed under	the  Minimum
National Acceptable Standards published by the State  Board.
The appellant had also installed a 0.4 MGD plant for  treat-
ment  of sewage. Both these plants, contends the  appellant,
are working satisfactorily.
</p><p id="p_11">    The	 appellant  submitted monthly returns of  the  water
consumed from river Chambal for its Thermal Station, units 1
and  2, for the period from July, 1983 to January, 1984	 and
February,  1984 to June 1984. The Assessing  Authority,	 re-
spondent No. 2, assessed the cess at Rs. 13, 13,710 for	 the
first  period and Rs.9,42,013 for the subsequent period.  No
rebate	was allowed under <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_58">section 7</a> of the 1977 Act  on	 the
ground	that  the so-called neutralisation plant was  not  a
plant for the treatment of sewage or trade effluents  within
the  meaning of the said provision. Nothing was	 said  about
the  plant for the treatment of sewage. The appellant  filed
an  appeal under <a href="/doc/156059896/" id="a_59">section 13</a> in respect of the  cess  claimed
for the period from July, 1983 to January, 1984. The  appel-
late  authority dismissed the appeal holding that  the	cess
was correctly assessed and the appellant was not entitled to
rebate.	 In  respect of the assessment for the	period	from
February,  1984	 to  June, 1984 the  appellant	submitted  a
review petition which was rejected by respondent No. 2.	 The
appellant then preferred an appeal but the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">127</span>
same  was dismissed as barred by limitation.  The  appellant
preferred separate Writ Petitions Nos. 12 1/85 and 966/86 in
the High Court challenging the two assessment orders. In the
former	writ  petition the High Court granted  interim	stay
against	 the  recovery of the disputed cess  amount  to	 the
extent	of  seventy percent till the disposal  of  the	writ
petition.  In the second writ petition since  the  appellant
had  already  paid the amount of cess, the  application	 for
stay  did not survive but for future assessment	 orders,  it
directed  the appellant to pay thirty percent regularly	 and
the remaining seventy percent with interest at 15% per annum
in  the event the challenge failed. Both the aforesaid	writ
petitions  were finally disposed of by a Division  Bench  on
28th  October.	1988 which dismissed them holding  that	 the
cess was correctly assessed and the appellant was not  enti-
tled to rebate. In taking this view the Division Bench	came
to  the conclusion that there was no material on  record  to
show that the appellant had applied for consent of the State
Board  to instal a plant either under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_60">section 25</a> or  <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_61">section
26</a> of the 1974 Act nor was there evidence to show that	such
consent	 was given. It, therefore, opined that the  authori-
ties below had rightly concluded that the benefit of  rebate
under  <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_62">section 7</a> was not admissible to the appellant.  While
dismissing  the writ petitions the Division Bench,  however,
observed as under:
</p><p id="p_12">"Anyhow	 if  the consent after the period of  assessment  in
dispute	 has either been obtained for discharge of  effluent
etc.,  or  can be deemed to have been obtained	and  if	 the
treatment plants are working satisfactorily, the  petitioner
shall  be entitled to rebate according to the provisions  of
rules for that period."
</p><p id="p_13">It  follows  therefrom that the Division  Bench	 refused  to
grant  rebate to the extent of seventy per cent for want  of
consent under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_63">section 25</a> or 26 of the 1974 Act.
    Feeling  aggrieved by the Judgment and order  passed  by
the  Division  Bench of the High Court, the  appellant	pre-
ferred special leave petitions (Civil) Nos. 1429 and 2157 of
1989  challenging the dismissal of the said two	 writ  peti-
tions.	During	the pendency of	 these	proceedings  several
assessment orders came to be made for the subsequent periods
upto  may,  1989 for the water consumed at  the	 appellant's
Thermal Units. The Assessing Authority also refused to grant
rebate, The appellant preferred appeals against the  assess-
ment  orders passed from time to time but to no	 avail.	 In-
stead of approaching the High Court the appellant has  filed
Special Leave Petitions Nos. 3223, 3262,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">128</span>
3272,  4599 and 4600 of 1990 in this Court against the	said
assessment orders as well as the refusal to grant rebate  on
the  ground  that  similar questions were  involved  in	 the
earlier	 two special leave petitions which were	 pending  in
this Court. We have granted special leave in all cases under
<a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_64">Article	 136</a> of the Constitution and we now proceed to	dis-
pose them of by this common Judgment.
</p><p id="p_14">  Dr.  Singhvi, the learned counsel for the  appellant	con-
tended that the 1977 Act was an independent piece of  legis-
lation	and  was not, what he called, 'the pari	 materia  or
parasite legislation' to the 1974 Act, and hence once it  is
shown  that  the  appellant had installed a  plant  for	 the
treatment of a trade effluent within the meaning of  <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_65">section
7</a> of the 1977 Act read with rule 6 of the Rules, the  appel-
lant was entitled to rebate regardless of whether or not the
appellant  had secured the consent of the State Board  under
<a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_66">section	 25(1)</a> of the 1974 Act. He contended that the  State
Board's	 consent became necessary only if an outlet  new  or
altered-  was sought to be used for the discharge of  sewage
or  trade effluent in the stream and not otherwise.  In	 the
present	 case, contended Dr. Singhvi, the appellant had	 put
up  an independent sewage plant for the treatment of  sewage
and an independent neutralisation plant for the treatment of
water  discharged  from the condensor cooling plant  of	 the
Thermal	 Station.  So  far as the former  is  concerned	 the
consumption  of	 water is negligible; the  bulk	 consumption
takes place at the condensor cooling plant from where  water
is  discharged	after  use at a temperature  far  above	 the
standard of 40 C, which if discharged into the stream  with-
out  treatment	would be harmful and injurious	to  acquatic
organisms  in  the stream. That is  why	 the  neutralisation
plant  was necessary to bring down the temperature of  water
to  40C or below before its actual discharge in the  stream.
At  the	 point where this water merges into the	 stream	 its
temperature  is below 40 C and therefore it ceases to  be  a
contaminated  trade effluent. Since the outlet is  used	 for
the  discharge	of this water which is no more	polluted  it
cannot be said that it is used for the discharge of a trade
effluent  within  the meaning of <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_67">section 25(1)</a> of  the	1974
Act. According to Dr. Singhvi the enactment being essential-
ly for the prevention, control and abatement of pollution of
streams and wells. the duty to ensure the purity of  streams
and  wells is cast on the State Board and for the  effective
performance of the same, <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_68">section 25</a>( 1)' provides for previ-
ous  consent if any new or altered outlet is intended to  be
brought	  use for the discharge of sewage or trade effluent.
But no such previous consent would be necessary if uncontam-
inated water is sought to be discharged into the stream.  In
other  words according to Dr. Singhvi the expression  'trade
effluent' in <a href="/doc/116131139/" id="a_69">section 2(k)</a> must be read
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">129</span>
in the context of the purpose and object of the law and	 the
mischief it seeks to curb. Yet, by way of abundant  caution,
the appellant applied for the grant of consent under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_70">section
25</a>/<a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_71">26</a>  of the 1974 Act by the letter dated 9th	April,	1984
for  the neutralisation plant and by the letter	 dated	I2th
April,	1984  for the sewage plant meant for the  colony  of
workmen situate within the power Station. Under	 sub-section
(7)  <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_72">section  25</a> since the State Board neither	granted	 nor
refused	 consent within the period of four months  from	 the
receipt of the applications, it must be deemed to have	been
granted	 unconditionally on the expiry of the  said  period.
Lastly,	 he pointed out that during the pendency of the	 two
writ petitions in the High Court, the Secretary of the State
Board  granted the required consent and conveyed it  by	 his
letter	No. F. 5(B-I4)RSEB/Tech/86/11472 dated	24th  March,
1988.  Therefore, when the Division Bench of the High  Court
disposed of both the writ petitions the consent of the State
Board under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_73">section 25(1)</a> was already granted and hence	 the
High Court was not right in making the observations it	made
in paragraphs 7 and 9 of the impugned judgment.
    We	may clarify that in the present appeals we  are	 not
concerned  with	 the legality and validity of  the  levy  of
cess.  Dr. Singhvi, however, stated that the  appellant	 re-
served the right to challenge the validity of the 1977	Act,
if the interpretation placed by the authorities below on the
true  scope  and meaning of <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_74">section 7</a> read with	 rule  6  is
found  to  be correct. We may state that since	we  are	 not
required to go into the question of Parliament's  competence
to enact the 1977 Act, we do not propose to delve into	this
aspect of the matter.
</p><p id="p_15">    Now, on a plain reading of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_75">section 25</a>
it  becomes  clear that the previous consent  of  the  State
Board  is necessary where any new or altered outlet is	pro-
posed to be used for the discharge of sewage or trade efflu-
ent  into  a stream or well. If what is	 discharged  in	 the
stream or well is not a pollutted 'trade effluent'  (<a href="/doc/116131139/" id="a_76">section
2(k)</a>)  or a 'sewage effluent' (<a href="/doc/167777868/" id="a_77">section 2(g)</a>), can  there  be
any  question of seeking the previous consent of  the  State
Board? The appellant has a separate sewage plant. Since	 the
bulk of the water is consumed at the condensor cooling plant
and  the same is recycled into the stream, the	question  is
whether what is discharged in the stream can be said to be a
trade  effluent? Dr. Singhvi emphasised that the consent  of
the  State Board would not be necessary under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_78">section  25(1)</a>
for the discharge of that recycled water, unless it is shown
that  what the appellant discharged in the stream  or  river
was  polluted  water, According to Dr. Singhvi, the  use  of
water  at  the	condensor cooling plant	 merely	 raises	 the
temperature of water above the tolerance limit
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">130</span>
of 400 C. if the water is discharged in the river or  stream
before its temperature is reduced to 400 C or below, it	 may
well  be  contended  that within the broad  meaning  of	 the
expression  'pollution' in <a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_79">section 2(e)</a>, it  was  imperative
for  the  appellant to obtain the previous  consent  of	 the
State  Board for making use of that outlet. But if,  on	 the
other  hand,  it is shown that the temperature of  water  is
brought down to the prescribed standard and the water is  no
more harmful or injurious to acquatic organisms in the river
or stream i.e. is not polluted, the discharge of such  water
cannot	be equated with discharge of a trade effluent.	This
raises	a mixed question of law and fact, viz., whether	 the
recycled water returned to the stream in the same  condition
in  which it was drawn with the temperature reduced to	less
than  400  C,  can still be said to be	a  'trade  effluent'
requiring  consent  under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_80">Section 25</a>( 1)? It  may,  in	this
context be mentioned that samples of the trade effluent were
collected by the State Board for analysis on 24th May, 1984.
By letter dated 3rd December,  1984, the appellant requested
the Assistant Engineer, State Board, to supply a copy of the
analysis  report which was refused by the letter dated	26th
December, 1984. The appellant was informed that the monitor-
ing results conducted by the Board .were not supplied to the
concerned industries. He added that the appellant could	 get
the sample tested, if so desired, at the Board's  Laboratory
on payment basis. We think that if the Board was in  posses-
sion of this vital information, it should have in all  fair-
ness  brought it on record rather than withhold it. If	that
information was available on record Dr. Singhvi's contention
could have been met. We are, however, not inclined to  raise
any adverse inference as was suggested.
</p><p id="p_16">    We now come to the second limb of Dr. Singhvi's  submis-
sion.  According  to him, <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_81">section 7</a> of the 1977 Act  is	 not
dependent on the Board's consent under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_82">section 25(1)</a> of	 the
1974  Act. In fact neither <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_83">section 7</a> nor rule 6 speak  about
the  same.  All that <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_84">section 7</a> says is that  any  person  or
local authority which is liable to pay cess can claim rebate
of  70%	 of the cess payable by him or it, if he or  it	 has
installed  a  plant  for the treatment of  sewage  or  trade
effluent,  as the case may be. A plant has undoubtedly	been
installed for the treatment of sewage and no dispute in that
behalf	was raised before us. However, as the bulk  consump-
tion of water from the river is used at the condensor  cool-
ing plant the question is whether the appellant can be	said
to  have  installed  a plant for the treatment	of  a  trade
effluent.  The Appellate Authority took the view that a	 150
ft.  long  channel  meant for carrying	the  trade  effluent
cannot	be  described as a treatment  plant.  The  appellant
contended that the treatment plant installed by it comprises
of an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">131</span>
arrangement to lift the water to a height of 22 ft. and then
drop  it  from that height into an open channel so  that  it
cools down on coming in contact with the atmosphere and then
flows towards and into the river. It would appear that	this
arrangement  was not specifically brought to the  notice  of
the authorities below including the High Court and it  seems
the authorities decided the question of the existence of the
treatment plant on the premise that it consisted of merely a
single 150 ft. long channel. However, this aspect has to  be
looked into.
</p><p id="p_17">    The High Court has, however, taken the view that in	 the
absence	 of consent under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_85">Section 25</a>( 1 ), the appellant  is
not  entitled to rebate. We find it difficult to agree	with
this  view. <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_86">Section 7</a> as well as Rule 6 do not envisage	 the
Board's	 consent  under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_87">Section 25(1)</a> of the 1974 Act  as  a
sine-qua-non. Under <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_88">section 7</a> the consumer has only to	show
that he has installed a plant for the treatment of sewage or
trade  effluent and that it functioned	successfully  during
the  relevant period to earn rebate. <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_89">Section 25(1)</a>  operates
in  a  different field and has nothing to do  with  a  plant
installed for the treatment of a trade effluent although the
grant  of consent to a new outlet can be conditional on	 the
existence  of  a plaint for the	 satisfactory  treatment  of
effluents to safeguard against pollution of the water in the
stream.	 The High Court refused the claim for rebate  as  it
erroneously  thought  that the prior consent  of  the  State
Board was a must. That is why in the concluding part of	 the
Judgment  it  observed that if the consent  is	subsequently
obtained  or deemed to be obtained and the plant is  working
successfully,  the  appellant will be  entitled	 to  rebate.
Since  we  are of the view that the  Board's  consent  under
<a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_90">Section 25(1)</a> was not imperative, we think that that part of
the High Court's order cannot be sustained.
    So	far as the 1977 Act is concerned it would be  neces-
sary to consider the true scope and meaning of <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_91">section 7</a> and
rule  6. On a plain reading of the said provisions it  would
be necessary to decide (i) whether water discharged from the
condensor cooling plant can be said to be a 'trade effluent'
by  reason only of the fact of its temperature	being  above
the prescribed standard, (ii) whether but for the  treatment
given to it as described by the appellant and set out  above
such water would have been discharged in the stream or river
at  a temperature above 40 deg.C, and (iii) whether the	 ar-
rangement made by the appellant as set out above can, there-
fore,  be described as a plant for the treatment of a  trade
effluent.  These and the related questions must be  answered
to  effectively deal with the appellant's claim for  rebate.
The  authorities  below including the High  Court  have	 not
applied	 their	minds to these essential  for  deciding	 the
question of grant or refusal of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">132</span>
rebate. If it is found that the plant in question is one for
the  treatment of a trade effluent, the appellant  would  be
entitled  to rebate notwithstanding the absence	 of  consent
under  <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_92">section 25(1)</a> of the 1974 Act. We feel that the	par-
ties  did not focus their attention on these  vital  aspects
and,  therefore,  failed  to place on  record  the  material
essential for deciding the application for grant of  rebate.
In the circumstances, we are left with no alternative but to
remit the matter to the Assessing Authority with a direction
to permit the appellant as well as the State Board to  place
on record such material as is considered relevant and there-
after give the parties an opportunity of being heard  before
deciding  the matter. The Assessing Authority should  do  so
without	 being	influenced  by the previous  orders  of	 the
authorities as well as the High Court. In the meantime	i.e.
till the Assessing Authority decides the matter afresh,	 the
appellant  will continue to pay 30% of the cess	 amount	 and
will  file an undertaking in this Court within	eight  weeks
from today to the effect that in the event the appellant  is
finally found liable to pay the balance of 70% the appellant
will pay the same with interest at 15% per annum within	 six
months from the final determination. The appeals are allowed
accordingly. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of
these cases, we make no order as to costs.
