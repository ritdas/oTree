        ****
Harinder Singh Sidhu, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">        The petitioner was appointed as Junior Environmental Engineer

in   respondent-Board on 13.11.1985. The next promotional post was

Assistant Environmental Engineer.
</p>
<p id="p_2">         It is the case of the petitioner that services of the petitioner are

governed by Punjab State Board for Prevention and Control of Water
                        CWP No.160 of 1997 (O&amp;M)    [2]



Pollution Employees Service Regulations 1980 (hereinafter, referred as the

"1980 Regulations" ). As per Regulation 13, all promotions to posts shall

be made on the basis of Merit-cum-Seniority and no person shall have right

to any post on the basis of seniority alone.
</p>
<p id="p_3">          At the 55th meeting of the Board held on 16.02.1987, the Board

resolved to amend and replace the 1980         Regulations by the     Punjab

Pollution Control Board Employees Services Regulations, 1987 (hereinafter

referred to as the "1987 Regulations" )

          As per Section 12 (3A)(b) of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, no regulations made by a State Board shall be

effective until approved by the State Government. However, without the

approval having been granted, the 1987 Regulations were applied by the

respondent-Board for the purpose of promotions to the post of Assistant

Environmental Engineer made in the year 1988 and 1989.

</p><p id="p_4">          As the petitioner was not eligible for the promotion to the post of

Assistant Environmental Engineer in terms of the 1987 Regulations, he was

not considered for promotion in the year 1987 and 1988. He was promoted

as AEE only on 17.07.1991 when he qualified as per the 1987 Regulations.

</p><p id="p_5">           The issue of the applicability of the 1987 Regulations was settled

by a Division Bench of this Court in CWP No.19638 of 1996 decided on

30.07.1997. It was held that as 1987 Regulations had not been approved by

the State Government in terms of the <a href="/doc/151428175/" id="a_2">Section 12</a> (3A)(b) of Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 they had no force and could

not be relied upon. A review filed thereagainst was also dismissed and the

Board was directed to comply with the directions issued earlier.
</p><p id="p_6">                        CWP No.160 of 1997 (O&amp;M)      [3]



          Meanwhile, the respondent-Board had circulated tentative

seniority list of Assistant Environmental Engineers on 15.12.1995 in which

the date of promotion of the petitioner was mentioned as 17.07.1991. The

petitioner filed objections to the said list on 21.12.1995 contending that

1987 Regulations had no force of law and the petitioner should be granted

promotion w.e.f., 1988 by applying the 1980 Regulations and that seniority

list be recast in accordance with the 1980 Regulations. Having received no

positive consideration, the petitioner filed CWP No.160 of 1997 praying for

directions to the respondents to take a decision on his objections. Vide order

dated 1.11.1997 passed in the aforesaid writ petition,         the competent

authority was directed to take a final decision on the tentative seniority list

dated 15.12.1995 after considering objections raised by the petitioner and

other affected employees. A specific direction was given that while

finalizing the seniority list the competent authority shall take into

consideration the judgment rendered in CWP No.19237 of 1996 titled as

`Rajesh Kumar Vs. Punjab Pollution Control Board'.

</p><p id="p_7">          Pursuant to the aforesaid direction, order dated 29.12.1997 was

passed which is annexed as Annexure P-11 in CWP No.160 of 1997 . Vide

this order, the objections filed by the petitioner against the tentative

seniority list were rejected. The petitioner subsequently amended CWP No.

160 of 1997 to lay challenge to the order dated 29.12.1997.

</p><p id="p_8">          Meanwhile, in another CWP No.3630 of 1998 which was decided

on 29th March, 2012 it was reiterated that the 1987 Regulations having not

been approved by the State Government had no legal force and that the

1980 Regulations continued to hold the field. Directions were issued to the
                         CWP No.160 of 1997 (O&amp;M)     [4]



Principal Secretary, Government of Punjab, Department of Environment to

hear the petitioners and respondents in that case and all other affected

persons,   and thereafter determine their inter-se seniority by passing a

reasoned order in the light of the observations made in the decision.

</p><p id="p_9">           The petitioner filed representation before the Principal Secretary

,Department of Science and Technology, again raising the same claim that

he was entitled to be considered for promotion in 1988 and 1989 as per the

1980 Regulations.       In response to the the representations filed by the

petitioner and other affected persons, an order dated 12.11.2012 which is

Annexure P-12 (in CWP No.898 of 2013) was passed by the Principal

Secretary, Government of Punjab.      No merit was found in the case of the

petitioner and other affected persons and the seniority list issued by the

Board on 29.12.1997 was held to be correct. A copy of the order was

endorsed to the petitioner vide Annexure P-11 dated 01.01.2013 (in CWP

No.898 of 2013) The petitioner filed CWP No.898 of 2013 to impugn the

aforesaid orders.
</p>
<p id="p_10">           Learned counsel for the petitioner has inter-alia contended that the

order Annexure P-12 does not reflect any consideraton on merits of the

case of the petitioner with reference to the 1980 Regulations. He further

states that if respondent No.1 (Principal Secretary, Government of Punjab,

Department of Science and Technology), were to reconsider the case of

the promotion of the petitioner with reference to the 1980 Regulations, he

would not press his two writ petitions. Ld. Counsel for the respondents has

no objection to this.
</p>
<p id="p_11">           Accordingly, learned counsel for the parties are agreed that in
                                            CWP No.160 of 1997 (O&amp;M)     [5]



           case the petitioner submits a fresh representation listing out his grievances,

           the same would be decided on merits by the Principal Secretary,

           Government of Punjab, Department of Science and Technology in the light

           of the decisions rendered in CWP No.19638 of 1996 and CWP No.3630 of

           1998.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                               It is ordered accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                               The Principal Secretary while deciding the representation of the

           petitioner would also hear any other affected party as may desire to be

           heard.              It is expected that the The Principal Secretary would dispose of

           the representation as expeditiously as possible and in any case within three

           months from the date of its submission by the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_14">                               The petitioner specifically undertakes that in the event his

           representation is accepted and he is granted ante-dated promotion, he would

           not claim seniority over and above Sh. Pawan Kumar, Sh. V B. Handa and

           Sh. R. K. Gupta and Sh. Gurnam Singh who were promoted in 1988 and

           1989 relying on the 1987 Regulations.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                               Both petitions are disposed of in the above terms.
</p>
