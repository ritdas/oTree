                W.P.(C) No.19985 of 2011
            ---------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 7th day of April, 2014

                          JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      The petitioner has come up before this Court for

getting Exts.P2 and P4 issued by the third and 4th

respondents       respectively        quashed         and    for a

declaration that the petitioner can maintain a go-down

for storing gas cylinders without any consent from

respondents 1 to 3.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. The petitioner is a proprietor dealing LPG in

Pathanamthitta District.          The petitioner alleges that

during   December          2010,       the     third     respondent

approached him and demanded a domestic gas

cylinder illegally and as it was against the rules, the

petitioner could not oblige which made the third

respondent to threaten the petitioner that the

petitioner's godown would be closed. Therefore, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WPC No.19985 of 2011    2</span>

  petitioner alleges that the third respondent issued

  Ext.P2 to the petitioner and Ext.P3 to the 5th

  respondent fabricating a false story and requesting

  to take action. According to the petitioner, all these

  actions are without authority and misusing his

  official capacity.
</p>
<p id="p_3">          3. According to the petitioner, Ext.P1 license

  was issued by the 6th respondent after strict

  scrutiny and he alone have the right to cancel the

  license issued by him. According to the petitioner,

  there is no stipulation that the certificate from

  respondents 1 to 3 should be obtained for storage

  of LPG. It is with these allegations, the petitioner

  has approached this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_4">          4. The second respondent filed a report for

  and on behalf of first and second respondents

  wherein they have contended that it is the statutory

  obligation of the petitioner to obtain consent from

  the Panchayat or Pollution Control Board as he is

  carrying out a dangerous and offensive trade. It is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WPC No.19985 of 2011      3</span>

  not a mere requirement for obtaining clearance

  from explosive directorate.     It is also stated that

  based      on     the representations  filed   by  the

  organization of LPG distributors, the first respondent

  convened a meeting with the representatives of the

  organization and the necessity of obtaining consent

  by them is clearly conveyed to them as evident

  from Ext.R2(g) minutes. Therefore, according to the

  Pollution Control Board, the action taken was strictly

  in accordance with the statutes and government

  orders.
</p>
<p id="p_5">          5. When the matter came up for hearing, it

  was brought to my notice that the license already

  issued to the petitioner expired.
</p>
<p id="p_6">          6. LPG is a petroleum product and all

  petroleum product storage is listed as an industrial

  plant and comes under item No.26 of the Orange

  category industry vide G.O.No.2586/2002 H &amp; FWD

  dated 21.10.2002.      True copy of the government

  order is produced and marked as Annexure R2(c).

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WPC No.19985 of 2011        4</span>

  In general, industries are categorized into three

  category;       viz.  Green  (non  polluting), Orange

  (moderately polluting) and Red (seriously polluting).

</p><p id="p_7">          7. As per Section 21 of the Air (Preventions

  and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981, no person shall

  establish or operate such establishments without

  prior consent of the Board. Further, <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_2">Section 37</a> of

  the said Act highlights the penalties to be imposed

  for the violators. True copy of the relevant part of

  the said Act is produced as Annexure-R2(d).

</p><p id="p_8">          8. Exts.P2 and P3 are notices issued to the

  petitioner       in  accordance  with  the   prevailing

  statutory procedure.       It was only a direction to

  obtain consent from the respondent Board. Though

  sufficient time was granted, the petitioner did not

  respond        positively. Ext.P4 produced    by   the

  petitioner confirms that he is carrying out the

  dangerous and offensive trade without a license

  from the 4th respondent Panchayat.         Thus, there

  cannot be an operation of petroleum product

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WPC No.19985 of 2011      5</span>

   storage without required statutory consent from the

   Pollution Control Board and D &amp; O license from the

   local body.
</p>
<p id="p_9">           As the license issued to the petitioner has

   expired, this writ petition is disposed of permitting

   the petitioner to approach the respondent Board as

   well as the local authority with a proper application

   for consent and D &amp; O license and in the event of

   filing such an application, the first respondent Board

   as well as the 4th respondent Panchayat shall

   consider the same and pass appropriate orders

   after affording the petitioner and affected persons

   an opportunity of being heard.
</p>
<p id="p_10">          Till that exercise is completed, the existing

   state of affairs shall continue.</p><pre id="pre_2">
