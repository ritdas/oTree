JUDGMENT: (Per B.R. Gavai, J.)


1]     A common question of law that arises for consideration in these 

Petitions is, as to whether Petitioners who are Autonomous Colleges / 

Institutions,   as   defined   in   sub-section   (6)   of   Section   2   of   the 

Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016  (hereinafter referred to as

2015") or not?
</p>
<p id="p_2">

2]     Since all these three Petitions involve a common question of law 

they   have   been   heard   together   and   are   being   disposed   of   by   this 

common judgment and order.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

3]     Factual   position   in   all   the   three   matters   is   undisputable.

4]     The Maharashtra Legislature in the year 2015 enacted the said

the Petitioner on 04/03/2016 thereby communicating the Resolution 

of the Authority dated 02/03/2016, whereby it was resolved that the 

College may act as per the requirements of the UGC and University of 

Mumbai and that the College may follow the Rules.



5]     However,   the   Petitioner   received   a   notice   dated   07/04/2016, 

informing that pursuant to the passing of the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_6">Regulation Act</a> of 2015, 

it   was   mandatory   for   all   such   Institutions   to   get   course-wise   fee

informed that in case of contravention of any of the provisions of the 

Act,   there   was   provision   for   imposing   penalty   on   the   Institution 

committing   breach.       The   Petitioner   replied   to   the   said   notice   on 

29/06/2016,   stating   therein   that   since   it   was   an   Autonomous 

Institution, it was not subject to the jurisdiction of the Authority and as 

such,   the   notice   issued   be   recalled.       However,   on     06/09/2016, 

Petitioner  was  served  with the Notification  issued by the  Authority, 

calling   upon   all   Private   Unaided   Private   Professional   Educational

<a href="/doc/100378/" id="a_7">Section 14(a)</a> of the Regulation Act of 2015.   Being aggrieved by the 

said   Notification,   the   Petitioner   filed   Writ   Petition   No.309   of   2017 

before   this   Court,   seeking   a   declaration   that   Chapter   IV   of   the 

Regulation   Act   of   2015   was   not   applicable   to   the   Petitioner. 

Petitioner   thereafter   received   a   notice   dated   08/05/2017   from   the 

Authority,   informing   that  the  matter  of  the  Petitioner  was  fixed on 

12/05/2017 at 2 p.m and directed the Petitioner to remain present

Authority.   By the impugned order dated 01/07/2017, the Authority 

held   that   the   <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_8">Regulation   Act</a>   of   2015   was   applicable   even   to   the 

autonomous colleges and therefore the Petitioner was bound to submit 

its   fee   proposal   to   the   Authority.     Being   aggrieved   thereby,   the 

Petitioner has approached this Court.

rule and interim protection to the Petitioner.   This Court prima facie 

found that there was conflict between the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_9">Regulation 

Act</a> of 2015 and the 2016 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_10">Universities Act</a>.  It therefore  issued notice

7]     So far as the Petitioner in Writ Petition (L) No.2032 of 2017 is 

concerned, it is an Institute of Management, Development &amp; Research 

which   has   been   granted   autonomous   status   on   29/07/2015.     The 

Petitioner, in fact, in response to the notice issued by the Authority, 

had   submitted   its   proposal   to   the   Authority   regarding   fees   of   the 

Petitioner.   According to the Petitioner, the same was done bonafide. 

However,   contending   that   since   the   Petitioner   has   been   conferred 

autonomous   status   by   the   UGC,   the   Authority   ceased   to   have 

jurisdiction   to   determine   the   fees   of   the   Petitioner-Institute,   the 

Petitioner has approached this Court seeking the same declaration as is 

sought in the first Petition.

8]     The Petitioner in third Petition being Writ Petition No.2694 of 

2017   is   also   an   Institute   of   Technology.     The   Petitioner   has   been 

granted autonomous status on 06/04/2017 for a period of six years

from the academic year 2017-2018 to 2022-2023.   After noticing the 

interim   order   passed   in   the   first   matter,   the   Petitioner   has   also 

approached this Court, seeking the same declaration.



9]     The arguments canvassed on behalf of the Petitioners were led 

by Mr. Aspi Chinoy, learned Senior Counsel,    in   the first matter.  In 

the second and third     matter,   we    have   heard    Dr.   Birendra  

Saraf,  and Mr. Mahadeshwar, learned Counsel for the Petitioners. 



10] Mr. Chinoy, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 

Petitioners   in   the   first   Petition,   submits   that   in   the   Maharashtra 

Universities   Act,   1994   (hereinafter   referred   to   as   "<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_11">Universities   Act</a>, 

1994")  full administrative, academic and financial autonomy has been 

granted   to   the   Autonomous   Institutions.     Learned   Senior   Counsel 

submits   that the definition of "autonomous college" and "autonomy" 

as defined in sub-section (6) and (5) of <a href="/doc/462798/" id="a_12">Section 2</a> of the said Act read 

with <a href="/doc/169968/" id="a_13">Section 89</a> of the said Act would reveal that the legislative intent 

was   to   grant   complete   autonomy   in   administrative,   academic   and 

financial   matters   to   the   autonomous   colleges/institutions.     Learned 

Senior   Counsel   submits   that   the   said   legislative   intent   of   granting 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                                    9/74</span>

complete autonomy, including financial autonomy is fortified by the 

provisions of <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_14">Section 101</a> of the 2016 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_15">Universities Act</a>. It is submitted 

that     Autonomous Colleges / Institutions have been kept out of the 

purview of provisions of <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_16">Section 101</a>, which provide for the manner of 

fee fixation.  Learned Senior Counsel submits that provision of keeping 

Autonomous Colleges / Institutions out of the purview of Fee Fixation 

Committee, amplifies the legislative intent prescribed under the 1994 

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_17">Universities   Act</a>   of   giving   complete     financial   autonomy.     Learned 

Senior Counsel submits that when special provision under <a href="/doc/169968/" id="a_18">section 89</a> 

was   made   for   a   distinct   class   namely   Autonomous   Colleges   / 

Institutions, general provisions made in the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_19">Regulation Act</a> of 2015, 

would not be applicable to such a distinct class.   He further submits 

that   the legislative intent of giving complete financial autonomy to 

Autonomous Colleges / Institutions is explicit under sub-section (1) of 

<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_20">Section   101</a>   of   the   2016   <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_21">Universities   Act</a>,   by   keeping   Autonomous 

Colleges out of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_22">Section 101</a>, which provide for fee 

fixation.   He therefore submits   that the   legislative intent is to give 

complete freedom to the Petitioners to fix fees as determined by them. 

Learned   Senior   Counsel   submits   that   when   special   provisions   (as 

contained in <a href="/doc/169968/" id="a_23">Section 89</a> of the 1994 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_24">Universities Act</a> and sub-section

including   financial   autonomy   to   the   Petitioners,   general   provisions 

contained in the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_28">Regulation Act</a> of 2015 would not   be applicable to 

the  Petitioners.  Learned Senior Counsel further submits that, it  will 

have to be held that provisions in the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_29">Regulation Act</a> of 2015 which 

are repugnant to the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/169968/" id="a_30">Section 89</a> of the 1994 

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_31">Universities Act</a> read with  sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_32">Section 101</a> of the 2016 

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_33">Universities Act</a>,  stand impliedly repealed.



11] Mr. Chinoy,   learned Senior Counsel, relying  on the guidelines 

issued   by   the   UGC   to   the   Autonomous   Colleges,   submits   that   the 

autonomy has been granted, so that the Colleges that have potential 

for offering programmes of higher standards, have complete freedom 

in administrative, academic and financial matters.  He submits that the 

UGC Policy provides that the exercise of academic freedom by teachers 

is a crucial requirement for development of the intellectual climate of 

our country.   Unless such a climate prevails, it is difficult to achieve 

excellence   in     higher   education     system.     Learned   Senior   Counsel, 

therefore, submits that when autonomy is granted to the Petitioners  in 

pursuit of the policy of the UGC to achieve academic excellence, the 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                               11/74</span>

provisions of   the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_34">Regulation Act</a> of 2015 cannot be permitted to be 

applied to the Petitioners and  impose fetters on their freedom. 



12] Mr. Chinoy, learned Senior Counsel,  submits that when there is 

conflict between a special provision and  general provision, it is special 

provision which would apply and the general provision will have to 

give   way   to   the   special   provision.     Learned   Senior   Counsel   in   this 

respect relies on the judgment of the Apex Court in the cases of   <a href="/doc/995861/" id="a_35">R.S.  

Raghunath   vs.   State   of   Karnataka</a>   and   <a href="/doc/791872/" id="a_36">Another1,  Life   Insurance  

Corporation of India vs. D.J. Bahadur and Others</a> 2  and in the case of 

<a href="/doc/87705010/" id="a_37">Independent Thought vs. Union of India and Another</a> 3.



13] Dr. Saraf, learned   Counsel appearing on behalf of the Petitioner 

in   second   Petition   submits   that,   it   is   not   as   if   arbitrary   and 

unchannelised   power   is   granted   to   the   Autonomous   Colleges.     He 

submits   that   under   the   Statute   various   Bodies   like   the   Financial 

Council, the Governing Council etc are provided.  It is submitted that, 

fees   as   determined   by   the   Financial   Council   are   required   to   be

approved   by   the   Governing   Council,   which   apart   from   the 

representatives   of   the   Management   has   also   independent   and 

government representatives.  Learned  Counsel therefore submits that 

when the Statute provides for a special mechanism for   Autonomous 

Colleges, the general law as provided in the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_38">Regulation Act</a> of 2015 

would not be applicable.

<p id="p_8">

14] Mr. Mahadheshwar, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the 

Petitioner   in   third   Petition,   submits   that   under   the   Statute   framed 

under 1994 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_39">Universities Act</a>, a complete Code is provided for fixation 

of fees.  He therefore submits that when a particular Statute provides 

for a complete Code in the matter for which it is enacted, the same 

will have to be construed to be a special law.

<p id="p_9">

15] On the other hand, Mr. Aney, learned Senior Counsel, appearing 

on behalf of the State submits that perusal of various provisions of  the 

1994 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_40">Universities Act</a> as well as the 2016 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_41">Universities Act</a> would reveal 

that, both these Enactments are   general laws, dealing with various 

aspect   of   the   administration   of   the   Universities,   affiliation   of   the 

Colleges   to   the   Universities   etc.     Learned   Senior   Counsel   further

submits that even under the 1994 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_42">Universities Act</a>, determination of 

fees by the Autonomous Institution was subject to regulation by the 

Management   Council   under   <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_43">Section   28(v)</a>   of   the   said   Act,   upon 

proposal made to it by the Academic Council under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_44">section 30(q)</a> of 

the   1994   <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_45">Universities   Act</a>.     He   submits   that,   though   under   Statute 

No.613, autonomy was given to the Autonomous Colleges, the same 

was subject to the provisions of the said Act and as such, subject to the 

recommendations of Academic Council and Management Council.



16] Mr.   Aney,   learned   Senior   Counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the 

State, submits that the autonomy granted is for the limited purpose of 

commencement of Diploma or Certificate Courses without approval of 

the University, commencement of new Degree or Post-graduate Course 

with the approval of the Academic Council by fulfilling the minimum 

standards laid down by the University/UGC and for restructuring and 

redesigning   the   existing   Courses   with   the   approval   of   Academic 

Council as per UGC norms etc.

that   1994   <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_47">Universities   Act</a>   and   2016   <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_48">Universities   Act</a>   being   general 

laws concerning affairs of the Universities and the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_49">Regulation Act</a> of

fees in the Professional Unaided Colleges, it is the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_50">Regulation Act</a> of 

2015 which will have to be considered  as  a special law and the 1994 

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_51">Universities Act</a> and 2016 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_52">Universities Act</a> will have to be considered

<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_53">Regulation Act</a> of 2015 is traceable to Entry 25 of List - III of Seventh 

Schedule   of   the Constitution.   He submits that the Petitioners have 

not challenged the validity of the said Act.   Learned Senior Counsel 

further   submits   that   the   Petitioners   have   not   raised   any   grievance 

insofar   as   the   applicability   of   the   <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_54">Regulation   Act</a>   of   2015   for

Learned Senior Counsel submits that, though the words used in the 

said Act were "fee fixation", it has been held by the Apex Court that, 

they, in effect, provided for regulation of fees, to ensure that there was 

no arbitrariness.  Learned Senior Counsel therefore submits that there 

is a distinction between "fee fixation" and "fee regulation" and as such, 

there is no conflict in both the Acts.  Learned Senior Counsel further 

submits that though the 1994 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_65">Universities Act</a> used the word "financial 

autonomy",   in   the   2016   <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_66">Universities   Act</a>,   the   said   word   "financial 

autonomy" has been taken away and what has been provided in 2016 

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_67">Universities   Act</a>   is   only   academic   and   administrative   autonomy   and 

therefore the contention of the Petitioners needs to be rejected.



21] Mr. Chinoy, in rejoinder, submits that insofar as Judgments on 

which Mr. Aney and Dr Sathe relied on are concerned, in those cases 

there was no issue with regard to the autonomous status granted to 

the Colleges and as such, the said judgments would not be applicable

to the facts of the present case.  He submits that, when under the 1994 

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_68">Universities Act</a> and the 2016 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_69">Universities Act</a> an autonomy has been 

granted in furtherance of the policy of the UGC, the same cannot be 

taken   away   by   the   <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_70">Regulation   Act</a>   of   2015.     He   reiterates   that   the 

<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_71">Regulation Act</a> of 2015  being  a general law, would not be applicable 

to   the   Autonomous   Institutions   for   which   a   distinct   class   has   been 

carved out under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_72">Section 89</a> of the 1994 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_73">Universities Act</a> and under

the argument that there is a distinction between "fee fixation" and "fee 

regulation" is totally without substance. Both the things are one and 

the same.     He submits that by the Regulation of 2015 the freedom 

which is granted to the Autonomous Institutions to achieve  academic 

excellence is being taken away and as such, interpretation, as placed 

by the Respondents, would not be sustainable.

      examining   the   scope   and   the   object   of   the   two 
      enactments   and   by   a   comparison   of   their   provisions. 
      The matter in each case is one of the construction and

      implying a repeal,

               unless two Act are so plainly repugnant to each 
               other that effect cannot be given to both at the 
               same time, a repeal will not be implied, or that 
               there is a necessary inconsistency in the two Acts 
               standing   together.   (See  Craies   on   Statute   Law,

               [(1936) 1 Ch 274]

     To   determine   whether   a   later   statute   repeals   by 
     implication an earlier, it is necessary to scrutinize the 
     terms and consider the true meaning and effect of the 
     earlier   Act.   Until   this   is   done,   it   is   impossible   to 
     ascertain whether any inconsistency exists between the 
     two enactments. The area of operation in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_162"> the Code</a> and 
     the pollution laws in question are different with wholly 
     different   aims   and   objects,   and   though   they   alleviate 
     nuisance, that is not of identical nature. They operate in 
     their respective fields and there is no impediment for

<blockquote id="blockquote_79">            "31.       One of the important tests to determine 
            the issue of implied repeal would be whether the 
            provisions   of   the   Act   are   irreconciably 
            inconsistent with those of the Code that the two 
            cannot   stand   together   or   the   intention   of   the 
            legislature   was   only   to   supplement   the 
            provisions of the Code.   This intention is to be 
            ascertained from the provisions of the At. Courts 
            lean   against   implied   repeal.     If   by   any   fair 
            interpretation   both   the   statutes   can   stand 
            together,   there   will   be   no   implied   repeal.     If 
            possible, implied repeal shall be avoided.   It is, 
            however,   correct   that   the   presumption   against 
            the intent to repeal by implication is overthrown 
            if the new law is inconsistent with or repugnant 
            to   the   old   law,   for   the   inconsistency   or 
            repugnancy   reveals   an   intent   to   repeal   the 
            existing   laws.     Repugnancy   must   be   such   that 
            the   two   statutes   cannot   be   reconciled   on 
            reasonable   construction   or   hypothesis.     They 
            ought to be clearly and manifestly irreconciable. 
            It is possible, as contended by Mr. Jethmalani, 
            that the inconsistency may operate on a part of a 
            statute.     Learned   counsel   submits   that   in   the 
            present   case   the   presumption   against   implied 
            repeal stands rebutted as the provisions of the 
            Act are so inconsistent  with or repugnant to the 
            provisions of the earlier Acts that the two cannot 
            stand   together.     The   contention   is   that   the 
            provisions   of   Section   306   and   307   cannot   be 
            complied with by the special court and thus the 
            legislature   while     enacting   the   Act   clearly 
            intended that the said existing provisions of the 
            Code would not apply to the proceedings under 
            the   Act.   Learned   counsel   contends   that   this 
            Court   will   not   construe   the   Act   in   a   manner 
            which   will   make   Sections   306   and   307   or   at

irreconciabale and both of them cannot mutually co-exist, the question 

as to which is a special statute and which is a general statute and as 

such, which should prevail, would arise.   For that, we will have to 

examine as to whether there is any direct conflict between the two

the same subject.  It is equally settled that when it does not provide a 

repealing   provision,   the   intention   is   not   to   repeal   the   existing 

legislation. For finding out as to whether there really exists a conflict 

or not,  we will have to scrutinize the terms of all the Enactments and 

consider the true meaning and effect of both the Acts. We will have to 

consider   what   are   the   terms   of   both   the   Statutes,   what   are   their 

objects and   purposes.   We will have to consider, as to whether the 

provisions contained in the 1994 and the 2016 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_176">Universities Act</a>s on the 

one hand and the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_177">Regulation Act</a> of 2015 on the other hand are so 

irreconciable  and inconsistent that the two cannot stand together.  In 

the   light   of   these   guiding   principles,   we   will   have   to   examine   the 

scheme of both the Enactments.

50] The provisions of the 1994 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_178">Universities Act</a>   would reveal that 

autonomous colleges, autonomous institutions etc had full academic, 

administrative   and   financial   autonomy.     However,   the   same   was 

subject to the provisions of the Act and the Statutes.  It could thus be 

seen that in the 1994 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_179">Universities Act</a>, the autonomy was subject to 

the provisions of the said Act and the Statutes framed thereunder.  As 

could be seen from the perusal of clause (a) of Statute 613 that under

the   said   provision   also   the   Board   of   Management   had   no   absolute 

freedom to determine fees. The Statute specifically provided that the 

total fee should not exceed the cost of education per student, which 

includes  expenses on  salary, non-salary,   maintenance and rent.    It 

could thus be seen that there are inherent limitations in Statute 613 

itself.  The total fees cannot exceed cost of education per student.  The 

factors which could be taken into consideration would be expenses on 

salary, non-salary, maintenance and rent.

basically wrong.

              There can be no fixing of a rigid fee structure by 
              the   government.   Each   institute   must   have   the 
              freedom to fix its own fee structure taking into 
              consideration the need to generate funds to run 
              the institution and to provide facilities necessary 
              for the benefit of the students. They must also 
              be able to generate surplus which must be used 
              for   the   betterment   and   growth   of   that 
              educational institution. In paragraph 56 of the 
              judgment   it   has   been   categorically   laid   down 
              that the decision on the fees to be charged must 
              necessarily   be   left   to   the   private   educational 
              institutions that do not seek and which are not 
              dependent   upon   any   funds   from   the 
              Government.   Each   institute   will   be   entitled   to 
              have its own fee structure. The fee structure for 
              each institute must be fixed keeping in mind the 
              infrastructure   and   facilities   available,   the 
              investments made, salaries paid to the teachers 
              and   staff,   future   plans   for   expansion   and/or 
              betterment of the institution etc. Of course there 
              can   be   no   profiteering   and   capitation   fees 
              cannot   be   charged.   It   thus   needs   to   be 
              emphasized that   as per the   majority  judgment 
              imparting of education  is essentially  charitable 
              in   nature.   Thus   the   surplus/profit   that   can   be 
              generated   must   be   only   for   the   benefit/use   of 
              that   educational   institution.   Profits/surplus 
              cannot be diverted for any other use or purpose 
              and cannot be used for personal gain or for any 
              other   business   or   enterprise.   As,   at   present, 
              there are statutes/regulations which govern the 
              fixation   of   fees   and   as   this   Court   has   not   yet 
              considered   the   validity   of   those 
              statutes/regulations, we direct that in order to 
              give effect to the judgment in T.M.A. Pai's case

              number of members of the Committee shall not 
              exceed   five.   Each   educational   Institute   must 
              place before this Committee, well in advance of 
              the   academic   year,   its   proposed   fee   structure. 
              Along   with   the   proposed   fee   structure   all 
              relevant documents and books of accounts must 
              also be produced before the committee for their 
              scrutiny.   The   Committee   shall   then   decide 
              whether the fees proposed by that institute are 
              justified   and   are   not   profiteering   or   charging 
              capitation fee. The Committee will be at liberty 
              to approve the fee structure or to propose some 
              other fee which can be charged by the institute. 
              The fee fixed by the committee shall be binding 
              for a period of three years, at the end of which 
              period the institute would be at liberty to apply 
              for   revision.   Once   fees   are   fixed   by   the

              directly or indirectly any other amount over and

</p><p id="p_84">              8.  It   must   be   mentioned   that   during 
              arguments it was pointed out to us that some 
              educational   institutions   are   collecting,   in 
              advance, the fees for the entire course i.e. for all 
              the years. It was submitted that this was done 
              because the institute was not sure whether the 
              student would leave the institute midstream. It 
              was submitted that if the student left the course 
              in midstream then for the remaining years the 
              seat   would   lie   vacant   and   the   institute   would 
              suffer.   In   our   view   an   educational   institution 
              can   only   charge   prescribed   fees   for   one 
              semester/year,   if   an   institution   feels   that   any 
              particular student may leave in midstream then, 
              at   the   highest,   it   may   require   that   student   to 
              give   a   bond/bank   guarantee   that   the   balance 
              fees for the whole course would be received by 
              the   institute   even   if   the   student   left   in 
              midstream.   If   any   educational   institution   has 
              collected fees in advance, only the fees of that 
              semester/year   can   be   used   by   the   institution. 
              The balance fees must be kept invested in fixed 
              deposits   in   a   nationalised   bank.   As   and   when 
              fees fall due for a semester/year only the fees 
              falling   due   for   that   semester/year   can   be 
              withdrawn   by   the   institution.   The   rest   must 
              continue to remain deposited till such time that 
              they   fall   due.   At   the   end   of   the   course   the 
              interest earned on these deposits must be paid 
              to   the   student   from   whom   the   fees   were 
              collected in advance."

It could thus be clearly seen that Their Lordships of the Apex Court 

have clearly held that there can be no fixing of a rigid fee structure by 

the Government.  It has been held that the decision on the fees to be 

charged must necessarily be left to the private educational institutions 

that do not seek and which are not dependent upon any funds from 

the Government.   Each institute will be entitled to have its own fee 

structure. The fee structure for each institute must be fixed keeping in 

mind the infrastructure and facilities available, the investments made, 

salaries   paid   to   the   teachers   and   staff,   future   plans   for   expansion 

and/or betterment of the institution etc.   However, Their Lordships 

have held that there can be no profiteering and capitation fees cannot 

be charged.  It has been directed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that in 

order to give effect to the judgment in T.M.A. Pai Case 1 the respective 

State Government/concerned authority shall set up, in each State, a 

committee   headed   by   a   retired   High   Court   Judge   who   shall   be 

nominated   by   the   Chief   Justice   of   that   State.     The   judgment   also 

provides as to who shall be  other members of the Committee.  It has 

been provided that, each educational institute must place before this 

Committee,   well   in   advance  of  the  academic  year,  its proposed  fee

structure.       Along   with   the   proposed   fee   structure   all   relevant 

documents and books of accounts must also be produced before the 

Committee  for scrutiny.   The  Committee  is then required to decide 

whether the fees proposed by that institute are justified and are not 

profiteering   or   charging   capitation  fee.     The   judgment   further   held 

that the Committee will be at liberty to approve the fee structure or to 

propose some other fee which can be charged by the institute.  It has 

been   further   held   that,   once   fees   are   fixed   by   the   Committee,   the 

institute cannot charge either directly or indirectly any other amount 

over and above the amount fixed as fees.  It has been further held that 

if any other amount is charged, under any other head or guise e.g. 

donations, the same would amount to charging of capitation fee.  The 

Government/appropriate   authorities   have   been   further   directed   to 

consider framing of   appropriate regulations, if not already framed,

or profiteering, that institution can be appropriately penalised and also 

face the prospect of losing its recognition/affiliation.

              caution   to   such   Committees.     The   learned   counsel 
              appearing for the petitioners have severely criticised 
              the   functioning   of   some   of   the   Committees   so 
              constituted.   It   was   pointed   out   by   citing   concrete 
              examples that some of the Committees have indulged 
              in   assuming   such   powers   and   performing   such 
              functions as were never given or intended to be given 
              to   them   by  <a href="/doc/1978528/" id="a_206">Islamic   Academy   [Islamic   Academy   of  
              Education v. State of Karnataka</a>, (2003) 6 SCC 697]. 
              Certain   decisions   of   some   of   the   Committees   were 
              subjected to serious ctiticism by pointing out that the 
              fee   structure   approved   by   them   was   abysmally   low 
              which has rendered the functioning of the institutions 
              almost   impossible   or   made   the   institutions   run   into 
              losses.   In some of the institutions, the teachers have 
              left their jobs and migrated to other institutions as it 
              was   not   possible   for   the   management   to   retain 
              talented   and   highly   qualified   teachers   against   the 
              salary   permitted   by   the   Committees.     Retired   High 
              Court Judges heading the Committees are assisted by 
              experts in accounts and management.  They also have 
              the benefit of hearing and contending parties.     We 
              expect   the   Committees,   so   long   as   they   remain 
              functional, to be more sensitive and to act rationally 
              and   reasonably   with   due   regard   for   realities.   They 
              should   refrain   from   generalising   fee   structures   and, 
              where   needed,   should   go   into   accounts,   schemes, 
              plans and budgets of an individual institution for the 
              purpose  of finding out what would be an ideal and 
              reasonable fee structure for that institution."

from the purview of the said provision.  It could thus be seen that the 

legislative   intent   was   to   bring   all   unaided   Private   Professional 

Educational Institutions under the provisions of the said Act, except 

what it has specifically carved out.   It is further to be noted that, it is 

not even the case of the Petitioners that they are not bound to follow 

the part of the  Act, which deals with regulation of admissions.   As 

such,   the   contention   that   the   Act   would   not     apply   insofar   as 

regulation of fees is concerned does not hold water.

fixation of fees in Private Unaided Professional Colleges.  came to be 

considered by the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court consisting of 

five Hon'ble Judges in the case of  <a href="/doc/99335142/" id="a_209">Modern Dental College and Research  

Centre and Others vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and Others</a> 1.  It is to be 

noted that though the words used in the said statute were "fixation of 

fees", it would be relevant to refer to the following observations in 

para 80 and 81.

          "80.............. This Court went on to observe that 
          (SCC p.605, para 140) it cannot shut it eyes to the 
          hard   realities   of   commercialisation   of   education 
          and   evil   practices   being   adopted   by   many 
          institutions to earn large amounts for their private 
          or selfish ends.   In respect of Question 3 framed 
          thereunder,   which   was   with   respect   to   the 
          government   regulation   in   the   case   of   private 
          institutions,   this   Court,   in   para   141   of   the 
          judgment, answered that every institution is free 
          to devise its own fee structure, but the same can 
          be   regulated   in   the   interest   of   preventing 
          profiteering   and   no   capitation   fees   can   be 
          charged.........."

<p id="p_91">          "81.     It is in the aforesaid context that we have 
          to   determine   the   question   as   to   whether     the 
          provisions relating to fixation of fee are violative 
          of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_210">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution or they are 
          regulatory in nature, which is permissible in view 
          of   clause   (6)   of   <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_211">Article   19</a>   of   the   Constitution, 
          keeping   in   mind   that   the   Government   has   the 
          power   to   regulate   the   fixation   of   fee   in   the 
          interest   of   preventing   profiteering   and   further 
          that   fixation   of   fee   has   to   be   regulated   and 
          controlled   at   the   initial   stage   itself.     When   we 
          scan through <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_212">Section 9</a> of the 2007 Act from the 
          aforesaid   angle,   we   find   that   the   parameters 
          which are laid down therein that have to be kept 
          in mind while fixing the fee are in fact the ones 
          which have been enunciated in the judgments of 
          this Court referred to above.  It is also significant 
          to note that the Committee which is set up for this 
          purpose,   namely,  Admission   and   Fee   Regulatory  
          Committee,  is   discharging   only   a   regulatory

               itself.     The   Committee   is   empowered   with   a 
               purpose to satisfy itself that the fee proposed by 
               the   educational   institution   did   not   amount   to 
               profiteering   or   commercialisation   of   education 
               and was based on intelligible factors mentioned in 
               <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_213">Section   9(1)</a>   of   the   2007   Act.     In   our   view, 
               therefore, it is only a regulatory measure and does 
               not   take   away   the   powers   of   the   educational 
               institution to fix their own fee........."

<p id="p_92">

It could thus be seen that Their Lordships have  held that, under the 

Scheme of 2007 Act, though the term used was "fixation of fee" the 

nature of role assigned to the Committee was of discharging only a 

regulatory   function.     It   was   found   that   the   fee   which   a   particular 

educational   institution   seeks   to   charge   from   its   students   has   to   be 

suggested by the said educational institution itself. The Committee is 

empowered with a purpose to satisfy itself that the fee proposed by the 

educational   institution   did   not   amount   to   profiteering   or 

commercialisation  of education and was based on intelligble  factors

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_217">Regulation Act</a> of 2015.   The autonomous colleges 

would   be   entitled   to   fix   its   fees   in   accordance   with   Statute   613. 

However, the authority under the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_218">Regulation Act</a> of 2015 would be 

entitled to satisfy itself, as to whether fees determined by the unaided 

Private Professional Educational Institutions amounts to profiteering or 

commercialization or not.  
</p>
<p id="p_94">

58]        We further find that the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_219">Regulation Act</a> of 

2015   are   not   detrimental   to   the   concept   of   autonomy   as   provided 

under  the 1994  <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_220">Universities Act</a>  and the 2016 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_221">Universities Act</a> read 

with Statute 613 and on the contrary are conducive to it.  Perusal of 

Statute 613 would reveal that while determining fees by the Board of 

Management  on the recommendations of the Academic Board, a rider 

is provided that the  total fee should not exceed the cost of education 

per   student,   which   includes   expenses   on   salary,   non-salary   and 

maintenance and rent.   It could thus be seen that under Statute 613 

while   determining   fee,   the   only   factor   that   can   be   taken   into 

consideration   is   the   cost   of   education   per   student,   which   includes 

expenses on salary, non-salary and maintenance and rent.   Per contra,

factors   which   can   be   taken   into   consideration   while   determining 

reasonableness of the fee structure are much wider.  It could  be seen 

that   factors   like   location   of   the   institution,   the   cost   of   land   and 

building, minimum mandatorily required infrastructure or facilities, as 

specified by the appropriate  authority are required to be taken into 

consideration.   In view of clause (iv) of <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_223">Section 15</a>, which provides 

that   the   expenditure   proposed   or   incurred   on   the   facilities   and 

amenities   that   are   not   mandatory   as   per   the   guidelines   of   the 

appropriate authority, the autonomous institutions can very well point 

out the additional expenditure, either incurred by them or proposed to 

be   incurred   on   the   facilities   and   amenities   that   they   have   either 

provided   or   propose   to   provide   for   achieving   academic   excellence. 

The   other   factors   include   number   of   qualified   regularly   appointed 

teaching and non-teaching staff, expenses on the prescribed salaries of 

the   teaching   and   non-teaching     staff,   the   expenditure   on 

administration and maintenance.  It could further be seen that clause

regulation of fees.   The only rider is that, it shall not be more than 

15% of   educational   revenue in the respective professional courses. 

One   of   the   factors   which   can   also   be   taken   into   consideration   is 

incentives for quality   enhancement, such as   faculty     strength with 

Ph.D.   qualifications   and   Research   publications   in   International 

Journals   and   Patent   filed   by   the   institution,   faculty   training   and 

placement of students etc.  Not only this, clause (xiv) also permits any 

other relevant factor, as may be determined by the Fees Regulating 

Authority,   to   be   taken   into   consideration.     It   is   thus   clear   that 

discretion which the College will have while determining fees under 

the   <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_225">Regulation   Act</a>   of  2015  is much  wider  as compared  to  the  one 

under Statute 613 framed under the 1994 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_226">Universities Act</a>.



59] It   could   thus   be   seen   that   if   parameters   as   provided   under 

<a href="/doc/576649/" id="a_227">Section 15</a> of the Regulation Act of 2015 are to be exercised by the 

Petitioners  while determining their fees, they would have much more 

freedom  to  charge   fees in proportion  with the services rendered by 

them, in their pursuit of academic excellence in contrast to the limited 

scope   that   they   have   under   Statute   613.     The   only   role   that   the

As   such,   while   considering   a   statutory   provision   enacted   by   the 

competent   legislature,   the   said   guidelines   will   have   no   relevance. 

Apart from that, we are of the considered view that, even though the 

said guidelines do not have binding force, there is no conflict of the 

said   guidelines   with   the   <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_231">Regulation   Act</a>   of   2015.     As   discussed 

hereinabove, there is nothing in the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_232">Regulation Act</a> of 2015, which can 

be   said   to   have   an   adverse   effect   on   administrative,   academic   or

financial autonomy of the autonomous institutions.   On the contrary, 

as   discussed   hereinabove,   the   factors   which   can   be   taken   into 

consideration   while   determination   or   regulation   of   fees   under   the 

<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_233">Regulation Act</a> of 2015 are much wider as compared to the provisions 

contained in Statute 613 framed under the 1994 <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_234">Universities Act</a>.  The 

only   restriction   is   that,   the   institutions   should   not   indulge   in 

profiteering   or   commercialization.     <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_235">The   Act</a>   does   not,   in   any   way, 

interfere with the financial management of autonomous institutions. 

It   is   further   to   be   noted   that,   under   Statute   633,   the   autonomous 

colleges etc. are also entitled to raise funds from  various sources like 

accepting   endowments   or   donations   which   are   not   linked   with   the 

admissions, grant-in-aid, other assistance from funding agencies and 

such other resources, which are legally permissible and in consonance 

with the objectives of the University and of the Autonomous College 

etc.   <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_236">The Regulation Act</a> of 2015, in no way, affects the rights which 

the   autonomous   institutions   will   have   under   Statute   633   for 

generating additional funds.

63] Apart from that, we find that if arguments of the Petitioners are 

to be accepted, it would lead to wholly anomalous situation. While all

other   unaided   Private   Professional   Educational   Institutions   will   be 

subject to regulation, so that they do not indulge into profiteering or 

commercialization,   there   will   be   total   freedom   to   the   autonomous 

institutions to charge fees as they desire and indulge into profiteering 

and commercialization.   This will be wholly contrary to the mandate 

of the judgments of the two Constitution Benches of the Apex Court. 

  

64] Insofar as various judgments cited at bar by Mr. Chinoy, learned 

Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Petitioners, are concerned, 

we find that reference to the same would not be necessary. As already 

discussed hereinabove,    our first duty is   to find out as to whether 

there exist really any conflict between the two provisions.  Only if such 

conflict   is   found   to   be   existing,   then   the   question   as   to   which   is  a 

special law and which  is a general law and which should prevail over 

other,   would   arise.     However,   upon   perusal   of   the   1994   &amp;   2016 

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_237">Universities Act</a> on the one hand and the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_238">Regulation Act</a> of 2015 on 

the   other  hand,   we  are  of  the  considered view that  there  exists no 

conflict and that both of them can simultaneously exist in the fields 

discussed hereinabove.
