</p><p id="p_3">1.     Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. Reply

       submitted today by the Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 is ordered to be taken


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">O.A. No. 52 of 2014                                               Page 3 of 8</span>
        on record. Copy of the same has been furnished to the learned counsel

       for the Applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.     This application had been filed by the Applicant complaining about the

       pollution being caused by various units including that of Respondent No.

       5 in the industrial area at Govindpura in Bhopal.        As regards the

       Respondent No. 5, it was submitted that the said unit is operating sand

       blasting and short blasting at Plot No. 3, Sector-D of the Industrial Area

       of Govindpura and as a result of the aforesaid activity, since necessary

       precautionary measures had not been put into place, they were violating

       the provisions of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981

       and causing air pollution in the vicinity.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.     The Tribunal after receipt of the application directed issuance of notice

       vide order dated 13th March, 2014. After service of notice, the matter

       was taken up for hearing on 4th April, 2014. The learned counsel for the

       MPPCB submitted their reply and stated that inspections were being

       carried out in the premises of the Respondent No. 5 and notices with

       regard to the shortcomings in terms of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Act</a> under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_3">Section 31(A)</a>

       had been issued to the Respondent No. 5. It was further stated that as a

       result of the aforesaid notices, the Respondent No. 5 had closed the unit.

</p><p id="p_6">4.     In the reply filed by the Respondent Nos. 3 and 4, it has been submitted

       that inspection of the unit of the Respondent No. 5 was carried out on

       27th March, 2014 by the officers of the MPPCB and notice was issued.

       It has been submitted today by the learned counsel for the MPPCB that

       after the aforesaid notice was issued, the Respondent No. 5 had

       approached the Pollution Control Board stating that rectification had

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">O.A. No. 52 of 2014                                                  Page 4 of 8</span>
        been done and requested that an inspection may be taken up. Therefore,

       the Pollution Control Board again deputed its officers for inspection but

       it was found that the measures so adopted, were inadequate and as such

       permission to operate the unit had not been granted by the Pollution

       Control Board to the Respondent No. 5.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.     Learned counsel for the Respondent No. 5 submitted that other units

       located in the industrial area at Govindpura in Bhopal were also

       committing similar violations and they wre still being permitted to run

       and only the Respondent No. 5 has been targeted.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.     Learned counsel for the Respondent No. 3 submitted that the above fact

       is not correct and similar notices under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>, 1981 have been

       issued to the other industries also which are found to be non-compliant

       and in case these fail to take satisfactory measures, the same shall also

       be ordered to be closed down.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.     Learned counsel for the Respondent No. 5 submitted that the Respondent

       No. 5 will be taking all the necessary measures and may be allowed to

       operate the unit once the said measures are put into place.

</p><p id="p_10">8.     So far as the aforesaid prayer is concerned, we direct that the Respondent

       No. 5 shall be at liberty to approach the officials of the Regional Office

       of the Pollution Control Board at Bhopal and request them to carry out

       the inspection and on receipt of the aforesaid intimation from the

       Respondent No. 5, the officials of the Pollution Control Board shall carry

       out the inspection within a week thereafter and in case the measures

       taken by the Respondent No. 5 are found to be satisfactory, shall proceed

       in accordance with law for granting the consent to Respondent No. 5.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">O.A. No. 52 of 2014                                                  Page 5 of 8</span>
        We may also add that after receiving the response of other units to whom

       notices have been issued, inspection shall be carried out and in case

       satisfactory measures are not in place, action with regard to closure of

       those units shall be initiated by the Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 including

       disconnection of the electricity and water supply to the said units.

</p><p id="p_11">9.     While the grievance of the Applicant with regard to the present issue has

       been taken care of, we may add that this is the position prevailing in the

       Capital of the State of Madhya Pradesh where the headquarters of the

       Pollution Control Board itself is located and the Regional Office of the

       Pollution Control Board is also situated. It should not be left to the

       Applicants to come and complain against such violations and it is the

       duty of the officials of the Pollution Control Board to carry out a regular

       monitoring and inspection and as and when units are found to be non-

       compliant or polluting action in accordance with law shall be initiated

       against them.
</p>
<p id="p_12">10.    Learned counsel for the Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 submitted that with the

       volume of the work as well as the available staff it is not possible for the

       Pollution Control Board to carry out inspection as would be expected out

       of them. It was submitted that this Tribunal had already issued directions

       to the State Government for increasing the sanctioned strength of posts

       in the Pollution Control Board and the aforesaid matter is still pending

       with the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_13">11.    Shri Sachin Verma, learned Standing Counsel for the State submitted

       that the State had already considered the aforesaid issue and even the

       Finance Department has given its concurrence however some

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">O.A. No. 52 of 2014                                                    Page 6 of 8</span>
        clarifications were sought from the Pollution Control Board and the

       matter rests at that.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12.    Whatever be the problem with regard to compliance of the directions

       issued by this Tribunal in the Judgment dated 9th May, 2013 in the case

       of Cox India Ltd. Vs. M.P. Pollution Control Board , we direct that the

       Principal Secretary, Environment and Housing shall take up the issue

       with the Chairman, Pollution Control Board and all measures that are

       necessary shall be put into place and necessary government sanctions be

       issued for the revision of the sanctioned strength of the staff within two

       weeks and direction in the judgment dated 9th May, 2013 be complied

       with. The matter shall be listed on 15th May, 2014 before the Tribunal

       and by that date if the compliance is not made, the Principal Secretary,

       Environment and Housing shall appear personally along with the

       Chairman, Pollution Control Board to explain the issue and file

       necessary affidavits regarding the steps taken so far and show cause why

       the judgment dated 9th May, 2013 has not been complied with. In case,

       we do not find satisfactory explanation for the delay, the Tribunal shall

       hold the officers concerned personally liable and if necessary issue penal

       orders against them for non-compliance.
</p>
<p id="p_15">13.    We make it clear that in case sanction orders are issued and compliance

       in the case of Cox India Ltd. (supra) is made before 15th May, 2014, the

       personal appearance of the aforesaid officers shall stand dispensed with

       and it would be sufficient to file the affidavits of the Principal Secretary,

       Environment &amp; Housing and Chairman, MPPCB.
