</pre><p id="p_1">                         (06.10.2017)

This petition has been preferred under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">section 482</a> of the

Cr.P.C against the impugned order dated 12/03/2003

passed in Criminal Case No.138/2003 (MP Pollution
Control Board Vs. Kamal Kishore &amp; others) by the

Judicial Magistrate First Class, Satna with regard to

taking cognizance of <a href="/doc/923007/" id="a_2">sections 37</a> and <a href="/doc/1445515/" id="a_3">39</a> read with

<a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_4">section 40</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter for brevity referred as Act) and
 issuing process for appearance of the applicants/accused

persons and M/s Maihar Cement Company.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2. On 16/11/2015 on behalf of the petitioner no.3, it was

expressed that he does not want to press this petition.

Therefore, the petition qua petitioner no.3 dismissed as

not pressed. Similarly, on 21/09/2017 on behalf of the

petitioner no.2, it was expressed petitioner no. 2 does

not want to press the petition. Hence the petition qua

petitioner no.3 is also dismissed as not pressed.

</p><p id="p_3">3. Now this petition to be disposed of deeming to be filed

by the petitioner no.1 challenging the aforesaid

impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4. In this petition it is not controversial that at the

relevant time applicant no.1 Kamal Kishore was the

President of M/s Maihar Cement Company/accused no.4,

which is producing cement and its production capacity

have been enhanced from time-to-time.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5. Now facts giving rise to this petition are that on behalf

of the respondent on 27/01/2003 a complaint for

prosecution of applicants and M/s Maihar Cement

Company for commission of offence punishable under
 <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_6">section 37</a>, <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_7">39</a> read with <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_8">section 40</a> of the Act was filed.

In the complaint it was alleged that the accused

Company is engaged in manufacturing cement by using

raw material such as crushed limestone, coal, literate,

bauxite, clay, gypsum, etc; storage of the raw material,

handling and transportation &amp; generate particulate

matters which are blown out in the air causing air

pollution and this is within the knowledge of the accused

person as it is all done under their directions. The

consent is given for operation of the plant under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_9">Section

21</a> of the Act and conditions are imposed therein, of

which the main conditions are installation of air control

equipment, house keeping, control of fugitive emissions

and keeping the stack and ambient emissions within

limits as per prescribed standards. That other important

conditions are that particulate matters through chimney

do not exceed 150 mg per cubic meter before 05/12/2002

and after, 100 mg per cubic meter and suspended

particulates not exceeding 500 microgram per cubic

meter per day (average) and 60 microgram per cubic

meter annually (average). That these conditions were
 mentioned in the consent letters/renewal of consent

letters upto 2003 but the petitioners did not comply with

the conditions and openly violated them. The complaint

further mentions specifically that the officers of the

Board took the samples of air from the factory premises

in the presence of the officers of the company and from

time to time, informed them about fugitive emissions

exceeding the limits right from 2000 to 2002 and the

officers of the Board also carried out inspections from

time to time and apprised the management of the

deficiencies found in inspection but the management of

the factory did not take positive steps to stop air

pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6. Further on 24/12/2012 following procedure prescribed

under <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_10">section 26</a> and <a href="/doc/30564828/" id="a_11">27</a> of the Act, air samples were

taken in the presence of Additional Manager Shri Vijay

Kumar and samples were sent for labotary on 25/12/2012

and report was received on 26/12/2012 and send by

registered post to Company on 10/01/2013 and according

to the report sample indicated the presence of particles

in excess of the norms, which is in violation of <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_12">Section 26</a>
 of the Act, thus the Company is violating condition of

consent and instructions and directions given to prevent

or take appropriate measure to stop air pollution, which

is punishable under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_13">section 37</a> and <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_14">39</a> of the Act and the

entire operation of the factory and production of the

cement have been carried out under the supervision of

the applicants. Hence they as well as company are liable

to be prosecuted accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7. With the complaint copy of several communications

between the Pollution Board and the Company have been

filed. Apart from it, report of analyst with regard to

confirmation of air pollution has also been filed. On the

basis of the avernment in the complaint and the

documents submitted with the complaint by impugned

order cognizance has been taken and process for

appearance of the accused persons was issued, which is

under challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8. That the impugned order has been challenged mainly

on the ground that the impugned order is non-speaking

order. No reason has been mentioned. Hence the order is

bad in law. The impugned order is also against the
 provision of <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_15">section 40</a> of the Act as against the applicant

no.1 there is no specific allegation indicating his

responsibility for conducting the business of the

Company as the applicant no.1 is not concerned with the

day-to-day work and cannot be prosecuted. The

impugned order have also been challenged on the

ground that respondent has not followed the procedure

for taking sample, therefore, report of the analyst is not

acceptable and on the basis of the report no offence is

made out. Therefore the impugned order be quashed.

</p><p id="p_9">9. Learned counsel for the respondent has contended

that impugned order does not require any interference.

It is in accordance with the law as for issuing process

under <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_16">section 204</a> of the Cr.P.C the Magistrate is not

required to pass detailed reasoned order. His prima facie

satisfaction on the basis of the averment of the complaint

and other material submitted for perusal is sufficient. On

recording such satisfaction, the order for issuance of

process may be passed. In the instant complaint there is

a specific avernment about violation of the <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_17">section 37</a>

and <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_18">39</a> of the Act and also specific avernment in the
 complaint as required under <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_19">section 40</a> the Act for

prosecution of the applicants. Apart from it, whether the

report of analyst is acceptable or not or prescribed

procedure has been followed or not or what is the affect

of it, cannot be considered here. It is the subject matter

of the trial court and on that ground this Court can't

interfere in the proceeding of the trial court. Hence

petition be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10. Having considered the contentions of learned counsel

for the parties and perusal of the record, in view of this

Court applicant's contentions have no substance. The

applicant has assailed the impugned order firstly on the

ground that the Magistrate has not given any reason in

the impugned order and any non-speaking order of the

judicial authority is bad in law but this contention has no

substance as the provision of <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_20">section 204</a> of Cr.P.C does

not require recording of reasons for issuance of process.

The Apex Court in the case of Kanti Bhadra Shah Vs.

State of West Bengal (2000) 1 SCC 722 has observed

that
       "If there is no legal requirement that the trial court
       should write an order showing the reasons for
       framing a charge, why should the already burdened
       trial Courts be further burdened with such an extra
       work. The time has reached to adopt all possible
       measures to expedite the the court procedures and
       to chalk out measures to avert all roadblocks
      causing avoidable delays. If a Magistrate is to write
      detailed orders at different stages merely because
      the counsel would address arguments at all stages,
      the snail paced progress of proceedings in trial
      courts would further be slowed down. We are
      coming across interlocutory orders of Magistrates
      and Sessions Judges running into several pages. We
      can appreciate if such a detailed order has been
      passed for culminating the proceedings before
      them. But it is quite unnecessary to write detailed
      orders at other stages, such as issuing process,
      remanding the accused to custody, framing of
      charges, passing over to next stage in the trial.


</p><p id="p_11">11. The aforesaid view have also been followed in the

case U.P Pollution Control Board Vs. M/s Mohan

Meakins Limited &amp; others (2003) 3 SCC 745.

</p><p id="p_12">12. In view of the aforesaid pronouncements of the Apex

Court recording of reasons for issuance of process is not

must. Under <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_21">section 204</a> of Cr.P.C it is expected from the

Magistrate to examine the avernment of the complaint

and the statements of complainant and witnesses, if

taken or the other material produced in support of the

complaint with a view to frame opinion that prima facie it

appears that there is a sufficient ground for proceeding

against the person named as accused. In view of the
discussion, the impugned order cannot be assailed on the

ground of lack of recording of reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_13">13. Further contention of learned counsel for the

applicant is that the report of the analyst is not

trustworthy but truthfulness of the report is not required
 to be examined at this stage under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_22">section 482</a> of Cr.P.C.

The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of U.P Pollution

Control Board Vs. Dr. Bhupendra Kumar Modi &amp;

anr (2009) 2 SCC 147 has observed as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          When exercising jurisdiction under Section
          482 of the Code, the High Court could not
          ordinarily embark upon an enquiry whether
          the evidence in question is reliable or not or
          whether on a reasonable appreciation of it
          accusation would not be sustained. To put it
          clear, it is the function of the trial Judge to do
          so. .......However, it is not necessary that there
          should be meticulous analysis of the case
          before the trial to find out whether the case
          would end in conviction or acquittal.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_14">14. The avernment made in the complaint and the copies
of communications and the report, prima facie satisfy

that the report of analyst is admissible and prima facie

believable for the purpose of framing opinion with regard

to satisfaction of the Magistrate to proceed under <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_23">section

204</a> of Cr.P.C. Therefore, on the aforesaid account also

impugned order cannot be assailed.
</p>
<p id="p_15">15. Further the main contention of the applicant is that

in the complaint there is no specific avernment about the

applicant no.1 that he was responsible for the day-to-day

business of the Company or was in-charge of the

Company at the time of commission of the alleged

offence as required under <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_24">section 40</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_16"> 16. The provision of <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_25">section 40</a> of the Act is as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     40. Offences by companies.--
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     (1) Where an offence under this Act has been
     committed by a company, every person who, at the
     time the offence was committed, was directly in
     charge of, and was responsible to, the company for
     the conduct of the business of the company, as well
     as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the
     offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against
     and punished accordingly:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section
     shall render any such person liable to any
     punishment provided in this Act, if he proves that the
     offence was committed without his knowledge or
     that he exercised all due diligence to prevent the
     commission of such offence.
</blockquote><p id="p_17"> 2. Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section
    (1), where an offence under this Act has been
    committed by a company and it is proved that the
    offence has been committed with the consent or
    connivance of, or is attributable to any neglect on the
    part of, any director, manager, secretary or other
    officer of the company, such director, manager,
    secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to be
    guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be
    proceeded against and punished accordingly.
     Explanation.--For the purposes of this section,--
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">           (a) "company" means any body corporate, and
           includes a firm or other association of
           individuals; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">          (b) "director", in relation to a firm, means a
          partner in the firm."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_18">17. That with regard to interpretation of the aforesaid

provision, learned counsel for the applicant has stated

that as per sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_26">Section 40</a> where an

offence under this Act has been committed by company,

every person who at the time of offence was committed,

was directly in charge of, and was responsible to the

company for the conduct of the business of the company,

as well as the company, has been deemed to be guilty. So

apart from the company only the person who was

directly in charge of and was responsible to the company
 for the conduct of the business of the company at the

time of offence was committed is guilty. That as per sub-

section (2) of <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_27">section 40</a> where an offence under this Act

has been committed by a company and it is proved that

the offence has been committed with the consent or

connivance of, or is attributable to any neglect on the

part of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer

of the company, shall also be deemed to be guilty. Thus,

<a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_28">section 40</a> of the Act is very clear. It has been

interpreted in AIR 1983 SC 67 (Municipal

Corporation of Delhi Vs. Ram Kishan Rohatagi &amp;

ors). In paragraph 13 and 15, the Apex Court with

respect to the Manager and the Director has observed

that so far as the Manager is concerned, we are satisfied

that from the very nature of his duties it can be safely

inferred that he would undoubtedly be vicariously liable

for the offence; vicarious liability being an incident of an

offence under the Act. So far as the Directors are

concerned, there is not even a whisper nor a shred of

evidence nor anything to show, apart from the

presumption drawn by the complainant, that there is any
 act committed by the Directors from which a reasonable

inference can be drawn that they could also be

vicariously liable. In these circumstances, therefore, we

find ourselves in complete agreement with the argument

of the High Court that no case against the Directors has

been made out ex facie on the allegations made in the

complaint and the proceedings against them were rightly

quashed by the High Court. Further it is submitted that as per

<a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_29">section 40</a> of the Act, and other provisions made in other

special Acts like <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_30">Negotiable Instruments Act</a> <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_31">section 141</a>,

the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of National Small

Industries Corporation Limited Vs. Harmeet Singh

Paintal &amp; other (2010) 3 SCC 330 held that offence

committed by company as per provision of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_32">section 141</a>

not every person connected with the company are liable

but only those in charge of and responsible for conduct

of business of the company at the time of commission of

offence are vicariously liable. Hence, Director of accused

Company who was not in charge of or responsible for the

conduct of its business at the time of commission of

offence, held, not so liable.
</p><p id="p_19"> 18. In reply learned counsel for the respondent has

stated that in the paragraph 6 and 7 of the complaint,

there are specific avernment with regard to applicant

no.1 and other applicants that the entire operation of the

factory and production of the cement are carried out

under the supervision of all applicants and all the

activities relating to violation of provision of <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_33">section 37</a>

and <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_34">39</a> of the Act are carried out on the direction and

knowledge of the applicants/accused persons in which

applicant no.1 as President, applicant no.2 as Joint

President and applicant no.3 as Additional General

Manager of the production are otherwise responsible for

the production activities of the company. The

communications show that with regard to the conditions

and instructions to observe the provision of the Act have

been communicated time-to-time to the applicants.

Therefore prima facie it will be deemed that with their

consent or connivance aforesaid activities of the

company were taken place and if the applicant being the

President has not paid attention running a factory for

producing the cement with regard to non-compliance of
 the conditions with a view to prevent the pollution, it

would amount to gross negligence of highest officer of

the company, which also comes under the purview of

sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_35">Section 40</a> of the Act and if applicant

pleads that the aforesaid activities of the company was

not in his knowledge at all then he has right to prove

such fact under the proviso sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_36">Section 40</a>

of the Act at the time of trial. This aspect or defence

cannot be considered at the stage of issuance of process

under <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_37">section 204</a> of Cr.P.C and the order cannot be

made questionable before this Court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_38">section 482</a>

of Cr.P.C on the aforesaid ground.
</p>
<p id="p_20">19. Learned counsel for the respondent has placed

reliance on the judgment of U.P Pollution Board Vs.

Dr. Bhupendra Kumar Modi (2009)2 SCC 147 in

which it is held that when there is substantial avernment

in the complaint with regard to Joint Managing Director

Dr. Bhupendra Kumar Modi that at the relevant time he

was in charge of the business of the company and

responsible for the day-to-day working of the company,

hence the order of Allahabad High Court with regard to
 quashment of the proceeding under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_39">section 482</a> of Cr.P.C

is not upheld. In this case Apex Court has further

observed in para 38 to 41, which is relevant and

reproduced as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">    38. In the case on hand which is also similar to
    Mohan Meakins Ltd. (2003) 3 SCC 745, had
    commenced its journey in the year 1985,
    nonetheless lapse of such long period cannot
    be a reason to absolve the respondents from
    the trial. In a matter of this nature,
    particularly, when it affects public health if it
    is ultimately proved, courts cannot afford to
    deal lightly with cases involving pollution of
    air and water. The message must go to all
    concerned persons whether small or big that
    the courts will share the parliamentary
    concern and legislative intent of the Act to
    check the escalating pollution level and
    restore the balance of our environment.
    Those who discharge noxious polluting
    effluents into streams, rivers or any other
    water bodies which inflicts on the public
    health at large, should be dealt with strictly
    de hors to the technical objections. Since
    escalating pollution level of our environment
    affects on the life and health of human beings
    as well as animals, the courts should not deal
    with the prosecution for offences under the
    pollution and environmental Acts in a causal
    or routine manner.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">    39. It is our endeavour to point out that the
    High Court has quashed the complaint arising
    in an environmental matter in a casual
    manner by exercising power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_40">Section
    482</a> of the Cr.P.C. This Court has held
    exercise of power under <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_41">Section 482of</a> the
    Code is the exception and under the rule
    there are three circumstances under which
    the inherent jurisdiction may be exercised i.e.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">    (a) to give effect to an order of the Court; (b)
    to prevent abuse of the process of the Court;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">    (c) to otherwise secure the ends of justice.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">    40. It is true that it is neither possible nor
    desirable to lay down any inflexible rule
    which would govern the exercise of inherent
    jurisdiction. While exercising inherent powers
    either on civil or criminal jurisdiction, the
    Court does not function as a Court of Appeal
    or Revision. The inherent jurisdiction though
    wide has to be exercised sparingly, carefully
    and with caution. It should be exercised to do
    real and substantial justice and if any attempt
    is made to abuse that authority so as to
    produce injustice, the Court has power to
    prevent abuse. When no offence is disclosed
    by the complaint, the Court may examine the
    question of fact. When complaint is sought to
    be quashed, it is permissible to look into the
    materials to assess what the complainant had
    alleged and whether any offence is made out
    even if the allegations are accepted in toto.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">    41. When exercising jurisdiction under
    <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_42">Section 482</a> of the Code, the High Court
    could not ordinarily embark upon an enquiry
    whether the evidence in question is reliable
    or not or whether on a reasonable
    appreciation of it accusation would not be
    sustained. To put it clear, it is the function of
    the trial Judge to do so. The Court must be
    careful to see that its decision in exercise of
    its power is based on sound principles. The
    inherent power should not be exercised to
      stifle a legitimate prosecution. If the
     allegations set out in the complaint do not
     constitute offence of which cognizance has
     been taken by the Magistrate, it is open to
     the High Court to quash the same in exercise
     of the inherent powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_43">Section 482</a> of
     the Cr.P.C. However, it is not necessary that
     there should be meticulous analysis of the
     case before the trial to find out whether the
     case would end in conviction or acquittal.
</blockquote><p id="p_21">20. In the light of the above contentions and law laid

down by the Apex Court and in view of the specific

avernment in the paragraph 6 and 7 of the complaint, in

view of this Court the respondent has made specific

avernment as required under <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_44">section 40</a> of the Act to

prosecute the applicant for violation of <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_45">section 37</a> and <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_46">39</a>

of the Act by the company of which he was the President

at the relevant time as in the instant case there is not

only specific avernment in the complaint as mentioned

earlier but there is also communications between the

Pollution Board and President of the Company about the

violation of the norms, directions and conditions to

control and prevent the air pollution, which is natural

result of the processing of production of the cement.
</p><p id="p_22">21. The person, who is President of the Company

indulging in the activities of the production of cement

cannot say that it is not his responsibility to see that the

company is observing or not the provisions of the Act
 with a view to ensure safety and health of general public.

The communications show that number of times

instructions and warnings have been given to follow the

norms with a view to prevent and control the air

pollution and at the time of providing permission to

extend capacity of the production specific and categorize

conditions and norms have been communicated to the

company and it cannot be presumed that the applicant

being President of the Company was not aware about the

aforesaid norms, conditions and continue violation by the

company.
</p>
<p id="p_23">22. The President and other higher officers of the

company cannot take plea that they are only concerned

with the profit and loss of the company and they are not

supposed to pay attention towards the observation of the

law with regard to prevent or control of the pollution

which is essential part of the nature of the industry

concerned. Therefore, in view of this Court in present

case there are specific avernments and material on

record to frame the opinion by the Magistrate that prima

facie sufficient ground exists for issuance of process to
 prosecute the applicants on the basis of the complaint for

commission of offence under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_47">section 37</a> and <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_48">39</a> and

<a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_49">section 40</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_24">23. In view of the discussion, this petition is dismissed

being devoid of merits and interim order passed on

2/06/2005 with regard to stay of proceeding of the trial

court stands vacated.
</p>
<p id="p_25">A copy of this order be also sent to the trial court for

information.
