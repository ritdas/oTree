Prayer

Criminal Revision Petition filed under Section 397 r/w 401 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>.,
to call for the records relating to the order passed by the respondent in his
proceedings Roc.No.C3/48935/2014 dated 18.04.2015 and set aside the same as
illegal.

!For Petitioner     	:: Mr.K.M.Vijayan Senior counsel
			for Mr.B.Saravanan
	
^For Respondent 	:: Mr.P.Kannithevan
			Govt. Advocate (crl. side)

:ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">	The petitioner is a company known as M/s.Romana Distillery Industries
Private Ltd.  The said company is engaged in the manufacturing of packaged
drinking water. For the said purpose, the petitioner company has dug a Well
in the land comprised in S.Nos.42/1 and 42/3A at Magilady Village,
Tirunelveli District, for drawing water from the said Well for the said
business purpose.  The petitioner applied for No Objection Certificate from
the Water Resources Department, Government of Tamil Nadu.  The Chief
Engineer, State Ground and Surface Water Resources Data Centre, Chennai,
issued a certificate in Certificate No.423/NOC/Chennai/2014 dated 11.09.2014
expressing no objection for drawal of a total quantity of 10,000 litres per
day from the said Well for the purpose of packaged drinking water.  The
petitioner further claims that he also applied for consent from the Tamil
Nadu Pollution Control Board for the said purpose.  The District
Environmental Engineer, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, Tirunelveli by
his proceedings in No.F.TNV1430/GS/A/2014 dated 14.11.2014 has authorised the
said company to establish the industry in the site mentioned and to operate
the same.  The Department of Industry and Commerce has also granted
permission for the petitioner for doing the packaged drinking water
manufacturing as per Form No.2014/33/029/18659/PRDT.  According to the
petitioner, though he has satisfied all the legal formalities in getting
either no objection or permission from the various authorities, the
manufacturing process has not yet been commenced.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. While so, the respondent issued a show cause notice under Notice
No.C3/48935/14 dated 30.12.2014 purportedly under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_2">Section 133</a> of the Code of
Criminal Procedure calling upon him to show cause as to why he should not be
restrained from doing the said business by drawing water from the Well.  The
petitioner submitted a detailed reply on 08.01.2015, wherein, he had stated
that he had already obtained all necessary orders granting permission or no
objection from the various authorities and that the manufacturing had not yet
been commenced.  Yet another notice was subsequently issued by the District
Collector on 12.01.2015 in No.C3/48935/2014 that was challenged by the
petitioner before this Court by way of writ petition in W.P.(MD) No.3093 of
2015 and   this Court by order dated 09.03.2015 disposed of the said petition
with a direction to the petitioner to appear before the District Collector on
10.03.2015 and submit his detailed reply and with a further direction to the
authorities concerned to consider the same and to pass appropriate orders.
In pursuance of the same, the petitioner appeared before the respondent and
submitted relevant records such as the orders obtained from various
authorities and also explained to the District Collector that he had not
commenced the manufacturing.  He further submitted that since drawal of water
from the Well is going to be done in accordance with the orders obtained from
the various authorities, it will not amount to nuisance in terms of <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_3">Section
133</a> Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3. Having considered all the above, the respondent, by his proceedings
in RoC.No.C3/48935/2014 dated 18.04.2015, has passed the final order under
<a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_4">Section 133</a> of the Code, thereby prohibiting drawal of ground water by the
petitioner company through the new open Well or bore well or in any other
manner.  The District Collector has also ordered for the closure of the Unit.
He has further directed the Tahsildar, Nanguneri to ensure the closure of the
Unit and disconnection of electricity for the purpose of drawal of water.  It
is this order, which is under challenge in this revision.
</p><p id="p_4">	4. In this revision, the learned Senior Counsel raised three grounds
among other grounds.
</p><p id="p_5">	(1) The first and foremost ground is that when the drawal of water is
going to be performed in accordance with the orders issued by various
authorities under atleast four enactments governing the field, the District
Collector has got no jurisdiction to invoke his power under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_5">Section 133</a> of
the Code, as the drawal of water in accordance with the above orders would
not amount to nuisance in terms of <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_6">Section 133</a> of the Code of Criminal
Procedure.
</p><p id="p_6">	(2) He would further submit that when the drawal of water had not yet
been commenced, question of issuing any order under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_7">Section 133</a> of the Code
would not arise.
</p><p id="p_7">	(3) He would further submit that in this case, no preliminary order
under <a href="/doc/264083/" id="a_8">Section 133(1)</a> of the Code was passed and therefore, the impugned
order, which is a final order under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_9">Section 133</a> of the Code is wholly without
jurisdiction and the same is vitiated. For this proposition, the learned
Senior counsel relies on a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
C.A.Avarachan vs. C.V.Sreenivasan and another reported in (1996) 7 SCC 71.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	5. A detailed counter has been filed by the respondent, wherein, he has
stated that drawal of water from the Well for the purpose of business would
ruin the life of the Farmers in that area as the water in the nearby lakes
would deplete. It is further stated that only after holding enquiry, the
impugned order has been passed.  It is also stated that it is the duty of the
revenue authorities to maintain the water bodies and since in the instant
case, drawal of water from the Well will result in decrease of water in the
lakes, the impugned order came to be passed.
</p>	
<p id="p_9">	6. The learned Government Advocate (Crl. Side) for the respondent would
submit that it is true that there was no preliminary order passed as required
under <a href="/doc/264083/" id="a_10">Section 133(1)</a> of the Code, but that would not automatically vitiate
the entire subsequent proceedings including the impugned order.  According to
him, passing of such preliminary order, is purely a procedure and the same
does not touch upon the jurisdiction of the Magistrate.  He would further
submit that the petitioner did not raise any objection regarding the fact
that there was no preliminary order passed and instead he submitted to the
jurisdiction of the Magistrate by participating in the proceedings and
therefore, it is too late in the day for him to raise such objection that
there was no such preliminary order as required under <a href="/doc/264083/" id="a_11">Section 133(1)</a> of the
Code.  The learned Government Advocate would further submit that the impugned
order has been passed in public interest and therefore, the same need not be
interfered with by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_10">	7. I have considered the above submissions and I have also perused the
records carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_11">	8. As I already narrated, admittedly, the petitioner has dug a Well in
the land in question and he has proposed to draw water from the Well for the
purpose of manufacturing packaged drinking water.  However, such drawal of
water is governed by certain enactments such as <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_12">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,
1986, Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. As rightly contended by the
learned Senior Counsel, when these three enactments govern the field and when
the business is going to be done after completing all the legal formalities
as required under these enactments, invoking the power under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_15">Section 133</a> of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, which is a general enactment, is not legal.
When the petitioner has obtained orders under these enactments from the
appropriate authorities, he has got every right to do the business strictly
in terms of these orders.  If the District Collector or anybody else has got
any grievance regarding these orders, it is always open for the individual or
the District Collector to approach the statutory authorities or other
authorities under these enactments for withdrawal of these orders.  It is not
as though the orders upon which reliance has been made by the petitioner have
been issued by responsible statutory authorities.  Unless and until, these
orders are cancelled or varied, the petitioner has got every right to do the
business strictly in terms of these orders.   Therefore, as rightly contended
by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the action of the District
Collector in passing the impugned order purportedly under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_16">Section 133</a> of the
Code of Criminal Procedure is wholly without jurisdiction and the same cannot
be allowed to sustain.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	9. Now turning to the next contention of the learned Senior Counsel,
Sub Section (1) of <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_17">Section 133</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that
the Executive Magistrate, either from a police report or from any other
information and on taking such evidence, as he thinks fit, has to necessarily
pass a conditional order requiring the person carrying on such trade or
occupation etc., to desist from doing so, provided carrying on such trade or
occupation is found to be injurious to the health or the physical comfort of
the community and by fixing a time limit for obedience.
</p>
<p id="p_13">	10. Under <a href="/doc/1217486/" id="a_18">Section 136</a> of the Code, if such person does not perform such
Act or appear and show cause, he shall be liable to the penalty prescribed in
that behalf in <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_19">Section 188</a> of the Indian Penal Code and the order shall be
made absolute.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	11. For any reason, if he does not oppose the order within the time
prescribed in the preliminary order and obeys the order then, the order shall
be made absolute on the expiry of the said date.  For any reason, if the
person against whom such preliminary order has been passed raises objection,
he should be afforded opportunity and thereafter as required under <a href="/doc/572324/" id="a_20">Section
138(1)</a> of the Code, he should be allowed to let in further evidence, as in a
summons case. On the basis of such evidence, the Executive Magistrate has to
decide whether to make the preliminary order absolute with or without
modification or not.  Thus, both while passing the preliminary order as well
as while passing the final order, the issue is one and the same.  If only
such a preliminary order, which is a conditional order, has been passed,
question of making it absolute will arise.  In the absence of a preliminary
order, there will be no occasion for the Executive Magistrate to make any
order absolute.  In other words, in the absence of a preliminary order, no
final order as required under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_21">Sections 133</a> and <a href="/doc/1834702/" id="a_22">138</a> of the Code could be
passed.
</p>
<p id="p_15">	12. In C.A.Avarachan's case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had dealt with
the issue as to whether the final order made under <a href="/doc/1834702/" id="a_23">Section 138</a> of the Code
will stand vitiated on account of the fact that there was no preliminary
order passed under sub Section (1) of <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_24">Section 133</a> of the Code.  After making
elaborate discussion in respect of the scope of a preliminary order under
<a href="/doc/264083/" id="a_25">Section 133(1)</a> of the Code and the consequences of the failure of the
authority to pass such an order, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraph Nos.4
and 5 has held as follows:
</p><p id="p_16">	?4.In our opinion the omission on the part of the Sub-Divisional
Magistrate to draw up a preliminary order, which is a sine qua non for
initiating proceedings under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_26">Section 133</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure
and without following the procedure provided for by <a href="/doc/1834702/" id="a_27">Section 138</a> Cr.P.C., the
order made by the Sub Divisional Magistrate on 13.01.1988 is unsustainable
and is vitiated.  The High Court fell in error in not properly appreciating
the effect of non-compliance with the mandatory requirements of drawing up a
preliminary order before proceedings under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_28">Section 133</a> Cr.P.C.  Neither the
order of the High Court nor that of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate can
therefore, be sustained.
</p><p id="p_17">	5.This appeal consequently succeeds and is allowed.  The orders of the
Sub Divisional Magistrate dated 13.01.1986 and of the High Court dated
2.6.1989 are hereby set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_18">	13. In the instant case, admittedly, there was no such preliminary
order passed at all as required under <a href="/doc/264083/" id="a_29">Section 133(1)</a> of the Code.  Thus, as
held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the entire subsequent proceedings
including the impugned order is wholly without jurisdiction. As held by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court, passing of a preliminary order as required under Sub
Section (1) of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_30">Section 133</a> alone gives jurisdiction to the Magistrate to
proceed further to hold enquiry and to pass a final order. Since in the
instant case, the impugned order is only a final order, which has been passed
without being preceded by a preliminary order, the same stands vitiated.
</p>
<p id="p_19">	14. The learned Government Advocate (Crl. Side) would point out that
the enquiry was held and the impugned order was passed by the respondent as
directed by this Court in W.P.No.3093 of 2015.  In my considered view, when
the statute confers jurisdiction on an authority, on the happening of a
particular event, when the same is a legislative command, the Courts of law
cannot confers jurisdiction on the authority, in the absence of the said
event as prescribed in the statute.  Though it may be true that this Court
directed the District Collector to hold enquiry, it does not mean that this
Court had empowered the District Collector to pass a final order without
passing a preliminary order under <a href="/doc/264083/" id="a_31">Section 133(1)</a> of the Code.  Therefore,
this argument of the learned Government Advocate also deserves to be
rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_20">	15. In view of the foregoing discussions, I hold that the impugned
order is not sustainable and the same is liable to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_21">	16. In the result, the Criminal Revision Petition is allowed and the
impugned order is set aside.  Consequently connected Miscellaneous Petition
is closed. It is made clear that the District Collector or any other
aggrieved persons will be at liberty to work out their remedy against the
orders passed by various authorities referred to herein above.
