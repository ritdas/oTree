by the District Forum, Mansa vide which Op No. 1 was directed to

develop Shakti Nagar as per the specifications and terms and

conditions of the PUDA within a period of six months from the date of

receipt of copy of the order. He was further directed to compensate

the complainant to the extent of Rs. 30,000/- in each complaint. The

amount be paid within a period of one month from the receipt of the

copy of the order, failing which it will carry interest @ 9% p.a. from

</p>
<p id="p_15">2.             The facts have been taken from First Appeal No. 188 of

2014 arising out of complaint No. 144 of 2013. The complainant had

filed a complaint against the Ops under <a href="/doc/1891987/" id="a_1">Section 12</a> of the Consumer

Protection Act, 1986(in short 'the Act') on the averments that Op No.

1 had developed a colony under the name and style of Shakti Nagar

at College Road, Mansa after obtaining licence No. LDC/2001/73

dated 12.3.2011 from Op No. 2 for development and promotion of the

colony under the PUDA rules and regulations. As per the licence

issued by OP No. 1, colony in question was to be developed within a

period of three years. OP No. 4 had purchased a plot No. 11 for a

consideration of Rs. 1,50,000/- vide sale deed No. 5357 dated

21.12.2001 registered with Sub Registrar, Mansa on 4.1.2002. Op

No. 4 was in need of money and on assurance of OP No. 1 to

develop the colony within months, complainant purchased plot No. 11
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">      First Appeal No. 188 of 2014                                       4</span>



for a consideration of Rs. 4,10,000/- from Op No. 4 vide sale deed

No. 7223 dated 17.1.2012 registered with Sub Registrar on

18.1.2012. Accordingly, the complainant had come into the footsteps

of OP No. 4 and was entitled to the same rights as were available to

Op No. 4. OP No. 1 did not develop the colony as per the terms and

conditions of the licence to provide facilities as per specifications i.e.

water supply, electricity, roads, parks, sewerage and other basic

amenities till date, rather he had got extension of the licence till

11.3.2006. The complainant and other plot holders requested Op

Nos. 1 &amp; 2 time and again but none of the Op had paid any heed to

the request of the plot holders. The complainant had suffered

physical and mental harassment, agony and humiliations as well as

monetary loss as he failed to construct the house to enjoy the better

residential facilities. The act and conduct of the Ops amounted to

unfair trade practice as well as deficiency in service. Hence, the

complaint with a direction to Op Nos. 1 to 3 to develop and promote

the colony as per specifications, terms and conditions and rules and

regulations of the Licencing Authority. They be also directed to pay

compensation of Rs. 4,99,000/- alongwith interest @ 18% p.a. and

cost of litigation.
</p>
<p id="p_16">3.             The notice was issued only to OP No. 1 and no notice

was issued to Op Nos. 2 to 4 because Op No. 2 &amp; 3 are only the

Licencing Authority and not a service provider whereas Op No. 4 had

already sold the plot in favour of the complainant. Op No. 1 in its

written version took the preliminary objections that Op No. 1 had

already executed sale deed No. 5357 dated 21.12.2001 in favour of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">  First Appeal No. 188 of 2014                                         5</span>



Op No. 4 i.e. contract between the parties, which can be enforced

through Civil Court, therefore, this Forum had no jurisdiction to

enforce an agreement. The possession of the plot was handed over

to the complainant on the basis of "as is where is". OP No. 1 had

already deposited a sum of Rs. 24,76,945/- as cost of external

development work with PUDA, who is to provide such work. He had

already provided internal water lines, internal sewerage lines and

boundary wall of 11 feet height from the original earth level. Each plot

has been demarcated, green zone was demarcated, trees, plants and

grass was planted. Most of the basic facilities required to be provided

by this Op has been provided. Since the plot holders had not started

the construction at the spot, therefore, extension of the licence was

mandatory. Otherwise plots could be resumed by the PUDA. It was

specifically mentioned in the Sale Deed that Op will provide basic

amenities in the colony with the cooperation of all the plot holders and

parties were to be governed by the terms and conditions of the

contract and the rules and regulations of the PUDA. The complainant

had purchased a plot from OP No. 4 with an intention to further sell it

for a premium, therefore, he had violated the conditions of sale deed

No. 2999 dated 10.9.2002, therefore, he was not entitled to file any

complaint; complaint was barred by limitation; complaint was bad for

non-joinder of necessary parties. It is only the PUDA, who was to

determine whether Op had violated the terms and conditions of the

licence but no notice was given by the District Forum to the PUDA.

After basic facilities were provided by this OP then purchasers were

to maintain the colony with their own funds and that the Hon'ble
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">      First Appeal No. 188 of 2014                                      6</span>



Forum had no jurisdiction to entertain this complaint as the procedure

under the Act is summary procedure whereas it required voluminous

evidence and cross-examination of the witnesses, therefore, the

matter be relegated to the Civil Court. On merits, it was admitted that

OP No. 1 had taken licence No. LDC/2001/73 from OP No. 2 and it

was renewed till March, 2013. Originally OP No. 4 had purchased plot

No. 11 from OP No. 1 vide Sale Deed No. 5357 dated 21.12.2001

and the complainant has purchased this plot from Op No. 4. Op No. 4

had violated the terms and conditions of the PUDA by selling the plot

in favour of the complainant. There was no privity of contract between

the complainant and this Op, therefore, the complaint by the

complainant against this Op was not maintainable. Extension of

period of the licence given by the PUDA was within the rights of the

PUDA. Most of the basic facilities have been provided, therefore,

there was no unfair trade practice and deficiency in service on the

part of this Op. Complaint was without merit and it be dismissed.

</p>
<p id="p_19">6.             After going through the allegations in the complaint,

written reply filed by OP No.1, evidence and documents brought on

the record, the complaint was allowed as referred above.

</p><p id="p_20">7.             Aggrieved with the order passed by the learned District

Forum, appellant/OP No.1 has filed the present appeal.

</p><p id="p_21">8.             We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.

</p><p id="p_22">9.             It has been argued by the counsel for the OP No. 1 that

the complaint is barred by limitation. Op No. 4 Smt. Alka Garg had

purchased the plot in the year 2001 and in case the basic amenities

as pleaded in the complaint were not provided by Op No. 1 then the

complaint should have been filed within a period of two years after

execution of the sale deed in favour of the complainant, in that way,

the complaint should have been filed in the year 2003 but the

complaint was filed in the year 2013, therefore, it is clearly barred by

limitation. The counsel for the appellant has referred certain

judgments i.e. Civil Appeal No. 4962 of 2002 "Kandimalla

Raghavaiah &amp; Co. versus National Insurance Co. &amp; Anr." decided on

10.7.2009 and Civil Appeal No. 2067 of 2002 "State Bani of India

versus M/s B.S. Agricultural Industries (I)" decided on 20.3.2009 by

the Hon'ble Apex Court wherein it has been observed that the

complaint is to be filed within two years of the cause of action. There

is no dispute with regard to the law point settled by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in the above referred judgment but we have to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">   First Appeal No. 188 of 2014                                         8</span>



determine as to when the cause of action had arisen in favour of the

complainant or whether it was a continuous cause of action.

</p><p id="p_23">10.         Whereas the counsel for complainant has argued that no

doubt that Alka Garg was the original owner but after the complainant

purchased this plot from Alka Garg, the complainant had come in the

footsteps of Alka Garg and he will be entitled to all the rights in the

property, which were available to Alka Garg. The counsel for the

complainant further stated that Op No. 1 being Developer had taken a

licence from Op No. 2 to develop and promote the colony and he was

required to provide all the basic amenities as per the terms and

conditions of the licence, but he has failed to provide these facilities.

In case the facilities are not provided then it will be a continuous

cause of action. Even full amenities have not been provided so far as

is clear from the written version filed by Op No. 1. In para No. 1 of the

preliminary objections, he has stated that most of the basic facilities

required to be provided by this Op has been provided by this Op,

which shows that all the facilities have not been provided, therefore, it

will be a continuous cause of action till all the basic amenities are not

provided, therefore, the complaint was not barred by limitation. When

this point was dealt with by the District Forum, it was discussed that

Op No. 1 has not provided the basic amenities. Originally the licence

was valid for a period of three years but lateron, it was extended from

time to time and lastly it was extended upto 11.3.2013. Therefore, two

taken from that date, then the compliant is within limitation. A

State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Mumbai 2015(3)

CLT 139 "Samuel Dorman versus M/s Superier Builders &amp; Ors.". In

that case, there was delay in delivery of possession. Plea of the Op

was that the complaint is barred by limitation as it was filed beyond

two years from the date of cause of action. It was observed that the

builder has failed to fulfil his obligation to complete the construction of

flat. Hence, it can be concluded that there is a continuous cause of

action and the complaint is well within limitation. Here also in this

case Op No. 1 has failed to fulfil his obligation with regard to provide

all the basic amenities and the complaint against the Op is with

regard to completion of basic amenities so that he could raise the

construction and till these obligations are not completed, it will be a

continuous cause of action, therefore, we are of the opinion that the

District Forum was correct in its findings that the complaint is within

limitation and we affirm the findings so recorded by the District

Forum.
</p>
<p id="p_24">11.         The next point raised by the counsel for Op No. 1 is that

the complainant is not a consumer of the Op. It has been argued by

the counsel for the Op No.1 that the plot was sold to respondent No.

4 Alka Garg, therefore, the basic contract was with Alka Garg and

there was no contract between the complainant, therefore, there was

no relationship of consumer and service provider. No doubt that

originally the plot was allotted to Alka Garg but after purchasing this

plot from Alka Garg, the complainant has come in the footsteps of

Alka Garg. Whether it is Alka Garg or the complainant, the Op was to

provide the basic amenities as agreed by him at the time of taking the

licence from the PUDA and in case he has failed to provide the basic

amenities as agreed then certainly, there is deficiency in service on

the part of Op. In case the complainant has purchased the plot from

Alka Garg then he has purchased all the rights and obligations from

Alka Garg, therefore, in case the complainant has come in the

footsteps of Alka Garg then we do not agree with the plea raised by

the counsel for Op No. 1 that there was no relationship of consumer

and service provider between the parties. In case there was

relationship of consumer and service provider between Alka Garg

and Op No. 1, the same relationship will remain as it is between the

complainant and Op No. 1, therefore, Op No. 1 cannot raise this plea

that there was no relationship of consumer and service provider

between the complainant and Op No. 1.
</p>
<p id="p_25">12.         It is next argued that PUDA was a necessary party. As

final certificate was to be given by the PUDA but no notice was given

to the PUDA. At the time he had taken the licence from PUDA to

develop and promote the colony, he had taken certain obligations

while developing the colony i.e. to provide the basic amenities to the

plot holders. The same has been incorporated in the licence Ex. Op-6

and reads as under:-

</blockquote>
<p id="p_26">13.           Op No. 1 had applied for extension in the licence and

Officers of the PUDA had visited the spot on 3.9.2012 and they had

made the following observations:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">      "1.    Water Supply: Pipe is there but OHSR has not been

      provided. There was open storage tank and it was intimated

      that efforts are being made to get the water supply connection

      from M.C. Mansa.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">      2.     Sewerage System:- Sewerage services were provided but

      there was no vent shaft in sewerage lines. Manholes were not

      covered and there was no sewerage treatment plant.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11"> First Appeal No. 188 of 2014                                          13</span>



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">      3.     Horticulture :- Road plants was there but parks were not

      maintained.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">      4.     Electricity:- HT lines were against the norms. No plan was

      approved by PSPCL. LT lines were erected but there was no

      pole alignment and there was no provision for street light.

</blockquote><p id="p_27">Therefore, even in 2012 the basic amenities were not complete as

per the inspection conducted by the Officers of the PUDA that may be

the reason that the period of licence to OP No. 1 was extended by

PUDA the licencing authority, therefore, all the basic amenities were

to be provided by Op No. 1. Therefore, complaint is not bad for non-

issuance of the notice to the PUDA as PUDA is only the Licencing

Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_28">14.          Apart from the report of the Officers of the PUDA, during

pendency of similar complaint, the District Forum had appointed Smt.

Rekha Sharma, Advocate, as a Local Commissioner, who on

29.9.2008 had submitted her report that except one plot there is no

other construction in the colony. She further reported that septic tank

was un-covered. Sewerage system was not completed. Water supply

was incomplete as there was no tank built up for storage of the clean

water. No tubewell was installed inside the colony nor any other

source of water connected for water supply system. Electric poles for

electric supply were not erected. There was no drainage system in

the colony. Even otherwise during the course of arguments, it has

been argued by the counsel for Op No. 1 that they have taken up the

matter with various Departments to provide the basic amenities,

therefore, it is for the Department to give the clearance at the earliest
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> First Appeal No. 188 of 2014                                          14</span>



possible time. Here it is pertinent to note that the plots were

demarcated in the year 2001 but it is to be seen whether the efforts

were made by Op No. 1 to provide these facilities and when the

matter was taken up by Op No. 1 with the various departments. Apart

from his own statement Ex. Op-1, he has placed on the record copy

of the sale deed Ex. Op-2, order of the District Forum Ex. Op-3, sale

deed executed by Alka Garg in favour of Ex. Op-4, licence Ex. Op-6,

letter was written to PUDA for extension of the licence Ex. Op-7, Ex.

Op-8 is the renewal letter, which was renewed for the period of three

years in 2009. Ex. Op-9 is another letter vide which the licence was

extended from 13.8.2006 to 12.8.2009 on the original terms and

conditions. Ex. Op-10 is original certificate vide which the licence was

extended upto 11.3.2013. Therefore, no letter has been placed on the

record, which was written by Op No. 1 to other Departments for

providing the basic amenities. In the appeal file, he has placed same

documents and with regard to NOC of waste water treatment plant,

which was written in the year 2013. A letter dated 5.11.2013 was

written to the Chief Engineer (Commercial), PSPCL , Punjab,

therefore, in case he has taken the matter with the Departments in

2012 and 2013 then certainly, there is deficiency in service on the

part of Op No. 1 because he did not take up the matter with various

departments, which was required to be done by him for providing the

basic amenities immediately after carving out the colony in the year

2001. Therefore, no plea can be raised by the counsel for the

appellant that he has raised the matter with the concerned

Departments and that the Departments are not prompt in giving the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13"> First Appeal No. 188 of 2014                                         15</span>



response. In case the matter would have been taken immediately

after carving out the colony, by this time everything would have been

'OK'.    Therefore, the burden cannot be shifted to the Department

when OP No. 1 himself was in default for not taking the matter with

the concerned Departments at appropriate time.
