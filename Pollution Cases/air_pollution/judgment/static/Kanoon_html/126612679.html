</pre><p id="p_1">                Dated this the 14th day of August 2020


                 This Bail Application filed under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section 438</a> of

    Criminal Procedure Code was heard through Video Conference.

</p><p id="p_2">           2. Petitioner is the 1 st accused in Crime No.584/2019 of

    Pudukkad Police Station. The above case is registered against

    the petitioner alleging offences punishable under <a href="/doc/872569/" id="a_2">Sections 269</a>,

    <a href="/doc/1691473/" id="a_3">277</a> and <a href="/doc/38865/" id="a_4">278</a> r/w 34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> and also under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_6">Sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_7">43</a> of

    The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.

</p><p id="p_3">           3.    The prosecution case is that the petitioner is the

    driver of a mini lorry.   On 7.9.2019 at about 5 am, the Sub

    Inspector of Police, Pudukkad Police Station along with his team

    was conducting patrol duty through Chalakkudy-Mannuthy NH

</p><p id="p_4">    544.    At that time they saw a mini tanker lorry parked on the

    western side of the road and pumping some effluents into the

    stream which is near the road. They saw this by using the head

    light of the vehicle.   When the police party approached, two

    persons ran away from the place. On inspection it is found that

    the effluents which emanated is having a foul smell and it is

    realized that the same was latrine waste. Hence the above case

    is registered.

</p><p id="p_6">         4.      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

    learned Public Prosecutor.
</p>
<p id="p_7">         5.      The counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

    offences alleged against the petitioner are bailable.        The

    counsel also submitted that in the light of <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_9">Section 49</a> of the

    Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, the

    offences under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_11">Sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_12">43</a> of the said Act cannot be

    registered against the petitioner by the police officer. Only an

    authorised person can lodge the complaint.

</p><p id="p_8">         6.      The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the bail

    application. The Public Prosecutor submitted that the offences

    alleged against the petitioner are very serious.

</p><p id="p_9">         7.      After hearing both sides, I am forced to allow this

    bail application for a simple reason that the offence alleged

    against the petitioner are bailable offence.    I am aware that

    the allegations against the petitioner are very serious. But the

    offences alleged against the petitioner are only under <a href="/doc/734195/" id="a_13">Sections

    269</a>, <a href="/doc/1374604/" id="a_14">277</a> and <a href="/doc/1368265/" id="a_15">278</a> IPC. All these sections are bailable. As far

    as the offence under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_16">Sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_17">43</a> of the Water

    (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, there is a bar

    under <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_19">Section 49</a> of the said Act in initiating the complaint by

    the police. In such circumstances, this bail application can be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> BA.No.777/2020                         4</span>


    allowed on stringent conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_10">          8.      Moreover, considering the need to follow social

    distancing norms inside prisons so as to avert the spread of

    the novel Corona Virus Pandemic, the Hon'ble Supreme Court

    in Re: Contagion of COVID-19 Virus In Prisons case (Suo

    Motu Writ Petition(C) No.1 of 2020) and a Full Bench of

    this Court in W.P(C)No.9400 of 2020 issued various salutary

    directions for minimizing the number of inmates inside

    prisons.
</p>
<p id="p_11">         9. Moreover, it is a well accepted principle that the bail is

    the rule and the jail is the exception. The Hon'ble Supreme

    Court in Chidambaram. P v Directorate of Enforcement

    (2019 (16) SCALE 870), after considering all the earlier

    judgments, observed that, the basic jurisprudence relating to

    bail remains the same inasmuch as the grant of bail is the rule

    and refusal is the exception so as to ensure that the accused

    has the opportunity of securing fair trial.

</p><p id="p_12">         10. Considering the dictum laid down in the above

    decision and considering the facts and circumstances of this

    case, this Bail Application is allowed with the following

    directions:
