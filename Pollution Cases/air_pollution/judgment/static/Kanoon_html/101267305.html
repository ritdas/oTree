ORAL
JUDGEMENT
 


 


 


  (PER
: HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE JAYANT PATEL)
 


 


 


 


 


</p><p id="p_10">1.		As
in both the appeals, the common judgment of the learned Single Judge
arises for consideration with the common questions involved therein,
they are being considered simultaneously. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_11">2.		The
present appeals are directed against the judgment and order passed by
the learned Single Judge in Special Civil Application No.9722 of 1993
with Special Civil Application No.9626 of 1993 whereby the learned
Single Judge has declared the action of the authority as well as that
of the State Government for imposition of the scrutiny fee,
development fee and levy of premium as illegal and void. Learned
Single Judge has also allowed the petitioners to get back the refund
of the amount of Rs.1 crore and Rs.4 lacs which was deposited pending
the petitions pursuant to the interim order passed in the petitions.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_12">3.		The
short facts of the appeals are that on 17.10.1985, the State
Government in exercise of the powers under the Gujarat Town Planning
and Urban Development Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred as  the
Act ) by issuing the
notification constituted the Hajira Area Development Authority
(hereinafter referred as  the HADA 
for short) for securing the plan
development of the area of various villages i.e.
Damka, Bhatlai, Vasuva, Rajagari, Mora, Limla, Suvali and Hajira, all
of Taluka Choryasi, District Surat.  It appears that thereafter  from
the years 1986 to 1990 various parcels of lands and total about 285
hectors of lands were allotted to the original petitioners or its
subsidiary company or sister concern for petrochemical complex. The
original petitioners thereafter wanted to make construction over the
lands which were allotted to it and, therefore, the plans were
prepared and they were sent by the original petitioners to the HADA
for grant of approval and necessary permission.  However, on
28.3.1989, the HADA informed to the original petitioners that since
the Draft Development Plan is under contemplation and was not
published by the competent authority, the question of grant of
permission would not arise. It is the say of the original petitioners
that, thereafter, they moved to the Gram Panchayat, Mora, Taluka
Choryasi for granting construction of the boundary wall which was so
granted by the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat on 12.5.1989.  On
21.8.1989, the HADA in exercise of the powers under sections 9 and 13
of the Act published the Draft Development Plan and the General
Development Control Regulations containing various provisions
including (1) scrutiny fee, (2) scrutiny deposit and (3) premium. On
29.9.1989, pursuant to the meeting held by the HADA on 18.9.1989
separate notification was published in exercise of the powers under
section 99 of the Act whereby it was proposed to
levy and impose development charges. On 1.10.1989, an advertisement
was published in the newspaper inviting objections to levy and
imposition of development charges as proposed by the HADA.  On
16.10.1989, the HADA had issued the circular to all the industries
including the original petitioning company informing that it is
obligatory to obtain development permission before starting of
construction without which development would be treated as illegal.
On 21.12.1989, the HADA called the Chief Executive Officer of the
respondent company and instructed him to stop construction work of
Phase-I of their project and asked him to remain present in his
office at 1.1.1990.  On 4.1.1990, the HADA once again instructed the
original petitioning company to stop construction activity and to
remain present on 15.1.1990.  On 11.1.1990, the respondent company
submitted reply along with the complete list of their construction
activity and the plan of Phase-I to HADA. On 15.2.1990, the HADA
informed the respondent company to submit the plan in the prescribed
proforma along with scrutiny fee. On 25.4.1991, the HADA submitted
the proposal for development charges to the State Government for
approval.  On 23.8.1991, the HADA in exercise of the powers conferred
under section 29(5) read with section 36 of the Act issued the notice
calling upon the original petitioning company to show cause as to why
illegal construction should not be removed.  On 21.12.1991, the State
Government granted approval to the aforesaid proposal submitted by
the HADA for development
charges as well as for imposition of the fee prescribed.  On
8.1.1992, the HADA issued another notice calling upon the original
petitioning company to remain present and to submit the reply.  On
31.1.1992, the HADA in its board meeting held on 31.1.1992 passed
resolution No.196 for recovery of the development charges as approved
by the Government. On 4.2.1992, the notification for levy of the
development charges was published in the government gazette.  On
1.7.1992, the HADA issued demand notice upon the original petitioning
company demanding a sum of Rs.8.19 crores comprising Rs.4,77,77,521/-
by way of security deposit, scrutiny fee and premium and
Rs.3,38,12,460/- towards development charges.  On 17.7.1992, the HADA
issued another notice reiterating its above referred demand. 
However, as the amount was not paid, on 25.2.1993 / 9.3.1993 the HADA
issued the final notice under section 36 of the Act calling upon the
original petitioning company not to proceed with construction without
permission. Under the circumstances, the original petitioning company
preferred two petitions one being Special Civil Application No.9626
of 1993 for challenging the notification dated 29.9.1989 issued under
section 99 of the Act for imposition of development fee at the rate
specified in the said notification and approval thereof granted by
the State Government and another being Special Civil Application
No.9722 of 1993 challenging Regulation No.3.3 regarding scrutiny fee,
Regulation No.5.3 regarding scrutiny deposit and Regulation No.5.8
regarding premium etc.
 


 


 


</p><p id="p_13">4.		In
the said Special Civil Applications before the learned Single Judge,
interim order was passed on 26.10.1993 whereby the interim stay
against demand notice and further construction was permitted on
condition to deposit the total amount Rs.1,04,00,000/-. It may be
recorded that on 28.8.1997 pending the petitions, the State
Government dissolved the HADA and appointed the Collector, Surat to
perform functions under section 120(2)(a)(b) and (c) of the Act.
Learned Single Judge, thereafter, heard both the petitions for final
disposal and ultimately delivered the above referred judgment and
order whereby the notifications were quashed and imposition of
development fee, scrutiny fee, scrutiny deposit and premium were also
quashed.  Under the circumstances, the present appeals before the
Division Bench of this Court.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_14">5.		We
have heard Mr.Devnani, learned AGP appearing for the appellants and
Mr.K.S.Nanavati, Senior Advocate with Mr.Gandhi appearing for the
original petitioners   respondent Nos.1 and 2 herein and
Mr.Y.F.Mehta for the GIDC in both the matters.  We have also
considered the Record and Proceedings.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_15">6.		The
first aspect deserves to be considered is the validity of levy or
imposition of scrutiny fee, security deposit and premium and the
second aspect to be considered is levy or imposition of development
fee / development charges.  We may first consider challenge to
imposition of development fee and then we shall consider challenge to
imposition of scrutiny fee, security deposit and premium.  However,
before we proceed to examine both the aforesaid challenge in
particular, the contentions raised broadly for challenging the action
of the HADA for imposition of fee may be scrutiny fee or development
fee or premium as the case may be deserve to be considered. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_16">7.		The
contention of the original petitioners raised was on the premises
that the character of the action for imposition of fee is different
than that of imposition of tax. It was submitted that since
nomenclature provides for imposition of fee, when any fee is imposed
by any authority, it must meet with the test of quid pro
quo. The fee so imposed must
have co-relation with the services to be rendered for such purpose
and it is unlike tax being revenue of the State or authority which
may be utilized for any other purpose than the purpose for which it
is levied or taxed. It was submitted by learned counsel for the
original petitioners that affidavit-in-reply is as vague as anything
to justify the action for imposition of the fee. He submitted that it
is obligatory for the authority to place facts and figures showing
justification of the quantum of fee which is sought to be levied. No
facts and figures are produced nor it has been so reported to the
Court about the manner in which the money as may be realized
are to be utilized. Therefore, if no services are to be rendered or
it is not demonstrated before the Court that such fee is in
co-relation to such services to be rendered, the action would be
unsustainable in law and, therefore, the action of levying all types
of fees i.e.
scrutiny fee, security deposit, premium as well as development fee
are unsustainable and have been rightly quashed by the learned Single
Judge. Whereas, it was submitted on behalf of the State by learned
AGP that the whole matter is considered with different judicial
scrutiny available. He submitted that affidavit-in-reply filed shows
sufficient details for justification for imposition of fee and in
spite of the same, it has been wrongly considered that the action of
imposition of fee is unreasonable and unsustainable.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_17">8.		Before
we proceed to examine the aspect of co-relation or the principle of
quid pro quo, it would be
necessary to record certain provisions of the Act. Chapter II of the
Act provides for development area and constitution of area
development authority. Section 3 of the Act provides for declaration
of development area.  Such action was undertaken and the area
including the area in question of the land which is allotted to the
petitioning company was already undertaken and there is no challenge
on the said aspect. Section 5 of the Act provides for constitution of
an area development authority and the said constitution was also made
as back as on 17.10.1985 and the area development authority
was so constituted. Section 7 provides for the powers and functions
of an area development authority in respect of the area which is
declared as development authority. The same for ready reference reads
as under :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_18"> 7.
[Powers and functions of] area development authority.- (1) The powers
and functions of an area development authority shall be-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_19">(i)

</p><p id="p_28">(viii)

</p> 


 


 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">(2)</span>
<p id="p_29">The area development authority may, with the approval of the State
Government, delegate [any of its powers and functions] to the local
authority or authorities within its jurisdiction.
</p> 


 


 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">(3)</span>
<p id="p_30">The area development authority shall have its office at such place as
the State Government may specify in this behalf. 
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_31">9.		Section
8 of the Act provides for expenses of the area development authority.
Section 9 of the Act provides for development plan and
thereafter section 12 of the Act provides for various aspects to be
considered and included for development in the Draft Development
Plan. The suggestions and objections, if any, are to be invited to
the Draft Development Plan as per section 14 of the Act and
thereafter the said Draft Development Plan is to be submitted to the
State Government for sanction and the State Government after
examining the said Draft Development Plan has to consider the matter
for grant of sanction under section 17 of the Act. The pertinent
aspect is that in the Draft Development Plan, there may be inclusion
of acquisition of certain lands for development and such development
may be valid after following the procedure in accordance with law. 
The aforesaid shows that there is inbuilt mechanism provided for
functions to be discharged by the development authority. Another
aspect is that section 7(1)(iv) of the Act provides for controlling
of the development activity in the area. Section 7(iv-a) of the Act
provides for enabling the power to levy and collect scrutiny fees for
scrutiny of the documents submitted to the appropriate authority for
permission of the development as prescribed by the Regulations.
Section 7(1) of the Act also provides for acquisition of the
property, execution of the work for development and for other
supplemental, incidental and consequential powers.

<p id="p_32">10.		Section
99 of the Act provided in Chapter VII of the Act to enable the
development authority to levy development charges.  Section 99 and
Section 100 of the Act read as under.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_33"> Section
</p><p id="p_34">99. Levy of development charges.- Subject to the provisions of this
Act and the rules made thereunder, an appropriate authority may, with

<p id="p_48">11.		The
aforesaid provisions show that subject to previous sanction of the
State Government, development charges on land and building within the
development area may be imposed, but not exceeding maximum rates
specified under section 100 of the Act. Proviso to section 99 also
provides for different rates of development charges may be specified
for different parts of development area and for different uses. 
Section 100 of the Act broadly classifies into four categories for
assessment of development charges. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_49">12.		The
aforesaid provisions of the Act show that there is inbuilt mechanism
provided for levy and collection of fees which includes scrutiny fee
and development fee and as per the scheme of the Act read with the
Rules, the fund so collected is to be utilized for the services to be
rendered in that regard i.e. scrutiny fee is to be used towards the
services to be rendered for controlling development in the area and
for permitting development in the area as per the Draft Development
Plan. The development charges so fixed are to be collected and to be
utilized for discharging various functions as provided under section
9 of the Act for various facets of the development of the area under
the control of the development authority.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_50">13.		Having
considered the aforesaid statutory provisions, if the stand of the
development authority is considered as stated in the
affidavit-in-reply filed by Shri K.M.Shah, Senior Town Planner at
paragraph (vii), it has been stated, inter alia, as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_51"> I
submit that under ground (vii) the petitioners have referred to
various important aspects :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_52">i)
That the regulations are to be made by an appropriate authority.  It
is submitted that the regulations have in fact been made by the
appropriate authority, hence, this aspect is satisfied.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_53">ii)
that these regulations have to be made with the previous approval of
the Government.  I submit that it is not the case of the petitioners
that the previous approval of the Government has not been obtained,
hence, this aspect is also satisfied.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_54">iii)
that they must be consistent with the Act and the Rules made
thereunder.  I submit that in view of the provisions of the Gujarat
Town Planning and Urban Development (Amendment and <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_1">Validation) Act</a>,
1995 the authority is duly empowered to make such regulations, hence
the General Development Control Regulations are consistent with the
Act and the Rules.  Hence, this aspect is also satisfied. 
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_55">14.		Further
on the aspect of quid pro quo and reciprocal services, it has
been stated at paragraph  (v) as under.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_56"> v)
The petitioners have raised the contention that the fee contemplates
the concept of quid pro quo and the reciprocal services rendered by
the authorities collecting the fees.  I submit that as against the
levy of scrutiny fees, reciprocal services in the form of scrutiny of
documents submitted are rendered, so is the case with premium fees
whereby in cases where development is carried out without the prior
permission of the authority, necessary scrutiny is carried out and if
the development is found to be in consonance with the regulations the
same is regularised.  I submit that in case where development
permission is sought prior to carrying out the development, scrutiny
of the documents submitted is carried out and thereafter the
authority may or may not grant the development permission.  In cases
where the development permission is carried out without the prior
permission of the authority, the same is in the nature of
unauthorised construction.  In such cases where development
permission is sought subsequently, the documents submitted are to be
scrutinised and if the development is in consonance with the
regulations the same is regularised.  However, here the authority is
constrained to regularise the development already carried out in
contradistinction with the case where development permission is
sought prior to carrying out development permission.  Hence, in such
cases premium is levied which is also termed as composition fees.  I
submit that such fees are levied against the scrutiny of documents
submitted and against the impact caused by the unauthorised
construction whereby the authority is left with no choice but to
regularise the same if it is in consonance with the provisions of the
Regulations. 
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_57">15.		In
view of the aforesaid inbuilt mechanism of the provisions of the Act
read with Rules and the statement made in the aforesaid
affidavit-in-reply, it cannot be said that there is no quid pro
quo as sought to be canvassed nor can it be said that fee imposed
has no co-relation with the services to be rendered. If the
development authority has to control the development and has to
permit development in the manner as provided in the development plan,
it would be required for the development authority to scrutinize the
proposal for development.  At the time when the proposals are
submitted, it would also require for the authority to scrutinize the
documents submitted including that of visit of the site, construction
whether has been made in accordance with the plan submitted or not
and other incidental aspects for ensuring that no development is made
in contravention to the plan submitted for development and
consequently in contravention of the development plan so prepared and
sanctioned by the State Government. The security deposit, in any
case, is relatable to the deposit by way of assurance and upon
condition so specified or compliance so made, such deposit may be
refundable also. Similarly, development fee or charges so collected
for permitting development in any area is to be utilized for
development of the entire area which is declared as separate area.
Therefore, when the Act itself provides inbuilt mechanism coupled
with the above referred stand taken on behalf of the authority, it
cannot be said that fee has no co-relation or there is no quid pro
quo qua fee or charges so imposed.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_58">16.		An
attempt is made by learned counsel for the original petitioners to
contend that there must be facts and figures for upholding the
validity of the action for imposition of fee cannot be countenance
and accepted for two reasons; one is that it was not the case where
the fee was already imposed and it was enhanced or increased, but it
is a case where the authority has been constituted for the first time
and is yet to begin with rendering of the services in the development
area. When establishment or functioning for discharging of various
services to be rendered as per the scheme of the Act read with Rules
by the development authority, it is not must that there must be facts
and figures so demonstrated before the Court for justifying quantum
of fee imposed. Second reason is that the Act by express provisions
provides and speaks for scrutiny fee and development charges. As
observed earlier, inbuilt mechanism provides for collection of
scrutiny fee and development fee and its utilization towards
controlling development and permitting development of the development
area in accordance with the plan.  It also provides for various
facilities and infrastructure to be created in the development area
by utilization of the development charges or fee.  Therefore, when
the Act makes express provisions for imposition of fee, it cannot be
said that even in a case where the authority is established for the
first time and has imposed the fee for the first time, all the facts
and figures must be before the Court before upholding the validity of
the action for imposition of fee.  Hence, the contention cannot be
accepted.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_59">17.		Learned
counsel for the original petitioners also made an attempt to support
the reasons recorded by the learned Single Judge in the impugned
order contending that since no reasons are mentioned in the
notification for levy of maximum rate of development charges
prescribed, the action can be said as without proper application of
mind or arbitrary and illegal.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_60">18.		We
are not in agreement with the view taken by the learned Single Judge
that it is required for the authority to state the grounds and
reasons for levying of maximum rate of development charges prescribed
by the provisions of the Act. The notification will speak for the
decision to impose fee and the grounds are not as such required to be
mentioned. In any case, merely because the grounds are not mentioned
or reasons are not mentioned in the notification, it cannot be said
that per se the notification would be bad in law.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_61">19.		It
further appears that another aspect which weighed to the learned
Single Judge was that various facets for distinguishing uses of the
land are not taken into consideration by the authority while taking
the decision for imposition of fee and it was further considered by
the learned Single Judge that fee is sought to be imposed with
retrospective effect.  In our view, it was not the matter where the
fees were sought to be imposed or collected with retrospective effect
because it was not the case where the construction was made or
development was made by the petitioning company after sanction was
obtained by the competent authority. When the area was already
included in the development area and for development of such area
when there was already separate authority constituted for permitting
development, the Gram Panchayat had no authority with it to grant any
sanction including that of compound wall. When the petitioning
company had approached to the development authority i.e. HADA, they
had not granted sanction and it could be said that the same was
declined on the ground that the Draft Development Plan was yet not
prepared.  Under the circumstances, if the construction so made was
without there being any valid sanction in law of the competent
authority and thereafter when the development fee and the scrutiny
fee are imposed, it cannot be said that the same is sought to be
collected with retrospective effect. On the contrary, if the matter
is strictly considered, one can take a view that the construction was
unauthorized and unlawful since no sanction was granted by the HADA. 
Not only that, but the HADA time and again had directed the
petitioning company to stop construction. In spite of the same, the
petitioning company continued with the construction.  Therefore, it
was a case where the construction was made without there being
sanction of the competent authority and in spite of the intimation so
made for stoppage of the construction by the competent authority, the
construction was made.  The aforesaid aspect is also stated by the
petitioners in the memo of the petition itself that sanction was not
granted by the HADA and intimations were given for stoppage of the
construction.  Under these circumstances, when the construction was
not with prior sanction, such may invite two consequences, one may be
for demolition of construction since the same was unauthorized and
another may be for regularization of the construction. In a case
where the construction is regularized, it has impact for alleged
breach qua development of the area.  It can be said that at the time
when the regularization is to be made subject to fulfilling of the
conditions that the construction is not in contravention of the
development area, impact fee may be collected if it is so expressly
provided by the regulation. Instead of the words "impact fee",
the regulation in the present case has used the word "premium".
 Under the circumstances, it can be said that by virtue of the
regulation providing for collection of premium, lesser harsher
consequence is provided in comparison to demolition of construction
since no sanction was granted. Under these circumstances, it appears
that the premium so prescribed is to be considered and examined as if
impact fee imposed for the purpose of regularization of construction
subject to condition that construction so made without there being
any sanction is not in contravention to the development plan.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_62">20.		We
shall now examine further reasons which have weighed to the learned
Single Judge for declaring levy of fee and premium as unauthorized
and bad in law.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_63">21.		As
observed earlier, as per the scheme of <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_2">section 99</a> read with <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_3">section
100</a> of the Act, different uses of the land have role to play for the
purpose of imposition of development charges.  <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_4">Section 100</a> of the
Act, as observed earlier, provides for four broad categories i.e. (i)
industrial, (ii) commercial, (iii) residential and (iv)
miscellaneous.  If the impugned notification is considered in light
of the scheme of the Act, it has differently classified the land
included in the development area for the purpose of development fee. 
The schedule provides as under.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_64">(i)
	Residential   Rs.45,000/- per hector
 


</p><p id="p_65">(ii)	Commercial
  Rs.30,000/- per hector
 


</p><p id="p_66">(iii)Industrial

</p><p id="p_67">(iv)	Other
use   Rs.40,000/- per hector
 


 


 


</p><p id="p_68">22.		The
aforesaid rates are for the open land.  Whereas for the constructed
area, the rates provided are as under.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_69">(i)
Residential Rs.13/- per square meter
 


</p><p id="p_70">(ii)
Commercial Rs.15/- per square meter
 


</p><p id="p_71">(iii)
Industrial Rs.15/- per square meter
 


</p><p id="p_72">(iv)
Other use Rs.12/- per square meter
 


 


 


</p><p id="p_73">23.		Therefore,
as such, classification so identified by the statute has been taken
into consideration by the authority while imposing development
charges. Under these circumstances, it is not possible for us to
agree with a view taken by the learned Single Judge that unequal are
treated equal in the matter of levying and imposition of fees by the
authority. It appears that the learned Single Judge has considered
different classifications of the some portions of land on the basis
of availability of water supply, electric supply, sewerage, location,
nearby road and width of the road available to such land and the
learned Single Judge has further observed that if the flat rate is
prescribed by such authority for the entire use of the land in one
category without considering different parts and different uses, the
same could be said as illegal.  With respect, we find that such
microscopic classification would not be falling under the judicial
scrutiny of this Court when any fee, by way of subordinate
legislation, is imposed by the competent authority in exercise of its
quasi legislative power of subordinate legislation. <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_5">The Act</a> does
expressly provide broadly for classification and that too on the
basis of use of the land or development sought to be made over the
said land. Such classification has nexus with the use of the land and
it has no nexus with the location of the land. Further, when the Act
does not provide for separate classification on the basis of the
separate location of the land, levy would not be bad merely because
such aspect of classification is not considered by the authority
while exercising the power for subordinate legislation. The scope of
judicial scrutiny to any subordinate legislation when this Court has
to exercise the power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is by now
well settled. The subordinate legislation would be ultra vires
if the authority has exceeded the power or has transgressed the power
not otherwise provided by the parent Act.  Such aspect is unavailable
inasmuch as the Act does provide for power for levying of fee and the
development charges. On the aspect of classification also, when the
Act classifies different parcels of lands on the basis of the use
reading further classification on the basis of location of the land
would be reading the provisions in the Act which does not exist and
in our view, such normally would be outside the scope of jurisdiction
of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a> of the Constitution when any
subordinate legislation is brought under challenge contending ultra
vires to the power or to the Constitution.  Even, for testing
subordinate legislation keeping in view <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_8">Article 14</a> of the
Constitution, the Court would consider broad parameters and
examination in microscopic manner is neither available nor can be
undertaken.  Further, in any case, the ground not provided by the
legislature for different classifications of the land for imposition
of different fees, cannot be considered as the base for recording
conclusion that classification has not been properly made and,
therefore, if levying of fee would not meet with the test of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_9">Article
14</a> of the Constitution.  In the same manner, it cannot be said that
separate classification is to be made by way of sub-classification of
the land for the purpose of collection of fees like that of place
where the actual manufacturing process is conducted, pieces of land
which is not being used exclusively for actual manufacturing process
etc. which is considered by the learned Single Judge at paragraph 18
of the judgment. In these circumstances, we find that classification
so made in the subordinate legislation for imposition of fee is not
in contravention to the scheme of the Act nor can be said as not
meeting with the test of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_10">Article 14</a> of the Constitution as contented
by the original petitioners before the learned Single Judge.

25.		The

out any development work over any land. If the aforesaid provisions
of the scrutiny fee are considered in light of the subsequent
provisions of the Regulation, as per Regulations 3.4 to 3.6, it
cannot be said that the scrutiny fee proposed to be levied has no
co-relation to the services to be rendered. It will be required for
the authority to scrutinize all the aspects for ensuring that
permission is granted for development to the persons so entitled for
and the development so proposed is not in contravention but in
consonance with the development plan and no development is made even
after getting permission in contravention to the plan submitted for
development and so approved by the authority.  Regulations 3.4 to 3.7

no co-relation to the services to be rendered and, therefore, would
not meet with the test of quid pro quo as sought to be
canvassed.

<p id="p_125">27.		Next
challenge is to the security deposit as provided by Regulation 5.3

<p id="p_132">(v)

of the occupancy certificate. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_133">(vi)
The security deposit shall be forfeited either
in whole or in part at the absolute discretion of the Authority for
breach of any of the provisions of these regulations and
conditions of the `development permission . Such forfeiture shall
be without prejudice to any other remedy or right of the Authority .
</p>

 


 


 


<p id="p_134">28.		As
nomenclature itself provides further with the express provisions of
the Regulation, the security deposit is for ensuring that the
construction is made in accordance with the plan so sanctioned and
occupation is made in the premises constructed after occupation
certificate and such security deposit is to be refunded after grant
of occupation certificate.  Such deposit has also co-relation with
the services to be rendered for ensuring proper compliance of the
condition imposed for grant of permission for development.  Hence, it
cannot be said that the fee imposed by way of security deposit though
as such is not the fee, has no quid pro quo or no co-relation
with the services to be rendered.  We need to record that such
deposit in any case is to be refunded if there is proper compliance
of various conditions of permission granted and other regulation
concerned.

<p id="p_153">30.		The
aforesaid Regulation makes it clear that the same is to apply in case
of development already made in accordance with the General
Development Control Regulations, but without prior permission or in
deviation of the granted development permission. If construction is
made without prior permission, it may call for demolition of
construction or removal of construction since there was no
permission. However, in order to see that construction though made
without prior permission but is in accordance with the provisions of
the Regulation, instead of taking harsher action of demolition of the
same, the Regulation provides for levy of premium in the nature of
impact fee. If Regulation 5.8 is held to be ultra
vires
or is invalid, consequence which may be required to be faced by the
petitioners would be that no Regulation will be available for
regularization of the construction already made without prior
permission of the development authority. <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">The Act</a> provides that if any
development is made without prior permission, such is required to be
removed in accordance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/51749919/" id="a_14">sections 36</a> and <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_15">37</a> of
the Act. Therefore, if there is no Regulation available for
regularizing of the development already made without prior
permission, the aforesaid statutory provisions of <a href="/doc/51749919/" id="a_16">sections 36</a> and <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_17">37</a>
of the Act shall operate.  Consequently, construction made without
prior permission would be required to be removed.  We are unable to
appreciate the conduct of the petitioning company for challenging
Regulation 5.8 which may prima
facie
goes against them if statutory
provisions of <a href="/doc/51749919/" id="a_18">sections 36</a> and <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_19">37</a> of the Act are enforced.  Since it
is not even the case of the original petitioners that any development
or construction was made without prior permission of the authority,
if challenge is accepted as it is, as observed earlier, consequence
in law would be that the authority will be required to take action
for demolition of construction and the development already made will
be required to be removed even if they are in accordance with the
development plan since prior permission was not obtained.  In our
view, Regulation 5.8 is to be operate as shield to those who have
made construction or developed the land located in the area without
prior permission.  If any person has made unauthorized construction
without prior sanction of the competent authority or construction so
made was without prior permission, he would be required to pay
premium if he is so desirous to see that action for making
construction is regularized. The aforesaid aspect is also apparent
from the affidavit-in-reply filed, more particularly, the paragraphs
reproduced hereinabove, on behalf of the authority. If validity of
Regulation 5.8 is tested keeping in view that the same is by way of
regularization of construction made without prior permission, there
will always be additional fee or charge to be paid by those persons
who have made construction or developed the property without prior
permission. When the authority for the purpose of getting permission
has decided to collect development fee and scrutiny fee including
scrutiny deposit, charging
of impact fee by way of premium cannot be said to be arbitrary as
sought to be canvassed.  Learned Single Judge has proceeded on the
basis that there is no power available for imposition of premium.  It
is true that there is no express power provided under the Act like
scrutiny fee and development charges to be imposed. However, the Act
speaks for framing of the Regulations by the area development
authority and sanction to be obtained for giving effect to such
Regulations, one may contend that Regulation 5.8 may run counter to
the provisions of <a href="/doc/51749919/" id="a_20">sections 36</a> and <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_21">37</a> of the Act, since the Act
provides for removal of development, but challenge to Regulation 5.8
is not on that ground and, therefore, we leave the matter at that
stage without observing further.  However, the fact remains that
preparation of Draft Development Plan and sanction took petty long
time and in the meantime, if development is already made not in
contravention to the development plan and the authority has exercised
the power for regularization of development already made without
prior permission on payment of particular premium, instead of taking
harsher action of demolition of construction, the challenge cannot be
heard from the mouth of the person who has made construction like the
petitioning company without prior permission of the competent
authority. Further, if one has to make development after sanction of
the Draft Development Plan and after approval of the Regulations, he
would be required to pay fee for development including scrutiny fee.
As against the same, if the higher rates
have been provided, for those who have acted in breach of the law,
for the purpose of regularization of construction by way of premium,
it cannot be said that the rates so prescribed are arbitrary on the
ground as sought to be canvassed.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_154">31.		In
view of the aforesaid, we are not in agreement with the view taken by
the learned Single Judge for allowing of the petitions, but we find
that  challenges made by the petitioners in the petitions were
without merit and the petitions were required to be dismissed. Hence,
the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge is set aside and
both the petitions shall stand dismissed.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_155">32.		On
account of the interim order passed and ultimately final order passed
by the learned Single Judge in the petitions, consequence has arisen
that though levy of fee and the development charges etc. were lawful,
it has remained unpaid. There is no express provision made for
charge-ability of interest for unpaid security fee or unpaid premium
or unpaid security deposit. However, there is express provision made
under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_22">section 101</a> of the Act for charge-ability of interest for
unpaid development charges. <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_23">Section 101</a> of the Act provides for
recovery of development charges with interest at the rate of 6% per
annum from the date on the amount has remained unpaid.  We find
that the same rate can be made applicable even in respect of unpaid
security fee or unpaid security deposit or unpaid premium.
Consequently, on account of disposal of the petitions and since the
interim relief was enjoyed by the petitioners pending the petitions
before the learned Single Judge and thereafter the original
petitioners have also got refund of the amount with accrued interest,
we find it proper to observe that the competent authority i.e.
HADA or if HADA is dissolved, the authority which has acquired the
right and property of the HADA shall be at liberty to recover the
amount from the petitioning company all the unpaid fees with interest
at the rate of 6% per annum until the amount is actually
realized with accrued interest. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_156">33.		Further,
considering the facts and circumstances, we find that on account of
challenge made by the petitioners to levying of fee and thereafter as
levy was declared to be invalid, other persons have also not paid fee
so imposed, hence it is observed that it would also be open to the
authority to recover the fee in accordance with law of-course after
giving reasonable time to the persons concerned for payment of the
said amount. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_157">34.		In
view of the conduct of the petitioners of proceeding with the
construction in spite of prohibitory orders and thereafter creating
stalemate for recovering of fee for the larger area of seven villages
on account of previous litigation, it would be appropriate to impose
cost also.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_158">35.		Hence,
while dismissing the petitions, we find it proper to impose the cost
and as two matters are involved, the cost of Rs.50,000/- each, total
Rs.1,00,000/- shall be paid by the original petitioners within a
period of four weeks from today and the said amount shall be
deposited with this Court. Out of the said amount of cost,
Rs.50,000/- shall be paid to the appellant   State of Gujarat and
Rs.50,000/- shall be paid to the Gujarat State Legal Services
Authority.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_159">36.		After
pronouncement of the order, Mr.Nanavati, learned Senior Advocate
appearing with Mr.Gandhi prays for suspension of operation of the
order for sometime so as to enable his client to approach the higher
forum. When it was further inquired with learned counsel for the
original petitioners   respondents herein that whether to show bona
fide,  his client is ready to deposit the amount with accrued
interest or part thereof.  However, it was stated that there is no
instruction for deposit of the amount. Under these circumstances, we
find that when levying of fees is held to be valid in law, it would
not be a case to suspend operation of the order.  Hence, the said
prayer is declined.
