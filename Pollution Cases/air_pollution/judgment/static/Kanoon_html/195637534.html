                          (ORAL JUDGEMENT)



      This appeal arises out of decision rendered in the 115th meeting of

the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC, for short) on 16th / 17th August,

2012 and subsequent follow up action. By the impugned decision, the

Appellant was denied permission to accept membership of the industrial

units which are operating outside the Gujarat Eco Textile Park for

treatment of the effluents generated from their units.



</p><p id="p_2">2.    M/s. Gujarat Eco Textile Park Ltd. (the Appellant) obtained

necessary consent to establish and the required permission to operate

Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP, for short). Gujarat Pollution

Control Board (GPCB for short) also granted permission to amend

consent to establish on 21st April, 2009. It is not necessary to elaborately

state all the relevant facts in as much as the Respondents have not filed

their counter. Nor they have appeared in the matter. The averments in

the Appeal Memo are not traversed by the Respondents. There is no

dispute about the fact that the Appellant has capacity to deal with the

treatment of effluents upto 100 MLD. There is also no dispute about the

fact that the capacity is not being fully utilized by the Appellant. The units

which are located within the Gujarat Eco Textile Park of the Appellant are

the members thereof. Considered together, even if the effluents of such


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   2</span>
 members are allowed to be treated in the CETP, the capacity of the plant

will be utilized only upto 35 MLD. Thus, the Appellant has additional

capacity of the treatment of balance 65 MLD in the plant. The Appellant,

therefore, sought to accept membership of the other units located outside

the Gujarat Eco Textile Park. It appears that such other units consented

to become members of the Appellant's plant for the purpose of treatment

of the effluents released from such units.   Those units are mostly of

dyeing and printing of clothes. It appears that the Appellant, therefore,

requested to allow the units located outside the park to become members

of the CETP for the purpose of treatment of effluents, discharged by them

for common treatment.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">3.    Perusal of the impugned decision made in the minutes of 115th

meeting of the EAC would show that the EAC declined to accept the

proposal only on the ground that the industrial units located outside the

park are already members of the other CETP, which was under

construction and therefore the amendment sought by the Appellant could

not be accepted. The only reason assigned by the Committee (EAC) is

as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      " The Committee noted since the industrial units
      located outside the Park are already members of the
      other CETP under construction decided to change its
      earlier recommendation and in view of the above and
      opinion of the GPCB, the committee recommended not



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                3</span>
       to amend the EC of CETP to take effluent outside the
      Industrial Park."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_6">4.    The Learned Counsel for the Appellant points out that previously

the amendment sought by the Appellant was recommended by the EAC

in its 98th meeting dated 3rd and 4th March, 2011. It appears that EAC

came to the conclusion that the proposed amendment would not result in

any increase in discharge of quantity of effluents and therefore shall not

result in additional environmental burden, rather it would result in

environmental amelioration as the amendment shall ensure discharge of

only treated effluents in Khadi (creek/channel) and therefore it leads in

improvement in quality of Khadi water.      The learned counsel further

points out that there is no rationale in denial of the amendment sought by

the appellant in as much as the refusal is on the ground which is

unconnected with any environment issue. It appears that those industrial

units located outside the park, have now filed affidavits in order to show

that EC is not required for their units. The record further shows that the

appellant agreed to the condition that it will not undertake any additional

burden in excess of the capacity i.e. 100 MLD.        The Counsel would

submit that if any additional burden is accepted by the appellant, the

respondents may take appropriate action in view of the legal provisions

made under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.



</p><p id="p_7">5.    The only question to be determined in this appeal is: Whether the

impugned decision is legal and proper?
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 4</span><p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9"> 6.    We have gone through the record. We have given our anxious

consideration to the submissions of Learned Counsel for the appellant.

As stated before, there is no denial of the averments made in the appeal

memo. The respondents have not placed on record any tangible material

to show that the refusal to amend the EC is justified because of any

adverse environmental impact.        On the contrary, the EAC itself had

recommended the amendment on earlier occasion because the

amendment sought by the appellant could have positive environmental

impact. For that matter, the effluents of the units located outside the

park, would get appropriate treatment in the park of the Appellant. There

was therefore, no plausible reason for deviation after reaching such a

conclusion. The subsequent decision of the EAC was totally without

consideration of the Environmental benefits.      The fact that the units

located outside the park were attached to some other CETP, could not be

the consideration for denial of the amendment to the EC. The appraisal

by the EAC is therefore on faulty grounds. As a matter of fact, the EAC

reviewed its own previous decision vide the impugned decision. We are

of the opinion that the impugned decision is arbitrary and without any

substantial reason as such. In any case, the denial of the amendment is

not on the ground of any adverse impact on the environment.

Considering the reasons discussed herein above, we are of the opinion

that the impugned decision will have to be set aside.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 5</span>
</p><p id="p_10"> 7.    It is worthy to note that subsequently the proponent of the CETP,

located outside the Park and who initially objected, the grant of EC to the

appellant's CETP, withdrew his objection.       The new members having

units located outside the park of the Appellant have filed their affidavits to

show that their units need not have ECs due to the small scale activities

like dyeing and printing of clothes taken up by them.            In fact, the

treatment of the effluents released from such plants would be beneficial

to the environment.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">8.    The net result of the foregoing conclusion is that the impugned

decision is unsustainable in the eye of law and will have to be quashed.

Hence the impugned decision is quashed and the respondents are

directed to allow the amendment to the EC as sought by the appellant.

The respondents may put required conditions while granting amended

E.C. The Appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.
