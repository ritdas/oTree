<p id="p_1">PER T.R. SOOD, AM:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        In this appeal the Revenue has raised the following grounds:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             "1. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
                 learned CIT(A) erred in deleting disallowance of Rs. 25,15,048/-
                 by allowing the depreciation @ 100% instead of 25% on the
                 written down value of the water recycling plant allowed by the
                 Assessing Officer, without appreciating the fact that system was
                 just meant for reducing/preventing the breakage of marbles and
                 granites.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             2. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
                learned CIT(A) has erred in deleting the addition made by the
                Assessing Officer amounting to Rs. 2,45,628/- on account of
                contribution to employees provident fund paid after the due date
                as defined in the explanation below <a href="/doc/575869/" id="a_1">section 36(1)(va)</a> of the
                I.T.Act, 1961.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             3. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
                Ld.CIT(A) erred in directing to make adjustment in the value of
                opening stock in terms of the provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2">section 145A</a> of the
                Income-Tax Act, 1961 without appreciating that the opening
                stock of the relevant assessment year being the closing stock of
                the immediately preceding year, any adjustment in the value of
                the opening stock will disturb the closing stock of the preceding
                year resulting in chain reaction of changes defeating the intent of

</blockquote>
<p id="p_2">2.      As regards ground No. 1, after hearing both the parties, we find that this

issue came up before the Tribunal in the assessee's own case for the assessment

year 2006-07 in ITA No. 2713/Mum/09 dated 10.02.2010 and the same was

decided vide paras 9 and 9.1 which read as under:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2                                   ITA No.3249/M/09</span><p id="p_3">

</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       We have heard the rival submissions and considered them carefully.
       After considering the submissions and relevant material on record, we
       find that the ld CIT(A) was justified in allowing the claim of the
       assessee. The findings of the ld CIT(A) are given in para 2.5 which are
       as under:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">       "2.5       I have gone through the appellant's submission as well as
       the Assessing Officer's argument and I am of the considered view that
       in modern days, no industry is permitted to run without having a
       Pollution Control Machinery. From the above description of the whole
       processing and cutting of the granite rocks, it is clear that the water
       recycling plant/water recycling plant/water filtration system installed
       at the premises of the appellant is a water pollution control plant and
       this equipment is essential to control and prevent ground water
       pollution in the surrounding areas. The appellant's contention is also
       supported by the Chartered Engineer's certificate who has inspected
       the Water Recycling Plant installed at the factory premises of the
       appellant company and certified that this plant controls water pollution
       as it mechanically disposes the generated turbid and waste water and
       also cleans disposes the sludge mixed up with water during the
       process of cutting and polishing and this equipment is essential for
       granite industry as per the requirement of the environmental authority
       and pollution Control Board to control and prevent the ground water
       pollution in the surrounding area. The Karnataka State Pollution and
       Control Board, Bangalore has therefore granted its consent under the
       provisions of the water Prevention and of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Pollution Act</a>, 1974, vide
       letter dtd. 23.08.2007, which is valid up to 30.09.2008.            thus,
       considering the totality of the facts and evidence on record, I hold that
       water recycling plant/water filtration system is eligible for 100%
       depreciation as per the new Appendix-I, Part-A, III(ix)(n) of the I.T.
       Rules.       The Assessing Officer is therefore directed to allow
       depreciation on water recycling plant @100% as against 25% already
       allowed to the assessee. This ground of appeal is allowed."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       9.1        The above findings of the ld CIT(A) does not require any
       interference as the findings are as per provisions of law and as per I T
       Rules. The explanation offered by the assessee before the CIT(A) as
       well as here before us is correct and therefore, without going further
       into details, we confirm the findings of the ld CIT(A), which remain
       uncontroverted also."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_4">3.       Since the facts are identically same, following earlier order of the

Tribunal, we decide this issue against the revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.       As regards ground No. 2, admittedly the provident fund was paid within

grace period which was disallowed by the Assessing Officer. However, the same

was allowed by the learned CIT(A).
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.       Before us the learned Departmental Representative relied on the order of

the Assessing Officer.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          3                                  ITA No.3249/M/09</span><p id="p_7">

</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">6.      On the other hand, the learned counsel for the assessee submitted that

payments were made within the grace period and, therefore, the same should

have been allowed in view of the decision of the Hon'ble Madras High Court in the

case of <a href="/doc/1429395/" id="a_5">CIT vs. Shri Ganapathy Mills Co. Ltd</a>. (243 ITR 879).

</p><p id="p_11">7.      After considering the rival submissions carefully, we find that the Hon'ble

Madras High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1429395/" id="a_6">CIT vs. Shri Ganapathy Mills Co. Ltd</a>.(supra) has

held that payments made within the grace period to the Provident Fund Authorities

are allowable as deduction under <a href="/doc/632021/" id="a_7">section 43B</a>. Following that decision, we decide

the issue against the revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_12">8.      As far as ground No.3, after considering the rival submission, we find that

during the assessment proceedings the Assessing Officer noticed that assessee

had not added the amount of sales tax paid to the closing stock in terms of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_8">section

145A</a> of the Act and, therefore, the Assessing Officer had added this amount

towards the income of the assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_13">9.      On appeal, the learned CIT(A) deleted the addition vide para 5.2 of his

order on the basis that the payments pertained to excise duty.

</p><p id="p_14">10.     After considering the rival submissions carefully, we find force in the

submission of the learned counsel for the assessee that the issue basically relates

to payment of sales-tax. It was further pointed out that sales-tax was not included

in the purchases itself that is why the same is not included in the sales-tax also.

However, we find that the learned CIT(A) had allowed the assessee's appeal but

on the basis of excise duty which is not correct. Therefore, we set aside the order

of the learned CIT(A) and remit the matter back to the file of the Assessing Officer

for re-consideration of the issue and verify whether the sales-tax paid was included

in the purchases or not and then decide the issue accordingly. Needless to say that

the assessee should be afforded adequate opportunity of being heard.

signed by the assessee on 25.07.2007 and 16.11.2007, received back. It
is therefore, presumed that the assessee is not interested in pursuing the
appeal filed by it. It has been held by the Hon'ble Madhya Pradesh High
Court in Estate of Late Tukojirao Holkar vs. CWT (223 ITR 480)(MP) that if
the party, at whose instance the reference is made, fails to appear at the
hearing or fails in taking steps for preparation of paper-books, so as to
enable hearing of the reference, the Court is not bound to answer the
Reference.   The decision of the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in <a href="/doc/324021/" id="a_9">CIT vs.
Multiplan (India) Pvt. Ltd</a>., 38 ITD 320 (Del.) is also to the same effect. In

<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">2.         From the grounds filed by the assessee before the learned Commissioner

of Income-tax (Appeals) we find that the levy pertained to concealment of income

of Rs. 1,02,744/- and the penalty levied was Rs. 22,248/-. Therefore in view of

CBDT Circular F.No. 279/Misc.142/2007-IT dated 15th May, 2008 the appeal is not

maintainable, tax effect being less than Rs. 2 lakhs. Vide para 4 of this Circular it

is clearly mentioned that the tax effect in ascertaining monetary limits for filing of

appeals, in the case of penalty orders, would mean quantum of penalty deleted or

reduced.

<p id="p_25">3.         Therefore, appeal of the Revenue is dismissed as not maintainable.
