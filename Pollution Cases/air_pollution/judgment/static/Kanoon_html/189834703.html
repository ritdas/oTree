against these petitioners vide order dated 10.01.2011, which is under
challenge.
</p><p id="p_7">             Mr. P.K. Deomani, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners
submits that the court, has committed illegality in taking cognizance of the
offences as aforesaid, as no cognizance could have been taken for
contravention of the provision of Mines and Minerals (Development and
<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_37">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957, in absence of any complaint being filed by a person
authorized by the Central Government or the State Government.
</p><p id="p_8">             Similarly, the prosecution under the provision of the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_38">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, cannot be maintained, in
absence of complaint being filed by either by the Board or any officer
authorized in this behalf.
</p><p id="p_9">             Here in the instant case, complaint has never been filed rather a
first information report has been filed by one Kamla Kant Thakur, Junior
Environment Engineer, Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board, who has
never been authorized by the Board to lodge the complaint and thereby, the
court, has committed illegality in taking cognizance of the offence under the
Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_39">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 and also
under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_40">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p><p id="p_10">             It was further submitted that there has been no allegation
whatsoever, regarding commission of the offence of forgery as well as
commission of the offence under Section 3/4 of the S.C. &amp; S.T. (Prevention
of Atrocities ) Act, 1989 and, thereby, the court, has also committed illegality
in taking cognizance of the aforesaid offences. Thus, it was submitted that
the entire order taking cognizance of the offences, is fit to be quashed.
</p><p id="p_11">             Counter affidavit though has been filed on behalf of the State, but
no statement is there as to whether Junior Environment Engineer has been
authorized on behalf of the Board to lodge a complaint for contravention of
the provision of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_41">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p><p id="p_12">             In the context of the submission advanced on behalf of the
petitioners, one needs to take notice of the relevant provision of the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_42">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as well as Mines and
Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_43">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957.
</p><p id="p_13">             <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_44">Section 43</a> of the   Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_45">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1981, reads as follows:- [43. Cognizance of the offences.-(1) No court shall
take cognizance of any offence under this Act except on a complaint made
 by-
</p><p id="p_14">           (a) a Board or any officer authorised in this behalf by it; or
</p><p id="p_15">           (b) any person who has given notice of not less than sixty days, in
the manner prescribed, of the alleged offence and of his intention to make a
complaint to the Board or officer authorised as aforesaid, and no court
inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the
first class shall try any offence punishable under this Act.
</p><p id="p_16">           (2) Where a complaint has been made under clause (b) of sub-
section (1), the Board shall, on demand by such person, make available the
relevant reports in its possession to that person:
Provided that the Board may refuse to make any such report available to
such person if the same is, in its opinion, against the public interest.]
           Similarly, <a href="/doc/1492002/" id="a_46">Section 22</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Development
and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_47">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 reads as follows:-.
</p><p id="p_17">           22. Cognizance of offences.- No court shall take cognizance of
any offence punishable under this Act or any rules made thereunder except
upon complaint in writing made by a person authorised in this behalf by the
Central Government or the State Government.
</p><p id="p_18">           From the perusal of the aforesaid provisions, it does appear that
only a person authorised by the Central Government or the State
Government can lodge the complaint for contravention of the provision of
Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_48">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957.
</p><p id="p_19">           Similarly, person authorised by the Board can be said to be a
competent person to lodge the case for contravention of the provision of the
Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_49">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p><p id="p_20">           Here in the instant case, it has been specific stand of the
petitioners that Junior Environment Engineer, has never been authorised by
the Board to lodge the case for contravention of the provision of the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_50">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p><p id="p_21">           This has never been denied on behalf of the State.
</p><p id="p_22">           Similarly, the person, who has lodged the case, is not the
competent person to lodge the case for contravention of the Mines and
Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_51">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 and, thereby, the court
has committed illegality in taking cognizance of the offences punishable
under Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_52">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 and
well as under Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_53">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p><p id="p_23">           Further the court seems to have committed illegality in taking
cognizance of the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_54">Sections 447</a>/<a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_55">467</a>/<a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_56">468</a>/<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_57">120B</a> of
the Indian Penal Code and Section 3/4 of the S.C. &amp; S.T. (Prevention of
Atrocities ) Act, 1989, as the fact upon which, case has been registered,
never discloses about the commission of the offence either under <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_58">Sections
          447</a>/<a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_59">467</a>/<a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_60">468</a>/<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_61">120B</a> of the Indian Penal Code or under Section 3/4 of the S.C.
         &amp; S.T. (Prevention of Atrocities ) Act, 1989 and, thereby the court also
         seems to have committed illegality in taking cognizance of the aforesaid
         offences.
</p><p id="p_24">                     Under the circumstances, the order dated 10.01.2011 under
         which cognizance of the offences as aforesaid, has been taken, is hereby
         quashed.
