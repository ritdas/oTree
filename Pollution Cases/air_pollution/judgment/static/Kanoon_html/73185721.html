</p><p id="p_2">02. 28.05.2020              Heard Mrs. K.B. Roy Choudhury, learned counsel for the
                 petitioners and Mr. S. Palit, learned Additional Government Advocate
                 for the State-opposite parties.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                            This writ petition, in the nature of public interest litigation,
                 has been filed by the petitioners inter alia with the prayer that the
                 opposite parties-State authorities be directed to strictly comply with
                 the Environmental Protection Act, Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of
                 Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
                 1981 and the Rules/Guidelines relating to utilization of Puri-Konark
                 Development area for industrial purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                            The background fact, in the present writ petition, is that
                 the opposite party No.9-Saina Khatoon is in the process of
                 establishing a fly ash brick industry in purely residential area
                 adjoining to the houses of the residents which are coming under Puri-
                 Konark Development Authority, even without shortage of ground
                 water. The contention of learned counsel for the petitioners is that fly
                 ash particles may create health hazards for local public. The opposite
                 party No.9 has other plots available but she is deliberately
                 establishing her fly ash brick industry in the residential area. It is
                 submitted that construction of the said industry is illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                            Learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that
                 neither any consent to operate the above fly ash industry from the
                 Odisha State Pollution Control Board nor any 'No Objection Certificate
                 (NOC)" from the Central Ground Water Authority has been obtained
                 by the opposite party No.9. Learned counsel for the petitioners also
                 referred to the order of the National Green Tribunal dated 21.07.2017
                 in the matter of <a href="/doc/45962037/" id="a_3">Bishnu Prasad Mishro vs. State of Odisha and others</a>,
                 in that case wherein also similar brick kiln was operating without
                 clearance in Ganjam District, Odisha and submitted that the counsel
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               -2-</span>




      representing the fly ash brick unit sought permission to sell the
      existing stock of fly ash bricks produced by them prior to passing of
      the interim order dated 24.04.2017 with an undertaking that they
      shall not manufacture such bricks without obtaining NOC from the
      Central Ground Water Authority. Such requirement has not been
      complied with by the opposite party No.9.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                 Having regard to the fact that the petitioners have
      efficacious alternative remedy for redressal of their grievance, instead
      of directly entertaining the writ petition, we grant liberty to the
      petitioners to approach the Orissa State Pollution Control Board as
      well as Central Ground Water Authority inviting their attention to this
      dispute. If their grievances are not redressed, they are at liberty to
      approach the National Green Tribunal Bench at Kolkata either by
      physically filing or by means of e-filing. The petitioners may also
      request for appropriate interim relief to any of these authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                 With the above observation, the writ petition stands
      disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                 As lock-down period is continuing for COVID-19, learned
      counsel for the petitioner may utilize the soft copy of this order
      available in the High Court's website or print out thereof at par with
      certified copies in the manner prescribed, vide Court's Notice
      No.4587, dated 25.03.2020.
