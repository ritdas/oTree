 <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_1">section 61</a> and <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_2">62</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003.                           The appellant is
aggrieved on account of the following counts:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        i)       The Commission has held that any gain in net
                 generation       out     of     reduction       in   the    auxiliary
                 consumption is realized through extra sale by REL-
                 G and any benefit of better auxiliary consumption
                 would be treated in the truing up of revenue and
                 not in the truing up of expenditure.                  Accordingly,
                 the Commission has not allowed the efficiency gain
                 on additional net generation available on account
                 lower auxiliary consumption and has considered the
                 revenue from sale of additional energy as efficiency
                 gain.    The appellant contends that lower auxiliary
                 consumption is already factored in lower actual fuel
                 cost and lower variable cost of generation is worked
                 out for the entire net generation including the
                 additional energy available on account of lower
                 auxiliary consumption.                 The appellant contends
                 that the Commission ought to have computed
                 efficiency gains of entire net generation i.e. on entire
                 energy    sold    by       REL-G        and     should     not   have
                 considered the entire revenue from such sale as
                 efficiency gain.</blockquote>

</p><p id="p_3">         ii)      The Commission has considered the entire interest
                 on working capital as efficiency gain since working
                 capital requirement of the appellant for the FY 2007
                 had been met through internal accrual and not
                 through debt.       The appellant contends that this
                 would be contrary to clause 34.5(e) of MERC (Terms
                 &amp; Conditions of Tariff) Regulations 2005 which
                 provides that the rate of interest on working capital
                 shall be on normative basis and shall be equal to
                 short term prime lending rate of State Bank of
                 India. It is contended that irrespective of the source
                 from which the working capital is obtained the
                 Commission should have allowed interest and the
                 same could not have been considered as efficiency
                 gain.

                 performance and PLF incentive would be additional
                 burden on the consumers and has not allowed the
                 income tax on PLF incentive to be part of revenue
                 requirement although the incentive itself has been
                 taken as part of revenue.             It is contended by the
                 appellant that the incentive would lead to higher
                 income tax liability for REL-G and the income tax

                  thereon should naturally be passed on to the
                 consumers. In this connection it is also submitted
                 that the benefit of better performance is passed on
                 to the consumers in terms of cheaper power due to
                 higher availability.

<p id="p_5">        iv)      The Commission has disallowed expenses under
                 sub-head of 'Contributions and Donations' under
                 A&amp;G expenses for the FY 2007.                       The appellant
                 contends that the said amount was expended
                 towards community development and social welfare
                 (such as maintenance of schools and technical
                 training of all local youth of Dahanu where REL-G
                 generation plant is located), maintenance of parks,
                 gardens,      plantations       and         other    horticultural
                 activities (as part of green belt in marshy areas
                 required    as    per   MPCB         guidelines)        and   other
                 environmental management &amp; monitoring activities
                 which   formed      a    very     small       portion    of   O&amp;M
                 expenses.        The appellant disclosed that such
                 expenses were allowed when claimed separately in
                 previous years although for the year in question,
                 since these expenditures have been clubbed with
                 'Contributions and Donations' they have been
                 disallowed.

</p><p id="p_12">3)      Efficiency gain on account of lower auxiliary consumption:
Regulation 19.1 deals with sharing of gains and loses due to
controllable factors. The gain in the present case has been caused
by lower auxiliary consumption. The gain has to be shared in the
manner prescribed in Regulation 19.1. One-third of the gain has to
be passed on as rebate in tariff while one-third can be utilized at
the discretion of the generating company. The remaining one-third
has to be retained in a special reserve to meet future exigencies.
The appellant computed the total efficiency gain at Rs.78.13 Crores.
This was based on approved operational norms of heat rate and
auxiliary consumption.          The Commission, however, had the
following to say on the appellant's claim for one-third of the gain
out of controllable factors of reduced auxiliary consumption and
better lower heat rate:

         the reduction in the auxiliary consumption is realized
        through the extra sales by REL-G.               Therefore, the
        Commission has considered the efficiency gain on account
        of fuel cost on the basis of gross heat rate and any benefit
        out of the better auxiliary consumption would be treated in
        the truing up of the revenue and not in truing up of the
        expenditure. Further, the Commission has considered the
        sharing of gains in line with Tariff Regulations and has
        considered the sharing of gains as one third to be shared
        with the distribution licensee, i.e., REL-D, and two thirds
        of the gain to be retained by REL as against the REL
        submission of retaining one third of the gains as a special
        reserve for absorbing future loses.

 4)      As per the Commission's calculations the total efficiency gains
</pre><p id="p_14">is only Rs.72.35 Crores and not Rs.78.13 Crores. According to the
Commission, in case efficiency gain is calculated in the manner
done by appellant, the appellant will get benefit of efficiency gain
twice.       The reason for so believing is the Commission's view that
any gain in net generation out of reduced auxiliary consumption
results in extra sales by REL-G. The Commission has considered
the efficiency gain on account of fuel cost on the basis of gross heat
rate and any benefit out of better auxiliary consumption to be
treated in the truing up of revenue and not in the truing up of
expenditure. The appellant, however, explains that the production
is determined by demand and not by auxiliary consumption. The
appellant claims that the better operational parameters have
actually gone in reducing the cost of production rather than in
increase in sales as the generation has been only to the extent
needed to meet the demand plus the auxiliary consumption. It will
not be correct to say that on account of reduced auxiliary
consumption there has been increase in sale to the extent of
reduced auxiliary consumption. In fact, auxiliary consumption is a
part of cost.         When auxiliary consumption is reduced the total
amount to be produced is also reduced. A generating company is
required to generate as much as is required to meet the demand of
the purchaser. In case generating company has to sell more power
it has to produce more power. The production does not increase on

 account of lower auxiliary consumption. Only the need to produce
is reduced to the extent the auxiliary consumption is reduced.
Therefore, reduction in auxiliary consumption does not actually
mean increase in the sale of electricity units produced. The benefits
of the better operational parameters go to the consumer in the form
of reduced cost of generation and as sharing of efficiency gain as
per provisions of Regulation19.            To this extent we find merit in the
appeal.

         Interest on Working Capital
        As discussed in the above paragraphs, the actual interest
        on working capital incurred by REL during FY 2006-07 is
        nil and the normative interest on working capital approved
        by the Commission considering other elements of expenses
        as approved after truing up, works out to Rs.6.37 Crore.
        As the actual expenditure under this head is zero, the
        Commission has considered the entire normative interest
        on working capital as efficiency gains and has considered
        sharing of the same with the distribution licensees in the
        appropriate ratio, as discussed while sharing efficiency
        gains due to fuel cost."

<p id="p_25">6)      It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that when working
capital is funded through internal sources of the appellant, the
internal funds also carry cost.          It is further submitted that such

<p id="p_26">7)      The Commission observed that in actual fact no amount has
been paid towards interest.             Therefore, the entire interest on
working capital granted as pass through in tariff has been treated
as efficiency gain. It is true that internal funds also deserve interest
in as much as the internal fund when employed as working capital
loses the interest it could have earned by investment elsewhere.
Further the licensee can never have any funds which has no cost.

 The internal accruals are not like some reserve which does not
carry any cost. Internal accruals could have been inter corporate
deposits, as suggested on behalf of the appellant. In that case the
same would also carry the cost of interest. When the Commission
observed that the REL had actually not incurred any expenditure
towards interest on working capital it should have also considered if
the internal accruals had to bear some costs themselves.           The
Commission could have looked into the source of such internal
accruals and the cost of generating such accruals. The cost of such
accruals or funds could be less or more than the normative interest.
In arriving at whether there was a gain or loss the Commission was
required to take the total picture into consideration which the
Commission has not done. It cannot be said that simply because
internal accruals were used and there was no outflow of funds by
way of interest on working capital and hence the entire interest on
working capital was gain which could be shared as per Regulation
No. 19. Accordingly, the claim of the appellant that it has wrongly
been made to share the interest on working capital as per
Regulation 19 has merit.

expenses towards such activities is allowed to be recovered.
However, the entire expenses disallowed namely Rs.1.96 Crores is
not incurred on account of such activities. The Commission has to
