    Power Station (NTPS). The NTPS uses coal as fuel for generation of
    electricity. Coal is burnt in a boiler with the help of air supplied by fans.
</p>                            
<p id="p_6">    The waste product is ash. The ash generated is of two types. One is
    Furnace Bottom Ash comprising of coarse ash. Second is Pulverized Fly
                           
    Ash (PFA). Due to the heat and the air circulation of the fans used at the
    power station, PFA which is a fine ash, rises to the top of boilers. The
    Bottom Ash generated is mixed with water and converted into a slurry.
</p>           


<p id="p_7">    This slurry is then pumped out from the bottom of the boilers and is
        



    disposed off in an Ash lagoon. The Bottom Ash is generally about 20% of
    the total ash. The PFA which rises to the top of the boilers is trapped by





    Electrostatic Precipitators (ESPs) installed along the outer sides of the
    boilers. Each particle of PFA has a small electric charge. The ESPs are
    rows of large plates made of copper, each carrying an electric current of
    varying intensity. If the PFA escapes in the air, it being very fine, can





    cause serious atmospheric pollution. Traditionally Individual contractors
    were lifting a small quantity of waste fly ash from NTPS, while most of
    the ash was being washed away into the lagoon or escape into the air.
    This was the position when the parties negotiated an agreement in
    respect of the PFA.

    of land for installing their ash and processing plant and machinery at
                            
    some distance from the NTPS. Dirk India complained that no valid lease
    deed was executed in its favour, and no right or title was created, which
                           
    made it difficult to raise finances. Dirk India commenced construction
    of the Ash Handling plant (PFA plant) on the land demarcated by
    Mahgenco. Between October 2000 and April 2002, issue arose as to
           


    whether the land allotted to Dirk India was 'forest', also issues regarding
        



    construction and maintenance of the direct approach road, and shifting
    of high tension wires. Around April 2001, Dirk India erected one Silo.

<p id="p_11">    Silos/hoppers are receptors for collection of ash. As further narration
    would show, a serious dispute arose between the parties as regards these
    Silos/Hoppers. According to Mahgenco, Dirk India was supposed to
    create four large hoppers. According to Dirk India, hoppers could not be





    created since system of delivery of PFA was not provided by Mahgenco
    and the locations of the hoppers were not specified. On 24 January 2005,
    PFA Plant put up by Dirk India was inaugurated. The dispute regarding
    collection of PFA however remained unresolved. A meeting took place
    on 11 April 2005, between the Chairman of Mahgenco and Chairman

    letters to Dirk India stating that Dirk India failed to collect the
    required quantity of PFA and unless that was done, Mahgenco would

    2006, Mahgenco purported to terminate the agreement between the
                            
    parties. Dirk India was called upon to remove the plant and machinery
    and to hand over the vacant possession of the PFA plant site. By letter

    that Dirk India was not able to lift the entire PFA, Mahgenco was
    permitted to take the PFA to the lagoon, and other consequential

    Mahgenco from selling or delivering PFA to the strangers or otherwise
    disposing of the same, without first offering it to Dirk India, to the extent

    Maharashtra. Dirk India entered into an Agreement dated 4 October 2000
    with MSEB. Dirk India invested in a captive plant at NTPS. Mahgenco
    gave exclusive rights to Dirk India lift the PFA generated at NTPS for a





    term of 30 years. Under the Agreement, Dirk India was required to make
    a huge investment in order to build, at their own cost, a PFA Handling
    plant on a piece of land next to the NTPS to be leased by Mahgenco for





    thirty years. The PFA collected by the ESPs needed to be transported by
    a Dense Phase Conveying System to a central point of collection or a
    silo/hopper meant for storage of the PFA and its ultimate disposal. The
    Dense Phase Conveying System was to be built and commissioned by
    Mahgenco at their cost so as to enable them to provide the PFA to Dirk
    India. Mahgenco was to deliver the PFA in the hoppers of Dirk India as

<p id="p_34">    15.          The learned counsel made submissions in extentio. It is
     



    however necessary to keep in mind the scope of challenge under <a href="/doc/675604/" id="a_10">Section
    34</a> of the Act lest it becomes an exercise of an appellate power. It is trite
    to state that the petition under <a href="/doc/675604/" id="a_11">Section 34</a> of the Act is not an appeal





    and the merits of the award cannot be examined exercising appellate
    powers. The scope of enquiry lies in a narrow field. The scope of scrutiny
    under <a href="/doc/675604/" id="a_12">Section 34</a> is a subject matter of various judicial pronouncements.
</p>




<p id="p_35">    The review of the decisions would indicate that the Court leans in favour
    of confirming the arbitral award. There are however certain situations
    where the Court exercises powers under <a href="/doc/675604/" id="a_13">Section 34</a> of the Act to set aside
    the award. Therefore, unless a petitioner brings its case within the
    available grounds, the petitioner cannot succeed.

           above, it can be held that the term 'public policy of India' is
           required to be interpreted in the context of the jurisdiction of

           becomes final and executable. The concept of enforcement of
           the award after it becomes final is different and the
                              
           jurisdiction of the Court at that stage could be limited.</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">           Similar is the position with regard to the execution of a
           decree. It is settled law as well as it is provided under Code
                             
           of civil Procedure that once the decree has attained finality,
           in an execution proceeding, it may be challenged only on
           limited grounds such as the decree being without jurisdiction
           or nullity. But in a case where the judgment and decree is
        

           challenged before the Appellate Court or the Court
           exercising revisional jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of such
     



           Court would be wider. therefore, in a case where the validity
           of award is challenged there is no necessity of giving a
           narrower meaning to the term 'public policy of India'. On the
           contrary, wider meaning is required to be given so that the





           'patently illegal award' passed by the arbitral tribunal could
           be set aside. If narrow meaning as contended by the learned
           senior counsel Mr. Dave is given, some of the provisions of
           the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_15">Arbitration Act</a> would become nugatory. Take for
           illustration a case wherein there is a specific provision in the





           contract that for delayed payment of the amount due and
           payable, no interest would be payable, still however, if the
           Arbitrator has passed an award granting interest, it would
           be against the terms of the contract and thereby against the
           provision of <a href="/doc/234058/" id="a_16">Section 28(3)</a> of the Act which specifically
           provides that "arbitral tribunal shall decide in accordance

          the award is, on the face of it, erroneous and in violation of

    error of law. It was not necessary for the Arbitrators to write a detailed
    and elaborate judgment, and since it is found that 22 issues framed
                            
    earlier were superfluous, they were narrowed down to 5 key issues. It is
    clear that Dirk India failed to perform it's part of the contract, contract
                           
    was rightly terminated, therefore no elaborate award was necessary.

    available ground of challenge. For this purpose, it would be necessary

    Mahgenco, unless Dirk India commenced construction of the hoppers,
    there was no question of a supply system for stage (a).

    collection of transport of PFA from ESP to Hoppers to be constructed
                           
    nearby i.e. for the stage (a). It was never disputed by Dirk India that
    the transport from the Hoppers to its PFA plant-stage (b) was the
                          
    responsibility of Dirk India, and it was being done by plying trucks.

<p id="p_88">    26.         Mr. Dirk on behalf of M/s. Dirk India in his deposition
    reiterated that since Mahgenco did not make any arrangement to deliver
    the PFA from hoppers to be constructed stage (a), and the location for





    other hoppers were not specified, a small silo was built. He said that it
    was not possible for Dirk India to collect adequate amount of PFA,
    without resorting to manual collection. He asserted        that it was the





    obligation of Mahgenco to deliver the PFA into hoppers of Dirk India
    and for that purpose, Mahgenco had to install Dense Phase Conveying
    System which they failed. Mr. Dirk was cross-examined extensively. In
    the cross-examination, various suggestions were given. Mahgenco
    examined it's engineer Mr. R.J. Morale. Mr. Morale specifically averred
    that Dirk India erected only one silo and it failed to erect remaining

    hoppers. He specifically stated that as per clause 3.2 of the agreement,




                                                                                 
    Mahgenco was to deliver the PFA to Dirk India's hoppers, which were
    never constructed. There was no question of construction of a delivery




                                                        
    system and Mahgenco was under no legal obligation to provide a PFA
    delivery system. He stated that the erection of a delivery system without
    any hoppers would have been a meaningless exercise. He stated that




                                                       
    primary default was on the part of Dirk India in not constructing the four
    hoppers. It is to be noted that all these assertions were regarding stage (a).

<p id="p_89">    27.          Thus the dispute between the parties was regarding PFA
                             
    was to be delivered from ESP to the hoppers, that is stage (a). To repeat
    clause 3.2 and clause 3.5 covered different transportation stages. Clause
                            
    3.2 was for stage (a) ESP to the hoppers. Clause 3.5 was for stage (b)
    hoppers to the PFA plant. The term 'Site' meant where the PFA plant
    was constructed. It is clear from the pleadings of the parties and evidence
        


    that the controversy is surrounded itself as regards the obligations under
     



    clause 3.2. As a corollary, various issues arose : whether it was the
    obligation of Dirk India; whether Dirk India was to first construct the





    hoppers then delivery system was to be constructed; whether Mahgenco
    was right that without hoppers there could be no delivery; whether since
    the Dirk India installed only one silo and did not collect requisite
    amount of PFA there was a breach of contract; whether it was the





    responsibility of Mahgenco to construct a Dense Phase Conveying

          According to the Company the responsibility was, after

          collection of PFA within the precincts of the NTPA. The

          responsibility of transporting PFA on the company. The
          Company, however, has claimed that the Claimant never

          responsibility of transporting PFA from NTPS to the plant
          of company was always that of company and it completely

</pre><p id="p_93">          from the scrutiny of the agreement dated 04.10.2000, it will
          be clear that a responsibility of transporting PFA was
          always that of the company. How it does, it was the
       


          discretion of the company. Rights to use the roads within
    



          the NTPS were also given to the company for
          transportation of PEA and yet nothing was done to effect
          transport of 1000 MT/per day PFA from the NTPS to the
          company plant at any time. Failure to lift even 1 / 5th of the





          agreed quantity of the PFA throughout the period of
          subsistence of the contract is therefore substantial and valid
          reason for which the contract can be terminated. The most
          vital purpose of the agreement dated 04.10.2000 was
          effective prevention of atmospheric pollution caused by





          PFA. It cannot be matter of dispute that this was the basic
          reason for which the entire contract was tailored: The
          company having failed to lift anything more that 600
          MT/per day throughout the period of subsistence of the
          contract there was total failure to achieve this object for
          which the entire contract was executed. Therefore, the
          Genco had very substantial reason for terminating the
          contract.

          even according to the company the responsibility of
          transportation of PFA was that of the Claimant Company




                                            
          till 11th April, 2005. There is nothing on record to show
          that anything substantial in this regard was undertaken by
                            
          the company to perform its part of the contract. According
          to us there is a gross failure to perform an all important
          term of the contract by the company by not doing anything
                           
          for transportation of PFA from its Silos in the NTPS to its
          silos in the Pozocrette plant. It cannot therefore be said that
          Genco avoided its responsibility of delivering PFA. In our
          opinion, the Respondent Genco has completely proved one
          valid reason for termination of contract namely non
        


          transportation of PFA in agreed quantities from NTPS plant
     



          to Pozocrette plant to prevent pollution for a continuous

    Chinoy contended that the reference to clause 3.5 by the Arbitrators is




                                                      
    only to hold that it was the responsibility of Dirk India to transport the
    PFA. He submitted that it includes responsibility under clause 3.2 as well.
    According to him, the finding under clause 3.5 will not detract from the




                                                     
    finding as regards the basic obligation to transport the PFA.
</p>



                                             
<p id="p_101">    31.          When the contract stipulated different kinds of obligations
    for different stages of transport and the parties knew that was to be so,
                            
    the decision of the arbitrators ought to have on those lines. If one looks
    the passages from the award culled out above again, the Arbitrators
                           
    have not made any distinction between the transport for stage (a) and
    stage (b). The arbitrators hold that it is the responsibility of Dirk India
    to transport from PFA to PFA plant and it could do so by installing a
        


    convener system, tankers or trucks. When Dirk India was manually
     



    collecting the PFA, it was transporting it by trucks from NTPS plant
    to its PFA plant. That it was the responsibility of Dirk India to





    transport from hoppers to its PFA plant, at the cost of repetition, was not
    disputed by anybody. The Arbitrators brought on to themselves to
    decide an issue which was never in dispute. There is confusion as
    regards the distinct responsibilities of the parties in respect of two





    distinct stages of transportation.    The Arbitrators imposed a denial of
    obligation for stage (b) on the part of Dirk India and then castigated it
    for the denial.
</p>

<p id="p_102">    32.          Now it will have to be considered whether findings on

    clause 3.5 and 3.2 can be severed. In my opinion, it is not possible.
</p>



                                                                               
<p id="p_103">    There is total confusion between the two stages of transportation. This
    confusion again and again appears in the award and it is so intrinsically




                                                       
    mixed with the findings that it is very difficult to hold that even if the
    observations as regards clause 3.5 is kept aside, rest of the reasoning
    was the adjudication of the dispute between         the parties. This flaw




                                                      
    permeates through the entire fabric of the award and vitiates it. Failure to
    distinguish between two stages of transportation         was a fundamental




                                            
    failure. Though there is a finding that Dirk India failed to lift the PFA
    from ESP by not constructing hoppers on the site, it is based on a wrong
                            
    clause of the contract. To put in short, the responsibility for stage (a)-
    the real dispute, is decided by adjudicating the clause governing stage
                           
</p><p id="p_104">    (b). In a petition under <a href="/doc/675604/" id="a_39">Section 34</a> of the Act, it may not be possible to
    test the merits of the award, but once it is found that outcome is a result
    of adjudication of dispute which never arose, then              it will be a
        


    fundamental flaw. If the flaw is so fundamental and intermixed, then
     



    the entire award will be vitiated and cannot stand.

<p id="p_105">    33.          Having dealt with the part where the Arbitrators decided the
    issue which never arose, now to the issues which arose but were not
    decided. Disputes was : whether hoppers had to be constructed first or
    whether the location had to be provided first; whether Dense Phase





    Conveying System had to be constructed; what is the effect of minutes
    of meeting of 11 April 2005, whether it constituted an amendment or
    not, whether it confirmed the obligations or whether new obligations
    were cast; whether Dirk India had to provide a Dry Ash system.

</p><p id="p_107">    34.          According to Dirk India, hoppers could not have been




                                                                             
    constructed before the Supply System and specifications of the location
    were given. According to Mahgenco, Dirk India had to first construct




                                                     
    four hoppers which they did not do, and they did not collect the PFA.
    The parties led evidence at great length on these issues. When 22 issues
    framed earlier by the Arbitrators, two issues were included in it. First,




                                                    
    whether Mahgenco was under an obligation to provide Dense Phase
    Conveying System, and for delivery of PFA to the hoppers. Second




                                           
    issue was whether Dirk India agreed to install dry fly ash collection
    system. There was an another issue as to whether Dirk India had
                           
    committed breach of contract by erecting one hopper out of four.
</p>                          
<p id="p_108">    35.          The Arbitrators straightaway went to the issue whether Dirk
    India committed any breach by not collecting the PFA, but with no
    consideration of the issue as regards the Dense Phase Conveying System.
</p>        


<p id="p_109">    These issues could not have been separated. Whether there was                 an
     



    obligation to construct a Dense Phase Conveying System or not, was an
    equally vital issue to be considered. These vital issues were not decided





    as the Arbitrators found that the admission of Dirk India was enough,
    and the clause 3.5 was clear.

    42.         Before the Arbitrators,

</pre><p id="p_170">    interpretation as regards minutes of meeting and their implications. It
    was the case of Dirk India that minutes were an admission of liability on
                          
    the part of Mahgenco to ensure the delivery of PFA. It was their case
    that Mahgenco was in default to comply their obligations. They failed
    to deliver the PFA to Dirk India and did not construct Dense Phase
        


    Conveying System. There was also a debate between the parties as to
     



    whether there was an amendment of the agreement. Dirk India in its
    statement of claim stated that     minutes were an explanation to the





    agreement and were only a guideline. It was their case before the
    Arbitrators that everything recorded in the meeting did not have an effect
    to modify the agreement and some of the points in the minutes were
    clarificatory in nature. The issue then arose whether it was the





    responsibility of Mahgenco to construct Dense Phase Conveying System
    and whether setting up of Supply System was to be done simultaneously
    with the construction of the silos. It was the stand of Mahgenco that it
    was never their responsibility to construct Dense Phase Conveying
    System and it was the responsibility of Dirk India to construct




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 25/07/2014 23:50:03 :::</span>

    delivery of PFA to be constructed first or hoppers to be constructed first.
    Most of the dispute centered around this question. Both the parties led




                                                      
    evidence and witnesses were cross-examined on this issue. It was the
    specific contention of Dirk India that the minutes of meeting dated 11
    April 2005 did not totally modify the agreement but only reiterated




                                                     
    the obligation of Mahgenco that it would install PFA supply system.
</p>



                                            
<p id="p_171">    43.          The Arbitrators concluded that even according to Dirk India,
    the responsibility of transportation of PFA was with Dirk India. They
                            
    based this conclusion on the pleadings of Dirk India          regarding the
    meeting dated 10 April 2005 that the contract was amended on 11
                           
    April 2005. According to the Arbitrators, since Dirk India itself stated
    that by meeting of 11 April 2005, the contract was amended and the
    responsibility was shifted to Mahgenco, it was clear that before this
        


    amendment, admittedly the responsibility of transportation of PFA was
     



    with Dirk India, and further enquiry was necessray. If the Arbitrators
    were to shut out any further enquiry on the ground that Dirk India





    itself had admitted the liability by pleading theory of amendment, the
    Arbitrators should have examined whether such pleadings existed. Dirk
    India specifically pleaded that there was no amendment as such to the
    contract in the meeting of 11 April 2005, but minutes were only





    clarificatory in nature and the responsibility was always on the
    Mahgenco. The Arbitrators then went on to observe that the theory of
    amendment of contract cannot be accepted as it could be only done by
    notice under Clause 11.2 of the contract. In fact Mahgenco had stated
    that the minutes had no force and could be taken into account. Thus,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 25/07/2014 23:50:03 :::</span>

    the Arbitrators placed reliance on an non-existent admission of Dirk




                                                                               
    India to reach at an important conclusion, without further enquiry. Thus
    this dispute was never decided. According to the Arbitrators it was not




                                                       
    necessary as the admission of Dirk India was clear. If the foundation to
    fix the responsibility on Dirk India was their own pleadings and if such
    pleadings never existed, then the finding would be rendered perverse on




                                                      
    the face of it.

<p id="p_172">    44.           As regards the submission of Mr. Dada that the award is
    without reasons, Mr. Chinoy submitted that it is not necessary to give a
                            
    detailed award and no elaborate reasoning in support thereof need to be
    given. He submitted that obligation under the contract was admittedly
                           
    not performed by Dirk India and, therefore        no detailed award was
    necessary. It is true that an arbitral award need not be very detailed,
    but at the same time, unless the parties agree, reasons have to be given
        


    in the award. If the parties go to the Arbitrators with specific issues to
     



    be decided, not only they must be decided, but the parties must be
    informed why the dispute was decided in a particular manner.

    parties better and bring it into focus and give a just and reasoned
    decision.   When the parties choose an arbitrator with a technical
    background they rely more on the technical approach rather than a




                                                     
    judicial approach, and may not expect a detailed reasoning. The parties
    may decide that no reasons be given in the arbitration award. The




                                            
    parties may choose an arbitrator from similar background as themselves.
    They may choose an arbitrator with an expertise in the subject or they
                            
    may choose an arbitrator with a judicial background. The expectations of
    the parties as regards the form and content of the award in all these
                           
    contingencies differ. Their expectation as to how the award should be
    delivered also differs. The depth and quality of reasoning will differ and
    cannot be placed on the same pedestal. This is not to lay down any
        


    absolute proposition of law but a factor to be kept in mind when a party
     



    makes a grievance about an unreasoned award.

    31 March 2011 and there was a gross delay. Again had this been a lone
    argument, it may or may not result in setting aside the award. But when





    the outcome of the proceedings was as narrated above, one wonders
    whether it was the result of time gap between the closure of argument
    and pronouncement of the award.

    be permissible as it would amount to exercising an appellate power
    over the Arbitrators findings. Even with the restricted jurisdiction




                                                        
    available under <a href="/doc/675604/" id="a_40">Section 34</a>, it can be seen that the award is fundamentally
    flawed. According to Mr. Chinoy, none of the above grounds constitute
    any ground for interference under <a href="/doc/675604/" id="a_41">Section 34</a> of the Act. According to




                                                       
    him, there was nothing complicated in the dispute. It was the
    responsibility of Dirk India to collect the specified quantity of PFA




                                             
    which they admittedly failed to do and, therefore the contract was rightly
    terminated and which action has been correctly upheld by the Arbitrators.
</p>                             
<p id="p_177">    I am afraid the controversy was not as simple as that. Mr. Dada is
    successful in demonstrating that there is a complete omission to decide
                            
    the core issues and        the issues decided are irrelevant. He also
    demonstrated that the dispute which never arose was decided. He has also
    been successful to demonstrate that this flaw is of such a fundamental
        


    nature that the award is rendered perverse. If the Arbitrators did not
     



    decide the dispute and decided a dispute which never arose, the entire
    purpose of arbitration is lost, rendering it a completely futile exercise.

<p id="p_178">    48.          Dirk India     alone is not dissatisfied       with the award.
    Mahgenco has also filed its petition being Arbitration Petition No.695 of
    2011 challenging the dismissal of its counter claim. Mahgenco had





    sought damages from Dirk India on various counts. Mahgenco sought
    damages of Rs.18671.58 lakhs with interest @ 18% p.a. The damages
    were sought on the ground that Mahgenco had entered into the contract
    with Dirk India for removing the PFA to avoid environmental pollution
    and Dirk India not only failed to lift the agreed quantity, but caused
    damage. According to Mahgenco, the machinery inside ESP hoppers

    expenses. Damages were also sought for cleaning cable trays; cleaning




                                                      
    of suspension tubes and rods; replacement of rectifier           transformer;
    cleaning of isolator; emitting electrodes; shaft insulator; various heaters
    etc. Mahgenco contended that slurry pumps had to be maintained. And




                                                     
    PFA had to be dumped in the lagoon. Various pumps is required to run 24
    hours, causing heavy electrical consumption. Various machines and




                                            
    supervisory staff had to be maintained because the PFA was not lifted by
    Dirk India. Various problems arose such as reduction in vaccum, poor
                              
    performance of cooling         towers, machinery was chocked up and
    additional supervisory staff had to be engaged. Sums under various heads
                             
    were specified. Correspondence was placed on record and Mr. Morale
    deposed to that effect.

<p id="p_179">    49.           The Arbitrators dismissed the claim of Mahgenco in totality.
</p>     



<p id="p_180">    The Arbitrators    held that    the documents which were sought to be
    proved by the witness of Mahgenco were not proved. The Arbitrators





    held that even if they were accepted in evidence, the exact loss is not
    discernable and Mahgenco did not prove that it had spent so much
    amount for preventing environmental pollution. The Arbitrators also
    held that Mahgenco did not challenge various orders passed by the High





    Court from time to time and Dirk India alone was not responsible for
    the losses caused by Dirk India by implementation of the orders of the
    High Court.

    contended that the approach of the Arbitrators in dismissing the entire




                                                                              
    claim of Mahgenco is perverse. He submitted that the orders passed by
    the High Court were without prejudice to the rights and contentions of




                                                      
    the parties and merely because Mahgenco did not challenge the orders of
    the High Court, and Mahgenco, a statutory body, decided to comply
    with the orders, it cannot be deprived of claiming damages which it had




                                                     
    suffered. He also submitted that evidence produced on record was
    official correspondence, about which there could not have been any




                                           
    dispute. In the petition filed by Mahgenco challenge this part of the
    award is on the ground of breach of principles of natural justice and
                           
    that the finding that Mahgenco is precluded from seeking damages by not
    challenging the orders of the High Court, is perverse.

<p id="p_182">    51.         I am in agreement with the submissions of Mr. Madon.
    Because the orders passed under <a href="/doc/1549225/" id="a_42">Section 9</a> of the Act, by the High Court,
        


    were not challenged, the entire claim of damages of Mahgenco could not

    damages, this aspect should have been looked into by the Arbitrators.

<p id="p_183">    The correspondence which was sought to be relied upon by Mahgenco

    it is his contention that Mahgenco is not entitled to any damages, he
