                        *****

     THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226 &amp;
227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, PRAYING TO QUASH THE
ORDER   /   NOTICE DATED   26.7.2013   ISSUED   BY   THE II
RESPONDENT AT ANN-J.


     THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY HEARING,
THIS DAY, NAGARATHNA J., MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                                3




                          ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.     Sri D.Nagaraj, learned counsel takes notice for

respondent No.2. Sri.R.G.Kolle, learned AGA takes notice

for respondent No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    In this writ petition, the petitioner has challenged

Annexure "J" dated 26/7/2013, which is a closure Notice

issued by the 2nd respondent and has sought a direction to

the respondents to consider the petitioner's application

dated at Annexure "B", for grant of lease to run his stone

crushing unit in the safer zone and to permit him to

continue the stone crushing unit in the present location till

such time the application is considered.


</p><p id="p_4">3.    It is the case of the petitioner that he has obtained

license and permission from the respondent-authorities

and    running   his   stone   crusher   unit   in   Sy.No.454,

Badanaguppe village, Chamarajanagar Taluk and District.

That pursuant to the directions of this Court as well as the

Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of           Obayya Pujari,

safer zones for location of stone crushing units had to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   4</span>




notified and the same have been notified on 8/11/2012.

That the petitioner has made an application for grant of

licence to the stone crushing unit in the safer zone but the

said licence has not yet been granted. Therefore, the

grievance of the petitioner is that on the one hand the

allotment in the safer zones has not been made by the

respondent - authorities and on the other hand he is not

able to pursue stone crushing activity in the existing

location, as a result, his business has come to a standstill.


</p><p id="p_5">4.    It is the further case of the petitioner that he is a

class-I Contractor and Karnataka Rural Road Development

Authority has allotted work to develop the roads in the

rural area in Chamarajanagar District as per Annexure "E"

to "H" under a project and that he has to complete the said

work within 11 months from 27/03/2013 and on account of

the closing down of the stone crusher work as per the

closure order issued by respondent No.2, it is not possible

for   him   to   complete   the       work   and   would   lead   to

inconvenience to the public at large. It is also stated that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               5</span>




the development work is in progress and would not be

completed in time and that the same would lead to

financial loss to him.     That he is entitled to run the

operation of stone crushing activities under the provisions

of Section 7 of the Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers

Act. It is the further case of the petitioner that as safer

zones have been notified in his District, his application be

considered by respondent No.3 and license be issued to

him. However, pending consideration of his application, he

has sought permission to continue his stone crushing

activity in the aforesaid survey number by seeking

quashing of the impugned closure order (Annexure-B).


</p><p id="p_6">5. Having regard to the prayers made in the writ petition,

we are of the view that this writ petition can be disposed of

in terms of the orders passed in the earlier writ petitions in

W.P.Nos.40894-956/2012 and W.P.No.11543/2013. The

first of the writ petitions pertain to Shimoga District, in

which, safer zones have been identified as in the instant

case.

Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers Act, 2011 ("Act",

or the Rules made there under.                The explanation states
