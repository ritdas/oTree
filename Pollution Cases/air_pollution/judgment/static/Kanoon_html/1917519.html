</pre>
<p id="p_1">Ramachandran Nair, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      Writ Appeals are filed against common judgment of the learned

single Judge declaring clause (e) of sub rule (1) of Rule 8 of the Kerala

Minor Mineral Concessions Rules, 1957, hereinafter called the "Rules"

as invalid and impermissible under the enabling provision contained in

<a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_1">Section 15</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_2">Regulation)

Act</a>, 1957. In the WPC taken up along with Writ Appeals, the prayer is

for direction to the respondents to permit the petitioner to use

mechanical device for mining sand. We have heard counsel appearing

for appellants, counsel for the petitioner, Government Pleader for State

and it's agencies and standing counsel appearing for the Velloor Grama

Panchayath.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      2. Petitioners in the WPCs are wet land owners who challenged

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2</span>

the above Rule on the ground that mechanical mining of sand in the

neighbouring paddy lands permitted under the Rule causes various

problems to them and destruction of their property. However, in the

Writ Appeal stage, petitioners even after receipt of notice, have not

appeared in Court either through counsel or in person. The above rule

declared invalid by the learned single Judge confers right on the permit

holder to mine sand using mechanical device. For easy reference we

extract hereinbelow the rule impugned in the WPCs and the enabling

provision under which the same was prescribed by Government:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           8. Conditions on which quarrying permit shall be granted:
           (1) Every quarrying permit granted under rule 4 shall be

           ..................
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           (e) Quarrying permit holder shall have the right for the
           purpose of the quarrying to use any mechanical devices
           including jackhammer and pump.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">           (2) Every quarrying permit granted under rule 4 shall be
           subject to such other conditions as the competent authority
           or the officer granting the permit, as the case may be, may
           deem necessary in regard to the following matters, namely:

           in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected
           therewith.

                 of undertaking research or training in matters relating
                 to mining operations;

                 party is prejudicially affected by reason of any
                 prospecting or mining operations:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">The contention raised by the petitioners in the WPC and accepted by

the learned single Judge was that <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_4">Section 15</a> does not enable the State

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    4</span>

to make Rule 8(1)(e) conferring right on the mining licence holders to

engage mechanical devices for mining. Another contention raised was

that Rule 8(1) was unconstitutional inasmuch as it violates <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_5">Article 21</a>

of the Constitution of India in relation to neighbouring owners and the

public.   The learned single Judge upheld the challenge against the rule

on both the grounds and declared it invalid against which Writ Appeals

are filed. In support of his findings, the learned single Judge has

referred to Division Bench decision of this Court in SOMAN V.

</blockquote><p id="p_5">GEOLOGIST, (2004) 3 KLT 577 wherein this Court upheld the permit

conditions prohibiting mining within 75 metres from a railway line

and 50 metres from water tanks, reservoir, canals, etc.

</p><p id="p_6">      3. Counsel for the appellants contended that the impugned rule,

namely, Rule 8(1)(e) is perfectly within the powers of the State under

<a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_6">Section 15(1)</a> of the Act, which authorises the State Government to

make rules for all purposes in connection with quarrying or mining

licences granted under the Rules. Government Pleader appearing for

the State also supported the stand of the appellants that the impugned

rule is within the rule-making powers of the Government under <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_7">Section

15(1)</a> of the Act. Even though counsel appearing for the Panchayath

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5</span>

did not support the appellants, he contended that Panchayath is not

totally against mining using mechanical devices but they are more

concerned about the welfare of neighbouring owners and public at

large, who may be affected on account of adverse effect of mechanical

mining. In our view, the judgment of the learned single Judge is not

sustainable because State has power under <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_8">Section 15(1)</a> of the Act to

regulate mining through licences to be issued subject to conditions

which the Government is free to impose. In fact, when mining is

regulated by State and licences for mining are issued subject to

conditions, State has all incidental powers to prescribe any rule for the

purposes connected with mining. Admittedly all mining licences are

issued with strict conditions in regard to depth to which mining is

permitted, margins to be left to the neighbouring property, conditions

to be satisfied by the licence holder including the duty to fill up the

mined pit formed on account of mining.      Therefore adverse impacts

on environment are neutralised through the conditions imposed in the

mining licence. Similarly neighbouring owners and their properties are

protected by imposing strict conditions in the mining licence issued

under the Rules. The impugned rule was introduced on 12.3.2008

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      6</span>

which itself was to get over certain judgments of this Court imposing

restrictions on mining with mechanical devices. <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_9">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the

Constitution of India gives right to the citizen to practice any

profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. which

obviously means that right can be exercised to carry on the trade or

business successfully and profitably.         If mining cannot be done

successfully or profitably by engaging human labour, licence holder is

absolutely free to use mechanical devices so that mining is done

profitably. All what is required is that while engaging mechanical

devices, licence holders shall not violate any of the conditions of

licence. The learned single Judge has considered the adverse impact

that could be caused on account of mechanical mining and he assumed

that using of mechanical device will result in environmental pollution

and damage to neighbouring properties. So long as licence is issued

subject to conditions, then it is for the licence holder to carry on mining

without any violation, irrespective of the fact that the machine

employed by them is capable of mining beyond the limits permitted. In

other words, so long as machines employed are used for mining in

accordance with terms and conditions of licence issued, nobody can

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   7</span>

have any objection. In other words, licence holder is free to engage

any permissible method for mining whether mechanical or manual and

the only condition is that mining should be done in accordance with the

terms and conditions of licence. In our view the later part of <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_10">Section 15</a>

(1) giving power to the State Government to make rules for the

purposes connected with mining gives power to the State Government

to grant the right to mine by using mechanical devices. We are of the

view that Rule 8(1)(e) is only clarificatory in nature and that licence

holder is free to engage any mechanical device and the only restriction

is that mining should be done only in accordance with terms and

conditions of licence. We therefore reverse the findings of the learned

single Judge and hold that it was perfectly within the powers of the

Government under <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_11">Section 15(1)</a> to prescribe the above Rule.

</p><p id="p_7">      4. The next question to be considered is whether the impugned

Rule can be declared violative of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_12">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India

by assuming that use of mechanical device to mine sand can affect the

neighbouring owners and also local public. We are of the view that the

apprehension of the learned single Judge is without any merit or basis

because mining is permitted with restrictions to protect the interest of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                    8</span>

the local public, neighbouring owners, etc. In fact, while granting

mining licence,    the licensing authority visits the location of the

mining, neighbours affected, chances of pollution, etc., and impose

such conditions to ensure that no environmental problem is caused and

similarly no damage is caused to the neighbouring owners. In fact,

pollution can be caused on account of mining even when mining is

done without mechanical device. Pollution is an aspect on which

another agency exercises powers on the licence holder.              The

apprehension of pollution expressed by the learned single Judge on

account of mechanised mining in our view is absolutely out of place

and unreal. We therefore do not find that impugned Rule in any way

violates <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_13">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India inasmuch as it does not

permit or justify pollution during mechanised mining. In fact there is

no allegation of pollution caused during mining which takes place in

uninhabited watery land and in any case all aspects of pollution are

dealt with under the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Pollution Control Act</a>, a Central legislation.

</p><p id="p_8">      5. Incidentally we are constrained to observe that the findings in

the judgment are thoroughly unrealistic because it is common

knowledge that mining of sand from land covered by water is possible

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                    9</span>

only by engaging hi-tech machines, pumps, etc. Therefore in our view

it is thoroughly wrong to assume that sand mining can be done without

the aid of mechanical devices. Employment of hi-tech machines in

mining to some extent saves human life as well because human labour

engaged in sand mining in the land covered by water is always at the

risk of land slide and even drowning. We therefore feel that the Rule

authorising mechanical devices for mining helps safety of people also.

Government should certainly ensure proper compliance of mining

conditions by licensees, particularly filling up for mined pit which can

also be done employing mechanical devices.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       Writ Appeals and Writ Petition are consequently allowed by

vacating the judgment of the learned single Judge, and by upholding

the validity of the impugned Rule and declaring the appellants and

petitioner's right to use mechanical devices including pumps for mining

in terms of the licences..
