Y.K. Sabharwal, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	The main question to be examined in these matters is whether the 
mining activity in area upto 5 kilometers from the Delhi-Haryana border on 
the Haryana side of the ridge and also in the Aravalli hills causes 
environment  degradation and what directions are required to be issued.  
The background in which the question has come up for consideration may 
first be noticed.
</p><p id="p_3">The Haryana Pollution Control Board (HPCB) was directed by orders 
of this Court dated 20th November, 1995 to inspect and ascertain the 
impact of mining operation on the Badkal Lake and Surajkund - 
ecologically sensitive area falling within the State of Haryana.  In the report 
that was submitted, it was stated that explosives are being used for rock 
blasting for the purpose of mining;  unscientific mining operation was 
resulting in lying of overburden materials (topsoil and murum remain) 
haphazardly; and deep mining for extracting silica sand lumps is causing 
ecological disaster as these mines lie unreclaimed and abandoned.  It was, 
inter alia, recommended that the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) 
should be prepared by mine lease holders for their mines and actual 
mining operation made operative after obtaining approval from the State 
Departments of Environment or HPCB; the EMP should be implemented 
following a time bound action plan; land reclamation and afforestation 
programmes shall also be included in the EMP and must be implemented 
strictly by the implementing authorities.  The report recommended 
stoppage of mining activities within a radius of 5 kms. from Badkal Lake 
and Surajkund (tourist place).  The Haryana Government, on the basis of 
the recommendations made in the report, stopped mining operations within 
the radius of 5 kms of Badkal Lake and Surajkund.  
The mine operators raised objections to the recommendations of 
stoppage of mining operations.  According to them, pollution, if any, that 
was generated by the mining activities cannot go beyond a distance of 1 
km. and the stoppage was wholly unjustified.
NEERI Report and earlier directions
	By order dated April 12, 1996, the Court sought the expert opinion of 
National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) on the 
point whether the mining operations in the said area are to be stopped in 
the interest of environmental protection, pollution control and tourism 
development and, if so, whether the limit should be 5 kms. or less.  NEERI 
in its inspection report dated 20th April, 1996, inter alia, recommended that:
"6.1 Mining. (1) Detailed exploratory operations 
need to be undertaken to facilitate the estimation 
of reserves in the region, and for scientific 
management of mining operations.
</p><p id="p_4">(2)	The mine lease-owners need to undertake 
the mining operations in series, i.e. mining 
activities must be completed to full potential in a 
block before moving to the next.  This will help in 
reclamation of land in the block in which mining 
operations have been completed.
</p><p id="p_5">(3 to (9) ...
</p><p id="p_6">(10)	The Environmental Management Plans 
(EMP) being formulated by the mine-owners 
should include land rejuvenation and afforestation 
programmes, and other measures necessary to 
protect the quality of the environment and human 
health.  The mining operations should commence 
only after the approval of EMPs by a designated 
authority.  A time-bound action plan needs to be 
initiated for the implementation of the measures 
delineated in the Environmental Management 
Plans.
</p><p id="p_7">(11) &amp; (12) ...
</p><p id="p_8">(13)	The question of lifting the ban on mining 
operations needs to be considered in conjunction 
with the implementation of stringent pollution 
control, land reclamation, green belt, and other 
Environmental Management measures so as to 
facilitate the availability of construction materials 
and employment opportunities for the workers 
along with the protection of environment and 
public health.
</p><p id="p_9">(14)	It is considered necessary to prepare a 
Regional Environmental Management Plan for 
urgent implementation to enable eco-friendly 
regional development in the area."
</p>

<p id="p_10">	On consideration of the reports, this Court came to the conclusion 
that the mining activities in the vicinity of tourist resorts are bound to cast 
serious impact on the local ecology.  The mining brings extensive 
alteration in the natural land profile of the area.  Mined pits and unattended 
dumps of overburdened left behind during the mining operations are the 
irreversible consequences of the mining operations and  rock blasting, 
movement of heavy vehicles, movements and operations of mining 
equipment and machinery cause considerable pollution in the shape of 
noise and vibration.  The ambient air in the mining area gets highly 
polluted by the dust generated by the blasting operations, vehicular 
movement, loading/unloading/transportation and the exhaust gases from 
equipment and machinery used in the mining operations.  It was directed 
that in order to preserve environment and control pollution within the 
vicinity of two tourist resorts, it is necessary to stop mining activity within 2 
kms. radius of the tourist resorts of Badkal Lake and Surajkund.  The Court 
further directed the Director, HPCB to enforce all the recommendations of 
NEERI contained in para 6.1 of its report so far as the mining operations in 
the State of Haryana are concerned.  Further, it was directed that failing to 
comply with the recommendations may result in the closure of the mining 
operations and that the mining leases within the area from 2 kms. to 5 
kms. radius shall not be renewed without obtaining prior no objection 
certificate from the HPCB as also from the Central Pollution Control Board 
(CPCB).  Unless both the Boards grant no objection certificate, the mining 
leases in the said area shall not be renewed.  (<a href="/doc/1964392/" id="a_1">M.C. Mehta v. Union of 
India &amp; Ors</a>. [(1996) 8 SCC 462]).
</p>

<p id="p_11">Present Issues
	The aspects to be examined include the compliance of the 
conditions imposed by the Pollution Boards while granting no objection 
certificate for mining and also compliance of various statutory provisions 
and notifications as also obtaining of the requisite clearances and 
permissions from the concerned authorities before starting the mining 
operations.  
</p><p id="p_12">In matters under consideration, the areas of mining fall within the 
districts of Faridabad and Gurgaon in the Haryana State.  
I.A. No.1785/01 has been filed by the Delhi Ridge Management 
Board praying that the Government of Haryana be directed to stop all 
mining activities and pumping of ground water in and from area upto 5 kms 
from Delhi-Haryana border in the Haryana side of the Ridge, inter alia, 
stating that in the larger interest of maintaining the ecological balance of 
the environment and protecting the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary and the 
ridge located in Delhi and adjoining Haryana, it is necessary to stop 
mining.  In the application, it has been averred that the Asola Bhatti Wildlife 
Sanctuary is located on the southern ridge which is one of the oldest 
mountain ranges of the world and represents the biogeographical outer 
layer of the Aravalli mountain range which is one of the most protected 
areas in the country.  The sanctuary is significant as it is instrumental in 
protecting the green lung of National Capital of Delhi and acts as a carbon 
sink for the industrial and vehicular emissions of the country's capital which 
is witnessing rapid growth in its pollution level each year.  The ridge, it is 
averred, is a potential shelter belt against advancing desertification and 
has been notified a wildlife sanctuary and reserve forest by the 
Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi.  Regarding the mining 
activities, it is averred that for extraction of Badarpur (Silica sand), there is 
large scale mining activity on the Haryana side just adjacent to the wildlife 
sanctuary of the ridge which activities threaten the sanctuaries habitat and 
also pumping of large quantity of ground water from mining pits.  It was 
also stated that the ground water level was being depleted as a result of 
the mining activity.  Further, the query dust that comes out of mining pits is 
a serious health hazard for human population living nearby and also the 
wild animals inhabiting the sanctuary pointing out that the mining and 
extraction of ground water had been banned in National Capital Territory of 
Delhi and the ridge being protected as per the order of this Court, it is 
necessary, that the ridge on the Haryana side is also protected - that being 
the extension of the range and, therefore, mining, withdrawal of ground 
water and destruction of flora, etc. should also be restricted outside Delhi 
or at least upto 5 kms. from Delhi-Haryana border towards Haryana.  
On 6th May, 2002, this Court directed the Chief Secretary, 
Government of Haryana to stop, within 48 hours, all mining activities and 
pumping of ground water in and from an area upto 5kms. from Delhi-
Haryana border in the Haryana side of the ridge and also in the Aravalli 
Hills.  The question to be considered is whether the order shall be made 
absolute or vacated or modified.    
</p><p id="p_13">	Our examination of the issues is confined to the effect on ecology of 
the mining activity carried on within an area of 5 Kms. of Delhi-Haryana 
Border on Haryana side in areas falling within the district of Faridabad and 
Gurgaon and in Aravalli Hills within Gurgaon District.  The question is 
whether the mining activity deserves to be absolutely banned or permitted 
on compliance of stringent conditions and by monitoring it to prevent the 
environmental pollution.
</p><p id="p_14">EPCA Visits
In terms of the order passed by this Court on 22nd July, 2002, 
Environmental Pollution Central Authority (EPCA) was directed to give a 
report with regard to environment in the area preferably after a personal 
visit to the area in question without any advance notice.  It may be noted 
that EPCA was constituted by the Government of India under notification 
dated 29th January, 1998 issued in exercise of power under Section 3(1) &amp; 
(3) of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 (for short, 'the EP Act') Mr. 
Bhure Lal was appointed its Chairman.  The EPCA was constituted with a 
view to protect and improve the quality of environment and preventing, 
controlling and abetting environmental pollution.  EPCA has also the power 
to deal with environment issues pertaining to National Capital Region 
which may be referred to it by the Central Government.  The EPCA has 
jurisdiction over the National Capital Region as defined in clause (f) of 
Section 2 of the National Capital Region Planning Board Act, 1985.  The 
Districts of Gurgaon and Faridabad are part of the National Capital Region, 
under <a href="/doc/184316376/" id="a_3">Section 2(f)</a> read with the Schedule of the said Act.  
The Chairman of the CPCB is a convenor member of EPCA.  EPCA 
made a surprise visit to the area to see the mining sites.  The mining sites 
visited are located in the villages of Anangpur, Pali, Mohabatabad and 
Mangar, which fall within the notified area of 5 km radius from the Delhi 
border in the Faridabad district.  EPCA also visited mining sites that are 
located outside the notified zone in Kot area, EPCA also held consultation 
with the officials of the Central Groundwater Board and obtained their 
opinion on this matter. On August 7, 2002, members of the EPCA visited 
the mining sites located within five km radius from Delhi border.  The 
objectives of the visit, as per EPCA, were as follows :
</p><p id="p_15">1.	Assessment of the level of compliance with 
the conditions laid down in the regulatory 
procedures like the No Objection Certificate 
(NOC) granted by authorities to the mine 
owners;
</p><p id="p_16">2.	Evidence of land and habitat degradation in 
and around the mining sites;
</p><p id="p_17">3.	Evidence of misuse and shortage of ground 
water in the area;
</p><p id="p_18">4.	Assessment of the implication of such 
activities for the local ecology and drinking 
water sources in the area.
</p>
<p id="p_19">During the visit, prima facie, EPCA found evidence of clear violation 
of some of the key conditions of order of this court dated May 10, 1996.
EPCA Ist Report and Recommendations
The EPCA gave its report dated 9th August, 2002.  It would be useful 
to reproduce the said report in extenso as under:
"Anangpur area and its vicinity : EPCA inspected 
the mining sites owned by Mohan Ram and 
Company as well as at least 5 other mining sites 
in this area, which EPCA is not clear who owns.
At the time of visit there was no mining taking 
place.  So EPCA members assessed level of 
compliance with some of the key conditions laid 
down in the NOCs.  There was clear evidence of 
violation of the following conditions.  
i.	The excavated pits should be filled with fly 
ash or municipal solid waste in the bottom 
layers.  The top soil should be used as a top 
layer while filling the pit.  Land reclamation 
and tree plantation should be done in a 
planned manner over the reclaimed mine 
pits.
</p><p id="p_20">ii.	The applicant shall not discharge any 
effluent or groundwater outside their lease 
premises and shall take appropriate 
measures for rainwater harvesting and 
reuse of water so as not to affect adversely 
the ground water table of the area.  No 
mining operation shall be carried out in the 
water table area.
</p><p id="p_21">iii.	The green belt proposed in the environment 
management plan around the proposed 
mining lease area and along the road side 
shall be developed.
</p><p id="p_22">The most serious violation noticed by the EPCA 
was the continuation of mining even after reaching 
the ground water level which has been disallowed 
by the regulatory agencies.  Photographs taken by 
EPCA, which show deep mining pits have turned 
into large lakes of ground water.  In this mining 
lease area EPCA members saw extensive and 
deep water bodies.  The water was blue, 
indicating that this was groundwater and not 
surface water runoff collected in the pits.
Even more serious violation noticed was 
configuration of water pipes laid out to draw water 
out of the pits to throw them over hills and let the 
water flow out.  This is a grave misuse of precious 
ground water in an area where ground water is the 
only source of water for the local population - both 
urban and rural.
</p><p id="p_23">EPCA members talked to local villagers who 
complained that water table in the area has gone 
down over a period of time and that the village is 
facing water shortage.  While earlier ground water 
could be tracked at the depth of 30-35 ft. now 
deep bore wells have been dug to get drinking 
water, in addition, noise and dust pollution from 
the mining sites are a problem.
</p><p id="p_24">Goodwill mine in Pali village : EPCA found similar 
violation of conditions and evidence of mining 
sites reaching the level of ground water in deep 
pits and pipes fitted to drain out water here as 
well.
</p><p id="p_25">During the long drive to various mining sites, 
EPCA could not see any credible sign of green 
belt along the roads.  Moreover, one important 
condition of NOCs is that "a safe distance should 
be maintained from the road to overburden dumps 
and the mine pits in accordance with the 
directions/notifications of the department of 
environment, Haryana and bureau of mines."  But 
EPCA noticed mining sites very close to the roads 
and also very close to the ecologically sensitive 
area of Asola sanctuary near the Goodwill mines.
Stone crushing sites in Pali : EPCA has inspected 
the stone crushing sites in the area.  All sites had 
a lot of material and trucks being loaded.  It is 
difficult to establish if these are the left over 
material from the past or were products from 
banned sites or from sites from outside the notified 
area.  EPCA was informed that after the Hon'ble 
Supreme Court directive of May 2002, the stone 
crushers were not being operated, except 
between the hours of 5 am to 9 am.  EPCA was, 
therefore, unable to verify the working conditions 
of these crushers.  But it did not find any evidence 
of afforestation as stipulated by the NEERI 
directive or any evidence of dust minimizing 
equipment.
</p><p id="p_26">Mining around Mangar village : Again the same 
situation was found around Anangpur.  The 
villagers interviewed here were caught between 
the devastation of the mines, desperate shortage 
of drinking water and the only livelihood option 
that these manual stone quarries provided.
Legal mining in Kot area : As mining is banned 
along the 5 km radius from the Delhi border, 
EPCA also visited some mines that are outside 
the notified area to ascertain the state of the 
environment.  In this  area, surface mining is being 
done and not deep mining.  Therefore, as yet, the 
groundwater reserves are not being touched in 
this region.  The entire area was like a giant dust 
field.  We saw no evidence of any afforestation or 
even dust minimising efforts being undertaken in 
the areas that are being mined.  We did see one 
tanker of water, which was sprinkling the roads, 
unable to stop the dust from swirling.  EPCA could 
not see any protection for the workers from dust.  
As this area will clearly emerge as a major mining 
in the future, it is important that the mining area is 
properly demarcated and environment 
management plan implemented to enable 
scientific mining to minimize degradation of the 
environment.
</p><p id="p_27">Faridabad-Gurgaon road : EPCA saw mining 
alongside the road.  Though the mines were 
closed because of the Hon'ble court directive, 
EPCA saw vast pits and mining activity in this 
area.  This is the road for the proposed bypass 
from Delhi.
</p><p id="p_28">3.	The present laws and regulations in the 
area
We have assessed the current applicable laws 
and regulations in the area, which govern land use 
and mining so as to understand what efforts have 
been made by different agencies to ensure 
compliance.
</p><p id="p_29">?	In may 1992, parts of the Aravalli range 
were declared ecologically sensitive under 
the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment (Protection) Act</a>.  Under 
this notification, certain activities - including 
all new mining operations, including 
renewals of mining leases - are restricted 
and permission has to be sought from the 
Ministry of Environment and Forests.  This 
notification is valid for reserved forests in 
the districts of Gurgaon in Haryana and 
Alwar in Rajasthan.
</p><p id="p_30">?	In August 1992, the Forest Department of 
Haryana had issued a notification under the 
Punjab Land Preservation Act 1900, 
banning the clearing and breaking up the 
land not under cultivation, quarrying of 
stone... in the Badkal area without prior 
permission of the forest department.  This 
ban was for 30 years.  Earlier it had already 
issued a similar notification for the Pali area 
for 25 years.
</p><p id="p_31">?	In 1996, the Hon'ble Supreme Court banned 
all mining activity within 2 kms of the Badkal 
and Surajkund tourist resorts.
</p><p id="p_32">?	In the same order, it ordered that mining 
leases within the area from 2 km to 5 km 
radius shall not be renewed without 
obtaining no-objection certificates from the 
Haryana Pollution Control Board as also the 
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).  It 
stipulated that "unless both the boards grant 
no objection certificate, the mining leases in 
the said area shall not be renewed".
</p><p id="p_33">?	Mining in the 2-5 kms was allowed under 
condition that there would be strict 
adherence to the environment management 
plan laid down by the NEERI.  It has to be 
noted here that the CPCB had in its report 
to the Hon'ble Court in 1996 stated that the 
"deep mining for silica is causing an 
ecological disaster".  CPCB has 
recommended that mining activity "should 
be stopped within a radius of 5 kms from 
Badkal and Surajkund.  The subsequent 
report of NEERI dated 20.4.1996, 
recommended green belt at 1 km radius all 
around the boundaries of the two lakes.  On 
this basis, the Hon'ble Court directed that 
radius be extended to 2 kms for a green belt 
and to cushion the impacts of air and noise 
pollution.
</p><p id="p_34">?	The Hon'ble Court in its order asked the 
agencies to ensure enforcement of the 
recommendations of NEERI.  It directed that 
"failure to comply with the recommendations 
may result in the closure of the mining 
operations."
</p><p id="p_35">4.	Compliance and enforcement : absent and 
missing
To discuss the future strategy for this area, it 
would be important to assess the track-record of 
the different agencies in ensuring that the previous 
orders and directives are enforced and complied 
with.
</p><p id="p_36">1.	No mining within 2 kms of Badkal and 
Surajkund : Probably enforced.  But difficult 
to assess as the area is hilly.
</p><p id="p_37">2.	Mining within 2-5 kms should get permission 
from Haryana Pollution Control Board and 
CPCB.  The CPCB has issued 2 NOCs, 
dated December 20, 2001 and May 6, 2002.  
No further record has been found of NOCs 
given for mining in this area.  EPCA has not 
been able to find the NOCs granted by the 
Haryana Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_65">No evidence.  
</p><p id="p_66">Groundwater board has 
not given any clearance 
that we could ascertain.
</p><p id="p_67">From the above, it is clear that little or nothing has 
been done to seriously comply with the directives 
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as to 
enforce the regulations and conditions laid down 
by the authorities for environmental management 
of the mining areas.
</p><p id="p_68">5.	Impact on groundwater reserves
It has been argued by the Government of Haryana 
in its IA no.1785 of 2001 that the expert committee 
constituted by it under the Chairmanship of the 
principal conservator of forests has submitted that 
there is a water divide between the two 
boundaries of the two states which prevents the 
flow of water from Delhi side to Haryana side.  It 
has, therefore, argued that the mining on the 
Haryana side is not affecting the water balance in 
the Delhi side of the ridge.
</p><p id="p_69">It has further said that only in four pits the 
groundwater was pumped regularly and in two pits 
occasionally.  Therefore, it has argued that little or 
no impact on groundwater reserves is possible.
5.1	Groundwater Board
EPCA requested the Central Ground Water Board 
(CGWB) for its opinion.  The Board has based its 
recommendations on the data available with it as 
well as a field survey.  
</p><p id="p_70">The key issues are :
</p><p id="p_71">1.	On the issue of the ridge providing a water 
divide between the two states, the CGWB 
has maintained that while the surface water 
divide follows the Delhi-Haryana border, 
except in the catchment of Bhuria Nala, `the 
surface water divide may not be the 
groundwater divide in the strict sense due to 
secondary porosity and also flat topped 
nature of the hills.'  It also states that the 
Aravalli hills are highly fractured, jointed and 
weathered making the major recharge zone 
for the surrounding areas.
</p><p id="p_72">2.	On the impact on the groundwater reserves 
due to mining, the Board has found that its 
observation wells have shown an increase 
in groundwater levels in Anangpur, Mangar, 
after the mining has been stopped in May.  
Therefore, in spite of monsoon failure and 
continued abstraction of water, the 
observation wells have noted increased 
water levels within just 2 months of the 
mining being closed.
</p><p id="p_73">The groundwater levels in a tube well 
monitored in Mewla Maharajpur during mid 
July and first week of August showed a rise of 
0.18 metres, A higher rise - 0.71 to 0.78 metres 
was observed in the two tube wells near the 
Mangar mines and Pali mines in the two 
months since the mines were closed.  This 
clearly points to the impact of mining on 
groundwater reserves.
</p><p id="p_74">This fact was also confirmed in the interviews 
done by EPCA at site.
</p><p id="p_75">3.	CGWB also notes that contrary to what has 
been claimed, the mined water is not being 
pumped into abandoned pits to recharge the 
groundwater.  Instead the groundwater 
pumped is discharged into the surrounding 
nalas, leading to "wastage" of groundwater.  
For instance, in the case of Anangpur 
mines, the water was pumped into the 
Bhuria Nala and in the case of Pali, the 
groundwater was discharged into a nala to 
the Badkal lake and from Manger mine 
towards Dhauj lake causing "enormous 
losses to groundwater resources of the 
area".  The mined water is also full of silt, 
which reduces recharge as well.
</p><p id="p_76">4.	Furthermore, CGWB notes that the large 
surface lakes in the mines are leading to 
huge losses of groundwater through 
evaporation.
</p><p id="p_77">5.	The Central Ground Water Authority 
(CGWA) has notified these areas - South 
district of NCT Delhi, Faridabad, 
Ballabhgarh Municipal Corporation area, 
Gurgaon town as water stressed areas and 
has put regulatory measures on ground 
water development in these areas.
</p><p id="p_78">Given all this, CGWB concludes that the 
"dewartering of mines in the Aravalli hills has 
affected groundwater regimes of the mine area as 
well as buffer zone resulting in the depletion of 
ground water resources."
</p><p id="p_79">5.2	Compliance with groundwater related 
regulations
The NOC given by the Central Pollution Control 
Board, includes an explicit condition regarding 
ground water :
</p><p id="p_80">	That the mine owner will ensure that there is 
no discharge of effluent of ground water 
outside lease premises.  They must take 
measures for rain water harvesting and 
reuse of water so as not to affect the 
groundwater table in the areas.  Most 
importantly, it stipulates that no mining 
operations shall be carried out in the water 
table area.
</p><p id="p_81">This condition has been grossly violated.  Even 
the Haryana government's affidavit in court 
accepts that pumping of ground water is taking 
place, though it attempts to soften the issue by 
arguing that it is only being done in a few cases.
Under this condition, mining is not allowed in the 
water table area.  EPCA saw deep and extensive 
pits of mines with vast water bodies.  EPCA also 
saw evidence of pumps and pipes being used to 
drain out the ground water so that mining could 
continue.  Therefore, the miners are mining for 
silica, but also in the process, mining and 
destroying the ground water reserves of the areas.
In times of such water stress and desperation, this 
water mining is nothing less than a gross act of 
wastage of a key resource.  This time the stress 
has been further aggravated by the failure of 
monsoon.  Notices have been issued in the 
nearby housing colonies stating that fall in 
groundwater table due to lack of rains is 
responsible for water shortage in the area this 
season.  This only indicates how important it is to 
conserve ground water in the region for long term 
sustainability of drinking water sources.  Ground 
water is the only source of drinking water here."
</p>
<p id="p_82">	On the basis of study and visit as well as the report of the Central 
Ground Water Board, EPCA made the following recommendations :
"1.	The ban on the mining activities and 
pumping of ground water in and from an 
area upto 5 kms. from the Delhi-Haryana 
border in the Haryana side of the ridge and 
also in the Aravalli Hill must be maintained.
</p><p id="p_83">2.	Not only must further degradation be halted 
but, all efforts must be made to ensure that 
the local economy is rejuvenated, with the 
use of plantations and local water 
harvesting based opportunities.  It is indeed 
sad to note the plight of people living in 
these hills who are caught between losing 
their water dependent livelihood and 
between losing their only desperate 
livelihood to break stones in the quarries.  It 
is essential that the Government of Haryana 
seriously implements programmes to 
enhance the land based livelihood of people 
? agriculture, animal care and forestry.  
Local people must not be thrown into 
making false choices, which may secure 
their present but will destroy their future.  
Already, all the villages visited by EPCA 
complained of dire and desperate shortages 
of drinking water.  Women talked about long 
queues before taps to collect water.  
</p><p id="p_84">Clearly, water resources of the region are 
critical inputs to development and cannot be 
wasted and destroyed like this.  The state 
government must come up with strategies to 
involve local communities in the future 
development of this region.
</p><p id="p_85">	We have been given to understand that 
under the mining lease, 10 per cent of the 
royalty is to be given to local villagers.  We 
have also understood that the turnover is of 
the mining operations in this area is 
substantial ? between Rs.50 lakhs to Rs. 1 
crore a day were the gross estimates 
provided to us.  However, we do not have 
any estimate of the money that has been 
given to villagers from this revenue.  But 
there was little evidence in these poor and 
destitute villages that any effort had been 
made to share the proceeds with them.
</p><p id="p_86">3.	The Central Ground Water Board must be 
consulted urgently about what should be 
done with the huge standing water in the 
area.  This is a valuable national resource 
and the Board should be asked if the water 
is best conserved by covering it to stop 
evaporation or should it be used for 
recharge and storage with further water 
harvesting efforts.
</p><p id="p_87">4.	The Ministry of Environment and Forests 
(MOEF) should be asked to extend the 
notification under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">Environment 
(Protection) Act</a> to the Faridabad part of the 
Aravalli and ridge as well.  Currently, the 
notification is only for Gurgaon district.  This 
notification declaring it an ecologically 
sensitive area will help to regulate the 
activities in this region.
</p><p id="p_88">5.	It is not clear to us if adequate planning for 
water is being done in the large scale 
construction activities being undertaken in 
this area.  This aspect is outside the 
purview of this report but needs to be 
examined carefully.
</p><p id="p_89">6.	It must also be noted that Gurgaon-
</p><p id="p_90">Faridabad road is being proposed as the 
major bypass for the city of Delhi.  The 
Hon'ble Court will note its directives on the 
air pollution case in this regard.  It has been 
said to the court in that matter that the 
Government of Haryana is intending to 
widen the road and bids have even been 
issued to this effect.  Therefore, it is all the 
more important that the mining activity along 
the road must not be allowed.  The 5 kms. 
</p><p id="p_91">ban from the border of Delhi will take care of 
this requirement.
</p><p id="p_92">7.	EPCA would also recommend that the 
mining area outside the 5 kms. area must 
be demarcated and regulated.  In this 
context, EPCA would like to draw the 
attention of the court to the violations and 
gross disregard for regulations found in the 
present mines.  It is not out of place to 
mention that these mines are owned by very 
powerful and highly placed individuals in the 
establishment.  In a related case the High 
Court of Punjab and Haryana has directed 
on 20.4.2001 a CBI enquiry on the basis of 
a public interest litigation filed by a 
journalist.  In its order the Hon'ble Court 
maintained that its examination has found 
evidence that illegal mining operations are 
going on in the area.  The Hon'ble Court 
also noted the bias of the State Government 
to shield the offenders and has said that 
because there is prima facie evidence of the 
involvement of a `person who holds the high 
position of the cabinet minister in the state', 
the enquiry should be done by CBI.  This 
enquiry is still ongoing.
</p><p id="p_93">	During the examination of the case, EPCA 
was told of other persons involved in the 
mining activity who are highly influential and 
part of the ruling political parties in the state 
and Centre.
</p><p id="p_94">	In this respect, EPCA would recommend  
that tighter and constant monitoring of the 
area must be done by a Central 
Government agency.  To increase 
accountability, EPCA would also 
recommend that the environment 
management plan (EMP) for the mining 
area as well as the conditions of the NOC 
should be made a public document.  All 
other subsequent monitoring reports of this 
region must be available publicly, preferably 
on the website of the monitoring agency."
</p>
<p id="p_95">	With the report, a note given by the Chairmen, Central Ground 
Water Board on impact of pumping of ground water from mines and 
ground water regime in mining area and its buffer zone in Aravalli hills of 
NCT Delhi, Faridabad and Gurgaon Districts of Haryana was also 
annexed.  The said note reads as under :
</p><p id="p_96">Based on available data with Central Ground 
Water Board and a quick survey in and around 
mining area in Aravalli hills, following observations 
are made -
</p><p id="p_97">"1.	The area under consideration forms part of 
Aravalli range from where mining of silica-
sand and other construction material was 
being carried out.  The mining of silica sand 
was mainly carried out below water table by 
dewatering the mines whereas mining for 
other construction material is carried out 
above water table.  The major mining areas 
are Anangpur, Pali, Manger and 
Mohabbatabad.
</p><p id="p_98">2.	The surface water divide in the area 
approximately follows Delhi-Haryana 
boarder except the catchment of Bhuria 
Nala flowing in Haryana State, which 
extends in Asola area of Delhi State also.  
The formations in the Aravalli hills are highly 
fractured, jointed and weathered making it 
the major recharge zone for the surrounding 
areas.  The surface water divide may not be 
ground water divide in strict sense due to 
secondary porosity and also flat-topped 
nature of the hills.
</p><p id="p_99">3.	The pumping of ground water during mining 
of Silica sand affects ground water regime 
of surrounding area.  During the field visit, it 
was reported by local people that during the 
dewatering of mines there was decline in 
ground water levels and reduction in 
discharge in surrounding wells whereas 
after stoppage of pumping the rise in water 
levels and increase in discharge has been 
reported.  In few observation wells on down 
stream side of mines rise in ground water 
levels has been observed in Anangpur, 
Manger and villages after stoppage of 
abstraction of ground water from deep 
mines.  The ground water levels in a tube 
well monitored in Mewla Maharajpur during 
mid July 2002 and first week of August 2002 
were 24.39 and 24.57 m. below ground 
level respectively, showing a rise of 0.18 m. 
Ground water levels in tube well located at 
temple near Manger mine in second week 
of July 2002 and first week of August, 2002 
were 51.70 and 49.99. m. below ground 
level respectively showing a rise of 0.71 m.  
Similarly, ground water level in a tube well 
at Indernagar in Delhi area near Pali mine in 
third week of June 2002 and first week of 
August 2002 were 59.68 and 58.90 m. 
</p><p id="p_100">below ground level respectively showing a 
rise of 0.78 m.  The stoppage of dewatering 
of mines has resulted in rise of ground 
water levels in surrounding areas.
</p><p id="p_101">4.	It has been observed that drainage pattern 
of the area has been modified due to 
haphazard mining and dumping of waste 
material which has bearing on natural path 
of ground water flow in the area.
</p><p id="p_102">5.	It is claimed that abandoned pits act as 
recharge pits and in some cases the 
pumped ground water is put in these pits so 
there may not be substantial modification in 
the conditions of ground water regime.  All 
the ground water pumped out from 
Anangpur mine has not been put into 
abandoned adjoining pits resulting in 
wastage of ground water by discharge into 
Bhuria Nala.  Observation have indicated 
that Bhuria Nala which was ephemeral 
stream became a perennial stream during 
mining operations and now flow has 
stopped after closure of mining activity.  
Similarly, pumped out ground water from 
Pali mine was being discharged in a 
easterly  flowing  nala  to  Badkal  Lane and 
          from Manger mine in a south westerly 
flowing nala towards Dhauj lake causing 
enormous losses to ground water resources 
of the area.  Further, the pumped out water 
cannot be recharged effectively due to its 
high silt content.  In silica sand mines the 
water table has been intersected and in 
presently exposed to the atmosphere 
causing huge losses to ground water 
through evaporation.
</p><p id="p_103">6.	Studies conducted by Central Ground Water 
Board have revealed that water levels in 
Faridabad new town which falls in buffer 
zone of mine area have declined by 1.44 
m/year.  The decline of ground water level 
in the towns has been attributed to over 
development of ground water for domestic 
and industrial uses which is totally 
dependent on ground water.  The pumping 
out of ground water for mining of silica sand 
in recharge zone might have aggravated the 
declining trend of ground water levels which 
otherwise would have contributed to the 
buffer zone.
</p><p id="p_104">7.	Central Ground Water Authority has notified 
South district of NCT Delhi and Faridabad 
and Ballabhgarh Municipal  
Corporation area and Gurgaon town and 
adjoining industrial area in August 2000, 
October 1998 and December 2000 
respectively mainly on consideration of over 
development of ground water resources 
resulting in substantial decline in ground 
water levels.  Regulatory measures on 
ground water development have been 
imposed in these areas.
</p><p id="p_105">8.	Therefore, it is observed that dewatering of 
mines in Aravalli hills has affected ground 
water regime of the mine area as well as 
buffer zone resulting in depletion of ground 
water resources."
</p><p id="p_106">	When the aforesaid report came up for consideration, some of the 
mine owners submitted that their mines had not been inspected by Bhure 
Lal Committee.  Particulars of the mines that were stated to have not been 
inspected were filed on 23rd September, 2002.  Bhure Lal Committee was 
requested to carry out the inspection of the said areas/mines.  The 
Committee was also permitted to associate such other organizations or 
persons as it may deem fit and proper for the purpose of inspection.
EPCA 2nd Report and Recommendations
	In terms of the aforesaid order, 26 mines were inspected and report 
dated 21st October, 2002 was submitted.  The observations made as a 
request of inspection in regard to each mine are as follows :

The mining pit here has tuned into a huge 
groundwater lake, Groundwater is fully exposed.  
Extensive oberburden could be seen near the pits.  
It was very evident that no major efforts were 
made to create plantation in the area.  Some new 
and young saplings could be seen along side the 
paths leading to the pits.  Clearly these were 
planted very recently.

</p>
<p id="p_195">	In respect of the ground water regime the report states that :
"The key issue to examine is the impact of mining 
on the ground water regime in the region.  It is 
evident from the inspection done by EPCA that 
ground water reserves are being exploited and 
destroyed, it must be stressed that it is not a 
matter of individual mines reaching ground water 
levels or not, the issue to examine is the water 
regime of the entire area."  
</p>

<p id="p_196">The report further states that "during its inspection to the mines, 
Kartar Singh Badana, Minister of Cooperatives in the State and also a 
mine owner told EPCA members that the impact of ground water 
abstraction is minimal.  He maintained that the miners were harvesting the 
water and not allowing it to flow to the Yamuna, where it would be lost to 
the State.  A perusal of the reports of the ground water regime shows that 
this contention cannot be upheld."
</p><p id="p_197">It is also stated in the report that "the geology and geomorphology of 
the area comprises oldest exposed lithology with upland units.  The rock 
type is mainly quartzite and these rise 150-200 metres above ground level 
in the quartzite's the ground water aquifers occur in the weathered zones 
and interspaces within interconnected joints and fractures.  According to 
the CGWB, the unconfined aquifer is about 50 metres thick.  But between 
the 50-110 metre below ground level (bgi) a thick clay layer ranging in 
thickness from 25-60 metres separates the top unconfined aquifer from 
the confined aquifer.
</p><p id="p_198">The mines inspected by EPCA were below 150 feet (45 metres) and 
on checking it was found that most mines were further operating at 20-100 
feet (6-30 metres) below water levels.  This means that the mines are 
abstracting water from the confined aquifer.  As annual rainfall mostly 
replenishes the unconfined or top aquifer levels, the mining activity is 
destroying a non-renewable resource.  EPCA saw deep and extensive pits 
of mines with vast waterbodies ? stretching at times to a kilometer and 
more.  EPCA also saw evidence of pumps and pipes being used to drain 
out the ground water so that mining could continue.  Therefore, the miners 
are mining for silica, but also in the process mining and destroying the 
ground water reserves of the areas.
</p><p id="p_199">The NOC given by the Central Pollution Control Board includes an 
explicit condition regarding ground water :
"That the mine owner will ensure that there is no 
discharge of effluent or ground water outside 
lease premises.  They must take measures for 
rain water harvesting and reuse of water so as not 
to affect the ground water table in the areas.  Most 
importantly, it stipulates that there should be no 
mining operations shall be carried out in the water 
table area."
</p>
<p id="p_200">The report of the Central Ground Water Board states very 
categorically that the ground water table is already at a critical stage in 
Faridabad.  It states, `The stage of ground water development of 
Faridabad block is 89.02 percent in dark category and no further 
abstraction of ground water should be carried out to avoid any adverse 
environment impact on ground water regimes.  Thus no additional tube 
wells are advisable to be constructed for community water supply scheme 
even though they may not affect the storage in Badkhal lake.'  The report 
further states that `The domestic water supply to Faridabad town has to be 
catered and there are no surface water source which can be tapped.'
EPCA further observes that most of the mining is happening inside 
the municipal area of Faridabad.  In fact, Department of Mines and 
Geology states in the letter dated October 12, 2002, `it is submitted that 
the mineral rights of the mines vests with the State Government....The 
surface rights of villages Badkhal, Pali, Gothra, Mohabtabad, Anangpur, 
Mewla Maharajpur are with municipal corporation, Faridabad, and 
Manager revenue estate are with gram panchayat.'
Sensitivity of this region is further accentuated by its close proximity 
to the reserved forests of Asola sanctuary located at the border of Delhi 
and Haryana and other ecologically sensitive areas like Surajkund and 
Badkhal lake.
</p><p id="p_201">Even in Gurgaon, the CGWB report indicates that the ground water 
scenario is grim.  According to CGWB, the `ground water development of 
Guirgaon block is 124 per cent, indicating that the entire block in which 
Gurgaon town is situated is over exploited.'  The ground water levels are 
also falling dangerously according to the report of CGWB which 
recommends strict regulatory measures for ground water use.
	The EPCA, while reaffirming the recommendations that had been 
made in its earlier report dated 9th August, 2002, made the following 
recommendations :
</p><p id="p_202">"The overall assessment of the environmental 
impact of the mining activities in the area 
especially its implication for ground water level in 
the region reaffirms EPCA's assessment 
presented in its earlier report.  EPCA upholds its 
earlier recommendations made vide the report 
submitted to the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 
August 9, 2002.
</p><p id="p_203">EPCA is concerned that if mining is allowed to 
continue in this area, it will have serious 
implications for the groundwater reserve which is 
the only source of drinking water in the area.  
EPCA has also noticed uncontrolled construction 
activities that will expand urban habitation 
considerably in future.  Unless immediate 
measures are taken to conserve and augment 
water resources in the area acute survival crisis is 
expected.  Interviews with local villagers in the 
vicinity of mines confirm that water shortage is 
already a serious problem in the region.
The extent of degradation in and around mines is 
the evidence of failure to enforce basic rules for 
ecological safeguards.  Recent attempts at 
planting trees are cosmetic.  Exposed ground 
water lakes observed in mining sites only 
reconfirms the worst fears.  If mining could not be 
stopped in so many pits even after reaching 
groundwater level there is no guarantee that even 
some of those mines still at the surface level will 
abide by the stipulated norms when they reach the 
water table."

Notification of 27th January, 1994 Regarding Environment Impact 
Assessment (EIA)

	Another notification which is of considerable importance on aspect of 
mining is dated 27th January, 1994, as amended on 4th May, 1994.  The 
notification has been issued by Ministry of Environment and Forest, 
Government of India, in exercise of powers conferred by sub-section (1) 
and clause (5) of sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the EP Act read with 
clause (d) of sub-rule (3) of Rule 6 of the EP Rules stipulating that 
expansion or modernization of any activity (if the pollution load is to exceed 
the  existing one) or a new project listed in Schedule I of the notification 
shall not be undertaken in any part of India unless it has been accorded 
environmental clearance by the Central Government in accordance with 
the procedure specified in the notification.  
The issue in these matters is about the interpretation of the 
notification, its applicability also to mining leases granted earlier to the 
issue of the notification i.e. at the time of the renewal of such mining lease.  
The notification dated 27th January, 1994, to the extent material for the 
present purpose, reads as under :
</p><p id="p_236">"S.O.60(E) Whereas a notification under clause

publication of the said notification, against the 
intention of the Central Government to impose 
restrictions and prohibitions on the expansion and 
modernization of any activity or new projects being 
undertaken in any part of India unless 
environmental clearance has been accorded by 
the Central Government or the State Government 
in accordance with the procedure specified in that 
notification was published as S.O. No.80(E) dated

</p>
<p id="p_292">	Reference may also be made to a notification issued by the Haryana 
Government on November 28, 2001 with a view to enforce the 
recommendations of NEERI contained in para 6.1 of its report so far as 
mining operations in the State of Haryana are concerned.  In terms of the 
notification, the Designated Authority and the Monitoring Committee were 
directed to impose the conditions mentioned in the notification while 
according environmental clearance.  This notification, it seems, was issued 
in the purported attempt to comply with the directions of this Court as 
contained in the order dated 10th May, 1996 as reported in M.C. Mehta's 
case (supra).
</p><p id="p_293">We may also refer to the circular dated May 14, 2002 issued by the 
Ministry of Environment and Forest noticing that in the past several units 
had come up in violation of the notification dated 27th January, 1994 and a 
view had been taken earlier that such units are permitted to apply for 
environment clearance by 31st March, 1999.  For period of five years, there 
was no circular or notification granting any time to apply for EIA under 
notification dated 27th January, 1994.  The period to apply for environment 
clearance was extended upto 30th June, 2001 which deadline was 
extended upto 31st March, 2003, stating that it was to give opportunity to 
defaulting units to avail of the last and final opportunity to obtain ex post 
facto environment clearance.  The notification dated 27th January, 1994 is 
applicable also to construction activity.  It seems that this circular was 
issued to give opportunity to those who had undertaken constructions after 
issue of notification without compliance of stipulations therein.  We are, 
however, not concerned in these matters with the construction which may 
have come up in breach of the notification.  It does not appear that MOEF 
intended to legalise the commencement or continuance of mining activity 
without compliance of stipulations of the notification.  In any case, a 
statutory notification cannot be notified by issue of circular.  Further, if 
MOEF intended to apply this circular also to mining activity commenced 
and continued in violation of this notification, it would also show total non-
sensitivity of MOEF to the principles of sustainable development and the 
object behind the issue of notification.  The circular has no applicability to 
the mining activity.
</p><p id="p_294">Central Empowered Committee (CEC) - Its Suggestions
	The notification dated 27th January, 1994 is mandatory.  The 
compliance of the notification before commencement of any mining 
operation is essential and cannot be dispensed with.  The MOEF has not 
so far conducted Environment Impact Assessment in respect of any of the 
mining lease under the notification dated 27th January, 1994.  
Before the order dated 6th May, 2002 was passed, the lease holders 
had not made any application before the Ministry for grant of EIA.  The 
applications were filed during the pendency of these matters under the 
order of this Court.  The EIA applications of the lease holders are lying with 
CEC.  CEC was constituted in terms of notification dated 17th September, 
2002, issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Environment and 
Forest in exercise of power conferred by Section 3(3) of the EP Act for the 
purposes of monitoring and ensuring compliance of the order of this Court 
covering the subject matter of forest and wildlife and related issues arising 
out of the said order and one of the functions of the Committee in terms of 
the notification is to monitor the implementation of the orders of this Court 
and place reports of non-compliance before the Court including in respect 
of encroachment and removals, working plans, compensatory 
afforestation, plantations and other conservation issues.
In the order dated 31st October, 2002, this Court has observed that 
no mining activity can be carried out without remedial measures taking 
place and for this purpose, it is necessary that environment impact 
assessment is done and the applications dealt with before any mining 
activity can be permitted.  It was also observed that the application of lease 
holders for environmental clearance can be disposed of them of within a 
period to be specified by this Court.  In terms of order dated 25th 
November, 2002, the Central Empowered Committee was asked to file its 
suggestions in regard to the time for considering the applications for grant 
of EIA.  The CEC had received large number of voluminous Environment 
Impact Assessment plans only in the last few days which are being 
examined further stating that the process of examination and formulation of 
suggestions is likely to take some more time.  On 24th  January, 2003, the 
CEC was granted time to file its report upto 8th February, 2003.  CEC has 
filed three reports, the last having been filed on 7th February, 2003.
</p>	
<p id="p_295">In an interim report dated 22nd June, 2003 CEC stated that the 
complete information had not been supplied to it by the State of Haryana.  
The report states that as per the information provided by the Haryana 
State, in Faridabad district there are 21 sanctioned major mineral mines 
with the varying size from 44.48 hectare to 516.518 hectare.  In Gurgaon 
districts  54 mining leases have been sanctioned varying in size from 5.96 
hectare to 802.322 hectare.  All the mines of major minerals were 
operating in Faridabad district without obtaining statutory environmental 
clearance under the EP Act.  It also noticed that in respect of the Aravalli 
Hills range being an acknowledged as eco friendly area under the Aravalli 
notification, clearances were being granted on the basis of examination of 
an expert group without any public hearing or participation of NGOs or the 
affected people.  As already noticed, the delegation in favour of the State 
has been now withdrawn.  The report further observes that most of the 
mines are operating in violation of approved plans.  Instead of doing 
section wise mining (bench mining) the mining operations are carried on 
unscientifically with the sole aim to make maximum profits which has 
resulted in number of fatal accidents involving labourers, hazards to the 
adjoining  population, indiscriminate scattering of the over burden, wasteful 
manner of mining with complete disregard to mineral conservation aspect, 
rendering reclamation of mined area impossible.  Further it points out that 
several mining leases have been granted in areas where plantations were 
undertaken with the financial assistance provided by international donor 
agencies.  Mining activities are permitted in a manner which is destroying 
the ground water table and also the deep aquifers thereby causing 
irreparable damage to the critical ground water reserves.  There is no 
effective mechanism to ensure compliance of various conditions stipulated 
while granting statutory approvals.  No deterrent action was taken against 
mines even in those cases where during monitoring serious violations and 
non compliance of conditions were found.  The CEC has made the 
following suggestions :
</p><p id="p_296">"I)	For major mineral mines above 5 hectare in 
Faridabad district, mining activity may be 
allowed to be undertaken only after the 
required environmental clearances are 
accorded by the Ministry of Environment 
and Forest (MOEF); 
</p><p id="p_297">ii)	the powers delegated to the State 
Government by notification dated 27.1.1997 
to grant environmental clearances in 
respect of areas of Gurgaon district falling 
within Aravalli notification dated 7.5.1992 
requires to be reconsidered as the 
presumptions on the basis of which powers 
were delegated to the State Government 
have been found to be incorrect;
</p><p id="p_298">iii)	mining activity may be allowed in respect of 
areas notified under Section 4 and 5 of the 
PLP Act, which for the purpose of FC Act 
are `forest' even as per the State 
Government records, only after obtaining 
prior approval under the said Act from the 
MOEF;
</p><p id="p_299">iv)	all mining leases granted in respect of areas 
where plantations have been raised under 
the financial assistance received from any 
international donor agencies may be 
cancelled forthwith.  The concerned 
authorities may be prohibited from allowing 
any mining operations, allowing renewals or 
grants of fresh leases in such areas;
</p><p id="p_300">v)	mining activity may be allowed only as per

leases are for extraction of major mineral, some for extraction of minor 
mineral and some for extraction of both major and minor mineral.  In 
respect of none of the leases, before commencement of mining activity, 
EIA was obtained from the MOEF.  In respect of mining in Aravalli Hills in

State Government after the powers were delegated to it.  The delegation in 
favour of the State has since been withdrawn.  
Legal Parameters
The natural sources of air, water and soil cannot be utilized if the 
utilization results in irreversible damage to environments.  There has been 
accelerated degradation of environment primarily on account of lack of 
effective enforcement of environmental laws and non-compliance of the 
statutory norms.  This Court has repeatedly said that the right to live is a 
fundamental right under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_18">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and it includes the 
right to of enjoyment of pollution-free water and air for full enjoyment of life.  
(<a href="/doc/1646284/" id="a_19">See Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar</a> [AIR 1991 SC 420].
Further, by 42nd Constitutional Amendment, <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_20">Article 48-A</a> was 
inserted in the Constitution in Part IV stipulating that the State shall 
endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the 
forest and wildlife of the country.  <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_21">Article 51A</a>, inter alia, provides that it 
shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural 
environment including forest, lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have 
compassion for living creatures.  <a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_22">Article 47</a> which provides that it shall be 
the duty of the State to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living 
and to improve public health is also relevant in this connection.  The most 
vital necessities, namely, air, water and soil, having regard to right of life 
under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_23">Article 21</a> cannot be permitted to be misused and polluted so as to 
reduce the quality of life of others.  Having regard to the right of the 
community at large it is permissible to encourage the participation of 
Amicus Curiae, the appointment of experts and the appointments of 
monitory committees.  The approach of the Court has to be liberal towards 
ensuring social justice and protection of human rights.  <a href="/doc/1964392/" id="a_24">In M.C. Mehta v. 
Union of India</a> [(1987) 4 SCC 463], this Court held that life, public health 
and ecology has priority over unemployment and loss of revenue.  The 
definition of 'sustainable development' which Brundtland gave more than 3 
decades back still holds good.  The phrase covers the development that 
meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the 
future generation to meet their own needs.  <a href="/doc/1938608/" id="a_25">In Narmada Bachao Andolan 
v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. [(2000) 10 SCC 664], this Court observed that 
sustainable development means the type or extent of development that 
can take place and which can be sustained by nature/ecology with or 
without mitigation.  In these matters, the required standard now is that the 
risk of harm to the environment or to human health is to be decided in 
public interest, according to a "reasonable person's " test.  [See Chairman 
Barton : The Status of the Precautionary Principle in Australia : (Vol. 22) 
(1998) (Harv. Envtt. Law Review, p. 509 at p.549-A) as in <a href="/doc/764031/" id="a_26">AP Pollution 
Control Board vs. Prof. M.V. Nayuder (Retd) &amp; Ors</a>. [(1999) 2 SCC 
718].
</p><p id="p_334">	The mining operation is hazardous in nature.  It impairs ecology and 
people's right of natural resources.  The entire process of setting up and 
functioning of mining operation require utmost good faith and honesty on 
the part of the intending entrepreneur. For carrying on any mining activity 
close to township which has tendency to degrade environment and are 
likely to effect air, water and soil and impair the quality of life of inhabitants 
of the area, there would be greater responsibility on the part of the 
entrepreneur.  The fullest disclosures including the potential for increased 
burdens on the environment consequent upon possible increase in the 
quantum and degree of pollution, has to be made at the outset so that 
public and all those concerned including authorities may decide whether 
the permission can at all be granted for carrying on mining activity.  The 
regulatory authorities have to act with utmost care in ensuring compliance 
of safeguards, norms and standards to be observed by such 
entrepreneurs.  When questioned, the regulatory authorities have to show 
that the said authorities acted in the manner enjoined upon them.  Where 
the regulatory authorities, either connive or act negligently by not taking 
prompt action to prevent, avoid or control the damage to environment, 
natural resources and peoples' life, health and property, the principles of 
accountability for restoration and compensation have to be applied.  
	The development and the protection of environments are not 
enemies.  If without degrading the environment or minimising adverse 
effects thereupon by applying stringent safeguards, it is possible to carry 
on development activity applying the principles of sustainable 
development, in that eventuality, the development has to go on because 
one cannot lose sight of the need for development of industries, irrigation 
resources and power projects etc. including the need to improve 
employment opportunities and the generation of revenue.  A balance has 
to be struck.  We may note that to stall fast the depletion of forest, series of 
orders have been passed by this Court in T.N. Godavarman's case  
regulating the felling of trees in all the forests in the country.  Principle 15 
of Rio Conference of 1992 relating to the applicability of precautionary 
principle which stipulates that where there are threats of serious or 
irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a 
reason for proposing effective measures to prevent environmental 
degradation is also required to be kept in view.  In such matters, many a 
times, the option to be adopted is not very easy or in a straight jacket.  If 
an activity is allowed to go ahead, there may be irreparable damage to the 
environment and if it is stopped, there may be irreparable damage to 
economic interest.  In case of doubt, however, protection of environment 
would have precedence over the economic interest.  Precautionary 
principle requires anticipatory action to be taken to prevent harm.  The 
harm can be prevented even on a reasonable suspicion.  It is not always 
necessary that there should be direct evidence of harm to the environment.
	Bearing in mind the aforesaid principles, we have to consider the 
main question: should the mining activity in areas in question be banned 
altogether or permitted and, if so, conditions to be provided therefor?  The 
reports and suggestions of NEERI, EPCA and CEC have already been 
extensively noted.  The effect of mining activity in area upto 5 km. from 
Delhi-Haryana border on Haryana side of the ridge and also in the Aravalli 
Hills is to be seen in light of these reports and another report dealt later. 
One of the aspect stated in these reports is about carrying on of mining 
activity in close proximity to the residential area and/or main roads carrying 
traffic.

(Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_28">Development) Act</a>, 1957 (for short, 'the MMRD Act)  which 
was enacted to provide for the development and regulation of mines and 
minerals under the control of the Union.  <a href="/doc/120862145/" id="a_29">Section 13</a> is the rule making 
power of the Central Government.  The Central Government is empowered 
to make rules to provide for the manner in which rehabilitation of flora and 
other vegetation, such as trees, shrubs and the like destroyed by reason of 
any mining operation shall be made in the same area or in any other area 
selected by the Central Government (whether by way of reimbursement of 
the cost of rehabilitation or otherwise) by the person holding the mining 
lease.  <a href="/doc/192670971/" id="a_30">Section 18</a>, inter alia, casts a duty upon the Central Government to 
take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and 
systematic development of minerals in India and for the protection of 
environment by preventing or controlling any pollution which may be 
caused by mining operations and for such purposes, the Central 
Government may, by notification in the official gazette, make such rules as 
it thinks fit.  
</p><p id="p_336">The Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 have been framed by the 
Central Government in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 13 of 
the MMRD Act.  Chapter IV of these Rules relate to grant of mining leases 
in respect of land in which the minerals vest in the Government.  Rule 
22(4), inter alia, provides that on receipt of the communication from the 
State Government of the precise areas to be granted for mining purpose, 
the applicant shall submit a mining plan, within the period stipulated in the 
Rules, to the Central Government for its approval.  The applicant, on 
approval of the mining plan by the Central Government, shall submit the 
same to the State Government to grant mining lease over that area.  Rule 
4A, inter alia, provides that notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-
rule(4), the State Government shall be competent to approve mining plan 
of open cost mines (mines other than underground mines) in respect of 
now metallic or industrial minerals, named therein, one of it being Silica 
sand.  The mining plan, as provided in sub-rule (5) of Rule 22, shall, inter 
alia, incorporate the mineral reserves of the area and the plan of area 
showing, inter alia, water courses, limit of reserves and other forest areas 
and density of trees, if any, assessment of impact of mining activity on 
forest, land surface and environment including air and water pollution; 
details of the scheme of restoration of the area by afforestation, land 
reclamation, use of pollution control devices and such other measures as 
may be directed by the Central Government or the State Government from 
time to time.  A tentative scheme of mining and annual programme and 
plan for excavation from year to year for five years is also required to be 
incorporated in the mining plan.  Rule 22(5) was inserted in the Rules by 
notification dated 27th September, 1994 to which certain amendments were 
made in terms of notification dated 17th January, 2000 also inserting by 
same notification Rule 22(4A).  Sub-rule(4) to Rule 22 ad been earlier 
inserted by notification dated 27th September, 1994.
	The grant of permission for mining and approving mining plan and 
the scheme by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India by itself does 
not mean that mining operation can commence.  It cannot be accepted that 
by approving Mining Plan and Scheme by Ministry of Mines, Central 
Government is deemed to have approved mining and it can commence 
forthwith on such approval.  Section 13 of the MMRD Act and the Rules 
made in exercise of powers under the said section, deal, inter alia, with the 
aspect of grant of mining of lease and not commencement of mining 
operations.  Rules made under <a href="/doc/192670971/" id="a_31">Section 18</a>, however, deal with 
commencement of mining operations and steps required to be taken for 
protection of environment by proventing or controlling any pollution which 
may be caused by mining operation.  A mining lease holder is also 
required to comply with other statutory provisions such as Environment 
(protection) Act, 1986, Air (Prevention and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_32">Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, 
The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_33">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_34">Forest 
(Conservation) Act</a>, 1980.  Mere approval of the mining plan by 
Government of India, Ministry of Mines would not absolve the lease holder 
from complying with the other provisions. 
	Rules 31 to 41 contained in Chapter V of the Mineral Conservation 
and Development Rules, 1988 framed under Section 18 of the MMRD Act 
deal with the measures required to be taken by the lessee for the 
protection of environment from any adverse effect of mining or irreversible 
consequences thereof.  These Rules, inter alia, provide that every holder 
of a mining lease shall take all possible precautions for the protection of 
environment and control of pollution while conducting mining operations in 
the area; shall, wherever top soil exists and is to be excavated for mining 
operations, remove it separately and utilize for restoration or rehabilitation 
of the land which is no longer required for mining operations.  The holder is 
also required to take steps so that the overburden, waste rock, rejects and 
fines generated during prospecting and mining operations or tailings, slims 
and fines produced during sizing salting and benefication or metallurgical 
operations shall be stored in separate dumps which shall be properly 
secured to prevent escape of material therefrom in harmful quantities 
which may cause degradation of environment.  Wherever possible, the 
waste rock, overburden etc. shall be back-filled into the mines excavation 
with a view to restoring the land for its original use as far as possible and 
wherever it is not feasible during mining operation, the waste dumps shall 
be suitably tarraced and stabilized through vegetation or otherwise.  It is 
also required that the phased restoration, reclamation and rehabilitation of 
lands affected by mining operation shall be undertaken which work shall be 
completed before the conclusion of mining operations and the 
abandonment of mine.  Air pollution due to fines, dust and smoke or 
gaseous emissions during mining operations and related activities shall be 
controlled and kept within 'permissible limits' specified under various 
environmental laws of the country including the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_35">Control 
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_36">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 by the 
holder of mining lease.  Further, noise arising out of such operations shall 
be abated or controlled by the lessee at the source so as to keep it within 
the permissible limit.  The mining operations shall be carried out in such a 
manner so as to cause least damage to the flora of the area and nearby 
areas.  Every holder of mining lease shall take immediate measures for 
planting in the same area or any other area as selected by the authorized 
officer and not less than twice the number of trees destroyed by reason of 
any mining operation and look after them during the subsistence of the 
licence/lease and restore, to the extent possible, other flora destroyed by 
mining operations.    
</p><p id="p_337">The aforesaid  measures are not required to remain only on paper 
but strictly complied for the protection of environment and control of 
pollution as a result and consequence of mining operations.  
National Forest Policy
	In respect of mining in the forest area, we may also refer to the 
National Forest Policy, 1988 issued by Ministry of Environment and Forest, 
Government of India which, inter alia, notices that over the years, forests in 
the country have suffered serious depletion.  One of the reason of it is 
inadequacy of protection measure and diversion of forest land to non-
forest uses.  Without ensuring compensatory afforestation and essential 
environmental safeguards; and the tendency to look upon forests as 
revenue earning resource.  The basic objectives of the policy, inter alia, 
are maintenance of environment stability through preservation and, where 
necessary, restoration of the ecological balance that has been adversely 
disturbed by serious depletion of the forests of the country and checking 
the soil erosion and water conservation and increasing substantially the 
forest/tree cover through massive afforestation and social forestry 
programmes.  It provides that the National goal should be to have a 
minimum of 1/3rd  of the total land area of the country under forest or tree 
cover.  In the hills and in mountains regions, the aim should be to maintain 
2/3rd of the area under such cover in order to prevent erosion and land 
degradation and to ensure the stability of the fragile eco-system.  It also 
provides that a massive need based and time bound programme of 
afforestation and tree planting, with particular emphasis on fuel wood and 
fodder development, on all degraded and denuded lands in the country, 
whether forest or non-forest land, is a national imperative.  
Mining in Forest Area
The question of permitting mining in the area where large scale of 
afforestation with foreign funding has taken place is required to be 
examined keeping in view the National Forest Policy which also provides 
that forest land or land with tree cover should not be treated merely as a 
resource readily available to be utilized for various projects and 
programmes but as a national asset which requires to be properly 
sasfeguarded for providing sustained benefits to the entire community.  
Diversion of forest land for any non-forest purpose should be subject to the 
most careful examinations by specialists from the standpoint of social and 
environmental costs and benefits.  The mining and industrial development 
should be consistent with the needs for conservation of trees in forest.  It 
provides that no mining should be granted to any party, private or public, 
without a proper mine management plan appraised from the environmental 
angle and enforced by adequate machinery.  
Our attention was drawn by learned counsel appearing for lease-
holders to the part of national policy which provides that beneficiaries who 
are allowed mining and quarrying in forest land and in land covered by 
trees should be required to repair and re-vegetate the area in accordance 
with established forestry practices to submit that the policy itself 
contemplates mining operations in the forest area.  For present, we are not 
suggesting a complete ban of mining operations on forest land so long as it 
is possible to undertake the said operation on the sustainable development 
principles and after obtaining due approvals under various statutory 
provisions including <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_37">Section 2</a> of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.  At 
the same time, we are unable to appreciate the commencement and 
continuation of mining over areas on which crores of the foreign funds 
have been spent for afforestation and plantation.  Further, it is also not 
possible to accept the contention urged on behalf of the lease holders that 
only that part of such leased land where allegedly damage has been 
caused to plantation as a result of mining operations, be excluded from 
mining and not the entire area of the lease.  For example, if the mining 
area is 5 hectare and damages as a result of mining is to plantation in an 
area of 1 hectare, it is not practicable or reasonable to exclude only that 1 
hectare and permit the mining operation on the rest of the mining area.  
Reference can also be usefully made to the part of the State of Forest 
Report, 1999 issued by Forest Survey of India in relation to Haryana.    It, 
inter alia, provides that large scale plantations were carried out under 
Aravalli project since 1992.  The document claims increase of the forest 
cover in the State as a result of plantation under the Aravalli project.  It, 
inter alia, mentions that forest cover increase in Gurgaon and Faridabad is 
mainly due to plantation raised under the Aravalli project which was started 
in early 1990s.  In these matters, neither the State nor the leaseholders 
can be permitted to turn round and now take a stand that the areas 
covered under the Aravalli project is not forest.  The National Forestry 
Action Programme of December 2000 issued by the Ministry of 
Environment and Forest, Government giving project profile also makes 
detailed reference to the institution building and integrated national 
resource development in the Aravalli region, Haryana under the project 
implementing agency of Forest Department, Government of Haryana.  The 
project profile, inter alia, states that the Central to such a policy is 
rehabilitation of common lands to meet the needs of the rural poor and to 
reduce soil and water erosion and the proposed programme was 
envisaged to bring the benefit of integrated development of the Aravalli 
eco-system to the whole community, particularly, to the poorer sections.  
The project, it is stated, has been implemented in Aravalli hills situated in 
the five districts of Haryana including Gurgaon.  One of the expected 
outcome of the project is the reduced soil erosion and improved water 
regime in the rehabilitated area will be drastically reduce and run-off 
leading to recharge of constantly depleting ground water resources.  It 
records that Haryana Forest Department has implemented a project on the 
eco-restoration of common lands in the Aravalli hills, from June 1990 to 
October 1999.  The project is being funded by Delegation of European 
Communities.  The total cost  was 28.8 million ECU in which external 
assistance was to the extent of 23.2 million EUC.
Aravallis Hill Range
	The Aravallis, most distinctive and ancient mountain chain of 
peninsular India, mark the site of one of the oldest geological formations in 
the world.  Heavily eroded and with exposed outcrops of the slate rock and 
granite, it has summits reaching 4950 feet above sea level.  Due to its 
geological location, the Aravalli range harbours a mix of Saharan, 
Ethiopian, Peninsular, oriental and even Malayan elements of flora and 
fauna. In the early part of this century, the Aravallis were well wooded.  
There were dense forests with waterfalls and one could encounter a large 
number of wild animals.  Today, the changes in the environment at Aravalli 
are severe.  Though one finds a number of tree species in the hills, timber 
quality trees have almost disappeared.  Despite the increase of population 
resulting in increase of demand from the forest, It cannot be questioned 
nor has been questioned that to save the ecology of the Aravalli mountain, 
the laws have to be strictly implemented.  The notification dated 7th May, 
1992 was passed with a view to strictly implement the measures to protect 
the ecology of the Aravalli range.  The notification was followed more in its 
breach.
</p><p id="p_338">	In the aforesaid background, any mining activity on the area under 
plantation under Aravalli project cannot be permitted.  The grant of leases 
for mining operation over such an area would be wholly arbitrary, 
unreasonable and illogical.
</p><p id="p_339">Report of CMPDI on Aravalli
	The Central Mine Planning &amp; Design Institute Limited (CMPDI) on 
being asked by the Central Pollution Control Board to conduct a study of 
environmental problems of Aravalli hills and preparation of action plan for 
restoration of environmental quality in Gurgaon district, after extensive 
examination, has submitted to CPCB its final report in July 2003.  CMPDI 
is a subsidiary of Coal India Limited (Government of India Enterprise).  The 
report in respect of Aravalli range in Gurgaon district has been prepared by 
CMPDI with the following objectives :
</p><p id="p_340">1.	To prepare status report of the pollution problems in the Aravalli 
Hills.
</p><p id="p_341">2.	To prepare environmental management plan to abate various 
environmental problems
</p><p id="p_342">3.	To prepare action plan for restoration of environmental quality.
</p>

<p id="p_343">	The environmental problems in the Aravalli Range in Gurgaon 
district have been identified and remedial measures including the pollution 
control guidelines and action plan for various stakeholders have been 
suggested by CMPDI.  It has been noticed that in large scale mining 
projects what is still required is a proposal on district level as to what will 
be mined, how it will be mined and with what method and many such areas 
of environmental concern which had not been adequately addressed 
keeping in view the environmental degradation of the Aravalli Hills.  It has 
also been noticed that the Aravalli notification restricts process and 
operations under certain categories of the land in district.  Though the 
records of such lands are available at every village level map, there is no 
record available in the district level in respect of these areas to undertake 
realistic appraisal and effective monitoring of mining and other projects at 
the macro level on such lands.    While noticing that, notification dated 29th 
November, 1999, inter alia, made provision for preparing a master plan 
integrating the environmental concerns and the future land use of the area, 
but the master plan prepared on 28th August, 2002 does not, inter alia, 
address the issue of natural resource assessment and water Resource 
status; the areas near crushing zone and active mining zone remain a 
matter of concern and concerted efforts have not been given to the quality 
of roads and the dust suppression measures to maintain the air quality 
within safe limits.  The guidelines of operation in an eco-friendly manner 
have been issued by the State Government but the compliance is only 
partial, inasmuch as wind breaking walls are not proper, pollution control 
devices are not operating and the green belt around the crushing zones 
are not maintained.  Identification of mines in the district is difficult.  There 
does not seem to be mechanism to upgrade the mining technologies and 
methodologies to minimize the impact due to mining in the eco-sensitive 
zones in the district.  There is no identified land where overburden could 
be temporarily dumped prior to being utilized for void filling and for other 
purposes.  There does not seem to adequate awareness among the 
people in respect of the environmental problems.  In some parts of the 
district, the ground water potential is already in the dark category.  Lack of 
water conservation measures and rainwater harvesting may ultimately lead 
to water scarcity in the near future.
</p><p id="p_344">	Having identified the environmental problems, various actions have 
been recommended by CMPDI for the eco restoration in the Aravalli 
Range in Gurgaon district.  It has been, inter alia, recommended that it is 
imperative on the part of the State Government to improve inter-
departmental co-ordination among various Government departments to 
achieve the common objective, i.e., ecological restoration of Aravalli Hills 
in the district.  The master plan should indicate the proposed eco-
restoration plan to compensate the environmental degradation by the 
proposed activities in the master plan.  Rehabilitation programmes for the 
abandoned mines areas either to convert these to water reservoirs and 
eco-parks or reclamation by filling by rural waste, urban waste or fly ash.  
The master plan should be detailed to show the areas where overburden 
could be dumped, areas where waste material could be stocked, areas 
where plantation could be carried out, etc.etc.  The planning should, inter 
alia, include environmental impact and concerns of activities of one sector 
on the other sectors in the district, e.g., afforestation should be planned not 
only with a view to increase vegetation on the hills but also to be 
supplement for fuel, fodder etc. in the district.  All efforts should be made to 
preserve the ground water resources.  Water shed management and 
rainwater harvesting to be implemented in the Aravalli hills regions on war 
footing.  In the areas where mining deeper than the ground water table of 
the area is to be carried out, adequate provision of pollution control and 
conservation of water resources should be made.  There should be 
frequent inspections of the mining operations to ensure that these are in 
line with the requirement for sustainable development.  The inspections 
may be carried out at an interval of three months.  There should be 
continual source of revenue from the mining operations to the fund, 
recommended to be created, for the eco-restoration of the Aravalli hills.    
The minimum period of lease should be for 15-20 years.  This will induce 
the mine operators to take environmental protection measures more 
seriously.  The State Pollution Control Board shall undertake regular 
monitoring to check compliance and to assess the ambient air quality, 
water quality and other environmental protection measures.  The Ministry 
of Environment and Forest should take initiative to appoint a Central 
Agency to monitor the eco-restoration efforts and to provide technical 
support to the implementing organizations.  The renewal of mining lease 
and granting new leases should be effected after examining the 
environmental protection measures taken by the lessee.  Requisite data 
should be displayed on the internet to arouse awareness in public and for 
further usage.  Stringent action should be taken for water conservation.  
The Forest Department may even carry out the afforestation on behalf of 
mine operators.  Expenses should, however, be borne by the mine 
operators.  The afforestation shall be carried out keeping in view, inter alia, 
the consideration of checking the soil erosion.  The mine lessee should 
implement the environmental management plan and mining plan approved 
by the concerned authority.  In future, efforts in respect of search for 
sustainable development should broadly take into consideration resource 
potential in the region, the demand of the products and the supply options.  
Though the demand for the niche products existing in the Aravalli range 
which is one of the oldest mountain ranges in India will continue to grow, 
the supply options need to be given a closer look due to eco-sensitivity of 
the region.  The environmental cost needs to be internalized in the cost of 
the product and there is need to limit the supply options.  Noticing that the 
Aravalli range prevents the desert from spreading into Indo-Gangetic 
plains, it has been suggested that all future planning should not only 
concentrate to meet the ever growing demand of the products but due 
consideration should also be given to protect the chain.  All the 
developmental activities should, therefore, be planned in a coherent 
manner and there should be integrated approach for sustainable 
development.
</p><p id="p_345">	CMPDI has noticed that in the Aravalli Hills, a large number of 
activities, operations of stone crushers and deforestation besides other 
activities are causing environmental degradation.  These mines are usually 
located in the clusters in remote mineral rich districts/areas where living 
standards is lower and understanding of people towards environmental 
impact is also poor.  In the past, the mine operators took no note of 
environmental damage.  In fact, they were not even conscious about it.  
The attitude of mining community is to ignore the environmental concerns.  
In majority of the cases, the environmental concerns are ignored for 
making quick profits.  The small mines (less than 5 hectares) and the 
mining of minor minerals which are no doubt small individually but have 
damaging characteristics when in clusters, e.g. the mines of granite, 
marble, slates, quartzite etc. (falling under minor minerals) are no less 
damaging than the others, especially when the processing is taken into 
consideration.  The mining activities results in disturbance of land surface, 
altering drainage pattern and land use, besides the pollution problems, 
which may lead to the environmental problems of air, water and noise 
pollution and solid waste pollution.
</p><p id="p_346">	It has been suggested that the short term and long term action plan 
for the restoration of environmental quality of the area shall be prepared 
separately.  The action plan shall be prepared in such a way that it should 
be a guiding tool also in the hands of the state pollution control boards and 
Government agencies for enforcement of the environmental laws for the 
restoration of environmental quality of the area.  Monitoring programme 
shall include frequency of monitoring for air quality, water quality, ground 
water, solid wastes, noise level etc.
	In respect of water resources, it has been, inter alia, suggested that 
in order to draw water resource management plan, it is essential to assess 
the water quality of the various components of the hydrologic cycle, i.e., 
stream, ground water, surface water etc.  It has been pointed out that since 
the surface water potential is not promising in the district, there is 
increased dependence on the ground water for meeting the agricultural, 
domestic and industrial requirement resulting in depletion of ground water 
resources in the district.  It has been suggested that utmost care is 
required for further development of ground water in the areas where the 
recharge of the ground water is low.
</p><p id="p_347">	Dealing with the flora and fauna, it has been pointed out that the 
earliest account shows that at one time the Aravalli hills were well covered 
with dhauk (Anogeissus pendula).  Now, except in few places, viz., the Jhir 
Forest in Firozpur Jhirka (dedicated to Mahadeo Temple) and near 
Bhondsi recently regenerated with dhauk, the Aravallis are by and large, 
bereft of vegetation in the district.  
</p><p id="p_348">It has been noticed that in order to take stock of the environmental 
problems, CPCB and CMPDI team made several visits to Aravalli hills and 
held discussion with the mine operators, State officials and local people.  
There are number of mining projects etc. which are already existing and 
there is also tremendous potential to further increase the industrial and the 
other development activities.  The environmental impact due to mining 
projects on air quality, water quality, noise level, overburden etc. have 
been noticed and it has been pointed out that the opening of new projects 
will further affect some of the environmental attributes.
The report notices that the environmental degradation has taken 
place due to mining activities.  The existing crusher units are also not 
functioning on the environmental sound systems.  The situation warrants 
closer look on various components of the systems affecting the 
environmental attributes in the area, devising pragmatic approaches to 
facilitate eco-restoration of the Aravalli hills and offering broad framework 
to the industrial units to function under environmentally sustainable 
framework.  The suggestions also include the enactment of rules for grant 
of mine leases to levy a separate charge for dump removal, ecological 
restoration in the area, the technology to be used for mining operations 
and post mining land use and mine decommissioning.  As far as 
environmental protection in the Aravalli hills is concerned, planning and 
provisions must start from the stage of grant of mine lease and what all it 
should include have been set out.  It has been, inter alia, suggested that 
the environmental framework shall include the framework for 
environmental clearance such as depth of cutting, area of plantation and 
the type of plantation, which are attributes related to closure planning as 
also framework for monitoring and for forestry besides air quality, land use 
pattern etc.  In nutshell, it has been suggested that it is imperative on the 
part of the mine operators to carry out the mine operations in such a 
fashion that it has least impact on the ecology of the area.  The pollution 
prevention guidelines have been suggested in para 7.1.1.2
Having regard to the detailed study, the recommendations and 
action plan has been dealt with in Chapter VIII of the report, inter alia, 
suggesting that concerted efforts from various departments are needed.  
The report states that though the environmental upgradation measures 
need to be taken more seriously by the mine and other industrial 
operators, there is need on the part of the State Government to 
immediately start these measures in the areas where degradation has 
already taken place.  The other recommendations have already been 
broadly noticed.
</p><p id="p_349">No one has raised any objection to the recommendations contained 
in the report of CMPDI.  We accept the recommendations in principle.  
Modification of Order dated 6th May, 2002 Regarding Mining in 
Aravalli

Now, the question is should mining activities in the Aravalli range in 
Gurgaon district be permitted to restart and, to that extent, the order dated 
6th May, 2002 be modified, meanwhile directing implementation of 
recommendations in the report of CMPDI and earlier referred reports.  The 
other option is to first constitute a monitoring committee directing it to 
individually examine and inspect mines from environmental angle in the 
light of the said recommendations and file a report in this Court in respect 
of individual mines with its recommendations for restart or otherwise as 
also recommendation, if any, for the payment by the mine operators and/or 
by State Government towards environmental fund having regard to the 
precautionary principles and polluter pays principle and on consideration of 
that report, to decide the aspect of modification of the order dated 6th May, 
2002, partially or entirely.  We are of the view that the second option is 
more appropriate.  We are conscious of observations in CMPDI that 
measures for protecting the environment can be undertaken without 
stopping mine operations and also the suggestions of MOEF to permit 
mining subject to the mine lease holders undertaking to comply with such 
conditions which remain to be complied, but, having regard to the 
enormous degradation of the environment, in our view, the safer and the 
proper course is to first constitute a Monitoring Committee, get a report 
from it and only thereafter consider, on individual mine to mine basis, lifting 
of ban imposed in terms of order dated 6th May, 2002.  Before concluding 
this aspect, we may note that assuming there was any ambiguity about the 
applicability of order dated 6th May, 2002 to mining in Aravalli Range, it is 
clarified that the said order would be applicable to all the mines in Aravalli 
hill range in Gurgaon district.
</p><p id="p_350">Applicability of notification dated 27th January, 1994
	The notification has been reproduced in the earlier part of the 
judgment.  It, inter alia, applies to mining projects (major minerals) with 
leases of more than 5 hectares.  It can neither be disputed nor has been 
disputed that the notification is mandatory.  It, inter alia, provides that on 
and from the date of its publication in official Gazette expansion or 
modernization of any activity (if pollution load is to exceed the existing one) 
or a new project listed in Schedule A of this notification shall not be 
undertaken in any part of India unless it has been accorded environmental 
clearance by the Central Government in accordance with the procedure 
specified therein.  The contention urged on behalf of the lease-holders is 
that the leases in question do not relate to expansion or modernization of 
any activity as postulated by the notification.  Further, it is contended, that 
the notification applies to 'a new project' which means that it will apply to 
mining lease granted after issue of notification.  It has been strenuously 
contended that the renewal of existing mining lease is neither 'an 
expansion' nor 'modernization' nor is it a 'new project' and, therefore, the 
notification will have no applicability at the time of consideration of the 
renewal of the lease.  Reliance has been placed on a decision of this Court 
in Narmada's case (supra) holding that the notification is clearly 
prospective and, inter alia, prohibits the undertaking of a new project listed 
in Schedule I without prior environmental clearance from the Central 
Government.  The contention urged was that since in Narmada's case, 
where construction had commenced nearly 8 years prior to the notification, 
same very notification was not held applicable.   On the same analogy, it 
cannot have any applicability to the leases granted prior to the issue of 
notification.  
</p><p id="p_351">No doubt, the notification is prospective but the question here is 
whether it would be applicable when the aspect of renewal comes up for 
consideration after the issue of the notification.  In Narmada's case, it was 
not held that this notification will not apply at the stage of renewal.  The 
observations made in para 129 of the said decision and relied upon by 
learned counsel for the lease holders have no relevance to determine the 
applicability of the notification at the stage of renewal.  In Narmada's 
case, the environmental clearance had been granted in the year 1987 and 
this Court noticing that when it was granted by the Prime Minister, 
whatever studies were available were taken into consideration, it was 
known that the construction of the dam would result in submergence and 
the consequent effect which the reservoir will have on the ecology of the 
surrounding areas and various studies relating to environmental impact 
had been taken into consideration and  that there was no obligation to 
obtain the statutory clearance under 1994 notification.  
	In the present case, regarding the manner of grant of no objection 
certificate from environmental angle for proposed mining activity, by way of 
illustration, we may refer to the order dated 18th January, 1999 issued by 
Haryana State Pollution Control Board whereby no objection certificate for 
renewal of lease was granted stipulating that the applicant Som Prakash 
Sethi in respect of mining activity at village Anangpur, district Faridabad 
shall also seeking environmental clearance of its mining project in 
compliance with this notification without even mentioning any time limit for 
it and admittedly till date that had not been done.  None bothered to find 
out whether conditions in the order has been complied or not.  Further the 
letter dated 25th January, 2003, sent to Principal Secretary of Central 
Empowered Committee  by Director Mines and Ecology, Haryana shows 
how the State Government has been circumventing the legal requirements 
and permitting mining.  In that letter, it has been stated that pending 
approval of the environmental plan, the mining lessees undertook the 
mining operation of the minor mineral on issue of short term permit, in 
cases where the fresh mining leases were granted and in case of renewal 
of mining leases, the mining activities were going on.  This is despite 
conditions in the judgment dated 10th May, 1996 by this Court that the 
Director Mining and Ecology Haryana would be responsible for mining in 
the State of Haryana.
</p><p id="p_352">	Be that as it may and reverting to legal position, in <a href="/doc/1186098/" id="a_38">Ambica Quarry 
Works v. State of Gujarat &amp; Ors</a>. [(1987) 1 SCC 213], though a case 
under <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_39">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980 rejecting the contention that 
approval at the stage of renewal was not necessary and also the plea that 
since the leaseholders had invested sum of money in mining operation, it 
was the duty of the authorities to renew the lease, it was held that having 
regard to the awareness that deforestation and ecological imbalances as a 
result of deforestation have become social menaces and the same should 
be prevented and that the concept that power coupled with the duty 
enjoined upon the respondents to renew the lease stood eroded by the 
mandate of the FC Act.  It was held that The primary duty was to the 
community and that duty took precedence.  In such cases, the obligation to 
the society must predominate over the obligation to the individuals.  It 
would be apposite to reproduce what was said by Justice Mukherjee (as 
he then was) in paras 14 and 15 which read thus :
"14. Here the case of the appellants is that they 
have invested large sums of money in mining 
operations. Therefore, it was the duty of the 
authorities that the power of granting permission 
should have been so exercised that the 
appellants had the full benefits of their 
investments. It was emphasized that none of the 
appellants had committed any breach of the 
terms of grant nor were there any other factors 
disentitling them to such renewal. While there 
was power to grant renewal and in these cases 
there were clauses permitting renewals, it might 
have cast a duty to grant such renewal in the 
facts and circumstances of the cases specially in 
view of the investments made by the appellants in 
the areas covered by the quarrying leases, but 
renewals cannot be claimed as a matter of right 
for the following reasons. 
</p><p id="p_353">15. The rules dealt with a situation prior to the 
coming into operation of 1980 Act. '1980 Act' was 
an Act in recognition of the awareness that 
deforestation and ecological imbalances as a 
result of deforestation have become social 
menaces and further deforestation and ecological 
imbalances should be prevented. That was the 
primary purpose writ large in the Act of 1980. 
Therefore the concept that power coupled with 
the duty enjoined upon the respondents to renew 
the lease stands eroded by the mandate of the 
legislation as manifest in 1980 Act in the facts 
and circumstances of these cases. The primary 
duty was to the community and that duty took 
precedence, in our opinion, in these cases. The 
obligation to the society must predominate over 
the obligation to the individuals."

[1989 Supp.(1) SCC 504], agreeing with views expressed in Ambica 
Quarry Workers, it was held that the FC Act applies to renewals as well 
and even if there was a provision for renewal in the lease agreement on 
exercise of lessee's option, the requirement of the Act had to be satisfied 
before such renewal could be granted.  <a href="/doc/48415287/" id="a_41">In State of M.P. &amp; Ors. v. 
Krishnadas Tikaram</a> [1995 Supp.(1) SCC 587], these two decisions 
were relied upon and it was held that even the renewal of lease cannot be 
granted without the prior concurrence of the Central Government.  It is 
settled law that the grant of renewal is a fresh grant and must be 
consistent with law.  
</p><p id="p_355">	We are unable to accept the contention that the notification dated 
27th January, 1994 would not apply to leases which come up for 
consideration for renewal after issue of the notification.  The notification 
mandates that the mining operation shall not be undertaken in any part of 
India unless environmental clearance by the Central Government has 
been accorded.  The clearance under the notification is valid for a period 
of five years.  In none of the leases the requirement of notification was 
complied with either at the stage of initial grant of the mining lease or at 
the stage of renewal.  Some of the leases were fresh leases granted after 
issue of the notification.  Some were cases of renewal.  No mining 
operation can commence without obtaining environmental impact 
assessment in terms of the notification.

<p id="p_356">The Applicability of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 to areas 
treated as forest by State Forest Department


	The provisions of the Act provide for the conservations of forest and 
for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto.  Any 
forest land or portion thereof cannot be used for any non-forest purposes 
or assigned by way of leases or otherwise to any private person or to any 
authority, corporation, agency or any other organization not owned, 
managed or controlled by the Government, except with the prior approval 
of the Central Government.  Mining activity within forest area cannot be 
permitted in contravention of the provisions of the Act.  <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_42">The Act</a> makes the 
contravention of any of the provisions of <a href="/doc/89100821/" id="a_43">Section 2</a> as an offence 
punishable in the manner provided in the Act.  
The controversy is in respect of certain leases where area under 
the lease is covered under notification issued under <a href="/doc/11187870/" id="a_44">Section 4</a> and/or 5 of 
the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900.  The question is whether such 
area is 'forest' of any kind.  
</p><p id="p_357">Under <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_45">Section 3</a> of the aforesaid Act, whenever it appears to the 
State Government that it is desirable to provide for the conservation of 
sub-soil water or the prevention of erosion in any area subject to erosion 
or likely to become liable to erosion, such Government may by notification 
make a direction accordingly.  Under <a href="/doc/158774304/" id="a_46">Section 4(b)</a>, the State Government 
has power to regulate, restrict or prohibit the quarrying of stone or the 
burning of lime at placed where such stone or lime had not ordinarily been 
so quarried or burnt prior to the publication of the notification under section 
</p><p id="p_358">3.  <a href="/doc/125393809/" id="a_47">Section 5(b)</a> in respect of any specified village or villages, or part or 
parts thereof, comprised within the limits of any area notified under <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_48">section 
3</a>, the State Government may, by special order, temporarily regulate, 
restrict or prohibit the quarrying of any stone or the burning of any lime at 
places where such stone or lime had ordinarily been so quarried or burnt 
prior to the publication of the notification under <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_49">section 3</a>.  In respect of 
some mining areas notifications have been issued under <a href="/doc/11187870/" id="a_50">Section 4</a> and in 
respect of some notifications have been issued both under <a href="/doc/11187870/" id="a_51">Sections 4</a> and 
</p><p id="p_359">5.  The submission is that invoking of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_52">Sections 3</a>, <a href="/doc/11187870/" id="a_53">4</a> and <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_54">5</a> is only to 
conserve sub-soil water and prevention of the area from erosion of land 
and is not to create any forest.  It has been pointed out that in cases 
where the notifications have been issued, only felling of trees had been 
prohibited and not quarrying of stone.  
It cannot be disputed that the State Forest Department has been 
treating and showing the aforesaid areas as 'forest'.  The contention urged 
on behalf of the State Government is that it was on account of erroneous 
view point of Forest Department.  In fact and law, such area is not 'forest' 
and mining is not prohibited and, therefore the question of seeking 
permission under Section 2 of the FC Act does not arise.
In the instant case, it is not necessary to decide the legal effect of 
issue of the notification under <a href="/doc/11187870/" id="a_55">Section 4</a> and/or 5 of the Act.  Not only in 
their record the area has been shown as forest but the affidavits have been 
filed in this Court stating the area to be 'forest'.  <a href="/doc/282585/" id="a_56">In T.N. Godavarman 
Thirumulkpad v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. [(1997) 2 SCC 267]  , this Court 
held that the term 'forest' is to be understood in the dictionary sense and 
also that any area regarded as a forest in Government record irrespective 
of ownership would be a forest.  The State of Haryana, besides having 
filed affidavits in the forest matters treating such areas as forest for the 
purposes of the FC Act has been seeking prior approval from the Central 
Government for diversion of such land for non-forestry purpose.   
Reference in this connection may also be made to the affidavit dated 8th 
December, 1996 filed by Banarsi Das, Principal Chief Conservator of 
Forest, Chandigarh, Haryana in Civil Writ No.171 of 1996 <a href="/doc/1264331/" id="a_57">Environmental 
Awareness Forum v. State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Ors.  Our</a> 
attention has also been drawn to letter dated 26th November, 2002 
addressed by Divisional Forest Officer, Faridabad to Mining Officer, 
Faridabad forwarding to him a list of blocked forest areas of Faridabad 
district and requesting him to ensure that the said forest areas are not 
affected by any mining operations as also to a letter dated 17th September, 
2001 sent by Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Haryana (Panchkula) 
to Director of Environment, Haryana stating therein that no mining activity 
can be permitted in the area.  On the facts and circumstances of the case, 
we cannot permit the State Government to take a compete summersault in 
these proceedings and contend that the earlier stand that the area is 
'forest was under some erroneous impressions.  In the present case, for 
the purposes of the FC Act, these areas shall be treated as forest and for 
use of it for non-forestry purpose, it would be necessary to comply with the 
provisions of the FC Act.
</p><p id="p_360">We may also note that assuming that there was any confusion or 
erroneous impression, it ought to have been first sorted out at appropriate 
level and where affidavits had been filed in this Court, clarifications/orders 
sought before issue of the mining lease in respect of such area. 
Impact of Mining on Ground Water
Where during mining water level is touched, the Monitoring 
Committee shall carve out that area and it was agreed on behalf of the 
leaseholders that they would co-operate and not undertake any mining in 
such an area.  
</p><p id="p_361">Non-payment of royalty to the villagers
	A controversy has been raised about non-payment of royalty by the 
leaseholders to villagers on whose behalf it was contended that the order 
dated 6th May, 2002 prohibiting mining should not be varied till the 
leaseholders discharge their liability to pay royalty to the villagers.  On the 
other hand, mine leaseholders dispute the claim put-forth on behalf of the 
villagers and it has been submitted that no amount is payable by them and 
the villagers can make their claim, if any, from the State Government.    
The dispute of this nature cannot be properly adjudicated in these 
proceedings.  We leave it open to be adjudicated before appropriate forum 
in accordance with law.  
</p><p id="p_362">Leases in respect of minor mineral
	Though notification dated 27th January, 1994 is not applicable to 
minor minerals, but having regard to what we have discussed above in 
regard to degradation of environment and the required standard about the 
risk of harm to the environment or to human health to be decided in public 
interest according to 'reasonable person's test', and the report of CMPDI, 
we direct the Monitoring Committee to examine the leases granted for 
extraction of minor mineral in light thereof and file its report.  The 
Committee would, however, bear in mind that the notification dated 27th 
January, 1994 as such is not applicable to these leases.
Mining in Faridabad District
	Having examined the matter, we are of the view that though the 
study conducted by CMPDI relates to mining activity in Aravalli Hills in 
Gurgaon district, in public interest the general safeguards and suggestions 
in that report deserve to be implemented in respect of mining in Faridabad 
district as well.
</p><p id="p_363">	We have already extracted the recommendations of NEERI, as also 
violations noticed in the reports submitted by EPCA and the suggestions of 
EPCA, CEC and CMPDI.  The Monitoring Committee shall inspect the 
leases in question in Faridabad District as well in the light of these 
recommendations and file its report containing suggestions on 
recommencement or otherwise of the mining activity therein.
	It may be reiterated that if, despite stringent conditions, the 
degradation of environment continues and reaches a stage of no return, 
this Court may have to consider, at a later date, the closure of mining 
activity in areas where there is such a risk.
	As earlier noticed as well, it would not be expedient to lift the ban on 
mining imposed in terms of the order of this Court dated 6th May, 2002 
before ensuring implementation of suggestions of CMPDI and other 
recommendations of experts (NEERI, EPCA and CEC).  The safer course 
is to consider this question, on individual basis after receipt of report of the 
Monitoring Committee.
</p><p id="p_364">Environment Impact assessment applications
	During the course of hearing environment assessment applications 
in terms of notification dated 27th January, 1994 have been filed by some 
of the leaseholders.  In case, those applications are presently with Central 
Empowered Committee, the same shall be forthwith forwarded by CEC to 
MOEF.  The adverse effect, if any, and extent thereof on human health 
and ecology shall be examined while deciding impact of these activities.  
There is also the desirability of transparency in such matter.  The MOEF is 
directed to consider the said applications within a period of 10 weeks.
Monitoring Committee
	With a view to monitor the overall eco-restoration efforts in the 
Aravalli Hills and to provide technical support to the implementing 
organizations and also to monitor implementation of recommendations 
contained in reports referred herein, it is necessary to constitute a 
Monitoring Committee.  The heads of the following departments would be 
members of the Monitoring Committee :
</p><p id="p_365">1.	Regional Officer of State Pollution Control Board.
</p><p id="p_366">2.	Forest Department
</p><p id="p_367">3.	District Administration
</p><p id="p_368">4.	Department of Mining &amp; Geology
</p><p id="p_369">5.	Irrigation Department
</p><p id="p_370">6.	Regional Officer of CGWB
</p><p id="p_371">7.	Agriculture Department
</p><p id="p_372">8.	District Industry Department.
</p><p id="p_373">9.	Chairman - CPCB.
</p>
<p id="p_374">	Besides above, MOEF is directed to appoint an officer from Central 
Ground Water Board to be a member of the Monitoring Committee.  The 
following persons as representatives of public shall also be members of 
the said Committee :
</p><p id="p_375">1.	Prof. Dilip Biswas,
	Ex Chairman, CPCB.
</p><p id="p_376">2.	Mr. Valmiki Thapar,
</p><p id="p_377">3.	Mr. Bhure Lal.
</p><p id="p_378">	The MOEF would act as a nodal agency of the Monitoring 
Committee.  The Secretary of MOEF is directed to appoint an officer not 
below the rank of a Joint Secretary in the Ministry for the said purpose.
The Monitoring Committee is directed to inspect the mines in 
question and file a report within a period of three months, inter alia, 
containing suggestions for recommencement of mining in individual cases.  
All concerned individuals and departments are directed to render full co-
operation to the Monitoring Committee.
Conclusions	
</p><p id="p_379">1.	The order dated 6th May, 2002 as clarified hereinbefore cannot be 
vacated or varied before consideration of the report of the Monitoring 
Committee constituted by this judgment.
</p><p id="p_380">2.	The notification of environment assessment clearance dated 27th 
January, 1994 is applicable also when renewal of mining lease is 
considered after issue of the notification.
</p><p id="p_381">3.	On the facts of the case, the mining activity on areas covered under 
<a href="/doc/11187870/" id="a_58">Section 4</a> and/or 5 of Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900 cannot be 
undertaken without approval under the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_59">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 
1980.
</p><p id="p_382">4.	No mining activity can be carried out on area over which plantation 
has been undertaken under Aravalli project by utilization of foreign 
funds.
</p><p id="p_383">5.	The mining activity can be permitted only on the basis of sustainable 
development and on compliance of stringent conditions.
</p><p id="p_384">6.	The Aravalli hill range has to be protected at any cost.  In case 
despite stringent condition, there is an adverse irreversible effect on 
the ecology in the Aravalli hill range area, at a later date, the total 
stoppage of mining activity in the area may have to be considered. 
For similar reasons such step may have to be considered in respect 
of mining in Faridabad District as well.
</p><p id="p_385">7.	MOEF is directed to prepare a short term and long term action plan 
for the restoration of environmental quality of Aravalli hills in 
Gurgaon district having regard to what is stated in final report of 
CMPDI within four months.
</p><p id="p_386">8.	Violation of any of the conditions would entail the risk of cancellation 
of mining lease.  The mining activity shall continue only on strict 
compliance of the stipulated conditions.  
The matters are directed to be listed after reopening of courts after 
summer vacation on receipt of the report from the Monitoring Committee.
