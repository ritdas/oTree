                                Whereas the cause of the spill is attributed to a
                          shear at ferrule joint in 8” unloading hose pipe which
                          connects the vessel (ship) and the unloading pipeline
                          leading to ETTPL (Ennore Tank Terminal Pvt Ltd). Due to
                          sudden failure in the hose pipe, around 1.5 tons of
                          furnace oil has spilled in the sea water between the
                          jetty and vessel (ship). As soon as the failure occurred in
