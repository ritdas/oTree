                                JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">(Judgment delivered by bench)

         This application is filed seeking to direct the Respondents to inspect the
applicant's unit and permit the applicant to operate the unit which was closed on
13.8.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) after inspecting of the unit
found certain deficiencies and directed the applicant to comply with the same. Since the
applicant had not complied with, the TNPCB invoked its power under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">section 31-A</a> of Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and directed to close down the unit and
directed the Assistant Engineer to stop supply of electricity with immediate effect.
</p>
<p id="p_3">           It appears the applicant had made several representations requesting the
board to re-inspect the unit, since he had complied with the deficiencies pointed out
earlier. As there was no response, this application is filed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         The application had come up for hearing on 18.10.2011, 23.11.2011,
18.12.2011. On 19.1.2012 reply was filed by R-1 and R-2. However, they failed to reply
para 10 of the Application No. 22 of 2011 which reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_5">         "The applicant requested the R-2 herein for power connection to the
appellant's unit and also submitted a detailed representation on 13.8.2010. Along with
the representation photographic proofs were also submitted. Further, the applicant
sent another representation dated 15.9.2010 stating that the Jaw crusher has been
closed properly, that the pulverizing mill, cyclone carborator and back filter has been
well connected , that the pulverizing unit is kept in a closed room, that around the
unit trees are planted in a good manner and new trees are planted, that the septic
tank and chock pit are in good condition, that rain water harvesting pit has been
dome and rain water is collected, that all preventing measure for control of air and
noise pollution been made with documentary evidence to the and requested to give
 consent to operate and electricity connection. A true copy of the Applicant's letter
dated 13.8.2010 is annexed hereto and marked as Annexure A-3 (Colly) (page nos. 11-
</p><p id="p_6">12) and the true copy of the applicant's representation dated 15.9.2010 is annexed
hereto and marked as Annexure A-4 (Page Nos. 13-24)".
</p>
<p id="p_7">          Therefore, we directed the R-1 and 2 to inspect the Unit of the applicant and
submit a fresh report on or before 15th February 2012. On 15.12.2012 also there was no
report submitted by R-1 and R-2. Even today no such report is forthcoming. Under
these circumstances, without keeping the application pending for a long time, we are of
the opinion that the application can be disposed of with the following:
</p>
<p id="p_8">          The R-1 and R-2 are directed to consider the representations made by the
applicant dated 13.8.2010 and 15.9.2010 and take appropriate action by inspecting the
unit and taking decision within a period of six weeks from the date of this order and
communicate a copy of the decision to the applicant on or before 10.4.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_9">         If for any reason, R-1 and R-2 do not act upon and take a decision as directed
above, the applicant is at liberty to operate the Unit and R-3 shall restore electricity and
power supply to the unit. If the decision made is against the applicant, he may work out
remedies as available under the law.
</p>
