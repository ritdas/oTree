<p id="p_1">            This order shall dispose of C.W.P. Nos. 971 and 1469 of

2008 as common question of law have been raised. However, the

facts are being referred from C.W.P. No. 971 of 2008. The petitioner

has approached this Court with a prayer for direction to the

respondents to allot it a plot measuring 15000 square meters for

setting up a dyeing unit in the earmarked 'Dyeing Zone' Sector 29

Part-II, Panipat, as per the list of identified units prepared by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> C.W.P. No. 971 of 2008                                             2</span>

Haryana Pollution Control Board-respondent No. 3 (for brevity, 'the

Board').
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.           Brief facts of the case are that the matter regarding

contamination of ground water being caused by in-discriminate

discharge of polluted effluent by small and tiny units engaged in

dyeing and printing activities in Panipat Town was considered in

various meetings of the Environment Protection Council, Haryana. It

was noticed that out of 500 units of Panipat, about 300 tiny units,

which were employing 5-6 persons, were operating from residential

and non-conforming areas of the Town. Thus, in principle it was

decided to formulate a time bound action plan for relocation of small

scale industrial units working in the congested areas of the Town in a

separate industrial estate so that their effluent could be treated in a

common effluent treatment plant.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.           In the meeting of the Environment Protection Council,

held on 19.9.2001 it was decided that Sector 29 Part-II and Sector 30,

Panipat, being developed by the HUDA, would be suitable site for

relocating the aforementioned units. The issue with regard to cost of

sites for relocating the units was also considered and it was decided

that cost of the plot may be realised as per the following formula:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "i)    5% of the price along with the application form.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             ii)    10% within 30 days of issue of allotment letter.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             iii)   Balance 85% in half yearly instalments payable

                    over a period of 10 years."</blockquote><p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">             It was further decided that the HUDA will carry out an

exercise to work out a scheme in which the larger units would be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> C.W.P. No. 971 of 2008                                               3</span>

charged more, so that the price payable by the tiny units could be

reduced further i.e. less than Rs. 1,428/- per square yards.

</p><p id="p_6">4.           In the meeting held on 26.2.2002 as per Item No. A-84

(2) Suppl. A-84 the matter regarding shifting of dyeing units in

Panipat Town was considered. It was decided that the units involved

in the dyeing and printing activities in the Town which were

functioning from residential and non-conforming zone, should be

shifted to the new industrial area and land be given to them on 'no

profit no loss basis' by the HUDA in Sector 29 Part-II, Panipat.

Thereafter, a survey was conducted by the Survey Team of the

Regional Office of the Board at Panipat to identify the units which

were involved in the dyeing and printing activities and operating from

the residential and non-conforming zones in the Town for their

relocation to the new sites in Sector 29 Part-II, Panipat. A survey list

of 494 units was prepared, which were found existing in the non-

conforming zone in Panipat Town. In the list complete information

was incorporated viz. name of the unit, address, name of the owner,

type of industries, total area of plant in square meters, total area of

dyeing section in square maters, total investment, quantity of effluent

discharged, point of discharge, status of effluent treatment plan

whether installed or not, proof of ownership, status of air pollution

and land recommended by team in square meters.                 The policy

decision dated 26.2.2002 has been placed on record as Annexure P-4

in another petition, namely, CWP No. 11819 of 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.           The petitioner is a partnership concern and had been

transacting the dyeing business in the non-conforming zone and its

name in the survey list appears at Sr. No. 12 (P-2). Likewise, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> C.W.P. No. 971 of 2008                                            4</span>

name of the other petitioner firm (in CWP No. 1469 of 2008) figures

at Sr. No. 144. As per the recommendations made by the Survey

Team of the Board for allotment of plot to the identified 494 units, in

the case of the petitioner (in CWP No. 971 of 2008) it was

recommended that a plot of the size of 15000 square meters be

allotted in the Dyeing Zone in Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat, which was

earmarked by the Haryana Urban Development Authority for

rehabilitating Dyeing and Printing units, as per decision dated

26.2.2002, for shifting such units, whereas in the other case

recommendation for allotment of a 5000 square meter plot was made.

</p><p id="p_8">6.          The petitioner (in CWP No. 971 of 2008) applied for

allotment of an industrial plot of the size of 2100 square meters in

Sector 29 Part-II, Panipat. It was allotted a plot, measuring 2100

square meters in terms of policy decision dated 26.2.2002, for a

tentative price of Rs. 24,88,500/-, vide allotment letter dated

28.11.2003, which is on the original record. As per condition No. 4

of the allotment letter, the petitioner was to communicate its

acceptance through registered post alongwith an amount of Rs.

2,48,850/- within 30 days from the date of issue of allotment letter,

which together with an amount of Rs. 1,24,425/- already paid by it,

was to constitute 15% of the total tentative price.      According to

clause 5, the balance 85% amount of Rs. 21,15,225/- of the tentative

price could be paid in lump-sum without interest within 60 days of

the issuance of the allotment letter or in half yearly instalments

payable over a period of 10 years alongwith interest @ 11% per

annum.    The interest was to accrue from the date of offer of

possession and first instalment was to commence from the date of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> C.W.P. No. 971 of 2008                                              5</span>

offer of possession. The petitioner had deposited only a sum of Rs.

1,24,425/-, which represent 5% of the tentative price of the plot,

however, it did not deposit any further amount in terms of clause 4 to

make it 15% of the total amount nor any further amount of the

tentative price was paid. Consequently, the allotment was cancelled

on 11.3.2005 (P-3). The appeal preferred by the petitioner before the

Administrator,   HUDA,      Panchkula,    was    also   dismissed       on

29.11.2005/8.2.2006.     The request made by the petitioner for

restoration of the plot, which was made to the Chairman, HUDA,

Panchkula, has also not evoked any response.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             Similarly in the case of the other petitioner (in CWP No.

1469 of 2008) Plot No. 239, 'Dyeing Zone' Sector 29, Part-II,

Panipat, measuring 5000 squate meters, was allotted to it, vide

allotment letter dated 17.11.2003.       However, the allotment was

cancelled on the ground that the petitioner had failed to give

acceptance of the allotment in terms of clause 4 of the allotment letter

within 30 days from the date of its issuance (Annexure P-4 with CWP

No. 1469 of 2008). The appeal preferred in the matter was also

rejected vide order dated 27.9.2005/7.11.2005 (P-5).

</p><p id="p_10">7.           On 11.7.2007, the HUDA issued an advertisement in the

newspapers, including 'The Tribune', for allotment of industrial plots

in Dyeing Zone, Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat. It was mentioned in the

advertisement that in the 84th meeting of the Authority, held on

26.2.2002, the policy for shifting of Dyeing units, functioning from

Panipat Town/non-conforming zone, as identified by the survey

conducted by the Board in the year 2001, in Dyeing Zone, Sector 29,

Part-II, Panipat, was approved but despite lapse of 5 years, some of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> C.W.P. No. 971 of 2008                                              6</span>

the entrepreneurs who had been identified for the allotment of plots in

the zone have not come forward till that date seeking allotment of

plot. Since the plots could not be left as such for an indefinite period,

therefore, a last chance was again given to such entrepreneurs and

applications were invited upto 10.8.2007. It was further mentioned

that the applicants who had already made an application should apply

afresh alonwith the difference of earnest money and other required

documents (P-1).     The petitioner again submitted its application

alongwith earnest money of Rs. 14,43,750/- through two demand

drafts dated 9.8.2007 (P-6), which were duly received in the office of

the Chief Administrator at Panchkula on 10.8.2007 (P-7).

</p><p id="p_11">8.           On 21.9.2007, the Board issued a notice to the petitioner

for shifting their unit to Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat, within 45 days

under the 'Shifting of Dyeing Units Project'. The notice was replied

to by the petitioner on 3.10.2007 by stating that they had applied

again for allotment of plot in response to fresh advertisement dated

11.7.2007 and as soon as the plot is allotted they would shift the unit

(P-10). On 10.12.2007, again a closure notice under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33-A</a> of

the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, was

issued by the Board to the petitioner to show cause within 15 days as

to why their unit be not closed for not shifting to the Dyeing Zone

Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat (P-11). The petitioner again sent a reply

on 13.12.2007 taking the same stand that plot has not been allotted by

the HUDA in response to the advertisement dated 11.7.2007 (P-12).

On 4.12.2007, the petitioner sought clarification from the Estate

Officer, HUDA, Panipat mentioning that plots were allotted on

1.12.2007 but name of their unit was not included in the allotment list
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> C.W.P. No. 971 of 2008                                              7</span>

(P-13). On 14.12.2007, again a request was made by the petitioner to

the Administrator, HUDA, Panchkula (P-14).
</p>
<p id="p_12">9.           In the written statement filed on behalf of respondent

Nos. 1 and 2, the stand taken is that the petitioner has no legal vested

right for another chance for allotment of plot in the Dyeing Zone

Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat, since the petitioner is a defaulter when

plot was allotted to it earlier. It has been asserted that the petitioner

was earlier allotted a Plot No. 190, Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat,

measuring 2100 square meters, vide allotment letter dated

28.11.2003. However, the petitioner failed to comply with clause No.

4 of the allotment letter and ultimately the allotment was cancelled

vide order dated 11.3.2005. The appeal filed by the petitioner was

also rejected. It has been further pointed out that the application

alongwith earnest money in response to the advertisement dated

11.7.2007 deposited by the petitioner has already been returned vide

Memo. No. 2156, dated 8.1.2008, because the allotment of plot made

earlier in favour of the petitioner was cancelled due to its failure to

comply with the conditions of the allotment letter and no fresh

opportunity could be afforded to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_13">10.          Mr. Ashwani Talwar, learned counsel for the petitioner

has argued that the position of the petitioner cannot be worst than

those from whom now applications have been invited by issuing

advertisement dated 11.7.2007 (P-1). Learned counsel has submitted

that the unit of the petitioner has been working at the old site and a

notice for shifting was issued by the Board on 21.9.2007 (P-9)

followed by another closure notice, dated 10.12.2007 (P-11). The

aforementioned notices were duly replied with a request that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> C.W.P. No. 971 of 2008                                                 8</span>

petitioner may be permitted to apply in response to the advertisement

dated 11.7.2007. He has emphasized that without its rehabilitation

the Board cannot direct the petitioner to stop its activity and pass an

order directing closure of the unit. Learned counsel has also drawn

our attention to the letter of the Chief Administrator, HUDA, which

has been addressed to the Estate Officer, HUDA, Panipat, dated

23.3.2006 (Annexure P-10 in the connected C.W.P. No. 1469 of

2008) stating that plot of the same size as recommended by the Board

should be allotted to all the units mentioned in the survey list because

the plots    have    been    carved   out   in   accordance     with       the

recommendations made by the Survey Team of the Board. Learned

counsel then submitted that the petitioner would be satisfied if Plot

No. 190, Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat, already allotted to the

petitioner's unit is re-allotted and it would not insist for allotment of a

plot measuring 15000 square meters, as per the recommendations

made by the Survey Team. Learned counsel also gave an undertaking

on behalf of the petitioner that they will not insist for refund of 5%

amount, which stand already forfeited and plot be re-allotted at the

current allotment price.
</p>
<p id="p_14">11.          Mr. Arun Walia, learned counsel for the respondents on

the other hand has contended that since the petitioner is a defaulter, it

cannot seek parity with those who do not come forward earlier. The

petitioner was given a chance to avail the allotment of plot, which

was availed by them but it has defaulted in making payment and the

plot was rightly resumed. They have further argued that once the

petitioner is a defaulter it cannot be put at even-keel with those who

have not been given a chance.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> C.W.P. No. 971 of 2008                                             9</span><p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">12.          After hearing learned counsel for the parties at a

considerable length, perusing the paper book and original record with

their able assistance we are inclined to examine the offer made by the

petitioner in the light of the facts and circumstances of the case. The

recommendation made by the Board for allotment was for a plot

measuring 15000 square meters and 5000 square meters respectively

in respect of both the petitioners. A legitimate argument could have

been raised by them that they are entitled to the allotment of a plot

equivalent to the size recommended by the Board. It is pertinent to

notice that the Board has recommended allotment of plot measuring

15000 square meters to M/s Acfoli INC and 5000 square meters to the

other petitioner, namely, M/s Gupta Textiles.          It was in the

aforementioned situation that the Chief Administrator, taking notice

of the grievance made by other allottees had directed on 23.3.2006

(P-10 in C.W.P. No. 1469 of 2008) to the concerned Estate Officer

that the plot of the same size as recommended by the Board should be

allotted to all the units mentioned in the survey list as the plots have

been carved out in accordance with the recommendation made by the

Board.   On that basis, the petitioners could have impugned the

allotment earlier made. Moreover, the respondent State has taken a

policy decision dated 26.2.2002, which is aimed at re-locating these

polluting units engaged in the dyeing and printing activities, which

are found to have contaminated the ground water. The object is to

provide pollution free atmosphere in the residential/non-conforming

areas and accordingly a 'Dyeing Zone' in Sector 29 Part-II has been

carved out. A time bound action plan to decongest the town has been

finalised and all these units are to be shifted to the 'Dyeing Zone'. It

is also undisputed that the names of the petitioners figure in the list of

494 units which have been identified. We are further of the view that

the advertisement dated 11.7.2007 indicate that a number of

entrepreneurs who figures in the list of 494 units and identified for

allotment of plots in the 'Dyeing Zone', did not come forward for

allotment of plots and one last chance has been given to them. If that

be so, then the petitioners, although defaulter earlier could also be

given a chance because it would advance the basic object of shifting

the polluting dyeing and printing units from the residential/non-

conforming areas of the Town to the newly craved out 'Dyeing Zone'.

It is in the light of the aforementioned factual position that we are

persuaded to accept the offer made by the petitioners through their

counsel that they may be re-allotted the plots of the sizes of the 2100

square meters and 5000 square meters respectively at the current

price. Therefore, we are inclined to accept that offer.
