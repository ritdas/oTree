<div class="doc_title">M.P. Pollution Control Board ... vs Vivek Dhvan on 6 February, 2017</div><pre id="pre_1">                                    M.Cr.C. No.4475/2016

06/02/2017</pre><p id="p_1"> :-
</p><p id="p_2">     Ms. Preeti Waghmare, learned counsel for the applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     Shri Sunil Kumar Sharma, learned counsel for the non-
applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     Argument of both the counsel heard finally.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     The applicant has filed the present petition under Section
378 (3) of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>. for grant of leave to appeal against the order
dated 28/08/2015 passed by ASJ, Rajgarh in criminal appeal
No.38/2013 whereby learned appellate Court reversed the
judgment dated 29/12/2012 passed by JMFC, Narsinghgarh,
District-Rajgarh in criminal case No.171/2007 and acquitted the
non-applicants from the charges under <a href="/doc/120844/" id="a_2">Section 44</a> readwith
25/26 of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control Pollution) Act</a>, 1974
(which shall be referred hereinafter as "Act").
</p>
<p id="p_6">2.   It is submitted by learned counsel for the applicant that
learned appellate Court has erred in considering the documents
annexed with the report filed by the applicant and also erred in
considering the fact that the non-applicants never disputed the
consent of filing complaint. It is further submitted that learned
appellate Court erred in not considering that the applicant -
Board is established under <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_4">Section 4</a> of the Act by State
Government and all the documents filed by Government are
also the Government documents. The non-applicants were
damaging the environment and indirectly playing with the
health of human being. Learned appellate Court did not
consider this fact and erred in acquitting the non-applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_7">3.   Per contra, learned counsel for the non-applicants have
                                     M.Cr.C. No.4475/2016

supported the judgment of learned appellate Court and
submitted that the applicant could not prove the charge before
the trial Court beyond reasonable doubt. Learned trial Court
failed to appreciate the evidence and the documents of the
applicant and also the evidence produced before it, therefore,
learned appellate Court has rightly reversed the judgment and
has passed a reasoned order duly supported by the
documents.
</p>
<p id="p_8">4.   I have considered the submissions of both the learned
counsel and gone through the record.
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.   Learned appellate Court acquitted the accused persons
mainly on the ground that the applicant could not establish
their case beyond reasonable doubt that the sample was taken
after following the due process envisaged under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_5">Section 21</a>
sub-<a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_6">section 2</a>, <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_7">3</a>, <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_8">4</a> or 5 of the Act. Further, it is found that
original documents had not been filed before the trial Court up
till the statement of complainant - Alok Kumar Jain (PW/1),
though these documents filed later-on and available with
record but these have been filed at a later stage and their filing
is also doubtful. Further, they have not put-up before the non-
applicant during the statement of accused. It is also found that
the consent requisite for filing of the prosecution/complaint
was also not proper. Learned appellate Court has discussed all
these grounds in para 14, 15 and 16 of the judgment. Finding
of learned appellate Court is fully supported by the documents
produced and available on record.
</p>
<p id="p_10">6.   Considering the aforesaid, I do not find any illegality or
                                             M.Cr.C. No.4475/2016

         impropriety in the judgment passed by learned appellate Court,
         therefore, I refrain myself to interfere with the judgment of the
         appellate Court. In my considered opinion, this is not the fit
         case to grant leave to appeal, therefore, leave is declined.
         Accordingly, petition stands dismissed and disposed off.
</p>
