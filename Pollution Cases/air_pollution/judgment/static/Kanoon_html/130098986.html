(By Sri Gururaj Joshi, Advocate)

     This WP is filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India, praying to quash the order dated
19.12.2018 passed by the R1 vide Annexure-A.

    This WP coming on for orders this day, NARAYANA
SWAMY J, passed the following:

                          ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     The     closure    order       dated   19.12.2018      vide

Annexure-A passed by the 1st respondent is called in

question.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.      The ground taken by the petitioner is that

the impugned order has been passed by the 1st

respondent    without   giving      an   opportunity   to   the

petitioner. Hence, this writ petition.


</p><p id="p_4">     3.      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits

that there is closure order passed by the respondents.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  3</span>


But the petitioner's applications for renewal of the

consent for operation of the film city under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_2">Section 21</a> of

the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981

and renewal of consent for operation of the film city

under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_4">Section 25</a> of the Water Act should have been

considered by the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">      4.    At   this   stage,       learned   counsel    for   the

respondents - Authorities submits that there is no

scope for renewal of the consent and the same might

have been considered prior to expiry of consent. In case

an application is made under the provisions of the Act,

the same should been considered afresh.                   Learned

counsel    submits      that   petitioner      would     have   an

opportunity to file an application under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_5">Section 33(B)</a> of

the Water Act.       But this opportunity has not been

availed by the petitioner.            Hence, on this ground,

petition is to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      5.    We    have     heard        the    learned    counsel

appearing for both the parties.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              4</span><p id="p_9">


</p><p id="p_10">      6.     The closure order has been passed during

the currency of the consent.       But the petitioner has

neither made any application for rectification nor

renewal of the consent. In the meanwhile, the closure

order becomes confirmed since the petitioner has

obtained the approval to run the film city in the year

2008.      The submission of the petitioner is that the

petitioner had made fresh petition under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_6">Section 25</a> of

the Water Act.       If such an application is made, the

competent Authority is directed to consider and pass an

appropriate order.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">      The respondent - Authorities are directed to

consider the applications vide Annexures-G and H

afresh and pass appropriate order. The petitioner shall

comply with the mandatory requirements under the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      The applications made by the petitioner shall be

considered within a period of three months from the

date of receipt of copy of this order.
