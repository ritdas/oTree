<p id="p_1">     W.P.C.No.17180 of 2012 is filed by certain persons

complaining of pollution caused by the 4th respondent

running a chicken farm and meat stall in his property. The

petitioners seeks a direction against respondents 1 to 3

namely the Panchayath, the Kerala Pollution Control Board

(in short PCB) and the District Medical Officer, the authorities

who refused licence or consent to conduct the chicken farm.

According to the petitioners, the chicken farm and meat stall

of the 4th respondent is causing large scale pollution,

nuisance and possibility of health hazards.

</p><p id="p_2">     2.   It is contended that though an application is filed

by the 4th respondent as Ext.P7, no permission was granted

by the Panchayath for conducting the chicken farm and the

PCB has also not given any such permission.

W.P.C.Nos.17180 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">and 1949 of 2013                2</span>


</p><p id="p_3">      3.     Counter affidavit is filed by the 3rd respondent

inter alia contending that on a visit made by the Medical

Officer, it was found that the saw dust, chicken feeds

excreta and feathers of chicken have spread inside and

outside the poultry shed which is creating foul smell up to

50 meters radius, causing air pollution and generating fly

breeding. It is also contended that during rainy season the

waste generated from the farm may flow to the natural

water source and contaminate it.         Hence 'No Objection

Certificate' was rejected by the District Medical Officer. The

petitioners rely upon Ext.P2 report of the District Medical

Officer in relation to the very same chicken farm.

</p><p id="p_4">      4.     The 4th respondent has filed a counter affidavit

inter alia contending that he has been conducting the farm

since 1991 and the petitioners started residence in the

locality subsequently.     According to him, the licence was

being renewed from time to time and though an application

was submitted for renewal of the licence for the period

W.P.C.Nos.17180 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">and 1949 of 2013                3</span>


2012-2013, the Panchayath has not taken any action and

therefore the 4th respondent has a deemed licence in terms

of Rule 3 of the Kerala Panchayath Raj (Issue of Licence to

Dangerous and Offensive Trades and Factories) Rules, 1996

(hereinafter referred to as the 'D &amp; O Rules'). 4th respondent

also produced Ext.R4(c) which is a consent given by the PCB

on 26/06/2012 valid up to 31/12/2015 under the Air

(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, the Water

(Prevention      &amp;    <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,    1974  and

Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986.           It is further

contended that there are no nearby residences within 50

meters of the property of the petitioner and the chicken

farm is being conducted within an area of 2 acres.         He

denied the contention that any pollution is caused to the

nearby area and the farm as well as the meat stall is kept

very neat and clean. He also referred to Ext.R4(e), a No

Objection Certificate issued by the Medical Officer in-charge

of a Primary Health Centre indicating that the chicken farm

W.P.C.Nos.17180 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">and 1949 of 2013                4</span>


and the meat stall is being conducted in a hygienic manner.

</p><p id="p_5">      5.     W.P.C.No.1949 of 2013 is filed by the 4th

respondent in W.P.C.No.17180 of 2012 challenging the

report given by the 1st respondent District Medical Officer

inter alia indicating that the chicken farm cannot be

established as it causes pollution in the nearby locality.

Ext.P8 is the said report.    In Ext.P8, the District Medical

Officer had come to the conclusion that within 50 meters

radius of the chicken farm and slaughter house, there are

more than nine residences and the nearest water source of

chicken farm is about 30 meters. It is stated that during the

inspection, chicken feeds excreta and feathers of chicken

were found in the area and the chicken farm and slaughter

area were not kept in a hygienic condition. Therefore, it is

observed that the chicken farm and slaughter house is

causing nuisance to the people in the neighbouring locality.

</p><p id="p_6">      6.     Counter affidavit is filed on behalf of the 1st

respondent, DMO supporting the stand taken in Ext.P8.

W.P.C.Nos.17180 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">and 1949 of 2013                 5</span>


They also produced Ext.R1(a) Government order G.O.(Rt)

No.631/2009/ID/Tvm. dated 25/09/2009 to indicate that

certain instructions had been given to the Panchayat to

consider      the    issue relating to a  poultry farm   in

Thrikkodithanam Grama Panchayath.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      7.     The 2nd respondent, Panchayath has filed a

counter affidavit reiterating the contentions urged by the

DMO. According to them, necessary steps had been taken

to avoid pollution in the said area and they did not grant

licence to the petitioner on account of the report of the

DMO.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      8.     Heard the learned counsel appearing for the

parties and the learned Government Pleader.

</p><p id="p_9">      9.     At the outset, it is relevant to note that the

petitioner in W.P.C.No.1949 of 2013 is liable to obtain

licence from the Panchayath in terms of Section 232 of the

Kerala Panchayath Raj Act read with the D &amp; O Rules and

therefore it is obligatory on the part of the petitioner to

W.P.C.Nos.17180 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">and 1949 of 2013                6</span>


obtain a licence from the local authority.

</p><p id="p_10">      10. Parties are hereinafter referred to as shown in

W.P.C.No.1949 of 2013, unless otherwise stated.

</p><p id="p_11">      11. It is not in dispute that the petitioner had a licence

during the period 2011-2012. He had applied for a licence

as per Ext.P3 dated 11/04/2013 for the period 2012-2013,

but Ext.P3 has not been considered or rejected by the

Panchayath. Going by Section 236(3) of the Panchayath Raj

Act and Rule 12(3) of the D&amp; O Rules, it cannot be disputed

that the petitioner has a deemed licence. Then the next

question is about the impact of the report of the DMO. On a

perusal of the Rules relating to the conducting of meat stall

in addition to compliance of the licence conditions under the

D &amp; O Rules for conducting a meat stall, the petitioner has to

comply with the provisions of the Kerala Panchayath Raj

(Slaughter House And Meat Stalls) Rules, 1996 in respect of

conducting a meat stall for vending of bird meat. Rule 38

applies which reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_12">W.P.C.Nos.17180 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">and 1949 of 2013                   7</span>


</p><p id="p_13">                   38. Location of Meat Stalls.- A stall

             to vend meat of bird or animal in a

             Panchayath area shall be located in a place

             approved by the Village Panchayath for that

             purpose.   Meat stall shall be one covered

             with glass, inaccessible to insects like

             houseflies and also having abundant air

             circulation and meat shall be kept in a

             manner not visible to the lay public and the

             Licensee of the stall shall exhibit a board in

             front of the stall, visible to others, specifying

             his name, number of the stall and price

             chart."
</p>
<p id="p_14">      12. Rule 39 imposes an obligation on the part of the

examining authority or President or Secretary or any officer

authorised by the Village Panchayath or Government to

inspect the meat which is kept for sale. Rule 39 reads as

under:
</p>
                   39. Power to inspect meat stalls.-<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">             The Examining Authority or President or

             Secretary or any officer authorised by the

             Village Panchayath or Government shall have

W.P.C.Nos.17180 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">and 1949 of 2013                 8</span>


             power to inspect the meat kept for sale and

             to seize and destroy the meat which is seen

             as disease caused or unfit for consumption.

             The amount required for such destruction

             shall be levied as mentioned in Rule 11.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      13. Therefore, before conducting a meat stall, there is

an obligation on the part of the person conducting the stall

to obtain a licence from the Panchayath. Apparently, the

petitioner has not obtained the said licence even now.

There is nothing either in the aforesaid Rules or in the D &amp; O

Rules to indicate that the DMO has to give a report

regarding the functioning of the meat stall or the farm house

as the case may be.             Under Rule 39 of the Kerala

Panchayath Raj (Slaughter House And Meat Stalls) Rules,

1996, it is open for the examining authority to inspect the

meat kept for sale and to seize and destroy the meat if it is

having any disease or is unfit for consumption. This Rule

does not give any power to such examining authority which

includes Officers of Health Services to give a report as

W.P.C.Nos.17180 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">and 1949 of 2013               9</span>


contemplated in the impugned report.         That being the

situation, probably it is open for the Panchayath to call for

the report from the DMO to find out whether there is any

nuisance or pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      14. The fact remains that PCB has already permitted

the petitioner to establish a chicken farm and also to have a

meat stall in the said farm. It is therefore the obligation of

the PCB to verify and ensure that the farm is being

conducted in the manner prescribed as per the consent to

establish given by the PCB.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      15. As far as the Panchayath is concerned, the

Panchayath has an obligation to grant licence if an

application is filed in time.   As matters stand today, the

petitioner has a deemed licence for running the farm. He

does not have a licence to conduct the meat stall. While

conducting the farm, the petitioner has to comply with the

procedure prescribed by the PCB and to ensure that no

nuisance or pollution is caused to the nearby area or nearby

W.P.C.Nos.17180 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">and 1949 of 2013               10</span>


residences. The petitioner has a case that the very factual

basis on which the DMO had given Ext.P8 report is incorrect

especially in view of the fact that there are no residences

within a distance of 100 meters of his farm. That apart, it

seems that DMO proceeded on the basis that a specified

distance is required from the nearby residents since the

petitioner is having a slaughter house. In fact, there is no

such restriction under the Kerala Panchayath Raj (Slaughter

House And Meat Stalls) Rules, 1996. Hence it is not open for

the authority to prevent the farm from functioning. The Rule

only requires for a licence to conduct a meat stall under Rule

38 and no specific distance factor is mentioned in the said

Rules.
