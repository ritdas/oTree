    Factory, Barmana, in taking measures for checking





    pollution, rehabilitation and resettlement of aggrieved

    persons. Plight of the residents of village Salapar and the

    adjoining villages, falling within District Mandi, stands





    highlighted. Even though the aerial distance of Salapar is

    far less than the villages of District Bilaspur, yet

    measures of rehabilitation/resettlement and checking

    pollution for the villages of District Mandi, which in fact,

    are in close proximity, stand ignored by the authorities


    concerned. Accordingly, prayer is made for issuance of

    direction to the management of ACC Factory to provide




    financial assistance for development of the village.

<p id="p_12">    3.         Deputy Commissioner, Bilaspur, in his affidavit

    dated 18.03.2018, has pointed out that cement plant





    stands established by M/s ACC Limited.               The project

    proponent has established two units, one in the year,

    1984 and another in the year, 1994 with the carrying

    capacity of 4.64 Crores for both the plants. The entire

    cement, in which 1750 persons are engaged.                                    The

    industrial unit has obtained mandatory consents to

</p>
<p id="p_14">    4.           Crucially,        it    stands         admitted      that     Gram





    Panchayat Salapar starts from just at a distance of 3 kms

    from the cement factory with an aerial distance of 400-
</p>
<p id="p_15">    500 meters. According to this deponent, no pollution is

    caused, in any of the Panchayats, falling in his District,

    for   the   project       proponent            has     installed       requisite


    machinery so required to meet the conditions imposed

    by the Himachal Pradesh State Pollution Control Board




    and the one envisaged under the environmental laws of





    the land.

    responsibility is concerned, it stands admitted that in

    three Panchayats of Barmana falling in District Bilaspur,

    endeavour has been taken by the project proponent.

<p id="p_17">    6.         But what is crucial in his affidavit, is constant

    grievances vented out by the general public with regard

    to pollution caused by the project proponent on account




                                                           .
</p><p id="p_18">    of blasting, which even according to the deponent





    requires elaborate study. Also it stands pointed out that





    the National Green Tribunal is seized of such matter.
</p>
<p id="p_19">    7.         When     we    peruse      the      affidavit       dated

    13.03.2018, filed by the Deputy Commissioner, Mandi,





    we find the position to be totally different.             With the

    establishment of the cement plant, flora and fauna

    stands adversely affected so also the health of the

    people   leading   to    peculiar     problems/diseases              of

    Tuberculosis, Asthma and Malaria. Also issue of sound


    pollution stands raised by the natives.

<p id="p_20">    8.         In the affidavit dated 17.03.2018, filed by the




    Senior Environmental Engineer, H.P. State Pollution





    Control Board, Shimla, the Board has simply reiterated

    the view taken by the Deputy Commissioner, Bilaspur,





    H.P.
</p>
<p id="p_21">    9.         We find that M/s ACC limited is not a party in

    the present proceedings. Also the matter of pollution is

    pending consideration with the National Green Tribunal.

<p id="p_22">    But insofar as the duty of the State and the Regulator for

    enforcement of environmental law is concerned, we are

    of the considered view that the grievances of the
