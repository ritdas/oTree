<p id="p_7">      FACTS

</p><p id="p_8">      2.            The adumbrated facts leading to the writ petition is

      that the opposite party No.3 made Advertisement No.1/2003 for

      recruitment of ad hoc Additional District Judges under the Orissa

      Judicial Service (Special Scheme) Rules, 2001 (hereinafter called
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>


"the Rules, 2001") as per the direction of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in T.C. (Civil) No.22 of 2001 [<a href="/doc/1017222/" id="a_1">Brij Mohan Lal v. Union of

India and others</a>; (2002) 5 SCC] (hereinafter called "Brij

Mohan Lal-I"). After qualifying in written examination, as per

the Advertisement, the petitioner along with some of the opposite

parties were called to viva voce test. During viva voce the present

petitioner along with four other candidates were not found

selected. So, the petitioner along with other candidates filed writ

application bearing W.P.(C) No.2780 of 2004 before this Court.

This Court delivered judgment on 9.9.2005 directing the Registry

to consider the petitioner and other similarly situated candidates

for appointment as Ad hoc Additional District Judges. At the same

time, the appointment of opposite party Nos.6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 were quashed. So, the Orissa High

Court filed S.L.P. (C) 19938 of 2005, State filed S.L.P. (C) 20046

of 2005 and those opposite parties whose appointments were

quashed also filed S.L.P. (C) 20421 of 2005 in the Supreme Court.

The Hon'ble Apex Court upheld the judgment of this Court passed

in W.P. (C) No.2780 of 2004. Accordingly the petitioner was issued

with the appointment order on 27.12.2005 vide Annexure-3 as Ad

hoc Additional District Judge of the Fast Track Court created under

11th Finance Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_9">3.         Be it stated that after Brij Mohan Lal-(1) final
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      4</span>


Judgment was passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in T.C.

(Civil) No.22 of 2001, <a href="/doc/1017222/" id="a_2">Brij Mohan Lal v. Union of India and

others</a>; (2012) 6 SCC 502 (hereinafter called "Brij Mohan Lal-

(2) on 19.4.2012. By virtue of the said judgment direction was

issued to regularize the services of Ad hoc Additional District

Judges by holding an examination in the manner prescribed by

the Hon'ble Apex Court. It is specifically mentioned in that

judgment   that      while   High   Court      would   consider   to   give

appointment to these applicants, must keep in mind that these

applicants have put in number of years as Fast Track Court Judges

and served the country by administering justice in accordance

with law. In accordance with the direction of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court, the Orissa High Court issued notification directing the

serving   Ad   hoc    Additional    District    Judges   (ADJ)    including

petitioner as Ad hoc ADJs who have been terminated by virtue of

the judgment of this Court passed in W.P.(C) No.2780 of 2004 and

some of the Judicial Officers of the Fast Track Court who have

served for short while and tendered resignation.

</p><p id="p_10">4.         Be it further stated that the Judicial Officers who were

not found suitable by virtue of the order of this Court in W.P.(C)

No.2780 of 2004 were also found eligible to appear in the

examination for appointment as direct District Judges under the

order of the Supreme Court and is also challenged in this writ
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  5</span>


petition. However, in the writ petition it is specifically submitted

that the petitioner along with some Additional District Judges in

the Fast Track Courts serving for more than seven years could not

succeed in the written examination whereas opposite party

Nos.13, 14 and 15 who were thrown out of service as per the

order of this Court in W.P.(C) No.2780 of 2004 were found

qualified in the written test.
</p>
<p id="p_11">5.          In the Brij Mohan Lal-(2), the modalities for

examination have been well prescribed at Para 207.9 (c) that

there shall be 150 marks for the written examination and 100

marks for the interview and the qualifying marks shall be 40%

aggregate for general candidates and 35% for SC/ST/OBC

candidates. But the opposite party No.3 issued notification on

6.12.2012 inviting ad hoc Additional District Judges of the Fast

Track Court prescribing the qualifying marks as 40% in aggregate

for general candidates and 35% for SC/ST/OBC candidates in

each paper in utter disregard to the direction issued in Brij

Mohan Lal-(2) case. It is not out of place to mention that vide

Advertisement No.1/2000, the minimum qualifying marks in two

written papers with 50% each paper and those who qualified in

the written test were called for viva voce. In that test only two

candidates were selected and rest of the candidates securing

below such cut off marks were recruited as ad hoc Additional
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    6</span>


District Judges in Fast Track Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_12">6.          During     that    appointment     some    unsuccessful

candidates filed writ petition vide W.P.(C) No.10635 of 2003

whereunder this Court disapproved the Full Court proceeding

about lowering down the standard of merit and objected to

selection of seven candidates as Fast Track Court Additional

District Judges. Against that judgment S.L.P. (C) No.16335 of

2008 was filed where a stay was granted temporarily to the

operation of the judgment of this Court. So, those candidates

whose appointment as Fast Track Additional District Judges were

quashed were also called to the written examination in question

and after their success, they were called to viva voce test

purportedly held on 8.2.2013 to regularize their service as

Additional District Judges which is illegal.

</p><p id="p_13">7.          Be it stated that while the petitioner and other

similarly situated candidates were allowed by the order of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court at different occasion to continue as Fast

Track Court Additional District Judges with further direction to

consider their absorption as direct District Judges, the direction to

ask the petitioner and other similarly situated persons to qualify

in the written examination again under the order of the Brij

Mohan Lal-(2) is not acceptable. So, the writ petition is filed to

declare the impugned examination for regularization of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  7</span>


Additional District Judges of the Fast Track Court as illegal and

void. It is further prayed not to allow opposite party No.3 to hold

viva voce examination during pendency of the writ petition and to

allow the petitioner to continue as Additional District Judge until

further order.
</p>
<p id="p_14">SUBMISSIONS:
</p>
<p id="p_15">8.          Learned counsel for the petitioner precisely argued

that the petitioner has been duly qualified to be the Additional

District Judge of the Fast Track Court after undergoing the regular

examination held for appointment of the District Judges directly

from Bar in 2003 and petitioner has rendered nine years of

service by the time the impugned examination for regularization

of the District Judges are held in 2012. He further submitted that

when the petitioner has been appointed as Ad hoc Additional

District Judge and posted at several places in view of order in

case of Brij Mohan Lal-(1) and the case filed by Madhumita

Das, the service of the petitioner was not affected and there is

clear direction in those cases by the Hon'ble Apex Court for

regularization of service of petitioner and similarly situated

persons. Thus, the advertisement made by the Hon'ble High Court

in 2012 is grossly erroneous.
</p>
<p id="p_16">9.          Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted

that the advertisement made by opposite party No.3 in pursuance
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  8</span>


of the direction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in       Brij Mohan

Lal-(2) invited not only the petitioner and other serving Fast

Track Court Additional District Judges but also the Additional

District Judges who were removed by virtue of the order of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in earlier occasion and the Fast Track

Additional District Judges who left the job, thus create confusion

to fulfill the real spirit of the judgment in Brij Mohan Lal-(2). It

is the sole object of the judgment of Brij Mohan Lal-(2) that the

Judges of Fast Track Court who were continuing should be only

called to formal test as they have put in good number of years as

Additional District Judges of Fast Track Court and rendered justice

to the people.
</p>
<p id="p_17">10.        Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted

that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has clearly held in Brij Mohan

Lal-(2) that while regularizing the service of ad hoc Additional

District Judges of the Fast Track Court, the High Court must keep

in mind that they have rendered justice to the public for some

years and for that aggregate mark for the written and viva should

be 40% for general candidates and 35% for SC/ST/OBC but never

directed for 40% or 35% marks for respective category of

persons as the case may be in each paper separately and 40%

marks for the viva voce which were advertised by the opposite

party No.3 for selection of the petitioner and other similarly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  9</span>


situated persons vide impugned notification dated 6.12.2012

under Annexure-H series.
</p>
<p id="p_18">11.        Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

while the petitioner was discharging his duties as Ad hoc

Additional District Judge of the Court, same has been well

appreciated by the superior Courts including the Hon'ble Apex

Court, the discontinuance of the job of the petitioner who have

rendered service successfully as Ad hoc Additional District Judge

would not only smack the spirit of the judicial service but also

against the justice delivery system. So, he prayed to declare the

examination held in pursuance of the notification dated 6.12.2012

by the opposite party Nos.1 to 3 as illegal and void and the

petitioner should be allowed to continue in service.

</p><p id="p_19">12.        Learned Additional Government Advocate supporting

the counter submitted that the impugned examination has been

conducted in pursuance of the direction of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court passed in Brij Mohan Lal-(2) on 19.4.2012. He further

submitted that the service rendered by the petitioner as Ad hoc

Additional District Judge of the Fast Track Court is nothing but a

temporary service and at no point of time his service has been

regularized and it has been only extended from time to time by

notification of the State Government on the recommendation of

the Hon'ble High Court.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                    10</span><p id="p_20">


</p><p id="p_21">13.        Learned    Additional    Government   Advocate   further

submitted that in the judgment dated 19.4.2012 in Brij Mohan

Lal-(2) it has been clearly directed to allow all sitting or former

Fast Track Court Judges who were directly appointed from the Bar

to sit at the recruitment examination and accordingly the opposite

party Nos.1 to 3 have obeyed the order. Since the direction of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in Brij Mohan Lal-(2) is the

culmination of all the interim orders either passed in Brij Mohan

Lal-(I) or in case of Madhumita Das, such final judgment on Fast

Track Court Scheme is binding on the parties. Since it is direct

competition within all the Judges recruited under Fast Track Court

Scheme and Fast Track Court Scheme was scrapped by the

Central Government, there is no illegality committed by the

opposite party Nos.1 to 3 to allow the petitioner along with other

opposite patties to take part in the Examination.

</p><p id="p_22">14.        Learned    Additional    Government   Advocate   further

submitted that the advertisement made for regularization of the

service of the ad hoc Additional District Judges of Fast Track Court

is thoroughly in accordance with the modalities directed by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in Brij Mohan Lal-(2) because the

Hon'ble Supreme Court has directed to keep 150 marks for

written examination and 100 marks for viva voce and same has

been also advertised vide Annexure-H series. Moreover, for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                    11</span>


written    examination    aggregate     mark     of     40%   for   general

candidates and 35% for SC/ST/OBC candidates in each paper out

of 150 marks and 40% for the viva voce as per the Orissa

Superior Judicial Service and Orissa Judicial Service Rules, 2007

have been kept in accordance with the directive of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court. So, he submitted that there is no illegality in the

advertisement for recruitment/absorption of the Ad hoc Additional

District Judges to the post of regular Additional District Judges.

Hence, he prayed to dismiss the writ petition.

</p><p id="p_23">15.          MAIN POINT FOR CONSIDERATION:
</p>
<p id="p_24">(I)     Whether the petitioner is entitled to continue as regular

Additional District Judge since he has already been selected and

continued as Ad hoc Additional District Judge in the Fast Track

Courts ?
</p>
<p id="p_25">(II)    Whether    the    examination     held        for   absorption   or

regualrisation of the Ad hoc Additional District Judges under Fast

Track Court Scheme as regular Additional District Judges is legal

and proper ?
</p>
<p id="p_26">DISCUSSION:
</p><p id="p_27">POINT NO.(I)

</p><p id="p_28">16.          It is not in dispute that in <a href="/doc/1017222/" id="a_3">Brij Mohan Lal v. Union

of     India-(I</a>)   case   the   Hon'ble   Apex        Court   directed   for

appointment of three categories of Ad hoc Additional District

Judges for ensuring quick dispension of justice through Fast Track

Court under 11th Finance Commission. It is admitted fact that one

of the category of appointment of Ad hoc Additional District

Judges was direct from Bar besides Judicial Officers having been

given ad hoc promotion from eligible Judicial Officers subject to

their suitability and retired Judicial Officers having good service

record maintained. It is also clear from the pleadings of both the

parties that the members appointed from Bar directly should be

preferably in the age group of 35 to 45 years so that they can

continue against the regular post if the Fast Track Courts ceased

to function. In order to carry out the order of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, the State of Orissa on 22.2.2003 made Orissa

Judicial Service (Special Scheme) Rules, 2001. It is also admitted

fact that there was Advertisement No.1/2003 for recruitment of

ad hoc Additional District Judges for Fast Track Courts under said

Rules 2001 on 14.11.2003. On 7.1.2004 petitioner along with

seven candidates cleared the written examination.

</p><p id="p_29">17.        It is revealed from the pleadings of both the parties

that on 8.1.2004 the Full Court proceedings of this Court lowered

down the minimum cut off mark in written examination and called

31 more candidates for interview. In that Examination there was

cutoff marks for viva voce as 40%. As such on 26.7.2004 the

Home Department issued appointment letter in favour of 15
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                 13</span>


candidates as ad hoc Additional District Judges vide Annexure-2.

So, one Madhumita Das along with Kashinath Rout who qualified

in the written test but failed in the viva voce, challenged the said

appointment of 15 candidates on various grounds including the

decision of the Full Court for lowering down the minimum

percentage of qualifying marks in written examination from 50%

to 35% in each paper and 40% in aggregate and fixing minimum

qualifying marks in the viva voce test.
</p>
<p id="p_30">18.        As stated above, it is admitted fact that the Court

allowed the said writ petition filed by Madhumita and Kasinath

directing to quash the appointment and to consider afresh the

candidates who have secured more than 50% of marks in each

paper in the written examination. It is further revealed from both

the pleadings that against the judgment of this Court, the High

Court filed S.L.P.(C) 19938 of 2005, State filed S.L.P.(C) 20046 of

2005 and those candidates who lost the job as Ad hoc Additional

District Judges filed S.L.P. (C) No.20421 of 2005 in the Hon'ble

Supreme Court. All the three petitions were considered and the

judgment of this Court passed in W.P.(C) No.2780 of 2004 was

upheld. Hence, a fresh appointment for five candidates including

the petitioner were issued vide Annexure-3. The appointment of

the present petitioner is reproduced below:

the   Rules     of    2001     enacted      are   related     to    temporary

appointments. Rule 3 of the Orissa Rules 2001 provides that

notwithstanding anything contained in the Orissa Superior Judicial

Service Rules, 1963 and Orissa Judicial Service Rules, 1994, the

appointment of Additional District Judges was on ad hoc and

purely temporary basis for implementation of the FTC Scheme.

Rule 4 of said Rules contemplates that the appointment made

under these Rules shall be purely on ad hoc basis and is liable to

be terminated at any time without any prior notice. In 2003 such

Scheme was amended permitting the selection of members from

the Bar by way of direct recruitment while the Hon'ble Supreme

Court directed in Brij Mohan Lal-(1). In clear way in Brij

Mohan Lal-(2) (supra) it has been observed by Their Lordships

Judges under FTC Scheme does not give any right to the FTC

Judges for being appointed on regular basis as they have to face

the recruitment again under the Rules meant for appointment to

the post of Additional District Judges under erstwhile Orissa

Superior Judicial Service Rules, 1963. However, it is pleaded by

the learned counsel for the petitioner that there is order of the

Hon'ble Apex Court for absorbing the Ad hoc Additional District

Judges against regular vacancy without facing any examination as

directed in case of Brij Mohan Lal-(1) and the case filed by

<a href="/doc/1203803/" id="a_4">Madhumita Das and others v. State of Orissa</a>. It may be more

appropriate to quote paragraphs-21, 22, 23 and 24 of the

judgment in Brij Mohan Lal-(2) to meet the argument of the

learned counsel for the petitioner:
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">           "21. Now, we may notice another group of cases
         where the prayer made is diametrically opposite to that
         made in the case of Brij Mohan Lal (supra). The
         petitioners in Writ Petition (C) No.261 of 2008 titled
         <a href="/doc/628961/" id="a_5">Sovan Kumar Dash v. State of Orissa</a> have approached
         this Court directly under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_6">Article 32</a> of the Constitution
         with a prayer that they should be absorbed against
         vacant posts in the regular cadre as per the directions
         contained in Brij Mohan Lal case; (2002) 5 SCC 1.</blockquote><p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">         They further made a prayer that the Notification dated
         11-4-2008 issued by the State of Orissa calling for
         applications   from   eligible   candidates   for   direct
         recruitment from the Bar to the cadre of the District
         Judge be quashed. These petitioners have taken the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                               17</span>


plea that they have already crossed the eligibility
condition of age.
</p>
<p id="p_39">   22. Similarly, another set of petitioners have also
filed   Writ    Petition   (C)     No.250    of    2008       titled
<a href="/doc/1722737/" id="a_7">Madhumita Das v. State of Orissa</a>. The petitioners
therein were working as FTC Judges. While invoking the
writ jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_8">Article 32</a> of the
Constitution,    they prayed       that    they be      absorbed
against the regular vacancies of the State cadre of
District    Judges.    They      further    prayed     that     the
abovementioned         advertisement       dated     11-4-2008,
inviting applications for all the posts of District Judges
including the posts against which the petitioners were
working, be quashed. It is the contention of the
petitioners in this petition that they have already
attained an age more than the higher age limit
prescribed while working as ad hoc Judges of the FTCs.
Also, while judging the performance of the FTC Judges,
the condition of completion of eight sessions trials per
month cannot be imposed as it has not so been
imposed against the judges who are forming the
regular cadre of the State services.
</p>
<p id="p_40">   23. In this petition, no final order has been passed
by this Court. However, at the interim stage, when the
Writ Petition came up for hearing on 11-6-2008, this
Court passed the following order: (Madhumita Das case
(2008) 6 SCC 731, SCC pp.731-32, paras 1-4)

            "1. Issue notice.
</p><p id="p_41">            2. Challenge in these writ petitions is to
   Advertisement 1 of 2008 issued by the Orissa High
   Court.      The   petitioners   have     been     selected    to
   function as ad hoc Additional District Judges in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                              18</span>


terms of the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/1017222/" id="a_9">Brij Mohan
Lal vs. Union of India and Ors</a>. [(2002) 5 SCC
1]. It is their grievance that 16 posts advertised
also include the 9 posts presently held by the
petitioners in the two writ petitions. It is pointed out
that     the      eligibility      criterion    fixed     in     the
advertisement rules out the present petitioners.
Firstly, some of them are above the maximum age
of 45 years and secondly, being Judicial Officers,
they cannot apply for posts advertised for members
of the Bar. It is also pointed out that in terms of
what has been stated by this Court in Brij Mohan's
case (supra), at para 10, Direction 4, they are to be
continued (in the ad hoc posts) belonging to the
Fast Track Courts, and, thereafter, in respect of
regular posts available, after the Fast Track Courts
cease to function. Their cases are to be considered
subject      to     their       performance       being        found
satisfactory. Their stand is that they have been
continued      from time           to   time. Obviously,       their
performance was found to be satisfactory. Presently,
we are not concerned with that question which may
have relevance only at the time of considering their
absorption in respect of the regular vacancies.
</p><p id="p_42">         3. It is submitted by Mr. Uday U. Lalit, learned
senior      counsel         that        while   assessing        the
performance, there cannot be different yardsticks,
i.e. same parameters have to be adopted while
judging the performance of the petitioners viz-a-viz
those which are recruited from another source, i.e.
from     amongst       the      Judicial    Officers.   We      find
substance in this plea also. Therefore, we direct that
the process of selection pursuant to Advertisement
1 of 2008 may continue but that shall only be in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                        19</span>


          respect of 7 posts, and not in respect of 9 posts
          presently held by the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_43">                 4. It is pointed out that the High Court, after
          the advertisement [has] been issued has issued
          certain     letters       regarding   the        non-disposal      of
          adequate number of cases. The petitioners have
          given reasons as to why there could not be
          adequate disposal of the cases. Needless to say, the
          High Court shall consider the stand taken in the
          responses         while     judging      their    suitability      for
          appointment on regular basis. The petitioners shall
          continue to hold the posts until further orders, for
          which necessary orders shall be passed by the High
          Court. It is made clear that as and when regular
          vacancies arise, cases of the petitioners shall be
          duly considered. There shall not be any need for
          them to appear in any examination meant for
          recruitment to the cadre of District Judge."

</p><p id="p_44">               24.    As is evident from the above order in
          Madhumita Das case, (2008) 6 SCC 731, the cases
          of the petitioners were directed to be considered as
          and when the regular vacancies arose and they did
          not need to appear in any examination meant for
          recruitment to that post. This order of the Court has
          been relied upon by all the petitioners in different
          matters before this Court who are or were working
          as    FTC        Judges     and    are     praying     for      their
          regularization in the service. This was an interim
          order subject to the final order that the Court would
          pass while disposing of the writ petition finally."

</p><p id="p_45">22.       From       the    aforesaid       observations        of     the    Hon'ble

Supreme Court in Brij Mohan Lal-(2), it is clear that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                   20</span>


observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court as contended by the

learned counsel for the petitioner were interim order and same

are subject to final order passed in Brij Mohan Lal-(2).

</p><p id="p_46">23.        In Brij Mohan Lal-(2), it is clearly maintained at

paragraphs-91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96 and 97 in the following

manner:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                 "91. It is believed that, where Rule of Law
           prevails, there can be nothing like unfettered
           discretion or unaccountable action. The degree of
           reasoning required in support of the decision may
           vary. The degree of scrutiny during judicial review
           may vary. But the need for reasoning exists. As a
           result, when the Constitution of India provides that
           some offices will be held during the pleasure of the
           President,   without   any   express   limitations   or
           restrictions, this power should, however, necessarily
           be read as being subject to the fundamentals of
           constitutionalism. (<a href="/doc/1471968/" id="a_10">Refer B.P. Singhal v. Union of
           India</a> (2010) 6 SCC 331).</blockquote><p id="p_47">

</p><p id="p_48">              92. We must also notice another settled position
           of law, stated by this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1134697/" id="a_11">Union of
           India &amp; Anr. v. Tulsiram Patel</a> [(1985) 3 SCC
           398], that the origin of Government services is
           contractual. There is an offer and acceptance in
           every case. But once appointed to his post or office,
           the Government servant acquires a status and his
           rights and obligations are no longer determined by
           the consent of both the parties, but by the statute
           or statutory rules as framed and unilaterally altered
           by the Government. In other words, the legal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                         21</span>


position of a Government servant is more one of
status than that of contract.
</p>
<p id="p_49">  93.    Therefore, the appointees do not have an
absolute right to the post, but we would have to
consider the effect of the judgments of this Court in
Madhumita Das (supra) and Brij Mohan Lal
(supra) to examine if the petitioners in these cases
are entitled to any relief or not.
</p>
<p id="p_50">  94. Before we enter into discussion upon that
aspect of the case, it will be necessary for us to
deliberate on the question whether a writ of
mandamus can at all be issued in this case and, if
so, its scope. Needless to say, the origin of the FTC
Scheme was in a policy decision by the Central
Government. The Central Government had taken a
decision to implement the FTC Scheme, particularly
to deal with the arrears of criminal cases in the
country and it had taken unto itself the burden of
financing the entire scheme. It was to incur all
infrastructural   and   recurring    expenditures    for
implementation of the FTC Scheme. Examined from
any point of view, it was a policy decision of the
Union of India, which was accepted by the various
State Governments, which in turn implemented this
policy by appointing ad hoc Judges to preside over
FTCs. These appointments were made by three
different   methods:    from    amongst   the   retired
Judges, by promotion from Civil Judges (Senior
Division), and by direct recruitment from the Bar.

</p><p id="p_51">  95.   The Central Government then has taken a
decision not to finance the FTC Scheme beyond 31-
3-2011. However, some of the State Governments
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                               22</span>


have still taken a decision at their own level to
continue with the FTC Scheme, for the time being.
None of the States appearing before us have stated
that, as a matter of policy or otherwise, they have
decided to continue the FTC Scheme at their own
expense        as   a    permanent          feature    of    Justice
Administration System.
</p>
<p id="p_52">  96.    It is a settled principle of law that matters
relating to framing and implementation of policy
primarily fall in the domain of the Government. It is
an established requirement of good governance that
the Government should frame policies which are fair
and     beneficial       to   the    public     at    large.     The
Government enjoys freedom in relation to framing
of policies. It is for the Government to adopt any
particular policy as it may deem fit and proper and
the law gives it liberty and freedom in framing the
same.     Normally,       the      Courts    would     decline    to
exercise the power of judicial review in relation to
such matters. But this general rule is not free from
exceptions. The Courts have repeatedly taken the
view that they would not refuse to adjudicate upon
policy matters if the policy decisions are arbitrary,
capricious or mala fide.
</p>
<p id="p_53">  97. In bringing out the distinction between policy
matters amenable to judicial review and those
where the Courts would decline to exercise their
jurisdiction, this Court, in <a href="/doc/125596/" id="a_12">Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.
v. Union of India</a> [(1972) 2 SCC 788], held as
under: (SCC p.834, para 125)
           "125.        ... The argument of the petitioners
        that    Government           should     have        accorded
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                    23</span>


                greater priority to the import of newsprint to
                supply the need of all newspaper proprietors
                to the maximum extent is a matter relating to
                the policy of import and this Court cannot be
                propelled   into   the   unchartered   ocean   of
                governmental policy."
</p>
<p id="p_54">24.        With due regard to the said observation of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, it is clear that the Fast Track Court Scheme was

only floated by the Central Government for temporary purpose

and the Judges were appointed till the Scheme was continued.

When the Scheme came to an end by the Central Government on

31.3.2011, such Judges appointed under FTC Scheme have no

right to continue in service except as propounded by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in their final judgment in Brij Mohan Lal-(2). In

Brij Mohan Lal-(2), at paragraphs-205, 206 and 207 Their

Lordships observed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">             "205. Thus, these two orders must be seen in the
           light of the fact that the Union of India, as well as
           the State Governments of their own, extended the
           FTC Scheme for another five years i.e. till 2010 and
           thereafter, by another year. The Central Government
           ultimately took the decision not to finance the FTC
           Scheme    with   effect      from   30-3-2011.   Even
           thereafter, a number of States have taken the
           decision to continue the FTC Scheme while retaining
           the appointees thereto till 2012, 2013 and even till
           2016. The State of Haryana has even thought of
           making it as a permanent feature of dispensation of
           justice in the State. The cumulative effect of all
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                           24</span>


these factors is that the petitioners had a legitimate
expectation that either their services would be
continued as the FTC Scheme would be made a
permanent feature of the justice administration in
the State concerned or they would be absorbed in
the regular cadre. But mere expectation or even
legitimate expectation of absorption cannot be a
cause    of    action    for   claiming       the    relief    of
regularization,      particularly   when      the    same      is
contrary to the Rules and letters of appointment.

<p id="p_55">  206. In Madhumita Das, (2008) 6 SCC 731,
the protection was granted in an interim order and
we also feel that such directions cannot be issued, if
they are contrary to the enacted statute. When all
these facts, circumstances and the judgments of
this Court are harmoniously construed with an
intention to do complete justice as well as to protect
the fundamental rights and protections available to
the public at large, it would appear necessary that
this Court passes certain directions.

<p id="p_81">25.        In view of above direction and particularly in view of

the contention of the learned Additional Government Advocate

that the High Court has already issued notification in 2012 to hold

regular examination for the Fast Track Court Judges for their

absorption and regularization, the question of continuity of the

job of petitioner as a regular Additional District Judge is non est.

So, the plea of the petitioner that he continued as regular District

Judge is indefensible. Point No.(I) is answered accordingly.

POINT NO.(II)

</p><p id="p_82">26.        In the writ petition, it has been also submitted that

the opposite party No.3 has not held the written examination of

the Ad hoc Additional District Judges posted in Fast Track Courts

as per the direction given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Brij

Mohan Lal (II) but at the same time it is admitted that

petitioner has appeared in pursuance of the advertisement made

by the Court in the said Examination but he was not qualified

according to the pleadings of both the parties.

</p><p id="p_83">27.        Learned counsel for the petitioner alleged inter alia

that the Hon'ble Apex Court has directed in Brij Mohan Lal (II)

vide para 207.9 that since the petitioner along with other

candidates have already exercised the power by rendering justice

to the people of the nation, instead of facing rigorous test, the

concerned High Court would only hold the written test and viva

voce consisting of 250 marks and in that test each candidate

should secure 40% marks in case of general category and 35%

marks in case of candidates belong to SC/ST/OBC category. But
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                  31</span>


the opposite party No.3 issued notification to hold the written

examination with pass mark of 40%/35% as per the category of

the candidates in each paper and also advertised for holding

interview where cutoff mark was kept as 40% which are

completely against the directive of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

Brij   Mohan    Lal-(2)'s   case.     So,   he   submitted   that   the

examination being held contrary to the directive of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, must be declared as illegal and improper.

</p><p id="p_84">28.          Learned Additional Government Advocate submitted

that there is no irregularity or illegality in conducting the written

Examination or viva voce in accordance with the advertisement as

the advertisement has been made in accordance with the

directive of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Brij Mohan Lal-(2)

case. He submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court have also

directed that while the viva voce will be held, same should be held

in accordance with the Recruitment Rules of the respective

States. According to him, in our State there is Recruitment Rules,

namely, the Orissa Superior Judicial Service and Orissa Judicial

Service Rules, 2007 (hereinafter called "OSJS &amp; OJS Rules,

2007") and it is clearly mentioned therein that viva voce for the

direct District Judges has got cutoff marks of 40% to pass in the

interview.

<p id="p_85">29.          Considering the aforesaid submissions of respective
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                     32</span>


parties, we may refer the case of Madhumita Das and Bijaya

Kumar Jena v. State of Orissa &amp; others (W.P.(C) No.2870 of

2013 &amp; W.P.(C) No.3025 of 2013, disposed of on 19.4.2017)

where at paragraphs-27, 28 and 29 I have taken the view in the

following manner:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">    "27.          The directive of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
    passed in paragraph 207.9 of the judgment in Brij Mohan
    Lal (supra) has to be followed both in letter and spirit.
    However, conjoint reading of all the clauses in paragraph
    207.9 of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Brij
    Mohan Lal's case, it can be only deduced in the following
    manner:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">    (1)    In the matter of written test and viva voce relevant
    Recruitment Rule has to be followed for direct recruitment to
    the District Judges cadre to the extent of relaxation given in
    the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court. Hon'ble Apex Court
    have made it clear in clause (f) that the candidates who
    qualify the written examination and obtain consolidated
    percentage as aforeindicated in Clause (c) of para 207.9
    would be called to interview. It is, therefore, Hon'ble Apex
    Court taking the services of the Fast Track Judges into
    consideration have directed that the qualifying marks shall be
    40%    aggregate     for   general    candidates     and    35%     for
    SC/ST/OBC     candidates      out    of    150   marks     in   written
    examination. So, as observed by the Hon'ble Apex Court the
    aggregate consolidated percentage of mark is not to include
    the interview mark.</blockquote><p id="p_86">
    (2)           When the qualifying marks in the written test
    has been prescribed by the Hon'ble Apex Court, the High
    Court only would issue the notification for recruitment by
    following   the   directive   but    not   keeping   the    minimum
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                33</span>


qualifying mark on each paper in the written test.
(3)             In view of the specific directive of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Clause (d) that        each of the appointees
shall be entitled to one mark per year of service in the FTCs,
which would form part of the interview marks and Their
Lordship having directed in Clause © of the same para that
there should be 100 marks for the interview, the interview
mark has to be awarded to the candidates who qualify in the
written test by keeping the minimum aggregate marks in the
written test out of 150 marks. Hon'ble Apex Court have not
directed to take the aggregate mark of 40% and 35% as the
case may be for respective category as a mark secured in the
written test and in the interview.
</p><p id="p_87">(4)             With regard to Clause (c) of same para Their
Lordships have also directed to follow the written examination
and interview in accordance with the relevant Rules enacted
by the States for direct appointment to Higher Judicial
Services.    When    the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   have    not
prescribed the minimum pass mark for interview and had
directed for following the relevant Recruitment Rules, it must
be the Recruitment Rules with regard to the interview have to
be followed to comply the directive of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court.

</p><p id="p_95">28.         From the aforesaid OSJS &amp; OJS Rule, it is clear
that there are 200 marks in written examination and 30
marks in interview. The candidate who has secured 50% of
marks in each of the written paper shall be called for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                               35</span>


interview and a minimum 40% of marks shall be secured in
the interview to be included in the merit list. As per the
directive of the Hon'ble Supreme Court 200 marks for the
written examination have been reduced to 150 marks and the
interview marks have been raised to 100 marks. Moreover,
there is no any aggregate marks to be secured in the written
examination under the Rules whereas the aggregate marks of
40%   for   General   candidates   and   35%    for   SC/ST/OBC
candidates have been prescribed by the directive of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court. Without prescribing any mark for the
interview specifically their Lordships directed to follow the
OSJS &amp; OJS Rule so far as the interview and the written
examination are concerned for direct recruitment to the post
of District Judges. Where the minimum mark for interview is
not specifically mentioned but directive is made to follow the
OSJS &amp; OJS Rule, obviously their Lordships have directed to
follow the Recruitment Rules by keeping the minimum marks
in the interview for the candidates who qualify in the written
examination by keeping such consolidated aggregate marks in
both the papers. The directive in this regard is clearly inferred
from the directive of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Clauses
</p><p id="p_96">(a) (b) (c) (d) and (e) of para 207.9.
</p>
<p id="p_97">29.           Judging from the case of the present petitioners,
there is no doubt that both the petitioners in the respective
cases have secured 40% out of total 150 marks in the written
test, for which both the petitioners have qualified in the
written examination as per the directive of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court at para 207.9 and are consequently entitled to
appear in the interview. The advertisement at Clause (ii)
dated 6.12.2012 being in conflict with the directive of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court by requiring minimum marks in each
paper as 40% for general candidates and 35% for SC/ST/OBC
candidates is liable to be quashed to the said extent. I agree
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                    36</span>


      with my learned brother B.K. Nayak, J. to this extent but
      respectfully I do not agree that the total aggregate marks
      both in the written test and interview have to be taken
      together to comply the directive of the Hon'ble Supreme
      Court."

aforesaid judgment in the following manner:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">      "34.           From the aforesaid decisions of the Hon'ble
      Apex Court, it is clear that where statutory rules prescribe a
      particular mode of selection, it has to be given strict
      adherence. Moreover, it is emanated from the aforesaid
      decision that if the statutory rules give a particular
      benchmark for interview it has to be followed because at the
      interview many essential aspects of the candidature of a
      candidate are necessary to be evaluated. Thus, recently the
      Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/194634360/" id="a_30">Salam Samarjeet
      Singh v. High</a> Court of Manipur at Imphal, reported in
      (2016) 10 SCC 484 have also been pleased to consider a
      similar issue. Although the two members Bench have given
      independent views by referring the judgment to the Larger
      Bench to decide the issue in that case but their Lordships
      have consistently taken the view that in case the statutory
      rules prescribe a particular mode of selection, it has to be
      given strict adherence accordingly.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">      35.         Adverting to the present case, it appears that
      the directive of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Brij Mohan
      case (supra) have directed to follow the concerned
      Recruitment Rules while conducting the written test and the
      interview and Their Lordships have categorically directed
      that while giving the interview mark, one mark per year of
      service in the Fast Track Court also should be taken into
      consideration. The OSJS &amp; OJS Rules also prescribe that
      there should be 40 % marks in the interview. This process
      has also been adopted by this Court in its Full Court
      proceeding dated 26.11.2012. Thus, the OSJS &amp; OJS Rule in
      conjoint reading with the Full Court proceeding of this Court
      in compliance to the directive of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
      have rightly issued notice vide Annexure-7 that there should
      be minimum interview mark as 40% while there will be 100
      marks in the interview. So, with due respect to my learned
      Esteemed brother B.K. Nayak, J., the minimum mark for the
      interview stipulated by the OSJS &amp; OJS Rule must be
      adhered to and consequently Clause (iii) in Annexure-7 is
      legal and proper requiring no interference."

<p id="p_100">32.         The aforesaid view has been dissented by my learned

brother Hon'ble Sri Justice B.K. Nayak as observed in the

respective paragraphs for which on this point the matter has been

referred to the 3rd Hon'ble Judge and the opinion of the 3rd

Hon'ble Judge has not been received.
</p>
<p id="p_101">            However, in pursuance of the aforesaid view, in the

present case the petitioner has secured aggregate of 55% marks

which is less than 40% in the written examination for which he is

not eligible otherwise to appear in the viva voce. It will not be out
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                       38</span>


of place to mention that the advertisement made by the opposite

party No.3 at Clause (ii) is not in accordance with the Hon'ble

Apex Court but keeping 40% cutoff marks in the viva voce out of

100 is legal and proper.
</p>
<p id="p_102">33.          Apart from this, the question arises whether the

petitioner can challenge the examination after he participated in

the same examination and became unsuccessful to qualify in the

examination. It is trite in law that a candidate having participated

in selection process and after became unsuccessful cannot

challenge same selection process. So, in the present case

petitioner has no locus standi to challenge the examination in

question. Point No.(II) is answered accordingly.

CONCLUSION:

<p id="p_103">34.          In    terms    of   above     discussion        as   mentioned

hereinabove, the prayer of the petitioner that the examination be

declared illegal and invalid and he be continued as regular

Additional District Judge sans merit. Consequently prayer for not

to hold viva voce and not to terminate the services of petitioner

are also rejected.

B.K. Nayak,J. 35.    I had the advantage of going through the

   judgment of my learned Brother and, I agree with the ultimate

   conclusion reached by my learned brother that the petitioner is

   not entitled to the reliefs sought for by him. However, I prefer to

   shortly add the following reasons for the conclusion. Facts

   pleaded by the parties need no repetition.


</p><p id="p_107">   36.         This writ petition was filed initially by two persons.

   Petitioner No.2, Kasinath Rout has withdrawn from the writ

   petition with liberty to file a fresh writ petition as per order dated

   18.01.2017. Hence, this writ petition is confined to only petitioner

   No.1, who is hereinafter referred to as 'the petitioner'.


</p><p id="p_108">   37.         Petitioner's two fold prayer are that he being selected

   and appointed as Fast Track Additional District judge by following

   the procedure for direct recruitment of District Judge and in view

   of the order passed by the Hon'ble supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1017222/" id="a_31">Brij Mohan

   Lal v. Union of India and others</a>; (2002) 5 Supreme Court

   Cases 1 hereinafter referred to as 'Brij Mohan Lal-(1)'), the

   petitioner should not be terminated from service and be allowed

   to continue in the cadre of District Judge on regular basis. His

   second   prayer   is   that   the    recruitment   test   as   per   the

   advertisement pursuant to final judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme

   Court in the same case of Brij Mohan Lal, reported in (2012) 6
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                     40</span>


SCC 502 (hereinafter referred to as "Brij Mohan Lal-(2)")

should be quashed and the tests should not be allowed to be held.


</p><p id="p_109">38.            On introduction of the scheme for establishment of

Fast   Track    Courts   by   the   Central   Government,   the   State

Government framed rules called "The Orissa Judicial Service

(Special Scheme) Rules, 2001". The Scheme was being funded by

the Central Government under the Five Year Plans and accordingly

the recruitment and appointment under the aforesaid 2001 Rules

was purely schematic and not of permanent character, which

otherwise means that the persons appointed under the Scheme

will continue in office as Fast Track Ad hoc Additional District

Judges till the Central Government decides to continue with the

Scheme. Of course as per order of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Brij

Mohan Lal-(1) (supra) the persons who were recruited under

the scheme to the Fast Track Courts by following the procedure as

per rules governing direct recruitment of District Judges from the

Bar may aspire for continuing in the regular cadre of District

Judge. After the Central Government decided to abolish the

Scheme of Fast Track Courts, writ petitions were filed in several

High Courts and also even before the Hon'ble Supreme Court

praying to direct the Central Government not to abolish the

Scheme of Fast Track Courts. All those petitions were heard by

the Hon'ble Supreme Court in that very case of Brij Mohan Lal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                      41</span>


and the final judgment was passed as per judgment in Brij

Mohan Lal-(2) (supra), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court

directed for regularizing the services of the Fast Track Court

Judges, whose services had not been terminated on ground of

dishonesty or doubtful integrity, by subjecting them to limited

recruitment examination consisting of both written and viva-voce

tests. The guidelines and directions in this respect have been

given in paragraph ten (10) of the judgment in Brij Mohan

Lal(2).
</p>
<p id="p_110">
</p><p id="p_111">               Therefore, whatever direction or observation was

given in Brij Mohan Lal-(1) with regard to regularization of

directly recruited Fast Track Court Judges which was an interim

order, was superseded by the final judgment in Brij Mohan Lal-

(2).   After    passing   of   the   final   judgment,   the   directions/

observations made in Brij Mohan Lal-(1) lost their force, and it

is only the directions given in Brij Mohan Lal-(2) which are

necessary to be complied with. In the case of Brij Mohan Lal-

(2) the Hon'ble Supreme Court having given their thumb of

approval to the decision of the Union Government to discontinue

the Fast Track Courts Scheme, and the State Government having

not resolved to fund the Fast Track Courts established under the

Scheme, the petitioner and all other Fast Track Court Ad hoc

Additional District Judges were liable to be terminated. Keeping in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                               42</span>


view the fact that the Fast Track Court Judges had rendered a

number of years of service as Additional District Judges and

crossed the age limit for entering into any other service, the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in Brij Mohan Lal-(2) laid down

guidelines to be followed for the absorption of such terminated

Fast Track Court Judges in the regular cadre of District Judge, and

that in pursuance thereto the High Court of Orissa issued

advertisement for conducting tests for the Ad hoc Additional

District      Judges          for   their   absorption   in   the    regular   cadre.

Therefore, the petitioner cannot take objection to Brij Mohan

Lal-(2) and the consequential tests for the recruitment.

entitled to the reliefs sought for by him and the writ petition

accordingly stands dismissed.
