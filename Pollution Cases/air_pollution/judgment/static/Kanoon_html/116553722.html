<p id="p_4">JUDGMENT BY THE BENCH


              M/s. Scania Steels &amp; Power Ltd. (formerly known as Sidhi
    Vinayak Sponge Iron Ltd.) was operating a Sponge Iron Plant in
    Village Punjipatra, Tehsil Gharghoda, District Raigarh in the State of
    Chhattisgarh, before 2004 i.e. prior to issuance of EIA Notification,
    2006.       The production capacity of the said existing unit was 66,000
    TPA of Sponge Iron (2 x 100 TPD kilns). The rules which governed at
    the relevant time did not mandate any need for seeking environment
    clearance for establishing Sponge Iron Units and as such, no
    environmental clearance was obtained, for installation of the said unit.
</p>

<p id="p_5">     2.            In the year, 2008, M/s Scania Steels &amp; Power Ltd. (hereinafter
     called as Scania for the sake of brevity) applied to the MoEF for
     expansion of the existing project.                              It proposed to enhance the
     production of Sponge Iron from 66,000 TPA to 1,32,000 TPA by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   3</span>


     adding another unit or 66,000 TPA, install a Steel Melting Shop
     (Induction Furnace, 3x15 tons) with CCM facility of 1,35,000 TPA
     capacity, a Ferro Alloy Plant (5MVA) of 7,5000 TPA and Captive
     Power Plant    of 25 MW, (AFBC 17 MW + WHRB 8 MW).                  The
     proposal was considered by the MoEF and environment clearance
     (EC) was granted by letter dated 5 th November, 2008 for the proposed
     expansion.
</p>

<p id="p_6">3.         Jan Chetna (Appellant No.1) claiming to be a social and
     environmental group formed with the objective of working for the
     welfare of the local communities and creating awareness on social
     and environmental issues, represented through one or its Member
     Shri Ramesh Agrawal, and Shri Rajesh Tripathi claiming to be a
     Project affected person, having agriculture land adjacent to the project
     site and also claiming to be a social activist and a member of Jan
     Chetna, assailed the order dated 5 th November, 2008, passed by the
     Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) granting EC for
     expansion     of the project in question before the then National
     Environment Appellate Authority (NEAA).        The said Appeal was
     registered as NEAA Appeal No. 8/2009.
</p>

<p id="p_7">4.        On preliminary scrutiny the NEAA noticed that the Appeal was
     presented beyond the period prescribed and posted the matter for
     hearing on condonation of delay.      After hearing parties the NEAA
     declined to condone the delay and dismissed the Appeal. The said
     order was assailed by the present Appellant before the High Court of
     Delhi in WPC No.11157 of 2009. The Hon'ble High Court by order
     dated 14th October, 2009 set aside the order passed by NEAA and
     directed the said Authority to dispose of the Appeal on merits, as
     expeditiously as possible.    The Hon'ble High Court further observed
     that the question of locus standi of the Appellants can be raised by
     Scania and the said contention shall be dealt with in accordance with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4</span>


     law.   While NEAA was in session of the case, The NGT Act was
     promulgated and in consonance with the provisions of the said Act,
     the Appeal stood transferred to this Tribunal and was registered as
     NGT Appeal No.22/2011.
</p><p id="p_8">5.      The main grievances of the Appellants are two fold:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        a) That the Environment Clearance was granted to the project
            without Public Hearing, required under Clause-7 of EIA
            Notification, 2006.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">        b) The EAC in its meeting held on 15 th April, 2008 erroneously
            exempted the proposal for Public Hearing under Clause-7(ii) of
            EIA Notification, 2006, construing the proposal to be an
            expansion project.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        The Appellants have elaborated the said contentions in different
        paragraph of their Memorandum of Appeal and contented that the
        EC to the project, having been granted by the MoEF without
        conducting proper Public Hearing which is a pre-requisite under
        the EIA Notification, the same is illegal and needs to be quashed.
        In support of their contentions they have enclosed as many as 16
        documents which are marked as Annexure A-1 to A-16, to the
        Appeal Memorandum.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_9">6.          Respondent     No.2-Chhattisgarh   Environment    Conservation
     Board (CECB), has filed a reply mainly taking the stand that the MoEF
     after examining all the aspects of the matter had come to the
     conclusion that no Public Hearing/consultation was required as per
     Clause-7(ii) of the EIA Notification, 2006, as the proposal was one for
     expansion of the proposed unit in the same campus.            It further
     contended that the EC was granted subject to certain specific and
     general conditions enumerated in the letter itself, and it appears that
     Respondent No.3, had not adhered to some of the conditions and as
     such a criminal complaint, has been initiated against the said
     Respondent.    It is further, averred that Respondent No.2 is vigilant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         5</span>


     and will take appropriated action if there is any deviation or breach of
     conditions as and when it occurs.
</p>

<p id="p_10">7.         Respondent No.3 Scania has filed a reply before the NEAA.
</p><p id="p_11">     The said Respondent also filed another reply before this Tribunal with
     regard to the merits of the case. In its reply Scania raised preliminary
     objection with regard to the locus-standi of the Appellants and
     contended that the present Appeal having been filed under the
     <a href="/doc/79225559/" id="a_1">National Environment Appellate Authority Act</a>, 1997, the mandatory
     requirement of the said Act has to be considered. Under the said Act,
     it is averred, an Appeal can be filed only by a person who is:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">           a) Either affected by the grant of Environment Clearance;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">           b) xxx
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">           c) Any association of persons (whether incorporated or not)
           likely to be affected by such order and functioning in the field of
           environment.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">           According to Scania the Appellants do not satisfy either of the
           clauses, and as such they have no locus-satndi to prefer this
           Appeal, and the same may be dismissed, in limine, on that
           ground alone.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_12">8.       Scania further contended that the EC, having been granted, by
     Statutory     Authorities,   in    consonance        with   settled     procedure
     established     under    law,     the   Appellants    who    are      nothing   but
     meddlesome interloper cannot question the same. Further, according
     to said Respondent, the proposal being one for expansion of a existing
     plant, is squarely covered under Calause-7(ii) of EIA Notification, 2006
     and did not require any Public consultation. That apart it is contended
     that persons having highly technical knowledge and expertise in the
     field, have examined the project proposal for expansion, and being
     satisfied that the proposal is only for expansion have rightly accorded
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     6</span>


     clearance. In support of the contentions raised, Respondent No.3 has
     also annexed several documents to its reply.
</p>

<p id="p_13">9.         In course of hearing Mr. Panjwani, Learned Senior Advocate,
     submitted that EIA Notification of 1994, was amended in the year 1997
     by incorporating Public Hearing as a mandatory requirement, before
     granting or refusing issuance of EC. The Notification of the year 2006,
     has gone one step further and introduce "Public Consultation also to
     be mandatory a requirement. The purpose of EIA is not just to assess
     environmental impacts as a procedural formality, but it is meant to
     improve the quality of the decision and in particular to ensure that the
     decision is based on proper assessment, evaluation of the pros and
     cons including cost and benefit in general, and in particular to ensure
     that the project is not thrust upon the citizens against their wishes,
     without taking into account their comforts and other living conditions.
     It is submitted that the process of public consultation / hearing is not to
     be viewed as a part of only an environmental law requirement, on the
     other hand the same should be viewed as an essential feature of
     democracy.    Transparency being the key to the democratic system,
     informing   the   public and seeking their views, comments and
     suggestions, before taking any socially sensitive decision, like granting
     clearance to a project, is contrary to the mandates of the law. The
     essential part of good governance requires that the public in general
     should not be kept in dark and the persons who are likely to be
     affected by the project are to be informed in advance about the
     consequences thereon and also granted an opportunity to participate
     in the decision making process. Public participation, according to Mr.
     Panjwani is also required to ensure that the project meets citizens'
     need and is viable and beneficial to the common man.
</p>

<p id="p_14">           Relying upon the decision of S.P. Gupta V/s Union of India &amp;
     Others (1981) SCC Supplementary (Page-87), it is submitted that "a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7</span>


popular Govt. without popular information or the means of obtaining it,
is but a prologue to a fast or tragedy or perhaps both. The citizens'
right to know the facts, the true facts, about, the administration of the
country is thus one of the pillars of democratic State and that is why
the demand for openness in the Government is increasingly growing
in different parts of the world".
</p>

<p id="p_15">       Mr. Panjwani had also relied upon the judgment of the Supreme
Court in the cases of Dinesh Trivedi V/s Union of India and Others
(1997) 3 SCC 306, Secretary, Ministry of Information and
Broadcasting V/s. Cricket Association of Bengal (1995) 2 SCC
161, State of U.P. V/s Rajnarayan &amp; Others (1975) 4 SCC 428,
Research Foundation for Science Technology National Research
Policy V/s Union of India and another (2003) 9 SCALE 303), Essar
Oil Ltd. V/s Halar Utkarsh Samiti (2004) 2 SCC 392, Lafarge Umium
Pvt. Ltd. V/s Union of India, Uttkarsh Mandal V/s Union of India,
2009 (10) AD (Delhi) 365 (28, 33-35, 36-42).
</p>

<p id="p_16">       Drawing attention to the facts of the case, Mr. Panjwani
submitted that Scania prior to 2006, had established a plant for
manufacturing Sponge Iron, with an existing capacity of 66,000 TPA.
At the relevant time the law did not mandate EC to be granted to such
plants and as such no EC was granted. In the year 2008, Scania
submitted Form-1, where the product and production of the projects
has become manifold. In as much as it intends to double the capacity
of Sponge Iron Plant, install a Steel Melting Shop, a Ferro Alloy Plant
and a Captive Power Plant. A cumulative assessment of the entire
proposal would lead to an irresistible conclusion that; in a camaflouge
way, the said Respondent, not only intends to double the capacity of
the existing Sponge Iron Plant, but also is trying to install Steel Melting
Shop, Ferro Alloy Plant and Captive Power Plant. Law is well settled
that if a new project proponent, in the year 2008, wants to establish a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     8</span>


  Sponge Iron Plant (Unit) having a capacity of 66,000 TPA, and or
  wants to install a Steel Melting Shop of 1,35,000 TPA and or Ferro
  Alloy Plant having a capacity of 7,500 TPA and or a Captive Power
  Plant, it has to undergo the process stipulated in the EIA Notification,
  2006.      The said Notification, according to Mr. Panjwani, mandatorily
  requires Public consultation either for each of the plant or cumulatively
  for all.     The present proposal, at no stretch of imagination can be
  considered to be an expansion of an old Sponge Iron Plant having a
  capacity of 66,000 TPA installed much prior to 2006. Each of the
  proposed units are independent and have to be assessed according to
  the norms stipulated for granting EC, for any new project, and that too,
  after following the requirements of EIA Notification, 2006. The present
  attempt is to bypass the requirement of 2006 Notification, by
  nomenclaturing all the new four units as expansion of the existing unit,
  according to the Appellants, is misnomer, and the EC granted for all
  the four units enumerated above, treating them to be expansion of the
  existing unit and avoiding Public consultation cannot be sustained.
</p>

<p id="p_17">10.        Further, according to Mr. Panjwani, the attempt made to bring
      the proposal, within the purview of Clause-7(ii) of the EIA Notification,
      2006 is also misconceived. The said provision, it is submitted can be
      involved if a Project Proponent had prior environmental clearance for
      the plant which is intended to be expanded or modernized.            Mr.
      Panjwani forcefully submitted that even otherwise Caluse-7(ii) of the
      EIA Notification, 2006   has absolutely no application to the case in
      hand in as much as, the plant, which is sought to be expanded had not
      obtained prior environmental clearance under EIA Notification, 2006.
      The MoEF, it is submitted had misguided itself in not properly
      interpreting Clause 7(ii) of the EIA Notification, 2006     and the EC
      granted, being contrary to law, needs to be set aside.

<p id="p_18">11.        The allegation with regard to the locus-standi is strongly
      repudiated on behalf of the Appellants and it is submitted that the
      Appellants squarely satisfy Clause (a) and (c) of Sub-Section 2 of
      Section 11 of the NEAA Act, 1997. In this connection Mr. Panjwani
      drew our attention to Para 2 &amp; 3 of the Memorandum of Appeal and
      submitted that Appellant No.2 is the owner of agricultural lands
      situated adjacent to the project site appertaining to Patwari Halka No.
      34 and would be directly affected by the project. Appellant No.1 is an
      Association of inhabitants of the locality who are also going to be
      affected by the project. Added to it, members of Appellant No.1 have
      filed objections and taken active interest and participated in the
      process, thus, it is not correct to say that they have no locus-standi to
      file the present Appeal.
</p>

<p id="p_19">12.      Ms. Kanika Agnihotri, Learned Counsel appearing for Respondent
      No.3 "Scania", repudiated     the submissions made on behalf of the
      Appellants.    According to Ms. Agnihotri, the present Appellant does
      not have the locus-standi to file the Appeal.   Drawing our attention to
      Section-11(1) and 11(2) of the <a href="/doc/79225559/" id="a_2">National Environment Appellate
      Authority Act</a>, 1997, under which the Appeal was filed, it is submitted
      that, only a person or an Association of person, who are likely to be
      affected by the grant of EC to the proponent, can file an Appeal. The
      Appellants, it is submitted have miserably failed to satisfy as to how
      they are affected by the grant of EC. In the alternative it is submitted
      that as the project was only for expansion of an existing plant, the only
      grievance of any person could be with regard to the environmental
      impact, and the said aspect has been duly considered by the EAC,
      therefore, the Appeal filed by the Appellants is not maintainable.
</p>

<p id="p_20">13.       In support of the contention that the project in question was an
      expansion project and not a new project, Ms Agnihotri made following
      submissions:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                      10</span>


<blockquote id="blockquote_8">            i)      No other land was required for setting up the proposed
                    new units, and thus there is no question of displacement
                    of any person nor there is necessity to acquire any
                    further land.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">            ii)     The proposal is confined to expansion of an already
                    existing project, and as such it attracts the provisions of
                    Clause 7(ii) of the EIA Notification, 2006.</blockquote>


<p id="p_21">            Expanding here arguments, Ms Agnihotri submitted that as no
  lands are required to be acquired, the only concern that can trouble the
  Appellants would be any damage which may be caused to the
  environment. The question whether the proposed project is damaging
  or is capable of damaging the environment is a scientific proposition
  and the same was considered and taken care of by Competent
  Authorities on the basis of numerous documents, data and research
  work produced by the Scania, before the Environment Appraisal
  Committee (EAC).           Relying upon the EIA report dated July, 2008,
  Annexure-I, it is submitted that the Authorities have made, in-depths
  analysis of all the relevant factors of Environmental Impacts such as
  impact on ambient air quality, impact on ecology, water, environment,
  topography, land use, traffic pattern, air pollution, noise pollution, water
  pollution,      solid   waste     management,    green    belt   development,
  occupational health management, and rain water harvesting etc. and
  were satisfied and submitted their Report.
</p>

<p id="p_22">14.       The concept of Public Consultation, according to Ms. Kanika
      Agnihotri is to achieve greater objectivity and to ensure that the
      interest of the public are protected. The said contingency arises only if
      a new project is set up, and not when an expansion takes place of an
      existing project. Relying upon the decision of Bombay High Court, in
      the case of Dighi Koli Samaj Mumbai Rahivasi Sangh Vs UOI &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                    11</span>


      Ors., 2009 (50 Bom CR 97), it is submitted that the proposal being
      one for expansion, Public Hearing is not necessary.
</p>

<p id="p_23">            Relying upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
      ND Jayal &amp; Another Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors. (2004) 9 SCC 362.
      Ms Agnihotri further submitted that the Appellant being a busy body
      should not be permitted to sit in judgment over the scientific analysis
      relating to the safety of the project, more so because, Competent
      Government Authorities possessing sound technical knowledge have
      taken a decision after due consideration of all the materials available.
</p>

<p id="p_24">15.       With regard to the exemption of Public Consultation, granted to
      the proposed project, it is submitted that the         contents of EIA
      Notification, 2006, lead to no doubt, that the project is squarely
      covered under Clause7(ii) of the said Notification. It was emphatically
      submitted by    her that the said Clause cannot be limited only to
      projects to which EC was granted under the EIA Notification, 2006, but
      also extends to ECs, where the proposal pertains to increase in
      production or increase in the lease area or production capacity or
      modernization of an existing unit, with increase in total production
      capacity.   Therefore the argument to limit the application of Clause
      7(ii) only to such projects for which clearances have been granted
      earlier under 2006 Notification, would not only be erroneous but also
      would defeat the entire purpose of the Notification. In support of her
      contention that the proposal is not for a new unit but was only for
      expansion of the old unit, Ms. Agnihotri relied upon the decision State
      of Gujarat and Ors. Vs Saurashtra Cement and Chemical
      Industries Ltd. AIR 2003 SC 1132).
</p>

<p id="p_25">  On the basis of aforesaid submission, it is contended that the project
  was rightly granted exemption from the Public Consultation as the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                     12</span>


  same is squarely covered under Clause-7(ii) of the EIA Notification,
  2006.
</p>

<p id="p_26">  Ms. Kanika Agnihotri also, brought to our notice that the MoEF had
  extended the benefit of exemption of Public Hearing in accordance
  with Clause-7(ii) of EIA Notification, 2006, in respect of several other
  projects and thus Respondent No.3 not the only exception, and as the
  allegations made by the Appellants are not bona fide or in accordance
  with law, the Appeal should be dismissed with exemplary costs.
</p>

<p id="p_27">16.       Respondent No.1 (MOEF) has entered appearance through Ms.
      Neelam Rathore, Learned Counsel. The stand of MoEF is that the
      proposal submitted by Scania is one for expansion of an existing
      Sponge Iron Unit only.       No extra land would be required as the
      expansion would be confined to the land which is used by Scania.
      The documents submitted and the particulars furnished by Scania
      were duly considered by the MoEF, and on being satisfied that there is
      no park / wild life sanctuary, within 10 km radius of the project,
      approved the same. The further stand of MoEF is that Clause-7(ii) of
      the EIA Notification, 2006, is squarely applicable to the proposed
      project and the EAC in its 80 th meeting dated 15th April, 2008, after
      exercising due diligence and proper consideration, exempted the
      proposal from Public Hearing / Public consultation, and called upon
      the Proponent to prepare the EIA/EMP report as per the prescribed
      TORs.
</p>

<p id="p_28">17.        Heard Learned Counsel for the parties at length. Perused the
      pleadings,   documents   annexed     by the   parties   and   notes   of
      submissions, meticulously.     Considered the submissions of all the
      Learned Counsel diligently. The controversies involved in this Appeal
      are as follows:-

                    Appeal     and    assail the    EC   granted    in favour of
                    Respondent No.3 (Scania)?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">             ii)    Whether     the   proposal     submitted   to   enhance    the

                    to further 66,000 TPA by installing a new unit, setting up
                    a Steel Melting Shop with CCM facility of 1,35,000 TPA
                    capacity, a Ferro Alloy Plant of 7,500 TPA and Captive
                    Power Plant of 25 MW, would amount to expansion of the
                    existing Sponge Iron Plant of 66,000 TPA established
                    prior to 2004 or amounts to installing new projects?

                    Clause-7(ii) of EIA Notification, 2006 and Public Hearing /
                    consultation can be exempted?

                    particulars submitted by the Project Proponent, and the
                    decision taken to grant EC was justified or proper?
</blockquote>

<p id="p_29">18.         We propose to deal with the question of locus-standi at the first
      instance. Admittedly, this Appeal was filed in the year 2009 invoking
      jurisdiction under NEAA Act, 1997. Though the said Act has been
      repealed and <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_3">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 has come into force,
      the Appeal having been filed under the NEAA Act, 2009, has to be
      disposed of under the provisions of the said Act.
</p>

<p id="p_30">19.         Before entering into the area of controversy, we propose to
      recapitulate the principles relating to Industrial Development vis-à-vis
      sustainable development.
</p><p id="p_31">             It is now well settled by a series of judgments of the Supreme
      Court that though the industrial development is of vital importance to
      the    country   as    it generates   foreign exchange        and   provides
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               14</span>


employment avenues, it has no right to destroy the ecology, degrade
the environment and pose health hazards.           In Vellore Citizens'
Welfare Forum Vs. Union of India, (1996 5 SCC 647, the Supreme
Court held that the traditional concept, that development and ecology
are opposed to each other, is no longer acceptable and "Sustainable
Development" is the answer. In the international sphere, "Sustainable
Development" as a concept came to be known for the first time in
Stockholm Declaration of 1972. Thereafter in 1987, the concept was
given a definite shape by the World Commission on Environment and
Development in its report called "Our Common Future" popularly
known as "Brundtland Report".         In 1991, the World Conservation
Union, United Nations Environment Programme and World Wide
Fund for Nature, jointly came out with a document called "Caring for
the Earth" which is a strategy for sustainable living. Finally, came the
Earth Summit held in June, 1992 at Rio where as many as 153
nations signed two conventions, one on biological diversity and
another on climate change.          The delegates also approved by
consensus, three non-binding documents, namely, a Statement on
Forestry Principles, a declaration of Principles on Environmental
Policy and Development Initiatives, a programme of action into the
next century in areas like poverty, population and pollution vide
Agenda 21.        The Supreme Court noted that some of the salient
principles   of    "Sustainable    Development",   as   culled-out   from
Brundtland Report and other international documents, are Inter-
Generational Equity, use and Conservation of Natural Resources,
Environmental Protection, the Precautionary Principle, Polluter Pays
Principle, Obligation to Assist and Cooperate, Eradication of Poverty
and Financial Assistance to the developing countries. The Hon'ble
Court noticed that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_4">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India guarantees
protection of life and personal liberty.    The Court also noticed that
<a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_5">Article 48A</a> of the Constitution cast a duty on the State to protect and
improve the environment and safeguard the forests and wild life of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                    15</span>


      country, <a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_6">Article 51</a> A(g) of the Constitution spells out duty of citizens
      to protect and improve the environment including forests, lakes, rivers
      and wild life, and to have compassion for living creatures. The Court
      also noted that apart from the constitutional mandate to protect and
      improve the environment, there are plenty of post-independence
      legislations on the subject, namely, The Water (Prevention and
      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of
      Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_9">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986. In
      view of the above mentioned constitutional and statutory provisions,
      the Court held that "Precautionary Principle" and the "Polluter Pays
      Principle" are part of the environment law of the country.
</p>

<p id="p_32">20.     Keeping in view these well settled principles, we may now proceed
      to examine the provisions of the NEAA Act. <a href="/doc/181903687/" id="a_10">Section 11</a> of the Act
      which is material for the purpose of this appeal, is reproduced herein
      below:-
</p>

<p id="p_33">            "11. (1) Any      person    aggrieved   by   an   order granting
            environmental clearance in the areas in which any industries,
            operations or processes or class of industries, operations and
            processes shall not be carried out or shall be carried out subject
            to certain safeguards may, within thirty days from the date of
            such order, prefer an appeal to the Authority in such form as
            may be prescribed.
</p>

<p id="p_34">            Provided that Authority may entertain any appeal after the
            expiry of the said period of thirty days but not after ninety days
            from the date aforesaid if it is satisfied that the appellant was
            prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal in time.
</p>

<p id="p_35">            2. For the purposes of sub-section (1) "Perons" means -
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                    16</span>


<p id="p_36">           a)      any person who is likely to be affected by the grant of
                   environmental clearance;
</p><p id="p_37">           b)      any person who owns or has control over the project with
                   respect to which an application has been submitted for
                   environmental clearance;
</p><p id="p_38">           c)      any association of persons (whether incorporated or not)
                   likely to be affected by such order and functioning in the
                   field of environment;
</p><p id="p_39">           d)      the   Central   Government, where the environmental
                   clearance is granted by the State Government and the
                   State Government, where the environmental clearance is
                   granted by the Central Government; or
</p><p id="p_40">           e)      any local authority, any part of whose local limits is within
                   the neighbourhood of the area wherein the project is
                   proposed to be located".
</p>

<p id="p_41">21.        On a plain reading of Section11, it is seen that any person
      aggrieved by an order granting environmental clearance has a right to
      prefer an appeal to the Authority. The definition of 'person' as
      contained in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/181903687/" id="a_11">Section 11</a> (a), provides that any
      person who is likely to be affected by the grant of environmental
      clearance has an undoubted locus standi to file an appeal. <a href="/doc/105719283/" id="a_12">Section
      11(2)(c)</a> is worded differently and is wider in scope than sub-clause
</p><p id="p_42">      (a). Sub-clause (c) speaks of "association of persons" (whether
      incorporated or not) who are likely to be affected by the impugned
      action and who work in the field of environment. In other words, sub-
      clause (a) talks of those who are affected or are likely to be affected
      and the emphasis is on the impact on an individual, though the sub-
      clause, does not rule out more than one person likely to be affected
      and/or actually aggrieved.    In contrast, sub-clause (c) refers to an
      association of persons, incorporated one.          Such association of
      persons, (incorporated association), cannot be said to be affected in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                      17</span>


      the manner traditionally understood.        Moreover, in environmental
      cases the damage is not necessarily confined to the local area where
      the industry is set up.        The effect of environmental pollution or
      environmental degradation might have far-reaching effects going
      beyond the local area and create national or global effects.          For
      example, the destruction of forests is said to be one of the causes
      leading to global warming. Therefore, the aggrieved person need not
      be resident of the local area. Such an interpretation would also result
      in defeating the very objective of this enactment in terms of access to
      justice. (see Judgment of High Court of Delhi passed in LPA No.
      277/2009 dated 14th September, 2009 in the case of Vedanta
      Alumina Ltd. Vs Prafulla Samantra &amp; Ors.)


</p><p id="p_43">22.     The expression "aggrieved persons" cannot be considered in a
      restricted manner. Its scope and meaning depends on variable factors
      i.e. the aims and objectives and the intend of the Statute out of which
      the controversy arises.   In the case of Gulam Qadir Vs          Special
      Tribunal and other 2002 (1) SCC 33, the Supreme Court observed
      that an orthodox rule of interpretation regarding the locus-standi of a
      person to reach the Court has undergone a sea change and the
      constitutional courts have been adopting a liberal approach in dealing
      with the cases or    the claims of litigants.   It is well settled that in
      construing remedial statute the courts ought to give to it widest
      operation which its language will permit. The words of such a statue
      must be so construed as to give the most complete remedy which the
      phraseology will permit, so as to secure the relief contemplated by the
      Statute is not denied to the class intended to be relieved. The statute
      being remedial in nature is given liberal construction to promote the
      beneficent object behind it.
</p>

<p id="p_44">23.     In so far as, the present case is concerned, it appears from the
      records, that the first Appellant a social Environment activist had in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                      18</span>


      several occasions in past, made representations before Competent
      Authority.   The organization of the first Appellant is working in the
      area in question and as it appears from the deliberations made in the
      court, was following the issue of the project in question, during various
      stages of the project, it had complained about the impact of the project
      on ecology and environment and prayed to direct Respondent No.3
      not to go ahead with the project.      The second Appellant is a resident
      of the locality and is the owner of agriculture land situate in the vicinity.
      In the above circumstances, it is not right to say that the Appellants
      are not aggrieved persons within the meaning of Section 11 of NEAA
      Act.   Denial of the right to file an appeal to the Appellants would
      virtually defeat the legislative intentions of granting access to justice.
</p>

<p id="p_45">24.     A dispute involving similar controversy arose earlier in the case of
      'Prafulla Samantra Vs MoEF &amp; Ors.' Prafulla claiming to be a social
      and environmental activist challenged an order granting EC by the
      MoEF for setting up of a Alumina Smelter Plant, before the NEAA, by
      filing an appeal. The said appeal was resisted on the ground that he
      is not a "person aggrieved" and is not covered under Section 11 of the
      NEAA Act. The Authority dismissed the Appeal holding that he is not
      a "person aggrieved".      Being aggrieved by the said order, Prafulla
      Samantra approached the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in WP(C) No.
      3126/2008.     After hearing parties Hon'ble single judge of the High
      Court of Delhi by a well discussed judgment dated 6.5.2009 allowed
      the writ petition. The Hon'ble Judge observed as follows:-

            meaningfully, would be rendered a chimera, an illusion. In their
            case, the Act would be a crude joke, paying lip service, while

<p id="p_46">            The Hon'ble Single Judge came to the conclusion that Prafulla
      Samantra satisfies the expression "Person aggrieved" and set aside
      the order passed by the NEAA. The said judgment was assailed by
      Vedanta Alumina Ltd., Respondent in the said case, before the High
      Court of Delhi in LPA No. 277 of 2009. The Divisional Bench of High
      Court of Delhi, by judgment dated 14th September, 2009, confirmed
      the finding of the Hon'ble single Judge, and held that Prafulla can be
      construed to a be a "Person aggrieved" in consonance with Section
      11 of NEAA Act and dismissed the LPA. The findings arrived at by
      the Division Bench of Delhi High Court are squarely applicable to the
      case in hand, and we have no hesitation to hold that the Appellants
      satisfy the definition of "Person aggrieved" and they have locus-standi
      to file this Appeal.

<p id="p_47">25.      Now we propose to deal with point No. 2 &amp; 3 of the controversy
      together as both the issues are connected with each other:-
</p>

<p id="p_48">            Admittedly, Scania was running a Sponge Iron Plant having the
      capacity of 66,000 TPA. The said plant having been set up much
      prior to 2004, no EC was required to be granted. In the year 2008,
      Scania applied to the MoEF seeking permission for enhancing the
      production of Sponge Iron from 66,000 TPA to 1,32,000 TPA by
      setting up another unit and, to install a Steel Melting Shop with CCM
      facility of 1,35,000, TPA capacity, further install a Ferro Alloy Plant of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                      20</span>


      7,500 TPA and also to set up a Captive Plant of 25 MW. According to
      Scania, the proposal was one for expansion of the existing Sponge
      Iron Plant and the units which are ancillary to each other and as such,
      the proposal is squarely covered by Clause -7(ii) of the EIA
      Notification, 2006; consequently Public Consultation was rightly
      exempted by the Competent Authority.           The said contention was
      repudiated by the Appellants. According to Mr. Panjwani, the
      endeavourance of the Scania was to set up three separate
      project/units, in the grab of expansion and as such, Clause-7 (ii) of
      the EIA Notification, 2006 has any application, to the proposal
      submitted.
</p>

<p id="p_49">26.         Before entering into the controversy, it will be prudent to refer to
      some of the provisions of EIA Notification, 2006. Clause-2 of the said
      Notification deals with mandatory requirement of prior Environment
      Clearance (EC) and reads as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">             "Requirements of prior Environmental Clearance (EC):- The

             falling under Category 'B' in the said Schedule, before any
             construction work, or preparation of land by the project
             management except for securing the land, is started on the

      under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_13">Article-21</a> of the Constitution.       <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_14">The Environment (Protection)

      right in discharge of the obligations enjoined under <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_15">Article-48</a> A of the
      Constitution.     Citizens have a right to know and also equal right to

      case of Dinesh Trivedi MP and Others Vs Union of India and

<p id="p_54">28.          In the democratic set up, all the authorities discharging public

<p id="p_55">29.        A cumulative reading of the provisions of EIA Notifications, 2006
      in the touch stone of the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme
      court    in   different decisions, gives    an impression that public
      consultations as incorporated in 2006 Notification is in recognition and
      in furtherance of the rights to the environment. Clause-7 (iii) Stage (3)
      of EIA Notification, 2006 deals with public consultation which reads as
      follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">              "Public Consultation'' refers to the process by which the
              concerns of local affected persons and others who have
              plausible stake in the environmental impacts of the project or
              activity are ascertained with a view to taking into account all the
              material    concerns   in the project or activity design as
              appropriate.</blockquote>


<p id="p_56">              Public consultations ordinarily have two components; (i) public
      hearing at the site or in its close proximity and (ii) to obtain responses
      in writing from other concerned persons having a plausible stake in
      the environmental aspects of the project or activity.         Thus public
      hearing is an integral part in the process of granting EC.
</p>

<p id="p_57">30.        According to Ms. Kanika Agnihotri, the proposal of Scania being
      one for expansion, with increase in production capacity and also
      change of product-mix by modernization, is squarely covered under
      Clause-7 (ii) of EIA Notification, 2006, and as such the Expert
      Appraisal Committee (EAC), in consonance with and in exercise of
      the powers conferred upon it under the said Clause, have rightly
      taken the decision to exempt public consultation, and granted EC.         It
      is further, submitted that to limit application of Clause-7(ii), only to
      those projects, which got EC under the EIA Notification, 2006, would
      be not only erroneous but would in fact, defeat the entire purpose of
      the Notification.

<p id="p_58">              In support of her submission that further enhancing the
      production of Sponge Iron by 66,000 TPA by installing a separate
      unit, and to set up a Steel Melting Shop by utilizing the Sponge Iron
      produced, and also to utilize the product therefrom, by setting up a
      Ferro Alloy, Plant and further, use the bye-products and waste by
      setting up a Captive Power Plant, can only be nomenclatured as
      modernization and expansion of the existing unit. In as much as the
      new units set up, are not independent but are expansion of the
      existing unit. The word "expansion" according to Ms. Agnihotri means
      to become greater and bigger in size. The new units proposed to be
      set up, it is submitted, are not self-contained or independently viable,
      on the other hand they are dependent on products of the existing
      plant and as such, the only inevitable conclusion that can be drawn is
      that, the proposed units are expansion of the existing Sponge Iron
      Unit.     In support of such submission Ms Agnihotri relied upon the
      decision in the case of State of Gujarat and Others Vs Saurashtra
      Cement and Chemical Industries Ltd. AIR (2003) Supreme Court
      1132.
</p><p id="p_59">          In the said decision the Hon'ble Court dealt with the provisions for
      exemption under Section 15 C of the Income Tax Act. The facts and
      circumstance and the provisions of Law of the said case being
      distinctly separate, it has little help to the Respondent.
</p>

<p id="p_60">31.     To appreciate the arguments advanced with regard to the
      exemption of the public Consultant, to the proposed unit, under
      Clause-7 (ii) of the EIA Notification, 2006, it would be necessary to
      quote the said clause:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">              "7(ii) Prior Environmental Clearance (EC) process for

</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                    24</span>


<blockquote id="blockquote_19">            All applications seeking prior environmental clearance for

            area or production capacity in the case of mining projects or for
            the modernization of an existing unit with increase in the total
            production capacity beyond the threshold limit prescribed in the
            Schedule to this notification made in Form-I and they shall be
            considered by the concerned Expert Appraisal Committee or
            State Level Expert Appraisal Committee within sixty days, who
            will decide on the due diligence necessary including preparation
            of EIA and public consultations and the application shall be
            appraised accordingly for grant of environmental clearance."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_61">32.     There is no dispute with regard to the fact that Scania had
      established a Sponge Iron unit, having a capacity of 66,000 TPA,
      before 2004. No EC, under EIA Notification, 1994, was granted to the
      said unit, as it was not covered under the said Notification. Further,
      admittedly, the unit in question had not obtained "Prior Environment
      Clearance" under the 2006 Notification, more so because, it was
      already in operation before the said Notification came in to force.
      There is no quarrel to the proposition that if Scania intends to expand
      and or modernize the existing project or activities and enhance the
      capacity and or intends to change its product mix, it has to obtain
      environmental clearance from the concerned regulatory authority.
      Therefore, the only dispute which has to be resolved is, whether the
      exemption of public consultation can be extended to the proposed
      project in consonance with the provisions of Clause 7(ii) of the EIA
      Notification, 2006 quoted supra and EC can be granted neither holding
      Public Consultation.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                        25</span>


<p id="p_62">33.       Before answering the said controversy, it would be just and
      necessary to once again consider the proposal given by Scania for
      expansion and or expanding the existing unit.        From the submissions,
      advanced, we gather that Scania proposes to install another unit of
      Sponge Iron Plant having further capacity of 66,000 TPA near the existing
      one, and thereby enhance the production of Sponge Iron from 66,000
      TPA to 1,32,000 TPA. It proposes to use the said enhanced product by
      installing a Steel Melting Shop and the product therefrom in the Ferro
      Alloy Plant. The heat generated from the aforesaid new units is proposed
      to be used in the captive power plant.          Thus, the main basis for
      installation of Steel Melting Shop, Ferro Alloy Plant, and Captive Power
      Plant is dependent upon the second unit of Sponge Iron Plant and
      increasing the capacity of Sponge Iron Plant from 66,000 TPA to 1,32,000
      TPA. If the argument advanced on behalf of Scania is accepted, then
      installation of second unit of Sponge Iron Plant and thereby increasing the
      production capacity of the Sponge Iron Plant which is already existing,
      would not attract the exemption as per 7(ii) of the EIA Notification, 2006,
      for the simple reason, that, the existing Sponge Iron Unit has not obtained
      prior environmental clearance under EIA Notification 2006. The wording
      of Clause 7(ii) is very clear and is bereft of any ambiguity. It stipulates
      that all applications seeking prior environmental clearance for expansion,
      with increase in the production capacity beyond the capacity for which
      Prior Environmental Clearance           has   been    granted    uder this
      Notification, or with increase either in lease area or production capacity
      etc. etc., would attract the exclusion of Public consultation. In the case in
      hand, the production capacity of an existing Sponge Iron Unit is sought to
      be enhanced, and its production capacity increased, but then no
      environmental clearance has been granted to the said existing Sponge
      Iron Unit, under EIA Notification, 2006, thus the concession not to hold
      public consultation cannot be extended to the expansion of the existing
      Sponge Iron Unit. In other words Clasuse-7(ii) is not applicable to the
      proposed expansion of Sponge Iron Unit.        Further, the intention behind
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                   26</span>


giving exemption under Clause 7(ii) with reference to public hearing could
have been due to the fact that Public Consultation process for the existing
unit would have already been done as required under EIA Notification,
2006 and as such, Public Hearing again is not necessary.
</p>

<p id="p_63">34.     It is implicit that the entire proposal for installation of the aforesaid
four units is interdependent on each other, in as much as, only if the
production capacity of Sponge Iron is increased, installation of Steel
Melting Shops is feasible. Similarly only, if the Steel Melting Shop is set
up, then then Ferro alloy Plant would be viable.        In the absence of the
aforesaid new units, it is not possible to install a Captive Power Plant as
enough electricity and waste heat or raw materials would not be
available. All the proposed units being interlinked and dependent on one
another, and as no unit can be established in the absence of the other,
we are of the view that the decision taken to exempt Public Consultation
to the entire project under Clause 7(ii) of the EIA Notification, 2006, was
not just and proper specially due to significant increase in pollution load
and    consequential      environmental    ramifications.    Considering     the
magnitude of the proposed project, we further feel that the public in
general should have given an opportunity of putting forth their views with
regard to the projects.
</p>

<p id="p_64">35.    A submission has been advanced on behalf of Scania that neither
the Appellant nor this Tribunal can sit in judgment over the cutting edge
of scientific analysis relating to any project.     According to Ms. Kanika
Agnihotri, Competent Authorities had granted environmental clearance
after considering the pros and cons of the projects, it would therefore, not
be proper for this Tribunal to sit in judgment. But then, legislature in its
wisdom has set up this Tribunal under the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_16">National Green Tribunal Act</a>,
2010. The corum of the Bench consists of a former Judge of the High
Court and an Expert Member, who possesses the scientific know-how
and also expertised knowledge in the subject. The Expert Members are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                         27</span>


      very experienced and had gathered vast knowledge in the subject matter.
      Thus the submissions made are neither justified nor tenable. That apart
      the scope of judicial review is very wide and most of it depends upon the
      scientific data as well as other matters which are produced before this
      Tribunal. While dealing with a litigation of present nature, the Tribunal is
      very careful and takes care to see that it does not over step the limitation
      of its jurisdiction. On scrutiny of the materials, if the Tribunal is satisfied
      that the decision taken by the Authority suffers from WEDNESDURY
      Principle and that no reasonable person should have taken such a
      decision, it would have no hesitation to deal with it in accordance with
      law.
</p>

<p id="p_65">36.       Before concluding we feel it necessary to examine the correctness of
      the EIA report. Perusal of the EIA report indicates that the study period
      (1.12.2007 to 28.2.2008) indicated in Table3.1 of EIA Report for collection
      of base line data regarding meteorology, ambient air quality, noise quality,
      surface and ground water quality, soil quality etc., are much earlier to the
      date Terms of Reference (TORs) were communicated to the Project
      Proponents.   In fact, the collection of base line data should have been
      started after receiving TORs, but in this case, the data collection started
      more than 4 months before the TORs were communicated by MoEF,
      defeating the very purpose of collection of latest base line data based on
      TORs prescribed by Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC)/MoEF. The said
      particulars are very much important to adjudge the prevailing pollution
      levels and environmental status of the study area, and were not kept in
      mind.
</p>
<p id="p_66">          The minimum detectable limit for SO2 and NO2 as given in EIA report is
      6 µg/m3.   However, it is seen from Table 3.7 of the EIA report that almost all
      the minimum values reported for SO2 (5.0 to 5.3 µg/m3.) are below the
      minimum detectable limit of 6 µg/m3. Even the mean 3 (three) values of SO2
      are ranging between 5.1 to 5.3 µg/m3, which are below the minimum
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                        28</span>


detectable limit. The background air quality in the area specially with respect
to SO2 is expected to be more due to existence of a number of sponge iron
units located in the area, but the mean ambient levels of SO2 as given in the
EIA report are ranging between 5.1 to 8.7 µg/m3 are low even during the
winter months when the inversion levels become quite low due to
meteorological conditions. The reflected data casts a doubt on the reliability
of the ambient air quality data produced in the EIA report, specially due to
existence of a number of Sponge Iron Units, burning of domestic coal,
vehicular traffic etc., in the area.
</p>

<p id="p_67">      In addition, it is seen from the EIA report that heavy metals such as Fe,
Ni, Zn, Mn and Cu have been estimated in the Respirable Suspended
Particulate Matters (RSPM) but the important heavy metal, such as mercury,
has not been estimated, even though the mercury level in the ambient air is
likely to be significant, specially in view of the consumption of large quantities
of coal by a number of sponge iron plants located in the area. It would have
been proper to prescribe estimation of mercury in the ambient air during the
TOR stage by EAC/MoEF specially in view of the fact that the mercury levels
are likely to increase due to doubling of the proposed capacity of the sponge
iron plant from existing 66,000 TPA to 1,32,000 TPA. Besides, captive power
plant of 25 MW (17+8 MW) is also based on coal as its main feed stock, and it
would also contribute to mercury emission.        In view of the unrealistic air
quality data, the overall impacts as worked out based on mathematical
modeling, does not appear to reflect the true picture in terms of likely impacts
on air quality. There was need to look at base line/background air quality and
meteorological data in a more critical way. It appears that the EIA Consultant
has taken it in a very casual way.
</p>

<p id="p_68">      Regarding water quality data, it is seen from Table 3.10 and Table 3.11
of the EIA Report that the fluoride levels are almost same in the ground water
and surface water, which appears to be unrealistic.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                         29</span>


<p id="p_69">37.      During the course of hearing, Learned Counsel for Scania informed, that
      no trade effluent will be discharged outside the plant boundaries and the
      entire effluent generated will be reused after treatment. However, to a query
      from the Court, as to what would happen to the effluent during the monsoon
      season when the requirement of treated effluent for irrigation purposes within
      the plant will get drastically reduced and as to how during the monsoon, "zero
      discharge" concept will be achieved, no convincing response came forward
      from the Learned Counsel for R-3. As such, we direct the MoEF to examine
      the water balance which would indicate as to how the treated effluent will be
      utilized and for what purposes.
</p>

<p id="p_70">            In view of the infirmities noticed, we direct MoEF to develop
      appropriate mechanism, to check the authenticity of environmental data
      reported in the EIA/EMP report which would facilitate a more realistic
      environmental appraisal of project.    Steps should also be taken for black
      listing Consultants found to have reported "cooked data" or "wrong data"
      and for producing sub-standard EIA/EMP report.
</p>

<p id="p_71">38.      Learned Counsel for Scania in course of her submission brought to our
      notice that the requirement of public hearing for the expansion project for M/s.
      Scania Steel Power Ltd., was waived by EAC during its meeting held on 15 th
      April, 2008 as per Clause 7(ii) of EIA Notification, 2006.         She further,
      submitted that EAC/MoEF has also given exemption from public hearing in

<p id="p_72">         Strict reading of Clause 7(ii) of EIA Notification, 2006 clearly provides
      power to EAC or State Level EAC to decide on due diligence necessary
      including preparation of EIA and Public Consultations only for those
      expansion proposals or modernization of existing units, which were accorded
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                           30</span>


      prior environmental clearance, under this Notification (EIA Notification, 2006).
      In the present case, as has been held, neither exemption from Public
      Consultation is applicable under expansion category nor under modernization
      pretext as the expansion proposal of M/s Scania Steel and Power Ltd., which
      is an existing Sponge Iron Plant, was not accorded prior environmental
      clearance under the EIA Notification, 2006.       It also does not satisfy the
      category of modernization of the existing unit, as a number of new facilities
      such as Induction Furnace, Ferro Allow Plant and Captive Power Plant have
      been proposed to be added which would certainly result in additional pollution
      load in the area.        The legislators, while framing Clause 7(ii) of EIA
      Notification, 2006, might have kept in mind that if Public Consultation has
      already been done earlier under EIA Notification, 2006 while giving prior EC ,
      the same Public Hearing (PH) need not be required again at the time of
      expansion or modernization of unit.
</p>
<p id="p_73">           Only because, the authorities have exempted Public Consultation in
      respect of some other projects, cannot be ground for exempting the same
      so far as Scania is concerned. Law is well settled that each case has to
      be    determined   and    decided    in consonance    with the   facts   and
      circumstances relating to the said case and there cannot be an universal
      decision to either conduct or exempt public hearing while granting EC.
</p>

<p id="p_74">           The decision to exempt Public Consultation in the case in hand was
      that of the MoEF and the Scania had no role to play. Therefore, we
      cannot find fault with the petitioner and feel that due to the error
      committed by the MoEF the EC granted in favour of Scania should not be
      cancelled.
</p>
<p id="p_75">39.         In view of the discussions made in the preceding paragraphs, we
      direct the MoEF to get public consultation (Public Hearing) conducted for
      the proposed projects at the site or nearby area of the site as per the
      provisions contained in the EIA Notification, 2006.       This direction is
      necessary in order to achieve the object and purpose of the Notification
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                      31</span>


 vis-a-vis the Statute.    Till the aforesaid exercise is completed, the EC
 granted on 5th November, 2008 for the proposed expansion of Integrated
 Steel Plant and Captive Power Plant at Village Kunjipatra, District Raigarh,
 Chhattisgarh by M/s. Scania Steel &amp; Power Limited, shall remain
 suspended. It is needless to say that the MoEF shall take prompt steps
 for completing the exercise of public consultation (Public Hearing) and
 curing the deficiency in EIA/EMP, and re-visit the entire project in the light
 of the observations made by us and complete entire exercise as
 expeditiously as possible.      It is needless to be said that the EC granted
 would be subject to the decision to be taken by the MoEF after public
 consultation, and other directions.
