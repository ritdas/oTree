<p id="p_2">Justice A.S. Naidu (Acting Chairperson)
Dr. G.K. Pandey (Expert Member)


                                          Dated 24th August, 2012



      The Appellant claims to be a public spirited citizen having

experience in working with Steel and Iron industries.         He has

knowledge with regard to the impact caused by the aforesaid

industries in the ecology, environment and human lives. He has

approached this Tribunal, inter-alia, assailing the Environmental

Clearance dated 1st June, 2012, granted by the Ministry of

Environment and Forests (MoEF) to M/s. Rashmi Metaliks Limited

(Respondent No. 3) for expansion of its existing steel plant by

adding 1.5 mtpa Beneficiation cum Pellet Plant which would

enable it to produce 1.2 mtpa pellets with Producer Gas Plant.

The Appellant in this Appeal seeks for following reliefs :-


</p><p id="p_3">      (a) To restrain the Respondent No. 3 from making further

         expansion of its present plant for which already the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              4</span>


  executive summary pertaining to the Public Hearing has

  been published in the month of September, 2011

  (Annexure-A-8)       and       the   appellant     accordingly

  represented to the authorities on 16.07.2011, 17.10.2011

  and   01.11.2011;     (Annexures      A-4,   A-5    and   A-6

  respectively); and

</p><p id="p_4">(b) To quash the Environmental Clearance granted by the

  Respondent No. 2 dated 09.01.2009 (Annexure-A-1),

  which is in flagrant violation of the provisions of the

  Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986, Water (Prevention

  &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention &amp;

  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, and the Rules and

  Regulations framed thereunder, and against the Arbitrary

  Acts and conducts of the Department of Environment,

  Government of West Bengal in violation of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_3">Article 21</a> read

  with <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_4">Article 48A</a> of the Constitution of India as well as in

  contravention of the principles of human rights and public

  policy in general;
</p>
<p id="p_5">(c) To direct the Respondent No. 1, Union of India to

  produce the Environment Clearance if were required in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            5</span>


  the case of Ductile Iron Pile Plant and manufacturing of

  capacity of 2 lac tpa or not?
</p>
<p id="p_6">(d) To   quash   the   illegal    grant   of   license   for   the

  commencement of the production by the Respondent No.

  3 which was obtained pursuant to consent to establish

  also granted without due process of law and as such,

  said commencement of production is against the public

  policy;
</p>
<p id="p_7">(e) To quash the illegal grant for expansion of project for

  installation of Mini Steel Plant by the State Government

  Authorities, which is violative of the provisions of the

  <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and the rules framed

  thereunder as also the notification issued to that effect by

  the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of

  India, New Delhi;
</p>
<p id="p_8">(f) To quash the arbitrary action or inaction on the part of

  the Environment Regulatory Authority and thereby

  enabling the Respondent Nos. 3 herein to perpetrate

  continued violation of the provisions of the Environment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 6</span>


        Protection laws of the Land read with Articles 51A of the

        Constitution of India; and

</p><p id="p_9">     (g) To    cancel/quash     the   Environmental    Clearance

        unlawfully obtained by the Respondent No. 3 from

        Respondent No. 2;
</p>
<p id="p_10">     (h) To stay the operation of the Environmental Clearance

        unlawfully granted by the Respondent No. 2 to the

        Respondent No. 3 till the disposal of the Appeal; and

</p><p id="p_11">     (i) To pass such other further order(s) as this Hon'ble

        Tribunal may deem fit and proper in the interest of

        justice.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">2.   After receiving notice, the Respondents have entered

appearance and filed detailed replies repudiating all the

averments made and allegations levelled in different paragraphs

of the Memorandum of Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">3.   In course of hearing, it appears that a proposal for

expansion had been forwarded to MoEF and the said proposal

was still under consideration. In other words, no decision had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  7</span>


been taken by the competent authority on the date on which this

appeal was presented.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">4.    We have heard Learned Counsel for the parties at length.

First relief sought for by the Appellant is to restrain Respondent

No. 3 from making further expansion of its present plant. Law is

well settled that expansion of existing plant can only be made

after obtaining necessary environmental clearance from the

Competent Authority.     It appears that no clearance has been

granted when the Appeal was filed for expansion and the matter

was pending before the Competent Authority.           According to

Respondent No. 3, he has clearly submitted that without obtaining

prior permission, no extension shall be made.




</p><p id="p_18">5.    Under prayer (b), the Appellant prays to quash the

Environment Clearance granted by the Respondent No. 2 on

09.01.2009 vide Annexure A/1. In consonance with <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_6">Section 16</a> of

the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, an order passed, has to be

assailed before this Tribunal within a period of thirty days. Thus,

the said relief is grossly barred by time and cannot be entertained.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   8</span>


Other reliefs sought are more or less consequential to the prayer

</p><p id="p_19">(a) and (b) and also cannot be entertained at this stage.



</p><p id="p_20">6.        Learned Counsel for the Appellant, in course of hearing,

submitted that the appellant has preferred another Appeal

assailing the Environment Clearance said to have been granted

by the MoEF on 01.06.2012. The said submission clearly reveals

that by afflux of time this appeal has become infructuous.

Considering the facts and circumstances narrated above, we

dismiss this Appeal. It is needless to be said that the appeal said

to have been filed assailing the alleged Environment Clearance

granted on 01.06.2012, shall be disposed of on its own merits in

accordance with law.
