of Spillage of Hazardous Waste also causes Air, Water

and Soil Pollution and therefore, the CPCB cannot

abdicate itself from the regulatory responsibility, though,

the primary role of enforcement is to be played by SPCB.

Under these circumstances, the Tribunal during the

hearing on 18th November 2013 noted that the CPCB

had conducted an inspection of the accident site on 18th

July 2012 itself and therefore, directed CPCB to make its

stand clear.           In response to this, further Affidavit was

filed by CPCB on 19th December 2013 and it has been

submitted that soil samples have been collected during

December 2nd and 3rd, 2013 for further investigations of

waste was spread/washed out in the incident. The waste

was spread inside the premises of the facility as well

outside and about 20,000 sq. m. outside the area was

affected. The CPCB has also mentioned the reasons for

such breach due to either overloading of the waste

disposal in Cell No.4, or entry of rainwater in the Cell

due to improper cover or improper construction of the

wall. It is also submitted by the CPCB that they have

collected samples of water at Bil-khadi on 18,19,20th

Hazardous Wastes Management Rules 2008'. However,

soil in the affected area has higher concentration of total

Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn and Mn, than outside the affected

clearly states that 'it becomes abundantly clear that

because of the accident, situation had become worst, but

since immediately corrective steps were ordered and

implemented             within    2-3   days,   the   situation   was

controlled'. This affidavit reveals that quantity of sludge

slurry accumulated on outside lands subsequent to the

accident was 26,796 MT. It further shows that this has

been lifted back by the Respondent No.4, under the

instructions of the officers of the Pollution Board.


</p><p id="p_43">21. These observations and reports available clearly

demonstrate that the spillage of hazardous waste and its

further drifting has caused environmental impact on the

surrounding environment including adjoining lands and

water bodies. The Tribunal records its finding on Issue

no 1 referred above in affirmative and further find it

necessary to quantity the release of HW and its

associated impacts for suitable remedial measures and

also, decide the issue of any compensation/restitution.

 hazardous waste adjoining to TSDF site and nearby open

land in the surrounding areas, Bhilkhadi and nearby

lands. The total stock of Hazardous waste was 3,46,458

MT in Cell Nos. 3 and 4 as on the date of accident and

approximate quantity of sludge in Cell No.4, was

1,77,000 MT. However, the stock that spilled over from

the location of Cell NO.4 was ETP sludge which was

washed away with rainwater as slurry. Therefore, it was

spread in the nearby area and had gained lot of

moisture.         The       affidavit   further mentions     that    the

quantity of 26796 MT of slurry was lifted and stored in

four different locations before further treatment and

disposal in TSDF. However, significantly this slurry is

shown to have a specific gravity of 0.1 which shows that

this slurry is nothing more but a liquid and liable to flow

away. A specific query was putforth to the Counsel for

the Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 that how much time was

taken to lift the entire quantity of 26796 MT of slurry

and on instructions, he stated that it took about three

(3) months for complete retrieval of the slurry. We find it

technically very difficult to agree that this particular

quantity is the total quantity of hazardous waste which

got spilled over after the accident of 17.7.2012. Further,

the Affidavit of Respondents 3 and 4 also use the

terminology            'washed      away      with   rainwater'     while

describing the incident. July is basically a rainy season

(J) Application No.87/2013 (WZ)
 and considering the fact that Vapi is in coastal area and

experiencing very heavy rainfall, it is difficult to

comprehend such argument. We also find that the

CPCB's first report which was prepared immediately

after the incident reveals that about 25000 MT "waste"

had been spread/washed out in the incident. We put

emphasis on the word 'waste' which is different from

'waste slurry'. Considering above submissions in totally

wherein it is claimed by the TSDF operators that 26796

MT of slurry was lifted with 0.1 specific gravity, it

amounts to 2679.6 MT of hazardous waste.

relevant mid-night, the southern side part of the wall of

the CETP collapsed.                 The debris fell outside the

premises. The Hazardous Waste gushed out and spilled

over. These are tale telling facts and circumstances. It

is obvious that such incident occured as a result of

improper maintenance of the TSDF by the Respondent

No.4.       Nobody can deny that if protective walls were

appropriately             constructed        and    HW   disposal     is

scientifically maintained by the Respondent No.4 then

the bizarre incident would not have occurred.                       The

incident itself is of such nature that no separate proof

for of "negligent act" on part of the Respondent No.4 is

required to be adduced. This is a case in which Principle

of Resipsa loquitur is applicable. We have no hesitation,

therefore,         in     holding   that      the   Respondent      No.4

committed gross negligence which resulted into the

spillage of Hazardous Waste that caused environmental

damage to the surrounding area, including agricultural

lands of the Applicant. Needless to say, the Respondent

Nos.3 and 4 are liable to restore the environment as well

as to pay adequate compensation to the Applicants. The

remedy as available under <a href="/doc/175098716/" id="a_15">Section 18</a> of the National

Green Tribunal Act is inclusive of restitution and

Tribunal has to be done on Polluter Pay's Principle as

enumerated in <a href="/doc/170223725/" id="a_16">Section 20</a> of the National Green Tribunal

<p id="p_51">
</p><p id="p_52">25.              The Polluter Pay's Principal is commonly

interpreted as; the Polluter must pay for the cost of

Pollution abatement, cost of environment recovery, cost

of incident management and compensation costs for the

victims of the damages, if any, due to Pollution.         It

implies that those who caused environment damage by

polluting should pay the costs of reversing that damage

and also controlling the further damage.       Though the

Principle is very simple, its implementation is rather

difficult and complex mainly due to the difficulty in

identification of the Polluters and apportioning their

responsibilities. Another concern, in implementation of

this principle is to how the polluter should pay. Even

the difficulties in restoring the ecological system, once it

is disrupted or contaminated makes the assessment of

payment in the terms of loss (loss of bi-diversity, loss of

habitat, loss of top soil, so on and so forth) difficult.

Moreover, the payment is, at the end of the day,

probably a monetary one. It is well documented that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                  27</span>
(J) Application No.87/2013 (WZ)
 monetary compensation do not essentially fully make up

for ecological loss or loss of resource such as ground

water, top soil, biodiversity and therefore, in reality to

some degree, at least, the polluter never pays the real

cost of the pollution, even if, some restitution or

compensation               is      possible.        The     environmentalist

generally,         therefore,         advocate        the    importance     of

'Precautionary             Principle'     over        the   'Polluter    Pay's

Principle' in the enforcement policies. The environment

damage costing is an evolving subject and can involve

both non market valuation as well as market valuation.

There are various methodologies in literature for such

environmental damage costing such as methods of direct

market         method,            surrogate        market   based   method,

constructed market based method and experimental

method.          In the instant case where the damages are

related to change in water quality of Bhilkhadi, change

in the characteristics of agricultural fields and also loss

of means of livelihood due to not taking crop in the

agricultural fields, a multi-pronged approach based on

above methodologies needs to be taken by this Tribunal.

These are detailed in following paras.

payment. We, therefore, propose to use the information

and       formula          used   by     Collector   in   arriving    at

quantification of the compensation.

<p id="p_56">
</p><p id="p_57">27.              Considering       the    submissions     made       and

referred to above by the CPCB and GPCB and the

operators and locating the missing links, we need to deal

with this uncertainty by developing some empirical co-

relations within the available information and data,

essentially keeping above principles in mind, and even at

the risk of little over-estimating the quantities for

remediation of the environment. We therefore will have

to estimate the quantity of drifted HW using the

observations of CPCB that about 25000 MT of hazardous

waste was slipped over after the incident. The typical

design criterion of TSDF allows the moisture content to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                         29</span>
(J) Application No.87/2013 (WZ)
 be about 40 to 60 %., and therefore considering the

moisture content even at conservative level being 40%,

the HW quantity spilled over is likely to be about 10,000

MT. The facility operators were able to retrieve only

2679.6 MT of hazardous waste (with 0.1 specific

gravity).Therefore, the quantity of hazardous waste,

which got released into environment is a difference

between these values i.e.7320.4 MT.            Further, the

reports of the water quality at Bhilkhadi and soil testing

reports submitted by the GPCB and CPCB clearly

establish beyond doubt that accidental release of

hazardous waste from the accident on 17.7.2012, has

resulted into environmental damages, particularly of

water quality of Bhilkhadi and also contamination of soil

in adjoining lands.

</p><p id="p_59">28.              We have perused various documents on

record to ascertain and assess the damages caused to

the agricultural lands of the Applicants and to quantify

the damages. It is observed for the order passed by the

District Collector, Valsad dated 22-5-2013 that the

agricultural land of 8-63-03 Hectare has been affected

due to the accident and spillage of the Hazardous Waste.

The Collector has also issued orders for compensation of

Rs.3,26,225=34 to 21 farmers as mentioned in the

annexure of the Report.            It is observed that this

compensation has been made for the damages on

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                  30</span>
(J) Application No.87/2013 (WZ)
 account of non-utilization of the agricultural land in one

season. This compensation has been awarded by the

Collector under the powers conferred on him by Section

24 and 29 of Gujarat Disaster Management Act. It is

therefore clearly evident that this compensation is not

for environmental damages as envisaged under the NGT

Act, 2010, including loss of agricultural value of the

affected agricultural lands. It is a kind of solatium given

to the farmers as urgent remedial response under the

special scheme. The arguments of the Respondent 3 and

4 that the Collector has already awarded compensation

and therefore, no further claim needs to be entertained

by this Tribunal, is therefore not acceptable and stands

rejected. It is further observed that the agricultural lands

are affected and damaged due to the spillage of HW from

the CHWTSDF due to the accident on 17.7.2012. Hence

the Issue at no. 2 referred to above is answered by in the

affirmative.

<p id="p_60">
</p><p id="p_61">29.              It is also clear from the CPCB's Affidavit dated

7th February 2014 that during the site Inspection of 2nd

and 3rd December 2013, there was vegetation (mainly

grass) from the affected area out side the TSDF.            This

finding shows that the affected land has not been and

could not be used for the designated agricultural

purposes. This Tribunal is aware that this could be due

to various reasons. However, the contamination of the

(J) Application No.87/2013 (WZ)
 agricultural land soil as reported in the said CPCB

Affidavit could be a more probable reason for non-use of

the agricultural land, even subsequent to the year 2012.

The      Tribunal,          therefore,   finds   it   appropriate   and

justifiable, on the Polluter Pay's Principle that the

Respondents No.3 and 4 need to pay the proportionate

compensation for the damages to the affected farmers

including the ten (10) Applicants as per the formula and

amount derived by the District Collector in the above

order, for the years 2013 and 2014.

carried out any assessment as per the Rule 25(1) and 25

</p><p id="p_65"> 31.              It is observed from this provision that the

State Pollution Control Board has the necessary powers

to assess the damages. However, the reply-affidavit filed

by the GPCB is silent on this aspect.        We express our

anguish for not using these legal provisions by the GPCB

in such serious environmental accident. It is observed

from the CPCB report, wherein possible reasons for

collapsing of retaining wall have been mentioned, that

the poor operation of TSDF is the main possible reason

for the collapse. It is also observed from the GPCB visit

reports that the TSDF operator has non-complied with

the conditions of Authorisation and also the instructions

given by GPCB in various visit reports. We therefore find

it surprising that GPCB has not taken any credible legal

action like prosecution in spite of repeated non-

compliances by the operators (Respondent Nos.3 and 4).

occurred on 17.7.2012, has been investigated by the

GPCB by deploying additional manpower and also

carrying out water quality analysis tests and soil

analysis tests, besides deputing additional manpower so

as to investigate environmental damages due to such

accident. This entire exercise has been done at the costs

of the public exchequer, and therefore, the accident and

its after effects needs to be considered on 'Polluter Pay's

implemented by TSDF. We have also, noted various non-

compliances reported by GPCB in its various visit

reports, mainly related to high moisture content, entry of

rain water in cells, non-covering the cells in rainy season

etc. We are concerned about such non-compliances by

TSDF, as these facilities have been developed as

specialized facilities to handle and safely dispose of the

hazardous waste received from member industries, and

as such they are expected to follow the strict protocol

and comply with the conditions of Authorisation, in their

operations. CPCB has mentioned requirement of pre-
