                            ------------

Dated, the 11th July, 2008.

</pre><p id="p_1">           Few residents of Village-Matia in Block-Laxmipur,

District-Jamui, have approached this Court in public interest alleging

construction of brick kiln chimney by respondent no.8 in the

residential area. According to the petitioners, the said brick kiln

chimney is hazardous and detrimental to health of general public of

the village and without obtaining no objection certificate from Bihar

State Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           2.    Bihar State Pollution Control Board (respondent no.3

to the writ petition) has filed a written response. They have placed on

record, guidelines framed by them for the establishment (location) of

brick kilns under the provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   -2-</span>




Act, 1981 and the Rules framed thereunder and the notifications

issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forest. Inter alia, as

regards location of brick kilns, the guidelines provide that such brick

kilns shall observe a minimum distance of 200 m. from residential

area having 200 permanent dwellers and more. In case of disputes,

however, a certificate from the concerned Circle Officer in this

regards shall be taken as final proof in respect of permanent dwellers.

</p><p id="p_3">           3.          Upon the application having been made by

respondent no.8, for establishment of brick kiln at Mauza-Matia,

Khata No.177, Khesra No.1913, 1914, 1915, 1933, 1917, 1904, 1842,

the site was inspected under the provisions of the Act of 1974 and the

Act 1981. Inter alia, the distance of the site from minor settlement

(minimum 200 permanent dwellers) have been found to be 200 m.,

Railway line and major settlement, are quite at some distance i.e.

more than 10 k.ms. away. Thus, the Bihar State Pollution Control

Board found that the proposal for establishment of brick kiln by

respondent no.8, met the guidelines and granted its consent to

establish the said brick kiln by its order dated 25th October, 2007.

</p><p id="p_4">           4.       The counsel for the petitioners heavily relied upon

a communication dated 8th August, 2007, sent by Block Development

Officer, Laxmipur to the District Magistrate, Jamui, wherein it is

stated that a brick kiln is being established within 100 ft. of a

residential house, agricultural land and Airtel Telephone tower and

that by establishment of such brick kiln, pollution problem in the area
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    -3-</span>




may arise. The counsel submits that there is, thus, contradiction in the

check-list prepared by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board and the

letter dated 8th August, 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            5.     We are afraid, the letter dated 8th August, 2007 does

not lead to an inference that brick kiln is within 100 ft. of a residential

area or minor settlement as contemplated by the guidelines framed by

the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. For a residential area (minor

settlement), the guidelines framed by the Bihar State Pollution Control

Board, contemplates minimum 200 permanent dwellers. The letter

dated 8th August, 2007 does not show anything otherwise. Merely

because one house is situated within 100 ft. of the brick kiln

established by respondent no.8, it cannot be said that it is within 200

m. of a residential colony or minor settlement.

</p><p id="p_6">            6.        We are satisfied with the consideration of the

application made by respondent no.4 for grant of consent to establish

by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            7.        No interference is called for in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            8.         Writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
</p>
