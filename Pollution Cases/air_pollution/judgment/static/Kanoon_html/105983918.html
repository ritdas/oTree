BY THE COURT : (Per Hon'ble Mr.Arun Mishra, CJ)</pre>

<p id="p_1">      These writ petitions have been filed questioning

the validity of Chapter VII of the Rajasthan Finance Act,

2008, hereinafter for the sake of brevity referred-to as

"the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2">Finance Act</a>, 2008", providing for levy of cess on

mineral rights and, therefore, they are being disposed-

of together by this common order.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      Petitioners are holders of mining leases granted

for   extraction     of   major    minerals     or    re-using    major

minerals.     They    have    been     called   upon     to     pay   the

environment and health cess imposed under Section 16

of the Rajasthan Finance Act. In exercise of the powers

conferred by <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_3">Section 19</a> of the Finance Act, 2008, the

State    Government          has    framed      the     rules     called

Rajasthan Environment and Health Cess Rules, 2008,

hereinafter for the sake of brevity referred-to as "the

Rules of 2008". Rule 13 of the Rules of 2008 provides

for the head under which cess collected under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_4">Section

16</a> of the Finance Act, 2008 is to be credited. Rule 14 of

the Rules of 2008 provides for the allocation of the

funds   for   the    implementation       of    environmental         and

health projects in mining areas of the various parts of

the State. Petitioners have submitted that the field is

occupied by the provisions of the Mines and Minerals

(Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_5">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957, hereinafter

for the sake of brevity referred to as "<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_6">MMDR Act</a>,1957"

enacted by the Central Government. Thus, the field is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     5</span>

very much occupied as per the declaration made in

<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_7">MMDR     Act</a>,1957      and    the   State         Government        had   no

competence to enact the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_8">Finance Act</a>, 2008 and the

Rules   framed      thereunder.         It   is   submitted     that      the

<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_9">MMDR Act</a>,1957 occupies the whole field. <a href="/doc/1588675/" id="a_10">Section 2</a> of

MMDR Act,1957 deals with the declaration as to the

expediency of the Union control. <a href="/doc/479266/" id="a_11">Section 9</a> of MMDR

Act,1957 provides for realization of Royalty in respect

of mining leases. <a href="/doc/1632341/" id="a_12">Section 13</a> deals with the power of the

Central Government to make rules in respect of major

minerals. It is submitted that under <a href="/doc/1632341/" id="a_13">Section 13(i)</a> of

MMDR Act,1957, the fixing and collection of fees for

or charges and the time within which and the manner in

which the dead rent or royalty shall be payable, have

been provided. It is provided in <a href="/doc/1164073/" id="a_14">Section 13(2)(qq)</a> the

manner    in    which    rehabilitation           of   flora   and    other

vegetation,     such    as     trees,        shrubs     and    the     like,

destroyed      by   reason    of    any      prospecting       or    mining

operations shall be made good by the person holding

by authority of law. <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_41">Article 246</a> deals with the subject

is inconsistency in the law made by the Parliament and

the law of the State Legislature, the Central Legislation

has    to    prevail.     Reference         has    been    made      to    Entry

Nos.54, 55, 86, 96 and 97 of List I of Schedule-VII of

the Constitution of India. Learned counsel have also

referred to Entry Nos.6, 49, 50 and 66 of List II and

Entry Nos.17A, 17B, 23 and 47 of the List III. Counsel

have     also      relied   upon       the     declaration      as    to     the

expediency of Union control made in <a href="/doc/1588675/" id="a_43">Section 2</a> of MMDR

Act,1957. Thus, the field is stated to be fully occupied

by     the    Central       Legislation           with    respect     to     the

declaration made under <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_44">MMDR Act</a>,1957. The State is

not delegated the power to enact the law as to major

provisions of ss.13(1), 13(2)(i), 13(2)(qq) &amp; 13(2)(r) to

contend       that    the    field    is    occupied      by   the    Central

Legislation and the State could have made rules only in

respect of the minor minerals as has been provided in

<a href="/doc/1661544/" id="a_46">Section 15(1)</a> of MMDR Act,1957. <a href="/doc/25002195/" id="a_47">Section 18</a> of MMDR

<a href="/doc/154093118/" id="a_48">Section 25</a> thereof deals with the recovery of certain

sums as arrears of land revenue. Thus, the State could

not have enacted the provisions under Chapter VII of

the Finance Act, 2008. Learned Senior Counsel has also

referred to the rules called the Rules of 1988 dealing

with the "environment" and "environmental pollution" in

the field of the mineral conservation and development.

He has also relied upon the definition of "environment"

and     "environmental    pollution"     under   Rule    3(j).

Reference has also been made to Rule 23F of the Rules

of 1988, which provides for financial assurance and

other   provisions in Chapter      V of the Rule    of   1988

relating to "environment". Thus, it was submitted that

environmental    field   is   occupied   by   the   aforesaid

legislation and consequently, the State has no power to

levy environment and health cess. Learned Sr.Counsel

has also relied upon the provisions contained in Chapter

V of the Act of 1952 providing for health and safety of

the workers working in the Mines. He has also relied

upon Chapter VI dealing with Hours and Limitation of

Employment and Chapter VII dealing with Leave with

<a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_49">Wages of the Act</a> of 1952 to contend that the field is

fully occupied by the Central Legislature. Reliance has

also been placed on the provisions of the Rules of 1955.

Chapter V of the Rules of 1955 deals with the Health

and Sanitation Provisions. Chapter VI deals with First-

Aid and Medical Appliances. Chapter VIII provides for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                       13</span>

Leave with Wages and Overtime and Chapter IX deals

with the Welfare Amenities. Rule 82 of the Rules of

1955     has       also    been   referred    providing    for    Fees   of

medical practitioner in case of occupational diseases &amp;

Rule 83 prescribes the Mode of payment of fees etc.

Reliance has also been placed on the provisions of the

Act of 1986 as also the Act of 1974 and the Act of

1981. The precise submission of the learned Senior

Counsel       is    that    the    State    has   no    power     to   levy

environmental or health cess in so far as it concerns

with the major minerals, the same amounts to levy of

excise on major minerals, which is impermissible. <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_50">The

Act</a>s and the Rules, referred-to above, are stated to

take care of environmental and health aspects, thus,

the State was incompetent to enact the provision with

respect to environment and health cess; the State could

have enacted if at all the provision with respect to

minor mineral only. The cess levied is in the nature of

fee and the fee on the major mineral is covered by the

provisions of <a href="/doc/1632341/" id="a_51">Section 13</a> of MMDR Act,1957 as also the

Act     of    1952    and    the    Rules    of   1988.    It    was   also

submitted that in case, the cess is a tax, then also, the

field    is   covered       by    <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_52">MMDR      Act</a>,1957,     other   Central

enactments and the Rules framed thereunder. It has

also been held wrongly that a typographical error crept

in the judgment of the India Cement; the correctness of

Keso Ram (supra) has been referred to the larger Bench
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                      14</span>

by the Apex Court, as such, it cannot be relied upon;

the law has not been correctly laid down in Keso Ram

(supra); the decision of the larger Bench is binding, as

the case of India Cement was decided by the Seven

Judge Bench. Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel

has also submitted that the notification dt.23.1.2009

with respect to rock phosphate matters suffers with

illegality as it seeks to enhance levy of health cess with

retrospective effect i.e. 1.4.2008. The notification is

subordinate legislation, thus, it could not have been

given      restrospective     effect      in   the   absence        of    main

legislation       providing    for     the     same.       Counsel        also

submitted that the question whether the Royalty was a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                 31</span>

clear that financial assurance is related to reclamation

financial assurance. The financial assurance which is covered

under the second proviso to Rule 23F of the Rules of 1988 is

relating to progressive closure of mine and reclamation and

rehabilitation to be done as envisaged under the provisions of

<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_99">MMDR Act</a>,1957. Such financial assurance does not cover the

provisions of the Act of 1952. The endeavour made by

Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned Sr.Counsel, while making the

</p>
<p id="p_53">      Submission has been raised by Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned

Sr.Counsel, that the provisions contained in Chapter VII of the

Finance Act, 2008 levying environment and health cess in so far

as it concerns major mineral, is ultravires the powers of the

State Legislature. He has submitted that Entry 54 of the List I of

Seventh Schedule provides for the jurisdiction of the Parliament

alone to legislate on the subject of Regulation of Mines and Min-

eral Development to the extent to which such regulation and de-

velopment under the control of the Union is declared by the Par-

liament by law to be expedient in the public interest. Entry 55

provides for the jurisdiction of the Parliament to legislate on Reg-

ulation of labour and safety in mines &amp; oilfields. Under Entry 54,

the Parliament has enacted <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_126">MMDR Act</a>,1957 and the Act of 1952

and the Mines Rules 1955 and the Mines Rescue Rules, 1985.

<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_127">Under MMDR Act</a>,1957, the Rules of 1988 have been framed.

Under <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_128">Section 15</a> of MMDR Act,1957, the Central Government

has delegated the powers on the State Government with respect

Government to take all such steps as may be necessary for the

</p><p id="p_54">      The Apex Court in Keso Ram (supra) has held that while

reading the three Lists, List I has priority over Lists III and II,

and List III has priority over List II. However, still, the predomi-

nance of the Union List would not prevent the State Legislature
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                  35</span>

from dealing with any matter within List II though it may inci-

dentally affect any item in List I. The Apex Court has laid down in

para 31(6) thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_54">      31(6) The doctrine of occupied field applies only when
      there is a clash between the Union and the State Lists
      within an area common to both. There the doctrine of pith
      and substance is to be applied and if the impugned legisla-
      tion substantially falls within the power expressly conferred
      upon the Legislature which enacted it, an incidental en-
      croaching in the field assigned to another Legislature is to
      be ignored. While reading the three Lists, List I has priority
      over Lists III and II, and List III has priority over List II.
      However, still, the predominance of the Union List would
      not prevent the State Legislature from dealing with any
      matter with in List II though it may incidentally affect any
      item in List I.</blockquote><p id="p_55">

</p><p id="p_56">      We find no repugnancy in the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_130">Finance Act</a>, 2008 and the rules framed thereunder with

the aforesaid legislation, as the Apex Court has laid

down that in spite of the fields of legislation having

been demarcated, the question of repugnancy between

law made by Parliament and a law made by the State

Legislature     may     arise only in cases when         both the

legislations occupy the same field with respect to one of

the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List and if a

direct conflict is seen. If there is a repugnancy due to

overlapping found between List II on the one hand and

List I and List III on the other, the State law will be

ultravires and shall have to give way to the Union law.

Where there are three Lists containing a large number

of   entries,   there    is   bound   to   be   some   overlapping

among them but the Entries In List I and List II must be

so construed as to avoid any conflict. If there is no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                    36</span>

conflict, an occasion for deriving assistance from non-

obstante clause "subject to" as enumerated in <a href="/doc/369702/" id="a_131">Article

245(1)</a> of the Constitution does not arise. If there is

conflict, the correct approach is to find an answer to

three questions step by step, (i) Whether it is still

possible to effect reconciliation between two Entries so

as to avoid conflict and overlapping? (ii) In which Entry,

the impugned legislation falls? The doctrine of pith and

substance      is   sometimes           expressed      in    terms     of

ascertaining the true character of legislation. The name

given by the Legislature to the legislation is immaterial.

Regard must be had to the enactment as a whole to its

main      objects   and    to    the    scope    and    effect   of    its

provisions. Incidental and superficial encroachments are

to   be     disregarded.        That    interpretation       would     be

preferred     which    would      avoid    conflict     between       two

legislations. The Court shall have regard to the object

and the scheme of the tax law under consideration and

the purpose for which the cess is levied, collected and

intended to be used. The Courts shall make endeavour

to   search    where      the   impact    of    the   cess   falls.   The

subject matter of levy is not to be confused with the

method and manner of assessment or realisation and

</p><p id="p_57">(iii) Having determined the field of legislation wherein

the impugned legislation falls by applying doctrine of

pith and substance, can an incidental trenching upon

another field of legislation be ignored? Once it is so
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                37</span>

determined that the impugned legislation substantially

falls within the power expressly conferred upon the

Legislature which enacted it, an incidental encroaching

in the field assigned to another Legislature is to be

ignored. While laying down so, the Apex Court has

relied upon the decisions in <a href="/doc/703764/" id="a_132">Hoechst Pharmaceuticals

Ltd.    v.    State   of   Bihar</a>,     (1983)        4    SCC      45,

</p><p id="p_58">33.

       The Apex Court has further laid down that every effort

should be made as far as possible to reconcile the seeming

conflict between the provisions of the State Legislation and the

Union Legislation. In view of what has been laid down in Keso

Ram (supra), we are of the considered opinion that it cannot be

said that the cess in issue is a case of levy on extraction of

minerals. It cannot also be said that the cess levied is a royalty

covered under <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_135">MMDR Act</a>,1957. The cess impugned is an impost,

which is levied on the mineral rights. It is a cess within the

purview of Entry 50 of List II of Seventh Schedule as per <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_136">Section

16</a> of the Finance Act, 2008 for the purpose of environment and

health as clarified in aims and objects of the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_137">Finance Act</a>, 2008

and the rules framed thereunder. We are of the considered

opinion that merely by making certain provisions for the safety

of the persons employed in mines with respect to financial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                      38</span>

security etc., it cannot be said that the field is covered by the

declaration made in <a href="/doc/1588675/" id="a_138">Section 2</a> and the provisions contained in

<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_139">MMDR Act</a>,1957.
</p>
<p id="p_59">         The fields of taxation in List I are with respect to the power

of the Union and with respect to the power of the State in List II

and there can be no overriding in the field of taxation. The Apex

Court has clarified in Kesoram (supra) that there can be an

overlapping in fact, as the methodology or mechanism adopted

for assessment and quantification can be similar for taxes

relating to different fields of taxation but there can be no

overlapping in law i.e. even though the mechanism adopted for

assessment is similar but the subject matter of two taxes by

reference to the two Lists can be different and, therefore, the

two taxes cannot be said to be overlapping. The Apex Court

relied    upon    the   Hoechst    Pharmaceuticals   Ltd's   case   and

Governor         General   in     Council's   case   (supra).   Thus,

merely because the health and environment cess is

measured by the quantity of the mineral removed, it

cannot be said that it is tax on mineral or because of

the measure adopted, it ceases to be a cess on mineral

rights. The Apex Court has laid down in the case of

Kesoram (supra) in para 31(1) thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_55">      31.(1) the various entries in the three Lists are not
     'powers' of legislation but 'fields' of legislation. The
     Constitution effects a complete separation of the taxing
     power of the Union and of the States under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_140">Article 246.</a>
     There is no overlapping anywhere in the taxing power and
     the Constitution gives independent sources of taxation to
     the Union and the States."

with respect to protection of environment and health of the

which have been pressed into service by Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned

Sr.Counsel, it cannot be said that the State is denuded of its

power to enact the provisions contained in Chapter VII of the

Seventh Schedule &amp; <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_141">Art.265</a> of the Constitution, the Apex Court

in Kesoram (supra) has laid down that The legislative power to

itself makes the field 'subject to' any other entry or abstracts the

field by any limitations imposable and permissible. A tax or fee

levied by State with the object of augmenting its finances and in

reasonable limits does not ipso facto trench upon regulation,

development or control of the subject, the power to legislate

whereof has been conferred on the parliament. It is different, if

the tax or fee sought to be levied, by State can itself be called

regulatory, the primary purpose whereof is to regulate or control

and augmentation of revenue or rendering service is only

secondary or incidental. Thus, in our opinion, the State could not

be denied its plenary power to tax mineral rights when it wants

to augment its finances in reasonable limits. Thus, levy of cess

on environment and health purpose does not trench upon

regulation, development or control of the subject, under <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_142">MMDR

Act</a>,1957 enacted by the Parliament. In case, the Parliament has

chosen not to legislate and failed to say something explicit, it is

not for the court to venture into an enquiry to find and hold that

what tax would hamper mineral development. It has been held in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                 40</span>

Kesoram (supra) that Entries 52, 53 and 54 in List I are not

heads of taxation. They are general entries. Fields of taxation

covered by Entries 49 and 50 in List II continue to remain with

State Legislatures in spite of the Union having enacted laws by

reference to Entries 52, 53, 54 in List I. It has been further laid

down that it is for the Parliament to legislate and impose

limitations on the State's otherwise plenary power to levy taxes

on mineral rights or taxes on lands (including mineral bearing

lands) by reference to Entries 50 and 49 in List II and lay down

the limitations on the State's power, if it chooses to do so, and

also to define the extent and sweep of such limitations. So long

as a tax or fee on mineral rights remains in pith and substance a

tax for augmenting the revenue resources of the State or a fee

for rendering services by the State and it does not impinge upon

regulation of mines and mineral development or upon control of

industry by the Union, it is not unconstitutional. Thus, the

regulation of mines and minerals vesting in the Union Govt. in

<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_143">MMDR Act</a>,1957 &amp; the Act of 1952 and Rules of 1955 and Rules

of 1988 relied upon by Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel,

appearing on behalf of the petitioners, could not have come in

the way of the State to enact the impugned provision in

question, as it does not either impinge upon regulation of mines

and mineral development or upon control of industry by the

Union. The State is augmenting its revenue resources for the

purpose of environment and health. The power to tax the

mineral rights is with the State. The power to curtail the exercise

of such power is with the Union. This is the result achieved
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                    41</span>

by homogeneous reading of Entry 50 in List II and

Entries 52 and 54 in List I. So long as a tax or fee on

mineral rights remains in pith and substance a tax for

augmenting the revenue resources of the State or a fee

for rendering services by the State and it does not

impinge          upon   regulation      of        mines     and      mineral

development or upon control of industry by the Central

Government, it is not unconstitutional.</blockquote><p id="p_60">

</p><p id="p_61">       We find no limitation having been imposed in any

of the Central Legislation in the field of taxation of

subject to the provisions of List I. The power of the

State to enact legislation with respect to mineral rights

is plenary. Any Legislation by the Union in the field

commensurate                  with    public         interest.         Considering            the

no    denial        to    the    State          to    enact          the    provision         like

</p>
<p id="p_63">       An effort was made by Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned

Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the petitioners,

to    give     wide           meaning       to       the       provisions          of    <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_149">MMDR

Act</a>,1957.The              Apex        Court          in    Kesoram           (supra)          has

cautioned and dealt with the submission and it has been

laid down that in spite of an inclination on the part of

the Courts to be liberal in assigning a wide meaning to

the scope of the qualifying words used in Entry 54 of

the     List    I        and     <a href="/doc/1588675/" id="a_150">Section         2</a>        of    MMDR         Act,1957,the

boundaries of limitation exist and the expanse of these

provisions cannot be so stretched as to strike at the

State          Legislations                     which                are          adequately
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                 43</span>

accommodated within the field of an Entry in List II

which too shall have to be meaningfully and liberally

construed. The effect of the declaration u/s.2 of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_151">MMDR

Act</a>,1957 is that no State Legislature shall have power

to enact any legislation touching (i) the regulation of

mines, (ii) the development of minerals, and (iii) to the

extent provided by Act No. 67 of 1957 but this does not

exclude the power to tax mineral right under Entry 50

of List II.
</p>
<p id="p_64">     Upon careful reading of the provisions of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_152">MMDR

Act</a>,1957, the field to tax mineral rights cannot be said

to be reserved for the Central Government. In our

opinion, the State has right to levy the tax on mineral

rights as envisaged under Entry 50 of List II of Seventh

Schedule      of   the   Constitution.   The   Apex   Court   in

Kesoram (supra) has further laid down that a mineral

right is the right to search for the development and

remove materials from the land. Mineral is something

which grows in a mine and is capable of being won or

extracted so as to be subjected to a better or precious

use. Until extracted, the mineral forms part of the crust

of the earth. The expanse of Entry 54 of List I cannot

be so stretched as to strike at the State Legislations,

which are adequately accommodated within the field of

an Entry in List II. The Apex Court has laid down thus:

</p>     137. All the minerals form part of the land.<p id="p_65">
</p><p id="p_66">     Minerals are conceived by the mother earth by the
     process of nature and nurtured over innumerable
     number of years and delivered on their assuming
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                        44</span>

value and utility for the earthlings. Generally and
broadly speaking - and that would suffice for our
purpose, a mine is an excavation in the earth which
yields minerals. Mineral is something which grows
in a mine and is capable of being won or extracted
so as to be subjected to a better or precious use.
Until extracted, the mineral forms part of the crust
of the earth. A mineral right, according to Black's
Law Dictionary (Seventh Edition) is the right to
search for, develop, and remove materials from the
land. It also means the right to receive a royalty
based on the production of minerals which right is
usually granted by a mineral lease. In both the
senses, the right vests in the owner of the land and
is capable of being parted with.
</p>
<p id="p_67">139. It is true that once a central legislation
declares    regulation    of   mines    and    mineral
development by law to be expedient in the public
interest, the legislation relating to regulation of
mines and development of minerals shall fall within
the sweep of Entry 54 of List I. The entry has to be
liberally and widely interpreted. Yet it cannot be
lost sight of that the entry itself employs an
expression "to the extent to which such regulation
and development under the control of the Union is
declared by Parliament by law" as qualifying the
preceding     expression     stating    the    subject
"regulation of mines and minerals development",
<a href="/doc/1588675/" id="a_153">Section 2</a> of MMDR Act too qualifies the relevant
declaration by suffixing to It the expression "to the
extent hereinafter provided". <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_154">Section 15</a> of the Act
has excepted and preserved the power of State
Governments to make rules in respect of minor
minerals. The qualifying words used in Entry 54 of
List I end in <a href="/doc/1588675/" id="a_155">Section 2</a> of the MMDR Act contain an
in-built indication that in spite of an inclination on
the part of the Courts to be liberal in assigning a
wide meaning to the scope of the said provisions,
the boundaries of limitation are there and the
expanse of these provisions cannot be so stretched
as to strike at the State Legislations which are
adequately accommodated within the field of an
Entry in List II which too shall have to be
meaningfully and liberally construed.

</p><p id="p_68">140. <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_156">The MMDR Act</a> enables control over the
regulation   of   mines   and   thedevelopment    of
minerals    being    exercised    by    the  Central
Government through legislation. The High Court
has upheld the validity of the SADA Act by relating
it to Entry 5 in List II which is local government'.
Any local government exercising the power of
governance over a local area shall have to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                               45</span>

    administer, manage and develop the area lying
    within its territory which cannot be done without
    raising funds. It is usual for every piece of
    legislation giving birth to an institution of local
    government to feed it by incorporating provisions
    conferring power of generating funds for meeting
    the expenses of governance, The SA.DA Act intends
    to achieve a level of local governance which the
    usual models of local government such as boards
    and municipalities are not considered capable of
    achieving and that is why a special development
    area and a Special Area Development Authority.
    The fund established under the Act meets expenses
    of administration needed to be incurred by the
    authority. The funds cannot be utilized for any
    purpose other than the administration of the Act.
    There are pieces of land which though containing a
    mine yet fall within the territory of special
    development area. It was pointed out by the
    respondents before the High Court that in spite of
    the. Act having been enacted In the year 1986 the
    successive     State   Governments,     which    had
    preceded, did not take care of the legislation and it
    was only the then government which became
    conscious of Its obligations under the SADA Act and
    commenced identifying special areas requiring
    development such as Sonbhadra, The imposition of
    cess envisaged through the SADA Act and the Rules
    was a step towards developing the special area, It
    is a matter of common knowledge, and does not
    need any evidence to demonstrate, that mining
    activity carried on the land within the special area
    involves extraction, removal, loading-unloading,
    and transportation of the minerals accompanied by
    its    natural   consequences    entailed   on   the
    environment and the infrastructure such as roads,
    water and power supply etc. within the special
    area. The impugned cess can, therefore, be
    justified as a fee for rendering such services as
    would improve the Infrastructure and general
    development of the area the benefits whereof
    would be availed even by the stone crushers. Entry
    66 in List II is available to provide protective
    constitutional coverage to the impugned levy as
    fee."
</p>
<p id="p_69">     A   charging   Section        is   necessary   especially

empowering the State to levy tax.          <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_157">Section 16</a> of the

Finance Act, 2008 is the charging Section. It clearly

provides that the cess is levied on mineral rights. Thus,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                 46</span>

we have to go by the charging provision, not by the

be form of excise on minerals on which the Royalty is

levied under <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_158">MMDR Act</a>,1957.
</p>
<p id="p_70">     The Apex Court has laid down that under <a href="/doc/1164073/" id="a_159">Sections

13(2)(i)</a>, <a href="/doc/1164073/" id="a_160">13(2)(qq)</a> and <a href="/doc/192939866/" id="a_161">18(2)</a> of MMDR Act,1957, the

power to levy tax or fee cannot be spelled out from the

said provisions, hence, <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_162">MMDR Act</a>,1957 has not placed

any limitation on the powers of the State to legislate in

the field of taxation on the mineral rights. The Apex

Court has also considered the expression "other fees or

charges" as enumerated in <a href="/doc/1164073/" id="a_163">Section 13(2)(i)</a> of MMDR

Act,1957, which provision has also been relied upon by

Mr.M.S.Singhvi,       Learned    Sr.Counsel,       appearing   on

behalf of the petitioners. The Apex Court has laid down

that they have to be interpreted ejusdem generis taking

colour from other words and phrases employed in the

same clause. The word "charges" cannot and does not

include    within   its   meaning    any   tax,   The   expression

"other fees or charges" must be assigned such meaning

as to include therein only such fees and charges as are

meant for regulation or development. Thus, the cess in

question is not covered under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1164073/" id="a_164">Section

13(2)(i)</a>     of     MMDR     Act,1957      as     contended    by

of the Act of 1957. The Apex Court considering the

</p><p id="p_72">(q) speaks of fee to be paid on applications for revision

and not on minerals, mineral rights or mining land.

<a href="/doc/154093118/" id="a_171">Section 25</a> speaks of 'recovery of tax and fee' amongst

others. Two observations are spontaneous. Firstly a

provision for recovery, being a machinery provision,

cannot be read as empowering the levy of tax or fee.

Secondly, it speaks of tax or fee being due to the

Government      without         defining   the    same      and   without

qualifying the word "Government' with Central or State.

A   perusal   of     several     provisions      of   the   Act   and    in

particular <a href="/doc/691913/" id="a_172">Sections 9A</a>, <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_173">15</a>, <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_174">15</a>(1-A)(a) and (g), 15(3),

17(3),   21(5),      25    goes    to    show    that    the    power    of

recovery is invariably given to the State Government

and obviously the word 'Government' in <a href="/doc/154093118/" id="a_175">Section 25</a>

refers   to    the     State      Government,           which     only   is

empowered to recover the sums due as arrears of land

revenue.      Thus,       the    submission      of     Mr.M.S.Singhvi,

learned Sr.Counsel, stands repelled by the dictum of

the Apex Court.
</p>
<p id="p_73">      The Apex Court has also considered the tax on

mineral rights on coal and brick matters. In Kesoram

(supra), while considering the question in coal matters

annual value of the coal bearing land as the basis and

in the brick earth matters, the quantity of brick earth
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                            48</span>

dispatched, the Apex Court has laid down that assuming

both the matters to be a tax on mineral rights, it would

be covered by Entry 50 in the List II. By reference to

Entry 50 of List II and Entry 54 in List I, the Central

legislation has not cast any limitations on the State

Legislature's power to tax mineral rights, or land for

that matter. The impugned cess was held to be a tax on

coal-bearing and mineral-bearing land. It was construed

as a tax on mineral rights and was, therefore, held to

be valid.
</p>
<p id="p_74">     The Apex Court has laid down in para 130 thus:

     "130. The amendments incorporated by the West
     Bengal Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act 1992
     w.e.f. 1.4.1992 into the provisions of the West
     Bengal Primary Education Act 1973 and the West
     Bengal Rural Employment and <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_176">Production Act</a> 1976
     classify the land into three categories: (i) coal-
     bearing land, (ii) mineral bearing land (other than
     coal-bearing land) or quarry and (iii) land other
     than the preceding two categories. These three are
     well-defined classifications by reference to the
     user or quality and the nature of product which it
     is capable of yielding. The cess is levied on the
     land. The method of quantifying the tax is by
     reference to the annual value thereof. It is well-
     known that one of the major factors contributing
     to the value of the land is what it produces or is
     capable of producing. Merely because the quantum
     of coal produced and dispatched or the, quantum
     of mineral produced and dispatched from the land
     is   the   factor   taken   into   consideration  for
     determining the value of the land, it does not
     become a tax on coal or minerals. Being a tax on
     land it is fully covered by Entry 49 in List II.
     Assuming it to be a tax on mineral rights it would
     be covered by Entry 50 in List II. Taxes on mineral
     rights lie within the legislative competence of the
     Stats Legislature "subject to" any limitation
     imposed by Parliament by law, relating to mineral
     development. The Central legislation has not
     placed any limitation on the power of the States to
     legislate In the field of taxation on mineral rights.
     The challenge to constitutional validity of State
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                  49</span>

       legislation is founded on non-availability of
       legislative field to State; it has not been the case
       of any of the writ petitioners that there are
       limitations enacted by Central legislation and the
       State of West Bengal has breached or crossed
       those limits. Simply because incidence of tax is
       capable of being passed on to buyers or consumers
       by the mine owners with an escalating affect on
       the price of the coal, it cannot be inferred that the
       tax has an adverse effect on mineral development.
       Entry 23 in List II. speaks of regulation of mines
       and    mineral    developments,    subject   to   the
       provisions of List I with respect to regulation and
       development under the control of the Union. The
       Central Legislation has taken over regulation and
       development of mines, and mineral development in
       public interest. By reference to Entry 50 of List II
       and Entry 54 in List I, the Central legislation has
       not cast any limitations on the State Legislature's
       power to tax mineral rights, or land for the matter
       of that. The impugned cess is a tax on coal-
       bearing and mineral-bearing land. It can at the
       most be construed to be a tax on mineral rights.
       In either case, the impugned cess is covered by
       Entries 49 and 50 of List II. The West Bengal
       Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act 1992 must be and
       Is held to be intra vires the Constitution."


       It was also contended by Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned

Sr.Counsel, appearing on behalf of the petitioners, that

the quantity, which is dispatched, is taxed. As cess is

levied on mineral dispatched which makes it a tax on

mineral extracted. In our opinion, it is a mere measure

of taxation. The cess is not levied on the production of

the mineral. The Apex Court in Kesoram (supra) has

laid down that Entry 54 in List I does not cast any

limitations   on   the   State   Legislature's   power    to   tax

mineral rights.
</p>
<p id="p_75">       The Apex Court has considered the nature of tax,

subject of tax and measure/mode/machinery of tax. The

Apex    Court   also     considered   the   question     whether

adoption of same measure of taxation can trench upon

field     of    legislation          of another             legislature. The             Apex

Court has laid down that the standard adopted as a

measure of levy may be indicative of the nature of the

tax, but it does not necessarily determine it and its

effect must be weighed alongwith and in the light of the

other relevant circumstances. When enacting a measure

to    serve      as       a    standard          for     assessing      the       levy    i.e.

measure of tax, the Legislature need not contour it

along lines which spells out the character of the levy

itself.        The    legislature                being      permitted         a    greater

latitude, like play in the joints, in the field of taxation

and economic activity, even crudities and inequities

having to be accommodated, any measure of tax which

maintains a nexus with the essential character of the

levy can be regarded as a valid basis for assessing the

measure          of           the    levy.            Adoption     of     the        same

measure/mechanism                      of    taxation        by    two    legislatures

cannot ipso facto imply a trenching of either field of

legislation, so long as the essential character of levy is

not     departed              from     within         the   four   corners          of    the

particular entry. The legislature is free to adopt such

method of levy as it chooses. Thus, merely by the fact

that      cess       is       levied        on     the      measure      of       quantity

dispatched under Sec.16 of the Finance Act, 2008, its

nature is not changed from being a cess on mineral

rights to a tax on minerals.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                      51</span><p id="p_76">

</p><p id="p_77">     The       Apex   Court     in        Kesoram(supra)      has     also

considered the meaning of `land' and `rights in land',

used in Entry 49 of List II of Seventh Schedule and it

has been held that the land includes all strata above or

below   the     surface    of   the       earth.   Therefore,   merely

because    a    tax   on   land      or    buildings   is   imposed    by

reference to its income or yield, it does not cease to be

a tax on land or buildings. The income or yield of the

land/building is taken merely as a measure of the tax.

Thus, in the instant case, merely by adopting measure

of quantity dispatched, the cess on mineral rights will

not become a royalty or a cess on mineral. The Apex

Court has further laid down that considering purport of

Entry 49 in List II of Seventh Schedule, one of the

major factors contributing to the value of the land is

what it produces or is capable of producing. Merely

because the quantum of coal produced and dispatched

or the, quantum of mineral produced and dispatched

from the land is the factor taken into consideration for

determining the value of the land, it does not become a

tax on coal or minerals. The method of quantifying the

tax is by reference to the annual value thereof. Merely

because the quantum of coal produced and dispatched

or the, quantum of mineral produced and dispatched

from the land is the factor taken into consideration for

determining the value of the land, it does not become a

tax on coal or minerals. Being a tax on land, it was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                52</span>

found to be fully covered by Entry 49 in List II.

</p><p id="p_78">      The Apex Court in Keso Ram (supra) has also laid

down that Royalty is distinguishable from cess. The

royalty is levied by reference to the quantity of the

minerals produced and because the impugned cess too

is   quantified   by taking    into   consideration    the same

quantity of the mineral produced, the latter does not

become royalty. The Apex Court has laid down that

Royalty is the rent of the land on which the mine is

situated or the price of the privilege of winning the

minerals from the land parted by the government in

favour of the mining lessee. The cess is a levy on

mineral rights with impact on the land and quantified by

reference to the quantum of minerals produced. The

distinction, though fine, yet exists and is perceptible.

Thus, the submission raised by Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned

Sr.Counsel, that cess in question is virtually a royalty

on mineral and levy of cess on environment and health

amounts to levy of Royalty, is rejected.

</p><p id="p_79">      It was also submitted by Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned

Sr.Counsel, appearing on behalf of the petitioners, that

the field is occupied as the Parliament has enacted

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_177">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986, thus, the impugned

legislation was not permissible. Nodoubt, the said Act

has    been   enacted     to   provide      for   protection   and

improvement       of   environment    and    matters   connected

therewith but it has no effect on power of the State to

<p id="p_80">     Similarly, Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned Sr.Counsel has

relied upon the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_178">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1981, which has been enacted in order to preserve

the quality of air and control of air pollution; the Act

provides for constitution of Central and State Boards for

prevention, control and abatement of air pollution; it

also provides for powers &amp; functions of the Central and

State Boards to improve      the quality of air &amp; to prevent

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_179">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. In our

considered opinion, it cannot be said that the said

Statutes in any manner curtailed the power to enact the

provisions contained in Chapter VII of the Finance Act,

2008 enacted under the relevant entries of the List II of

Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. We have not

found any repugnancy in the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_180">Environment Act</a> and the

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_181">Air Pollution Act</a> with the provisions of Chapter VII of

Sr.Counsel, appearing on behalf of the petitioners, that

252(1)</a> of the Constitution to the effect that the matters

regarding    prevention        and      control   of   water     pollution

should be regulated in those States by the Parliament.

In our opinion, by the aforesaid enactment of 1974 and

the resolution so passed by the State Govt. and various

other   States,    it   cannot       be    said   that   there     is    any

<p id="p_82">       It was also submitted by Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned

authorities in augmenting the resources of the Central

</p>
<p id="p_83">     It was also contended by Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned

Sr.Counsel, that Royalty is also a tax. In the instant

case, no royalty is realized. We are unable to accept the

submission considering the provisions in question and in

view of the decision of the Apex Court in Kesoram

(supra). Levy in question is of cess on mineral rights,

which is charged under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_191">Section 16</a> of the Finance Act,

2008. Thus, there is no room for creating confusion so

as to hold levy of cess in question to be a royalty. The

Apex Court in Kesoram (supra) has summarized the

conclusions in para 129 thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_57">     "129. The relevant principles culled out from the
     preceding discussion are summarized as under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_58">     (1) In the scheme of the Lists in the Seventh
     Schedule, there exists a clear distinction between
     the general subjects of legislation and heads of
     taxation. They are separately enumerated.</blockquote><p id="p_84">

</p><p id="p_85">     (2) Power of 'regulation and control' Is separate
     and distinct from the power of taxation and so are
     the two fields for purposes of legislation. Taxation
     may be capable of being comprised in the main
     subject of general legislative head by placing an
     extended construction, but that is not the rule for
     deciding the appropriate legislative field for
     taxation between List I and List II. As the fields of
     taxation are to be found clearly enumerated in
     Lists I and II, there can be no overlapping. There
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                        56</span>

may be overlapping in fact but there would be no
overlapping in law. The subject matter of two taxes
by reference to the two Lists is different. Simply
because the methodology or mechanism adopted
for assessment and quantification is similar, the
two taxes cannot be said to be overlapping. This is
the distinction between the subject of a tax and
the measure of a tax.
</p>
<p id="p_86">(3) The nature of tax levied is different from the
measure of tax. While the subject of tax is clear
and well defined the amount of tax is capable of
being measured in many ways for the purpose of
quantification, Defining the subject of tax is a
simple task; devising the measure of taxation is a
far more complex exercise and therefore the
legislature has to be given much more flexibility in
the latter field. The mechanism and method chosen
by Legislature for quantification of tax is not
decisive of the nature of tax though it may
constitute one relevant factor out of many for
throwing     light  on  determining   the   general
character of the tax.
</p>
<p id="p_87">(4) Entries 52, 53 and 54 in List I are not heads of
taxation. They are general entries. Fields of
taxation covered by Entries 49 and 50 in List II
continue to remain with State Legislatures in spite
of Union having enacted laws by reference to
Entries 52, 53, 54 in List I. It is for the Union to
legislate and impose limitations on the States'
otherwise plenary power to levy taxes on mineral
rights or taxes on lands; (including mineral bearing
lands) by reference to Entry 50 and 49 in List II
and lay down the limitations on State's power, if it
chooses to do so, and also to define the extent and
sweep of such limitations.
</p>
<p id="p_88">(5) The Entries In List I and List II must be so
construed as to avoid any conflict. If there is no
conflict, an occasion for deriving assistance from
non-obstante clause "subject to" does not arise. If
there is conflict, the correct approach is to find an
answer to three questions step by step as under:

One - Is it still possible to effect reconciliation
between two Entries so as to avoid conflict and
overlapping?
</p>
<p id="p_89">Two - In which Entry the impugned legislation fails
by finding out the pith and substance of the
legislation?
</p><p id="p_90">                       and
Three - Having determined the field of legislation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                        57</span>

wherein the impugned legislation fails by applying
doctrine of pith and substance, can an incidental
trenching upon another field of legislation be
Ignored?
</p>
<p id="p_91">(6) 'Land'", the term as occurring in Entry 49 of
List II, has a wide connotation, Land remains land
though it may be subjected to different user. The
nature of user of the land would not enable a piece
of land being taken out of the meaning of land
itself. Different uses to which the land is subjected
or is capable of being subjected provide basis for
classifying land into different identifiable groups
for the purpose of taxation. The nature of user of
one piece of land would enable that piece of land
being classified separately from another piece of
land which is being subjected to another kind of
user, though the two pieces of land are identically
situated except for the difference in nature of user.
The tax would remain a tax on land and would not
become a tax on the nature of its user.
</p>
<p id="p_92">(7) To be a tax on land, the levy must have some
direct and definite relationship with the land. So
long as the tax is a tax on land by bearing such
relationship with the land, it is open for the
legislature for the purpose of levying tax to adopt
any one of the well known modes of determining
the value of the land such as annual or capital
value of the land or its productivity. The
methodology      adopted,   having    an    indirect
relationship with the land, would not alter the
nature of the tax as being one on land.
</p>
<p id="p_93">(8) The primary object and the essential purpose
of legislation must be distinguished from its
ultimate or incidental results or consequences, for
determining the character of the levy. A levy
essentially in the nature of a tax and within the
power of State Legislature cannot be annulled as
unconstitutional merely because it may have an
affect on the price of the commodity. A State
legislation, which makes provisions for levying a
cess, whether by way of tax to augment the
revenue resources of the State or by way of fee to
render services as quid pro quo but without any
intention of regulating and controlling the subject
of the levy, cannot be said to have encroached
upon the field of 'regulation and control' belonging
to the Central Government by reason of the
incidence of levy being permissible to be passed on
to the buyer or consumer, and thereby affecting
the price of the commodity or goods. Entry 23 in
List II speaks of regulation of mines and mineral
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                        58</span>

development subject to the provisions of List I with
respect to regulation and development under the
control of the Union, Entries 52 and 54 of List I are
both qualified by the expression "declared by
Parliament by law to be expedient in the public
interest". A reading in juxtaposition shows that the
declaration by Parliament must be for the 'control
of industries' in Entry 52 and for regulation of
mines or for mineral development' in Entry 54.
Such control, regulation or development must be
'expedient in the public interest'. Legislation by the
Union in the field covered by Entries 52 and 54
would not like a magic touch or a taboo denude the
entire field forming subject matter of declaration
to the State Legislatures. Denial to the State would
extend only to the extent of the declaration so
made by Parliament. In spite of declaration made
by reference to Entry 52 or 54, the State would be
free to act in the field left out from the
declaration. The legislative power to tax by
reference to Entries in List II is plenary unless the
entry itself makes the field 'subject to' any other
entry pr abstracts the field by any limitations
imposable and permissible. A tax or fee levied by
State with the object of augmenting its finances
and in reasonable limits does not ipso facto trench
upon regulation, development or control of the
subject. It is different if the tax or fee sought to
be levied, by State can itself be called regulatory,
the primary purpose whereof is to regulate or
control and augmentation of revenue or rendering
service is only secondary or incidental.

(9) The heads of taxation are clearly enumerated
in Entries 83 to 92B in List I and Entries 45 to 63
in List II. List III, the Concurrent List, does not
provide for any head. of taxation. Entry 96 in List
I, Entry 66 in List II and Entry 47 in List III deal
with fees. The residuary power of legislation in the
field of taxation spelled out by <a href="/doc/1018229/" id="a_192">Article 248(2)</a> and
Entry 97 In List I can be applied only to such
subjects as are not included in Entries 45 to 63 of
List II. It follows that taxes on lands and buildings
in Entry 49 of List II cannot be levied by the Union.
Taxes on mineral rights, a subject in Entry 50 of
List II can also not be levied by the union though
as stated in Entry by itself the union may impose
limitations on the power of the State and such
limitations, if any, imposed by the Parliament by
law relating to mineral development and to that
extent shall circumscribe the States power to
legislate. Power to tax mineral rights is with the
States; the power to lay down limitations on
exercise of such power, in the interest of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                               59</span>

    regulation, development or control, as the case
    may be, is with the union. This is the result
    achieved by homogeneous reading of Entry 50 in
    List II and Entries 52 and 54 in List I. So long as a
    tax or fee on mineral rights remains in pith and
    substance a tax for augmenting the revenue
    resources of the State or a fee for rendering
    services by the State and it does not impinge upon
    regulation of mines and mineral development or
    upon     control  of   industry   by    the   Central
    Government, it is not unconstitutional."


     Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned Sr.Counsel, appearing on

behalf of the petitioners, has relied upon the decision of

the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1464523/" id="a_193">Hingir-Rampur Coal Co. Ltd. v. The

State of Orissa</a>, AIR 1961 SC 459 in which the Apex

Court   has    considered   the    question   with   respect    to

Entries 23 &amp; 66 in List II. The Apex Court has laid down

that the legislative competence of the State Legislature

under Entry 23 is subject to the provisions of List I with

respect   to   regulation   and     development      under     the

control of the Union. The jurisdiction of             the State

Legislature     under   Entry       23   is    subject to the

limitation imposed by the latter part of the said Entry.

If Parliament by its law has declared         that   regulation

and development of mines should in public interest be

under the control of the Union, to the extent of such

declaration, the jurisdiction of the State Legislature is

excluded. This question has already been considered by

the Apex Court in Kesoram (supra) and it has been laid

down that <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_194">MMDR Act</a>,1957 does not impinge upon the

power of legislature of the State under Entry 50 of List

II. The declaration made in <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_195">MMDR Act</a>,1957 is also

considered by the Apex Court in Kesoram (supra). Thus,

the decision in Hingir-Rampur Coal Co. is of no help to

the    submission       raised      by    Mr.M.S.Singhvi,        learned

Sr.Counsel.

<p id="p_94">       Reliance      has     been    placed       by   Mr.M.S.Singhvi,

learned     Sr.Counsel,         appearing        on    behalf    of   the

petitioners, on the decision of <a href="/doc/865455/" id="a_196">State of Orissa                        v.

M.A.Tulloch</a>, AIR 1964 SC 1284 , in which the Apex

Court has laid down that the repugnancy arises when

two enactments both within the competence of the two

Legislatures collide and when the Constitution expressly

or by necessary implication provides that the enactment

of one Legislature           has superiority over the other then

to    the   extent    of     repugnancy,         the   one   supersedes

another.     The      test     of   two     legislations     containing

contradictory      provisions       is    not,    however,      the   only

criterion of repugnancy, for if a competent legislature

with a superior efficacy expressly or impliedly evinces

by its legislation an intention to cover the whole field,

the enactments of the other legislature whether passed

before or after would be overborne on the ground of

repugnance.
</p>
<p id="p_95">       In the instant case, we have found that there is no

repugnancy and the field in question is not covered by

<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_197">MMDR Act</a>,1957.
</p>
<p id="p_96">       Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned Sr.Counsel, appearing on

behalf of the petitioners, has relied upon the decision of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                     61</span>

the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1907642/" id="a_198">India Cement Ltd. v. State of

Tamil Nadu</a>, (1990) 1 SCC 12. The question involved

in India Cement was whether a cess on royalty is within

the competence of the State                 Legislature.        The India

Cement Co. used to manufacture cement in its factory.

The lease deed provided for realization of the royalty at

the rate of Rs.0.75 per tonne on limestone on Govt.

land.   Different   rates     of    royalty   were        prescribed     for

patta     lands.    Under     Section       115     of      the     Madras

Panchayats Act, 1958, as amended by Madras Act XVIII

of 1964, the appellant was required to pay local cess at

the rate of 45 paise per rupee with retrospective effect

along with local cess surcharge               under      <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_199"> s. 116</a> of the

Act. In that connection, it has been held that a cess on

royalty    being    a   tax        on    royalty,    is     beyond       the

competence of the State Legislature because<a href="/doc/136667771/" id="a_200"> s. 9</a> of the

Central Act covers the field and the State Legislature is

denuded of its competence under               entry        23     of list II.

The ratio of the aforesaid decision is not at all attracted

to the facts of the present case. Thus, the submission

raised by Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned Sr.Counsel, that the

decision in India Cement (supra) has not been correctly

appreciated in Kesoram (supra), does not advance any

support in the instant case. The levy in the instant case

is a cess on mineral rights, not a cess on mineral/

royalty. The Apex Court in India Cement (supra) made

the following discussion in this regard in para 33 thus:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                             62</span>

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_59">     "33. In any event, royalty is directly relatable only
     to the minerals extracted and on the principle that
     the general provision is excluded by the special
     one, royalty would be relatable to entries 23 &amp; 50
     of list II, and not entry 49 of list II. But as the
     fee is covered by the Central power under entry
     23 or entry 50 of list II, the impugned legislation
     cannot be upheld. Our attention was drawn to a
     judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in
     Miscellaneous     Petition No. 410/83--M/s Hiralal
     Rameshwar Prasad &amp; Ors. v. The State of Madhya

     Court.J.S.Verma, Acting Chief Justice, as His
     Lordship then was, held that development cess by
     s. 9 of the Madhya Pradesh Karadhan Adhiniyam,
     1982 is ultra vires. It is not necessary in the view
     taken by us, and further in view that the said
     decision is under appeal in this Court, to examine
     it in detail."</blockquote><p id="p_97">

</p><p id="p_98">     The ratio of the aforesaid decision is not attracted

in the instant case, more so, in view of the decision in

Kesoram's case (supra). In the instant case, the cess is

not on royalty. Royalty was defined in respect to the

lime stone and kankar with regard to the nature of the

land. It is settled proposition of law that mere measure

of levy cannot be the basis to determine its nature and

the same cannot be a ground to hold trenching upon the

field. Thus, the decision is of no help to the submission

raised by Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned Sr.Counsel.

</p><p id="p_99">     Mr.M.S.Singhvi, learned Sr.Counsel, appearing on

behalf of the petitioners, has relied upon the decision in

<a href="/doc/1714839/" id="a_201">Orissa Cement Ltd. v. State of Orissa</a>, AIR 1991 SC

1676 , in which the Apex Court has dealt with the

question of cess on royalty in respect of land held for

carrying   mining   operations,   which   was   held   to   be

ultravires to the field reserved to the State Legislature.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                        63</span>

The Apex Court also considered the question of validity

of Orissa Cess Act, <a href="/doc/532738/" id="a_202">section 6</a> whereof provided for the

cess on royalty of mines and quarries, which was also

declared to be invalid. The Apex Court also considered

the validity of M.P.Kardhan Adhiniyam, 1982 dealing

with mineral areas development cess and concluded

that validity of the impugned Act cannot be upheld by

reference to Entry 23 of the List II and its levy was held

to be ultravires of the State legislature. Considering the

scope of Section 11 of M.P.Upkar Adhiniyam providing

for cess on land held in connection with mineral rights,

the Apex Court held that the levy was invalid and

ultravires        of   the   State     Legislature         in   view   of    the

conclusion that the tax is not referable to Entry 49 or

Entry 50. As already discussed, it was not a case of

imposition of cess on environment &amp; health as in the

instant case, which is referable to Entry 50 of List II of

the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. With

respect to the M.P.Act, 1982, the Apex Court has made

it   clear   in    para      61   itself    that   their    lordships       were

concerned only with Part IV, which levies a cess not on

land in general, which could be referred to Entry 18 or

Entry 49 but only on land held in connection with the

mineral rights, which, in the State, are principally in

regard to coal and limestone. Under <a href="/doc/915415/" id="a_203">Section 9</a> of the

M.P.Act, 1982, the proceeds are to be utilised only

towards the general               development of mineral-bearing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                            64</span>

areas. The levy was held to be a fee and the High Court

had opined that such fee would be referable to item 23

and hence, out of bounds for the State Legislature,

after the enactment of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_204">MMDR Act</a>,1957. Their Lordships

while considering the M.P.Upkar Adhiniyam Act, 1982,

which came up for consideration before the M.P.High

Court in <a href="/doc/1104902/" id="a_205">M.P.Lime Manufacturers' Association v. State</a>,

AIR 1989 MP 264, held that in view of <a href="/doc/691396/" id="a_206">Section 12</a> of the

Act having been deleted by the 1989 amendment, the

levy under Sec.11 of the Act ceased to be a fee and

became a tax. It was further held that the levy was not

covered by Entry 49 or Entry 50 of List II and was,

therefore, ultravires. The Full Bench observed that it is

significant to note that cess is not imposed on all land

and that it is not dependent either on the extent of the

land held in connection with mineral rights or on the

value thereof. The subject-matter of tax, therefore, is

major mineral raised from the land held in connection

with mineral right. If no minerals are raised, tax is not

leviable. The tax is not dependent on the extent of the

land held in connection with mineral rights. It is not a

case where all lands are   liable to be assessed on the

basis of the value of the land and that the measure of

the tax in so far as land held under a mining lease is

concerned, is the value of the minerals produced. Under

the impugned Act, value of the land or of the minerals

produced does not play any part in the levy of cess.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                    65</span>

Thus, the impugned levy was not held to be a tax on

land, which is covered by Entry 49 of the State List. The

Apex Court, while referring to Hingir Rampur's case

(supra), observed that from a perusal of the provisions

of <a href="/doc/1555531/" id="a_207">Section 11</a> of the Act, it would be clear that by the

charging section, tax was not imposed on the mineral

rights   of    every    holder     of   mining   lease.   In    these

circumstances, the tax levied by the Act was not held to

be a tax covered by Entry 50 of List II of the Seventh

Schedule to the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_100">      The     Apex   Court    in   Orissa   Cement    (supra)    has

further observed in para 62 with respect to the Full

Bench decision of the High Court that though the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_208">MMDR

Act</a>, unlike S.6(2) of the 1984 Act, does not contain a

specific provision for the levy of taxes, Sec.25 of the

MMDR Act does indicate the existence of such power.

The above observations of the High Court, therefore, in

our view, do not attach sufficient importance to S.25 of

the   MMDR     Act     and   the   field   covered   thereby.    This

aspect is, however, not of significance in view of the

conclusion that the tax is not referable to Entry 49 or

Entry 50. Thus, the decision of the Apex Court in Orissa

Cement is quite distinguishable, as the Apex Court has

laid down with respect to <a href="/doc/154093118/" id="a_209">Section 25</a> of the MMDR Act in

the same manner as interpreted in Kesoram (supra) and

also that the tax in question was not referable to Entry

49 or Entry 50. The Apex Court has laid down thus:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                       66</span>

"62. The other statute viz; the Madhya Pradesh
Upkar Adhiniyam (Act 1 of 1982) came up for the
consideration of a Full Bench of the Madhya
Pradesh High Court in <a href="/doc/1104902/" id="a_210">M.P. Lime Manufacturers'
Association v. State</a> (and connected cases) in AIR
1989 Madh Pra 264. The Full Bench held that, in
view of S.12 of the Act having been deleted by the
1989 amendment, the levy under S.11 of the Act
ceased to be a fee and become a tax. It held
further that the levy was not covered by Entry 49
or Entry 50 of List II and was, therefore,
ultravires. It observed:
</p>
<p id="p_101">"It is significant to note that cess is not imposed
on all land and that it is not dependent either on
the extent of the land held in connection with
mineral rights or on the value thereof. The
subject-matter of tax, therefore, is major mineral
raised from the land held in connection with
mineral right. If no minerals are raised, tax is not
leviable. The tax is not dependant on the extent of
the land held in connection with mineral rights. It
is not a case where all land is liable to payment of
cess, that the liability is assessed on the basis of
the value of the land and that the measure of the
tax in so far as land held under a mining lease is
concerned, is the value of the minerals produced.
Under the impugned Act, value of the land or of
the minerals produced does not play any part in
the levy of cess. The quantity of major minerals
produced from the land determines the liability to
pay tax. In these circumstances, the impunged
levy cannot be held to be a tax on land which is
covered by Entry 49 of the State list.

<p id="p_102">After distinguishing <a href="/doc/1945589/" id="a_211">Ajoy Kumar Mukherjea v. Local
Board</a>, AIR 1965 SC 1561 and referring to <a href="/doc/1230460/" id="a_212">Union of
India v. Bombay International Ltd</a>., AIR 1984 SC
420, the Court concluded:
</p>
<p id="p_103">"The character of imposed in     the instant case is
that though in form it appears   to be a tax on land,
in substance, it is a tax on      minerals produced
therefrom. The subject matter    of tax is, therefore,
not covered by Entry 49 of the   State list."

As for Entry 50, after referring Hingir-Rampur (AIR
1961 SC 459), the Court observed:
</p>
<p id="p_104">"Now from a perusal of S.11 of the Act, it would be
clear that in the instant case by the charging
section, tax is not imposed on the mineral rights of
every holder of mining lease. The tax is levied on
minerals produced in land held under mining lease.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                67</span>

</p><p id="p_105">     In these circumstances, the tax levied by the Act
     cannot be held to be a tax covered by Entry 50 of
     List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.
     In our opinion, therefore, it has not been shown
     that the State Legislature is competent to levy the
     impugned cess."
</p>
<p id="p_106">     This conclusion is obviously correct in the light of
     our    earlier   discussion. The   court,  however,
     expressed an opinion, in paras 10 to 12 of the
     judgment, that in case the levy could be treated as
     a tax imposable under Entry 49 or 50 of List II in
     the Second Schedule to the Constitution, such
     power "has not been taken away by the provisions
     of the MMRD Act". We think, as already pointed
     out by us that though the MMRD Act, 1957, unlike
     S.6(2) of the 1948 Act, does not contain a specific
     provision for the levy of taxes, S.25 of the former
     does indicate the existence of such power. The
     above observations of the High Court, therefore, in
     our view, do not attach sufficient importance to
     S.25 of the MMRD Act and the field covered
     thereby.     This   aspect,  however,   is  not   of
     significance in view of the conclusion that the tax
     is not referable to Entry 49 or Entry 50."

     Thus, as the tax in issue in the said case was not

referable to Entry 49 or Entry 50 of List-II of Seventh

Schedule to the Constitution of India, the decision is of

no help to the cause espoused by the petitioners.

</p><p id="p_107">     <a href="/doc/1820633/" id="a_213">In the Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments,

Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur

Mutt</a> (AIR 1954 SC 282), the Apex Court has laid down that

tax is a compulsory exaction of money by public authority for

public purposes enforceable by law and is not payment for

services rendered. This definition brings out the essential

characteristics of a tax as distinguished from other forms of

imposition which, in a general sense, are included within it. The

essence of taxation is compulsion, that is to say, it is imposed

under statutory power without the tax payer's consent and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                    68</span>

payment is enforced by law. The second characteristic         of tax is

that it is an imposition made for public purpose without reference

to any special benefit to be conferred on the payer of the tax.

This is   expressed by        saying that the levy of tax is for the

purposes of general revenue, which when collected forms part of

the public revenues of the State. As the object of a tax is not to

confer any special benefit upon any particular individual, there is

no element of 'quid pro quo' between the tax payer and the

public authority. Another feature of taxation is that it is a part of

the common burden. The fee is generally defined to be a charge

for   a   special   service    rendered   to   individuals   by   some

governmental agency. The amount of fee levied is broadly

supposed to be based on the expenses incurred by the

Government in rendering the service. Ordinarily the fees are

uniform and no account is taken of the varying abilities of

different recipients to pay. These are undoubtedly some of the

general characteristics, but as there may be various kinds of

fees, it is not possible to formulate a definition that would be

applicable to all cases.

<p id="p_108">      In Krishi Upaj Mandi Samiti and ors. V/s Orient Paper

&amp; Industries Ltd. (1995) 1 SCC 655), the Apex Court has laid

down that fee has been placed under separate category for the

purposes of legislation. The tax is a compulsory exaction of

money by public authority for public purposes enforceable by law

and is not payment for services rendered. There is no quid pro

quo between the tax payer and the public authority.

Tax Officers, Palakol &amp; ors.      (AIR 2006 SC 2897 =(2006)

6 SCC 763), the question which came up for consideration was

whether levy of cess under section 7(1) of the Andhra Pradesh

Rural Development Act, 1996 at the rate of 5% ad valorem on

the quantum of purchase of goods was tax or fee. <a href="/doc/64657360/" id="a_214">Section 8</a> of

the said Act provides for establishment of the Andhra Pradesh

Rural Development Fund. <a href="/doc/479266/" id="a_215">Section 9</a> deals with the purposes of

the Fund. The impost in question did not come in any of the

Entries in List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. The

Apex Court has observed that ordinarily, a cess means a tax

which raises revenue, which is applied to a specific purpose.

Ordinarily, cess is also a tax. Health cess, education cess, road

cess etc. are in the nature of tax. Nomenclature is not material.

The Apex Court has laid down thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">      "12. Ordinarily, a cess means a tax which raises revenue,
      which is applied to a specific purpose. Thus in Guruswamy
      and Co. V/s State of Mysore (AIR 1967 SC 1512),
      Hidayatullah, J, in his dissenting judgment observed:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_61">      "The word 'cess' is used in Ireland and is still in use in
      India although the word rate has replaced it in England. It
      means a tax and is generally used when the levy is for
      some special administrative expense which the name
      (health cess, education cess, road cess, etc.) indicates.
      When levied as an increment to an existing tax, the name
      matters not, for the validity of the cess must be judged of
      in the same way as the validity of the tax to which it is an
      increment."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_62">       The aforesaid observation has been referred to by the
       Constitution Bench decision of this Court in India Cement

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                                  70</span>

that the cess in question is in the nature of tax and it is not a

fee.
</p>
<p id="p_112">       The learned Sr. Counsel appearing on behalf of the

petitioners has relied upon the said decision to contend that cess

in question is a fee as the cess was not falling in any of the

Entries of List-II of Seventh Schedule. The case of the petitioners

is that it is a fee under Entry 66 of List II of the Seventh

Schedule. The facts of the instant case are different. The cess is

in the nature of tax which is clearly within the purview of Entry

50 of List-II of Seventh Schedule. The Apex Court has also laid

down in the said decision that traditional view that there must be

actual quid pro quo for a fee has undergone a sea change. If the

element of revenue for general purpose of the State pre-

dominates, the levy becomes a tax. The Apex Court in M/s

Vijayalashmi Rice Mill (supra), has thus laid down:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_64">       "16. The earlier view of the Supreme Court was that to
       sustain the validity of a fee some specific service must be
       rendered to the particular individual from whom the fee is
       sought   to   be   realised.   However,    subsequently    in
       Sreenivasa General Traders V/s State of A.P. (1983) 4 SCC
       353, the Supreme Court observed: (SCC p.380, paras 31-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_65">       32)
             "31. The traditional view that there must be actual
             quid pro quo for a fee has undergone a sea change in
             the subsequent decisions. The distinction between a
             tax and a fee lies primarily in the fact that a tax is
             levied as part of a common burden, while a fee is for
             payment of a specific benefit or privilege although
             the special advantage is secondary to the primary
             motive of regulation in public interest. If the element
             of revenue for general purpose of the State
             predominates, the levy becomes a tax. In regard to
             fees there is, and must always be, correlation
             between the fee collected and the service intended to
             be rendered...

<blockquote id="blockquote_66">          32. There is no generic difference between a tax and

retrospectively, as Section 11 of the Forward Markets

law   with   retrospective        effect.       In   that    context,      the

vires of the Act because it purported to operate
retrospectively affecting  vested    rights under
contracts which     were subsisting on the day on
which the bye-law came into force.
</p>
<p id="p_121">27. Mr. Pathak invited our attention to a passage
in Craies' Statute Law, 5th Ed. p. 366 reading:

"Sometimes a statute, although not intended to be
retrospective, will in fact have a retrospective
operation. For instance if two persons enter into a
contract, and     afterwards a statute is passed
which, as Cockburn, C. J., said        in Duke of
Devonshire v. Barrow, etc., Co. (1877) 2 Q. B.
D. 286, 289) "engrafts        an enactment upon
existing contracts' and 752 thus operates so as to
produce a result which is something quite different
from the original intention of the contracting
parties, such       a statute has, in effect a
retrospective operation."
</p>
<p id="p_122">The    bye-law     in so far as it affects executory
contracts requiring such contracts to be closed
out on     a (lay        not originally: - contracted for
and at a price fixed by law is in           the     above
sense undoubtedly retrospective. The submission
of learned 'Counsel was that though a legislature
which bad plenary power in this regard could enact
a, havind a retrospective operation, Subordinate
legislation, be it         a rule,     a bye-law or a
notification, could not be made so           as to have
retrospective operation and that to that extent
the rule, bye-law or notification would be ultra
vires and would have to be struck down, relying
for this position on -the decision of the Mysore
High Court reported in AIR 1960 Mys,326. 'We do
not however consider it necessary to canvass the
correctness     of    this   decision    or  the    broad
propositions laid down in it. It is clear law that a
Statute which could validly         enact     a law with
retrospective      effect    could    in express terms
validly confer upon a rule-making, authority a
power      to make a rule or            frame a: bye-
</p><p id="p_123">law      having retrospective       operation     and we
would add that we did not understand Mr.Pathak
to dispute this position. If       this were     so   the
same result, would follow where the            power   to
enact     a rule or,a byelaw with "retrospective
effect" so    as to Affect PendinG transactions, is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">                              75</span>

     conferred not by express words but where the
     necessary intendment of I the Act confers such A
     power.     If in the present case the power     to
     make     a byelaw so as to operate on contracts
     subsisting    on the   day the same was framed,
     would follow as;     a necessary implication from
     the term of<a href="/doc/1368663/" id="a_220"> S. 1</a> <a href="/doc/1368663/" id="a_221">1</a>, it would not be necessary
     to discuss the larger question as to whether and
     the 753 circumstances - in which       Subordinate
     legislation with retrospective effect could be
     validly made.
</p>
<p id="p_124">     Justice K.Subba Rao in minority view has opined

that Section 11   of the Forward Markets Regulation Act,

1952 does not authorize framing of the bye laws with

retrospective   effect.   However,    discussion    has   been

made with respect to power to frame bye laws with

retrospective   effect.   With    respect   to   Government's

power to make an order with retrospective effect, it has

been laid down that unless the Statute confers power on

the Govt. to frame bye laws with retrospective effect, it

cannot exercise such a power. Following is the relevant

observation made:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_67">     37. ......It is, therefore, clear that the said bye-
     law, in so far as it purports to affect the mode
     of   performance of the pre-existing       contracts,
     is certainly retrospective       in operation. I am
     assuming for the purpose of the present question
     that the bye- law cannot be construed in such a
     way as to confine its operation only to contracts
     that are entered into after it came into force. If
     so, the question arises whether        the   Central
     Government had power to make a bye law under
     S.12 (1) of     the   Act with retrospective effect-
     <a href="/doc/691396/" id="a_222">Section 12</a> (1) of the Act reads:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_68">     "The   Central   Government may,       either  on   a
     request in writing received by it in this behalf
     from    the  governing    body    of   a   recognized
     association, or if in its opinion it is expedient so
     to do, make bye-laws for all or any of the matters
     specified in section II    or amend     any bye laws
     made by such association under that section."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                         76</span>

<p id="p_125"><a href="/doc/1555531/" id="a_223">Section 11</a> enumerates the matters in respect of
which the recognized associations can make bye
laws for the regulation and control of forward
contracts. Neither s.12 nor a.11 expressly states
that a bye-law with retrospective operation can
be made under either of those two sections. Full
effect can be given to both the sections by
recognizing    a    power only     to   make bye-laws
prospective in operation,       that is, bye-laws that
would not affect any vested rights. In the
circumstances, can it be held that the Central
Government to which the power to make bye-
laws is delegated by         the Legislature without
expressly conferring on it a power to give them
retrospective operation can exercise a power
thereunder     to make such bye-laws.            Learned
counsel for       the respondents contends that, as
the Legislature can make a law with retrospective
operation, so too a delegated authority can make
a bye-law with the same effect.         This argument
ignores     the essential distinction       between     a
Legislature functioning in exercise of the powers
conferred on it under the         Constitution and a
body entrusted by the said           Legislature     with
power to make subordinate Legislation.            In the
case of the Legislature, <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_224">Art. 246</a> of                  the
Constitution confers          a    plenary     power of
Legislation subject to      the limitations mentioned
therein and in other provisions of the Constitution
in   respect    of     appropriate     entries     in the
Seventh     Schedule. This Court, in <a href="/doc/565623/" id="a_225">Union of India
v.   Madan Gopal       Kabra</a>     (1),   held that     the
Legislature can always Legislate retrospectively;
unless there is any         prohibition under         the
Constitution which has created it. But the         same
rule   cannot obviously be applied to the Central
Government exercising          delegated     Legislative
power for the scope of their power is not co-
extensive with that of Parliament. This distinction
is clearly brought out by the learned Judges of
the Allahabad High Court in <a href="/doc/67257559/" id="a_226">Modi Food Products
Ltd. v. Commission</a> of sales-Tax, U.P. AIR 1956 All
35, wherein the learned Judges observed:
"A Legislature can certainly give retrospective
effect to pieces of Legislation passed by it but an
executive Government exercising subordinate and
delegated legislative (1) [1954] S.C. R. 541. (2) A.
T. R. 1956 All. 35. 764 powers, cannot make
legislation retrospective in effect unless that
power is expressly conferred."
</p>
<p id="p_126"><a href="/doc/925294/" id="a_227">In Strawboard Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Gutta Mill
Workers Union</a> (1) a question arose whether the
Governor of   U.P., who referred an industrial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">                        77</span>

dispute to a person nominated by him with a
direction that he should submit the award       not
later than a particular date could extend the date
for a making of the award so as to validate the
award made after the prescribed date. Reliance
was placed upon s. 21 of the U.P. General Clauses
Act, 1904, in support of the contention that
the power of amendment          and      modification
conferred on the State Government under that
section    might be      so exercised as to have
retrospective operation.     In     rejecting    that
contention, Das, J., as he then was, observed:

 "It is true that the order of April 26, 1950, does
not ex facie purport to modify the order           of
February 18, 1950, but, in view of the absence
of any distinct provision in <a href="/doc/53181972/" id="a_228">section 21</a> that the
power      of     amendment      and     modification
conferred on the State Government may          be so
exercised as to have retrospective operation the
order of April 26, 1950, viewed merely       as    an
order of     amendment or modification cannot, by
virtue of <a href="/doc/53181972/" id="a_229">section 21</a>, have that effect."

This    decision is, therefore, an authority for the
position that      unless a statute confers on the
Government an express power to make an order
with retrospective effect, it cannot exercise such
a power. The           Mysore     High Court in      a
considered judgment in <a href="/doc/872990/" id="a_230">India Sugar &amp; Refineries
Ltd. v. State of Mysore</a> (2) dealt with the question
that now      arises for consideration.     There, the
Government issued (1) [1953] S.C.R. 439. 447-
</p><p id="p_127">448. (2) A. 1. R. 1960 Mys. 3 765 there
notifications dated 9-4-1956, 15-10-1957 and 13-
2-1958 purporting to       act under<a href="/doc/1116044/" id="a_231"> s. 14</a> (1) of
the Madras Sugar Factories Control Act, 1949,
whereby cess was imposed             on      sugarcane
brought and crushed in Petitioner's factory for the
crushing season        1955.     56,   1956-57     and
1957-58 respectively. One of the question raised
was whether        under the     said    section   the
Government had power to issue the notifications
imposing      a cess on sugarcane brought and
crushed     in petitioner's factory for a period prior
to     the date of the said notifications. Das Gupta,
C. J.,    delivering   the judgment of the division
Bench, held that it could not. The             learned
Advocate General, who appeared          for the State,
argued, as it is now argued before us, that in a
case where power to make rules is conferred on
the Government and if the provision conferring
such a power does not         expressly prohibit   the
making of rules with retrospective operation, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                         78</span>

Government in exercise of that power can make
rules with retrospective operation. In rejecting
that   argument,    the  learned  Chief Justice,
delivering the judgement of the division Bench,
observed at p. 332:
</p>
<p id="p_128">      "In my opinion a different principle would
apply to the case of an executive Government
exercising   subordinate         and       delegated
legislative powers.     In such oases, unless the
power to    act     retrospectively     is expressly
conferred     by       the      Legislature on the
Government, the Government               cannot act
retrospectively."
</p>
<p id="p_129">With     respect, I entirely agree with the said
observations. The      same    question was again
raised and the same view         was expressed    by
the Kerala High Court in C. W. Motor Service (P)
Ltd. v. State of Kerala (1). There the Regional
Transport Authority, Kozhikode, granted a stage
carriage permit      to the       third  respondent
therein in respect of a proposed (1) A. 1. R.
(1959) Ker. 347, 348. Ghat route. The grant of
the permit was challenged on      the ground that
when that order       was passed there was no
constituted Regional Transport Authority for the
district. It was contended on behalf of the
contesting respondent that the said defect was
cured by a subsequent notification issued by the
Government whereby Government ordered            the
continuance of the Road Transport Authority from
the date of the expiry of       the term of the said
'Authority till its successor was appointed. The
High Court      held   that   the notification with
retrospective operation was bad. In that context,
Varadaraja lyengar, J., observed :
</p>
<p id="p_130">"The rule is well-settled     that    even in a case
where   the   executive     Government acts       as   a
delegate of a legislative authority, it has no
plenary    power    to provide     for    retrospective
operation unless       and   until   that    power    is
expressly conferred by the parent enactment." The
House of Lords in Howell v. Folmouth Boat
Construction Co. Ltd. (1) expressed the same
opinion and also pointed cut the           danger    of
conceding    such     a    power       to a delegated
authority.   There,     a licence    was      issued to
operate retrospectively and       to     cover    works
already done      under the oral sanction of the
authority. Their Lordships observed:
</p>
<p id="p_131">"It would be a dangerous power to place in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                          79</span>

hands of      Ministers; and    their subordinate
officials    to allow them, when. ever they had
power to license, to grant the licence ex post
facto; and a statutory power to license should
not    be construed as a power to    authorise   or
ratify    what has been done unless the     special
terms of the statutory       provisions     clearly
warrant the construction."
</p>
<p id="p_132">It is true that this is a case of a licence issued by
an authority in exercise of a statutory power
conferred on      it, but the same principle must
apply to a byelaw made           by    an authority in
exercise of a power conferred under a            statute.
Our Constitution promises to usher in a welfare
State.     It involves conferment of powers of
subordinate legislation         on government and
governmental agencies affecting every aspect of
human activity. The regulatory process          is    fast
becoming an ubiquitous element in our life. In a
welfare State, perhaps,it is inevitable, for the
simple       reason that Parliament or Legislature
cannot be expected to provide for           all possible
contingencies. But there is no effective machinery
to control the rule-making powers, or to prevent
its diversion through authoritarian            channels.
If    the conferment of power to make delegated
Legislation proportion vigor      carried with     it   to
make a rule or        bye-law      with   retrospective
operation,    it may become       an    instrument      of
oppression. In these circumstances, it has been
rightly held that the provision conferring such a
power must be strictly construed and unless a
statute expressly confers a powers to make a rule
or bye-law retrospectively, it must be held that it
has not conferred any such power. It is said that
such a strict construction may prevent a rule
making authority from         making a rule in an
emergency,       though      the occasion       demands
or justifies a rule     with     retrospective effect.
The simple answer to this alleged difficulty is
that if the Legislature contemplates or visualizes
such emergencies, calling for the making of such
rules or     bylaws with      retrospective effect, it
should expressly confer such power.           It is also
said that the Government can be relied upon to
make such rules only on appropriate occasions.
This Court cannot     recognize      implied      powers
pregnant with potentialities for         mischief       on
such assumptions. That apart, the scope or ambit
of a rule cannot be made to depend upon the
status of a functionary entrusted with a 768 rule
making power.       In public interest the least the
court can do     is to construe provisions conferring
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                             80</span>

    such a power strictly and to confine its scope to
    that clearly expressed therein.

<p id="p_133">    <a href="/doc/76884/" id="a_232">In Hukam Chand v. Union of India</a>, (1972) 2

SCC 601 , the Apex Court considered the difference

between the subordinate legislation and statutory laws.

The Apex Court considered the power to make the rules

with retrospective effect and laid down that unless the

Legislature authorized the Central Government to make

the rules with retrospective effect, it could not have

done so. The Apex Court has laid down thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_69">    8. Perusal of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_233">section 40</a> shows that although the
    power of making       rules to carry out the purposes
    of the Act has been conferred       upon the Central
    Government, there is       no    provision     in    the
    section which may either expressly            or      by
    necessary implication show that          the   Central
    Government         has been vested with power to
    make rules        with retrospective effect. As it is
    <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_234">section 40</a> of the Act which empowers the Central
    Government to make rules, the rules would have
    to conform      to that section.      The extent and
    amplitude of       the rule    making power would
    depend upon and be governed by          the language
    of the section. If a particular rule were not to fall
    within the ambit and purview of the section,
    the Central Government in such an event would
    have no power to make that rule.           Likewise, if
    there was nothing in the language of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_235">section 40</a>
    to   empower      the  Central    Government      either
    expressly or by necessary implication, to make a
    rule retroactively, the Central Government would
    be    acting    in excess of its power if it gave
    retrospective effect to any rule. The       underlying
    principle is that     unlike    Sovereign Legislature
    which has power to enact laws with retrospective
    operation, authority vested with the power of
    making subordinate legislation has to act within
    the limits of its power and cannot transgress the
    same. The initial difference between subordinate
    legislation and the     statute laws lies in the fact
    that a subordinate law making body is bound by
    the terms of its delegated or derived authority and
    that court of law, as a general rule, will not give
    effect to the rules, thus made, unless satisfied
    that all the conditions precedent to the validity of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                         81</span>

the rules have been fulfilled (see Craies on Statute
Law,p. 297 Sixth Edition).

<p id="p_134">9. The learned Solicitor General has not been able
to refer to anything in <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_236">section 40</a> from which
power of the     Central Government to make

absence    of  any    such  power,    the  Central
Government, in our view, acted in excess of its
power in so far as it gave retrospective effect to
the Explanation to rule-49. The Explanation, in
our opinion, could not operate retrospectively
and would be effective for the future from the,
date it was added in February 1960.

"Dr.Seiyed Muhammad, learned Counsel for the

purported     to     have    been      given    to    the
explanation referred to earlier by the notifi-
cation dated February 16,1963 (Exh.P-12) for
obvious reasons. The rule making authority had
not been vested with the power under the Central
Excise    and    <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_239">Salt    Act</a>   to   make     rules  with
retrospective     effect. Therefore the retrospective

v.   M.   C. Ponnoose    and   Others</a>    etc.(1) this
Court dealt with      a notification dated August
14, 1963 which empowered the revenue officials,
including the Tehsildar, to exercise the powers of a
tax recovery officer under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_241">Income Tax Act</a>,
1961 in respect of arrears. The notification was
given retrospective effect. Question which arose
for   determination    was    whether    the    State
Government could invest the Tehsildar with such
powers retrospectively. Answering this question in
the negative, this Court observed :
</p>
<p id="p_138">"The   Parliament     can    delegate   its   legislative

     power within the recognised limits. Where any
     rule    or regulation is made by any     person    or
     authority to      whom such powers have been
     delegated by the Legislature it may or may not
     be possible to make the same so as to give re-
     trospective operation. It will depend on the
     language employed in the statutory provision
     which may in express terms or by necessary
     implication empower the authority concerned to
     make      a rule or regulation with    retrospective
     effect.     But where no such language is to      be
     found it has been held by the courts that the
     persons      or authority    exercising subordinate
     legislative    functions  cannot    make    a   rule,
     regulation     or bye-law which can operate with
     retrospective effect."
</p>
<p id="p_139">     Reference was made in the above cited case to
     an earlier decision of this Court in B. S. Vadera

     framed under the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_242">article 309</a> of the
     Constitution that those rules, could be made with

     rules so made shall have effect subject to the
     provisions of any such Act. It was also observed :

     "As the Legislature can legislate prospectively as
     well as retrospectively there can be hardly any
     justification for saying that the President or the

     same manner so as to give them prospective      as

     the ambit and content of the rule making power
     under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_244">article 309</a> can furnish no analogy or
     parallel to the present case."

         "44. By reason of Note 2, certain rights were
         conferred. Although there lies a distinction

Mills Ltd</a>., AIR 1990 SC 33 , the Apex Court also

considered the question of applicability of duty on yarn

for which notification was issued on 24.7.1972. It was

held that it cannot be retrospectively applied to the

yarn which had been authorizedly removed from the

spindles for captive consumption prior to that date. The

Apex Court has laid down thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_71">    11. We may also point out that the best that can
    be said for the department is that the system of
    compounded levy      ceased only    on   24.7.1972.
    This means that the normal rules will become
    applicable. But the normal duty on yarn, effective
    from 24.7.72, cannot be retrospectively applied to
    the yarn which had been authorisedly removed
    from the spindles for captive consumption prior to
    that date. The fact that the      clearance of the
    fabrics made of such yarn was,        after 24.7.72
    would be irrelevant in    computing    such normal
    duty for yarn. There is no principle or statutory
    language that compels an assessee to be deprived
    of the concessional rate that      has been made
    available to it, under a special      procedure, in
    respect of the yarn produced by it and utilised for
    captive consumption."

</p><p id="p_144">      Reliance has been placed upon a decision by the

learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents

in <a href="/doc/1463870/" id="a_249">Commissioner of Wealth Tax v. M/s Shravan

Kumar Swarup, JR</a> 1994(6) SC 446 , in which the

mode of valuation of house property was prescribed for

ascertaining the wealth under the <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_250">Wealth Tax Act</a>, 1957.

The Apex Court held that the mode of valuation of

house property wholly or mainly used for residential

purposes    for   ascertaining     the net wealth          under the

wealth tax act 1957 is essentially a rule of evidence.

Rule 1BB was merely procedural and was attracted to

all pending cases. However, there is no dispute with the

aforesaid     proposition         that    procedural/machinery

provision can be applied retrospectively but not the

charging provision.
</p>
<p id="p_145">      One of the essential ingredients as to tax rate

itself is until &amp; unless the rate is specified, merely

enabling provision providing for tax to be charged as

per the notification, it could not be said that the rate

was fixed by the State Government after the provision

was enacted. Thus, in the absence of very foundation of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">                                      85</span>

the charging provision to fix the rate retrospectively,

the subordinate legislation could not have been made

with retrospective effect. A bare reading of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_251">Section 16</a>

of the Finance Act, 2008, quoted above, makes it clear

that there is no provision to fix either expressly or by

necessary implication, the rate of cess retrospectively.

The State Govt. could not have fixed the enhanced rate

of cess retrospectively. Upto December, the rate of cess

which     was   realized   as    per       the    previous       notification

dt.25.2.2008      was   Rs.35/-       per        tonne    of   the   mineral

dispatched. Thereafter, the notification was issued on

23.1.2009 enhancing the environment and health cess

retrospectively with effect from 1.4.2008 at the rate of

Rs.500/-, which could not have been done.

</p><p id="p_146">        On behalf of the respondents, reliance was placed

on a decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/693176/" id="a_252">Bhim Singh v.

Union of India</a>, (2010) 5 SCC 538 to contend that

while making judicial review of the State legislation, the

court    should   be    slow    to        interfere      and   viability   or

veracity of a scheme or law has to be decided by the

legislature and not by the court.                     Judicial    review   is

maintainable        only        on         issues        of      vires     or

unconstitutionality of a scheme or law.

</p><p id="p_147">        In the instant case, the question involved is of

competence of the subordinate legislation to impose the

rate of cess (tax) with retrospective effect, which could

not have been done, unless the main legislature itself
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">                                      86</span>

has authorized it expressly or by necessary implication.

Thus, the aforesaid ratio counters the submission raised

by the respondents as to viability or veracity of the

Scheme or law. Applying the aforesaid decision, we are

of the view that the court can make interference in such

a   matter   and   it    is    not   viability     or   veracity    of    the

Scheme, which is involved in the instant case but the

question is as to the competence to make subordinate

legislation with retrospective effect without statutory

authorization.

1964 SC 925 , wherein the Apex Court has laid down

that recovery      can be validated              by enacting       specific

legislation. It is not the question involved in the instant

case. The legislature has not validated the recovery in

the   instant    case.        Infact,     the    Legislature     has      not

authorized the recovery with retrospective effect and,

therefore, the rate of cess could not have been revised

with retrospective effect on rock phosphate.

Income Tax v. Bazpur Cooperative Sugar Factory Ltd</a>.,

(1988) 3 SCC 553 has laid down thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_73">      13. In the     light of  the decisions     discussed
      earlier,  it appears to   us that    the respondent
      society had no authority in law to amend bye-law
      50 with retrospective effect as it purported to do.
      We have already pointed out the power of the
      society to amend its bye-laws arises from the
      provisions of Rule    11 of the United     Provinces
      Co-operative Societies Rules, 1936,      which rule
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">                            87</span>

    has been made under the powers conferred by
    Section 43 of the United Provinces Co-operative
    Societies Act, 1912. There is nothing expressly or
    impliedly in Rule 11 which confers any power on
    the    society   to    amend    its   bye-laws    with
    retrospective effect and in the absence of any such
    power being conferred, either expressly or by
    implication, it  cannot be said that the society
    had    any power to      amend its     bye-laws with
    retrospective    effect.    Mr.Manchanda,      learned
    counsel for the respondent-society placed strong
    reliance    on the decision of this Court in
    <a href="/doc/1987359/" id="a_255">Dr.Indramani Pyarelal     Gupta v. W.R. Nathu and
    Others</a>, [1963] 1 S.C.R. p. 721 where it was held
    that the substituted bye-law 52AA of the East
    India Cotton Association made by the Central
    Government in exercise of the power conferred
    upon it under       <a href="/doc/708230/" id="a_256">Section 12</a>      of the    Forward
    Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952 and which, very
    shortly stated, conferred power on the Forward
    Markets Commission,       after notifying    with the
    Chairman of the Board of the East India Cotton
    Association, to close      hedge contracts      in the
    eventualities mentioned in the said rule was not
    invalid in law or ultra vires the Constitution. On a
    proper construction, the amended or substituted
    bye-law applied not only to contracts to be
    entered into      futute but      also to subsisting
    contracts. This Court pointed out that, in that case,
    the power to make bye- laws so as to affect the
    rights in    subsisting   contracts followed as      a
    necessary implication from the terms of <a href="/doc/657558/" id="a_257">Section
    11</a>    of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act,
    1952. In the case before us, however, there is
    nothing in Section 43 of        the U.P.Co-operative
    Societies Act, 1912 or Rule 11 of the United
    Provinces Co-operative Societies Rules, 1936 to
    indicate that there is any power, express or by
    implied, in a co-operative society registered under
    that Act to make bye-laws with retrospective
    effect in respect of its business.</blockquote><pre id="pre_5">
