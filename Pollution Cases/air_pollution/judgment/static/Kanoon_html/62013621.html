                            आदे श / O R D E R

PER R.C.SHARMA (A.M):

      This is an appeal filed by the assessee against the order of CIT(A)-

8, Mumbai dated 18/02/2015 for the Assessment Year 2006-07 in the

matter of imposition of penalty u/s.271(1)(c) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1">IT Act</a>.

2. Rival contentions have been heard and record perused. Facts in brief

are that the assessee company filed its return of income for A.Y.2006-07

on 23rd November 2006 declaring a loss of Rs.1,29,84,436/- the AO

completed the assessment u/s.143(3) on 30th October, 2008 determining

the total loss at Rs.93,87,792/- after making the following additions /

disallowances:

i. Depreciation @30% on oil tankers           :     Rs.28,472/-
ii. Unutilised Modvat Credit                  :     Rs.18,43,077/-
                                      2
                                                          ITA No.3598/Mum/2015
                                               M/s. Vinyle Chemicals (India) Ltd.,


iii. Depreciation @80% on coal fire boiler :         Rs.4,78,423/-
iv. Depreciation @80% on effluent treatment
     Point                                 :         Rs.8,43,322/-
                                                     ===========
</pre><pre id="pre_2">                   Total                             Rs.31,93,294/-
                                                     ===========

</pre><p id="p_1">3. The AO observed that in the appeal filed by the assessee against the

order passed by the AO, the CIT(A) has confirmed the additions /

disallowances on account of depreciation but deleted addition made on

account of unutilized Modvat of Rs.18,43,077/-. The assessee submitted

that it had claimed depreciation @80% on coal fire boiler and affluent

treatment plant in good faith as has been done in earlier years, which has

been allowed by the Department.
</p>
<p id="p_2">4. The disallowance of depreciation so made was confirmed by the

CIT(A), however, assessee did not file further appeal before the Tribunal

and accepted the same in view of the huge carry forward losses and even

after reduction in depreciation there remains to be loss.

</p><p id="p_3">5. With regard to the disallowance of depreciation, AO also levied penalty

u/s.271(1)(c) which was confirmed by the CIT(A) and assessee is now in

further appeal before us.
</p>
<p id="p_4">6. We have considered rival contentions and carefully gone through the

orders of the authorities below and found from record that assessee has

claimed depreciation in respect of the above assets at the very same rate

at which it has claimed depreciation in earlier years and which has also

been accepted by the department. With regard to depreciation @30% on

Oil Tankers, the assessee was claiming depreciation at 30% on WDV of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      3</span>
                                                        ITA No.3598/Mum/2015
                                             M/s. Vinyle Chemicals (India) Ltd.,


Oil Tankers based on the entry D-9 in old Appendix -1 for depreciation

which reads as "Motor Buses and Motor Lorries other than those used in

a business of running them on hire." However in the subsequent Appendix

</p><p id="p_5">-1, this entry is not there. These tankers were acquired before 1990 and

assessee has been claiming depreciation @ 30% on oil tankers all these

years, which was accepted by the Assessing Officers all these years. On

the basis of earlier claims, the assessee claimed the depreciation in this

year also in good faith. When the AO pointed out this to the assessee, it

was accepted and no appeal was filed on this issue. The assessee simply

followed the action taken in earlier years. There was no ulterior motive or

intentional motive in claiming more depreciation.

</p><p id="p_6">7. With regard to depreciation @ 80% on Coal Fired boiler at Rs.4,78,423/-

the assessee has been claiming the depreciation at the above rate in

earlier years as well as in the subsequent years. In para 7.3 the A.O. has

mentioned that " The assessee did not furnish any evidence to show that

the assets purchased were coal fired boilers on which deduction @ 80%

is allowable. The assessee simply furnished a letter of Asstt Manager of

M/s Thermax Ltd addressed to assessee. In the said letter it is written that

on boiler model CPF 100A depreciation @ 100% is allowable as it is

energy saving device."
</p>
<p id="p_7">8. We found that the said letter is written by the Asstt Manager of a

Company who are manufacturers of the machinery used in coal fired

plants and therefore an authority to say that the coal fired boiler is an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     4</span>
                                                         ITA No.3598/Mum/2015
                                              M/s. Vinyle Chemicals (India) Ltd.,


energy saving device. In view of these facts we observe that the A.O

failed to appreciate the evidence furnished before him in right spirit. The

letter of Asstt Manager, Thermax Ltd is sufficient proof to establish that

the boiler is an energy saving device. There is bill for purchase of

machinery and bill for constructing coal bunker foundation for installing

coal fired boiler. What further evidence is required? The A.O. did not ask

for specific evidence in support of claim of depreciation. With regard to

depreciation on effluent treatment plant @80% at Rs.12,97,418/-, we

found that assessee had installed effluent treatment plant in its

manufacturing facilities as required by Maharashtra Pollution Control

Board in earlier years and had claimed depreciation on WDV of such

assets during the year. Upon making an application to the Maharashtra

Pollution Control Board and before starting manufacture of chemical

products, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board granted consent to

operate u/s 26 of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974

&amp; u/s <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981

and authorization/Renewal of Authorisation under Rule 5 of the

Hazarduous Wastes (Management &amp; Handling ) Rules 1989 and

Amendment Rules, vide their consent letter.
</p>
<p id="p_8">9. It would be observed that the terms &amp; conditions mentioned in the

above letter is not a brochure containing rules and regulations but a

consent letter issued to the assessee for observing the pollution control

rules in a chemical factory. Again there was no addition during the year.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     5</span>
</p><p id="p_9">                                                        ITA No.3598/Mum/2015
                                             M/s. Vinyle Chemicals (India) Ltd.,


Addition of such assets were done in 2004-05 and depreciation @ 80 %

was claimed by the assessee and allowed by the assessing officer. In the

year under appeal it was only WDV on which depreciation was claimed.

</p><p id="p_10">10. Thus, it is clear from the above that merely because of decline of part

claim of depreciation, which was allowed by department itself in earlier

year, the AO has levied the penalty. Since the assessee had huge losses

in the year under consideration and in earlier year as well as in the

subsequent years, no appeal was filed to the Tribunal. We found that the

assessee had not concealed any facts relating to income.

</p><p id="p_11">11. For levying of penalty u/s. 271 (1) (c) there must be concealment of

income. In the case of M/s Jyothy Laboratories Limited Vs DCIT (ITA No.

5447/Mum/05), the Mumbai Tribunal has held that where the assessee

has claimed expenditure after putting all particulars on record and after

interpreting section and using the favorable decision in support of same,

the assessee cannot be said to have furnished inaccurate particulars or

concealed particulars of income and hence, penalty was deleted. This

decision was rendered after considering the decision of Hon'ble Supreme

Court in the case of <a href="/doc/95472186/" id="a_5">Union of India &amp; Ors. V. Dharmendra Textile

Processors &amp; Ors</a>. (306 ITR 277) (SC).
</p>
<p id="p_12">12. Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Shivlal Desai &amp; Sons 114

ITR 388 has categorically observed that merely there are certain additions

/ disallowance in the assessment proceedings, it will not bring in its wake

the levy of penalty. Further, the Hon'ble Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                        6</span>
                                                           ITA No.3598/Mum/2015
                                                M/s. Vinyle Chemicals (India) Ltd.,


case of CIT Vs. Ajaib Singh &amp; Co. (170 CTR 489) has held that merely

because certain expenses claimed by the assessee has been disallowed

it does not mean that the assessee has furnished incorrect particulars of

its income.
</p>
<p id="p_13">13. Further, in the decision of Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in Burmah-

Shell Oil Storage and Distribution Co. of India Ltd. Vs. ITO (112 ITR

</p><p id="p_14">592) wherein it has been held that the rejection of the contention raised by

the Assessee cannot lead to the conclusion that there has been

concealment of particulars of income or furnishing of inaccurate

particulars thereof by the Assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14. The Bombay High Court in the case of Sesa Resources Ltd vs

ACIY(38 taxmann.com) has held as under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "The appellant had claimed a deduction u/s 10B of the Act. The
      appellant, however, was denied the same. The orders in this regard
      have attained finality. The question is, whether merely on account
      thereof the appellant is liable for penalty. There is no dispute that
      the appellant disclosed all the facts. The appellant did not conceal
      any facts. Based on the disclosed material, the appellant sought the
      deduction which was denied on the ground that it was not entitled to
      the same as a matter of law. The Tribunal was in error in holding
      that merely because the claim for deduction was denied the
      appellant is liable to pay the penalty."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">15. In the case of Reliance Petro Products 322 ITR 158 Hon'ble Supreme

Court held that "submitting an incorrect claim for expenditure would

amount to giving inaccurate particulars of such income" is not correct. By

no stretch of imagination can the making of an incorrect claim in law

tantamount to furnishing inaccurate particulars. A mere making of the

claim, which is not sustainable in law, by itself, will not amount to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                               7</span>
                                                                  ITA No.3598/Mum/2015
                                                       M/s. Vinyle Chemicals (India) Ltd.,


furnishing inaccurate particulars regarding the income of the assessee. If

the contention of the Revenue is accepted then in case of every Return

where the claim made is not accepted by the AO for any reason, the

assessee will invite penalty u/s 271(l)(c). That is clearly not the

intendment of the Legislature."
</p>
<p id="p_17">16. In view of the above discussion, we do not find any merit in the action

of the AO for levying penalty for part disallowance of claim of

depreciation.
</p>
<p id="p_18">17. In the result, appeal of assessee is allowed in terms indicated

hereinabove.</p><pre id="pre_3">
