<p id="p_10">     2. The case of complainant in brief is as follows-
     The complainant is a body corporate constituted
under <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_9">Section 4</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, is empowered to perform the

complainant        is   represented      by    the     Deputy
Environmental Officer, who has been authorized by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                           3          CC No.37639/2006</span>



the Board to file the complaint. Accused No-1 is a
company within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_11">Section 47</a> of the Act,
which is engaged in construction activities of
Apartment Buildings. Accused No-2 is the partner of
accused No-1 firm, who is having responsibility to
manage the day to day affairs of accused No-1. The
accused require to obtain prior consent for operation
of project from the complainant Board under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_12">Section
25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_13">26</a> of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. The occupier of accused project
is carrying on the project i.e., construction of
Apartment    building   without   prior   consent   for
operation of project from the complainant. On 06-06-
2006, the accused filed application seeking consent of
the complainant Board for operation of project i.e.,
construction of apartment building, as a result of
which, the same was inspected by the Deputy
Environmental Officer, Bengaluru North on 14-06-
2006 and found the accused was engaged in operation
of construction activities of apartment building
without prior consent. The complainant issued show
cause notice to the accused on 24-06-2006, for which
no reply was given. Thereby, it is alleged that the

</p>
<p id="p_11">      3. After taking cognizance, summons was issued
to accused No-1 and 2. The accused appeared through
a counsel. Accused No-2 being a partner of accused
No-1 signed the vakalath on behalf of accused No-
1(firm) and is on bail. After furnishing the copy of
complaint, Accusation was read over and explained to
accused. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed
to be tried.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      4. The complainant in order to prove his case
examined PW1 and 2 and got marked documents at
Ex.P1 to 6. Thereafter the statement of accused as
required U/S 313 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_19">Cr.P.C</a>. was recorded, wherein
the accused denied the incriminating evidence. The
accused No-2 has got examined himself as DW1.

the written arguments filed by the learned counsel for
accused.

<p id="p_14">     6. The points that arise for my consideration are-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           1)   Whether the complainant
                proves that the accused
                committed     the    offence
                punishable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_20">Section 44</a>

                1974?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           2)   What order?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">     7. My answer to the above points are as under
for the following reasons.
</p><pre id="pre_2">           Point No-1 :          In the Affirmative
           Point No-2 :          As per final order
                      REASONS
Point No-1:

</pre><p id="p_16">     8. It is the specific case of complainant that the
accused without prior consent of complainant Board
had started construction of residential apartments,
which is punishable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_22">Section 44</a> of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_23">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
</p><p id="p_17">     9. The complainant in order to prove its case
examined      PW1    Doddashanaiah,          the      Deputy
Environmental Officer, who filed the complaint on
behalf of the Board. In his evidence, he has deposed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             6           CC No.37639/2006</span>



that he is authorized to file complaint. In this regard,
the authorization letter is produced at Ex.P4, wherein
the Board in its committee meeting held on 19-10-
2006 had authorized the Deputy Environmental
Officer to initiate criminal action, for violation of
<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_24">Section 25</a> of the Act against the accused. The
complainant also examined PW2 Ramesh.A., the
Senior Environmental Officer.
</p><p id="p_18">     10. According to the complainant's counsel, the
accused without prior consent had started construction
of residential apartment, accused No-2 who was
managing the affairs of accused No-1 had filed
application for clearance/NOC to construct 192 Flats
at Kodigehalli. It is also argued that the accused had
filed declaratory affidavit at Ex.P6, wherein it is stated
that as on the date of filing Ex.P1 application for
NOC, the construction of residential flats was started,
which is in violation of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_25">Section 25</a> of Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_26">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974,
punishable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_27">Section 44</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_19">     11. The counsel for accused in written
arguments contended that there are no documents to
show that as on the date of filing application on 06-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            7          CC No.37639/2006</span>



<p id="p_20">06-2006, the construction was started by the accused.
There is no proof that the officials of complainant
Board had visited the spot. No mahazar was drawn
and no photographs are produced. The evidence of
PW1 cannot be believable. The complainant before
permitting the accused had collected Rs.8,00,000/-
and it is lying with the Board. It is further contended
that the evidence of PW2 does not establish the case
of complainant. On the other hand, the accused have
not violated the provisions of said Act.
</p><p id="p_21">     12. On careful consideration and submissions of
both sides, I have carefully perused the materials on
record. It is not in dispute that the complainant i.e.,
Karnataka State Pollution Control Board is established
under <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_28">Section 4</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_29">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. Thus, the complainant Board
is empowered to discharge the duties under the
provisions of said Act.
</p><p id="p_22">     13. PW1 is admittedly a Deputy Environmental
Officer. Though in his personal name authorization
was not given to file a complaint by the Board
meeting at Ex.P4, however by designation, PW1 was
authorized to file a complaint. Ex.P4 authorization is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                             8          CC No.37639/2006</span>



not disputed by the other side. Under <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_30">Section 49</a> (1)
</p><p id="p_23">(a) of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_31">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974, no court shall take cognizance of any
offence under the Act, except on complaint by a
Board or any officer authorized in this behalf by it.
</p><p id="p_24">     14. In the present case, the Board has authorized
PW1, the Deputy Environmental Officer to make
complaint against the accused.      Therefore, PW1 is
competent to file complaint on behalf of the Board
under the provisions of Act against the accused.
</p><p id="p_25">     15. It is not in dispute that as per Ex.P1, the
application was submitted by accused No-2 as a
partner of accused No-1 Maruthi Enterprises, seeking
consent for construction of residential apartment
project. Under <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_32">Section 47</a> (1) (a) of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_33">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974,
"company" means any body corporate and includes a
firm or other association of individuals. Thus, the
accused No-1 partnership firm falls within the
meaning of Company under the above said provision.
Under <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_34">Section 47</a> (1) (b) of the Water (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_35">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, "director" in relation
to a firm means a partner in the firm. Accused No-2 is

the partner of accused No-1 and the same is not
disputed by him.
</p><p id="p_26">     16. Under <a href="/doc/185025414/" id="a_36">Section 47</a> (1) of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_37">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, the
accused may prove that-

                       without his knowledge, or

           (b)      he exercised all due diligence to
                    prevent the commission of the
                    offence,
</pre><p id="p_27">Defence under sub-section (2), the accused may prove
that the offence has been committed without-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">           (a)     his consent or connivance, or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">           (b)     any neglect on his part

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     17. In the instant case, according to complainant,
accused No-2 was in charge and responsible to the
company for conduct of business of company at the
time of offence. The accused No-2 either in the cross-
</blockquote><p id="p_28">examination of PW1 and 2 or in his evidence on oath
did not contend that he was not the in charge and was
responsible to accused No-1 for the conduct of
business of accused No-1 company. Hence, it goes
without saying that accused No-2 was in charge of and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                           10         CC No.37639/2006</span>



responsible to accused No-1 company for the conduct
of business of accused No-1.
</p><p id="p_29">     18. PW1 in his examination in chief deposed
that on 14-06-2006, he had visited the spot where the
accused had started constructing the apartments
without prior consent under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_38">Section 25</a> of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_39">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. On
the basis of spot visit, he had prepared a report at
Ex.P2. Thereafter on 24-06-2006, the show cause
notice was issued to accused through registered post.
Accused No-2 had submitted declaratory affidavit at
Ex.P6 with his signature at Ex.P6(a) to the
complainant Board.
</p><p id="p_30">     19. In the cross-examination of PW1, the spot
visit was denied by the accused. Similarly, Ex.P6 - the
declaratory affidavit is disputed stating that on blank
stamp paper, the signature of accused No-2 was taken
and created the same. From the above said material on
record, the court has to look into that, whether before
submitting Ex.P1 application to the complainant
Board for construction of residential apartment, the
accused had started construction of the residential
apartment. If so, it contravenes under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_40">Section 25</a> of

attract the said provision.

that in 3½ acres of Sy.No.211 at Kodigehalli Village,
he had constructed apartment. On 06-06-2006 for
construction    of   apartment,    he   had   submitted

complainant officials had visited the spot. For about

He was granted permission to construct the apartment
within five years, which he has completed within the
stipulated period.

accused No-2, the following facts are established-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">             (a)     He had undertaken to construct
                     apartment    in    Sy.No.211 of

                     for the conduct of business of said

<p id="p_36">Therefore, the suggestion made to PW1 by the
defence counsel that Ex.P6 is a created document by

obtaining signature on blank stamp paper holds no
water.
</p><p id="p_37">      23. The Ex.P6 was attested by notary public
B.Gopala Krishna, signed by accused No-2 as a
partner for Maruthi Enterprises. In para 1, 2 of the
said affidavit, it is clearly stated as follows-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">      1) We have started construction of residential
      flats at Sy.No.211 of Kodigehalli Village,
      Yelahanka Hobli, Bangalore North Taluk, before
      making an application for the Environmental
      clearance and No Objection Certificate under the
      provisions of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_49">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,
      1986.

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">      2) We further state that the non-submission of
      application, REIA reports, property documents
      and consent fees to the Karnataka State Pollution
      Control Board in time was not intentional, but an
      inadvertent act of ignorance on our part which
      may be condoned.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">Thus the accused admitted that, before making an
application at Ex.P1, they have started construction of
residential apartment at Sy.No.211 of Kodigehalli
Village.

<p id="p_39">     24. Ex.P2 is the spot inspection report by PW1,
as per the instructions of PW2, wherein the
observation in fourth page at para 1 is that-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">            The developer has started construction
            activity before filing the application. The
            super structure work is completed and

</blockquote>
<p id="p_40">The said inspection was made on 14-06-2006 i.e., one
week after filing Ex.P1 application by the accused.
There is no reason to dis-believe the version of PW1
and 2 and the documents at Ex.P6 and 2, as there is no
dispute by the accused No-2 in his evidence. The
enemity is not elicited by accused to depose falsely by
PW1 and 2 against the accused.
</p><p id="p_41">     25. On the other hand, the officials of
complainant Board have adduced evidence, which
clearly establishes that the accused before obtaining
prior permission from the Board for construction of
residential apartment in Sy.No.211 of Kodigehalli
Village, had started construction, in contravention of
<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_50">Section 25</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_51">Control of

Affirmative.

the   said   Act,   the   punishment     prescribed   is
imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than
one year six months, but which may extend to 6 years

starting construction without permission, submitted
application seeking permission. Subsequently the
accused had obtained permission and completed
construction within five years. Accused No-1 is a firm

No-1 and both are liable to be convicted.

the offence has been committed. In the absence of
such contention and proof, the accused are liable to be
