</p><p id="p_4">             Industrial Revolution of latter 18th and early 19th century,

20th and 21st century scientific and technological revolutions

dramatically increased humanity's need for natural resources and its

pressure on environment. This impact has been negative. First half of

20th century raised fundamental question about the future environment.

Could we support rapidly growing population? First the question was

debated in scientific circles, but soon caught the attention of the public.

This concern gained momentum in 1960s and culminated in convening

of the United Nations conference on Human environment in Stockholm

in 1972.{A Commitment to The Future Sustainable Development and

Environment Protection"       by Mostafa K. Tabu published by United

Nations Environment Programme}. The concept of Sustainable

development is not new. It came to be known as early as in 1972 in the

Stockholm declaration that:

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "Man has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and

             adequate conditions of life, in an environment of a

             quality that permits a life of dignity and well being and he

             bears a solemn responsibility to protect and improve the

             environment for present and future generation."</blockquote><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">             Thereafter in 1987 United Nations released Burndtland

Report which defines Sustainable development as "development which

meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of

future generations to meet their own needs."
</p>
<p id="p_7">"Brundtland Report" which had been further discussed under agenda 21

of UN Conference on Environment and Development held in June 1992

at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Basic principles of sustainable development

described in Brundtland Report are:

</p><p id="p_10">         We would like to say few words about environment too. The

courts in India are very much concerned about the environment. No one

can turn blind eye to environment. Ecological equilibrium is must.

Balanced preserving of the environment and promoting development is

a necessity. They are fundamentally interrelated. The environment

cannot be an entity without human activity. The economy of a nation

grows with industrialization. The economic factors do not block the

attainment of desirable and sustainable future, rather they favour it. The

advantages are multiplied by industrialization as it promotes both better

resource management and more sustainable development.

</p><p id="p_11">            The Supreme Court and the High Courts have played an

important role in preserving environment and had applied the doctrine

of sustainable development. Parliament has enacted various laws to deal

with the problems of environmental degradation.

Bengal and ors</a>. AIR 1993 CALCUTTA 215, had the occasion to deal

with a similar problem in relation to the wetland and the learned Single

            considering the impact of this problem on the society in

            regard thereto, in my view, Law Courts should also rise upto

            present day context: Law Courts have a social duty since it

            is a part of the society and as such, must always function

            having due regard to the present day problems which the

            society faces. It is now a well-settled principle of law that

            socio-economic condition of the country cannot be ignored

            by a Court of law. It is now a well-settled principle of law

            that while dealing with the matter, the social problems shall

            have to be dealt with in the way and in the manner it calls

            for, since benefit to the society ought to be the prime

            consideration of the Law Courts and ecological imbalance

            being a social problem ought to be decided by a court of law

            so that the society may thrive and prosper without any

            affection".</blockquote><p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">            The learned Judge had indicated in the said judgment that

there should be a proper balance between the protection of environment

and the development process : The society shall have to prosper, but not

at the cost of the environment and in the similar vein, the environment

shall have to be protected but not at the cost of the development of the

society there shall have to be both development and proper environment

and as such, a balance has to be found out and administrative actions

ought to proceed in accordance therewith and not dehors the same.

Union of India and Ors</a>. 1996(5) SCC 281, Supreme Court had the

occasion to deal with the question of protection of 6000 kms long coast

line of India and the Court emphasised that it would be the duty and

responsibility of the coastal states and Union Territories in which the

stretches exist, to see that the notifications issued under the provisions

of Environment (Protection) Rules as well as the notifications issued,

declaring the coastal stretches should be properly and duly implemented

and the various restrictions on the setting up and expansion of

industries, operation or process etc. in the Regulation Zone should be

strictly enforced. The Court had indicated that with a view to protect the

ecological balance in the coastal areas, notifications having been issued

by the Central Government, there ought not to be any violation and the

prohibited activities should not be allowed to come up within the area

declared as CRZ notification. The Court also emphasised that no

activities which would ultimately lead to unscientific and unsustainable

development and ecological destruction should at all be allowed and the

Courts must scrupulously try to protect the ecology and environment

and should shoulder greater responsibility of which the Court can have

closer awareness and easy monitoring.

<p id="p_16">            Supreme Court had applied the doctrine of Sustainable

Development in <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_5">Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum v. Union of India</a>,

1996(5) SCC 647. In this case, a dispute arose over some tanneries in

the State of Tamil Nadu. These tanneries were discharging effluents in

the river Palar, which is the main source of drinking water in the State.

            minimal disturbance of ecological balance and without

            avoidable hazard to them and to their cattle, homes and

            agricultural land and undue affection of air, water and

Supreme Court issued directions towards the closing of mechanical

stone crushing activities in and around Delhi, which was declared by

World Health Organisation as the third most polluted city in the

world. Keeping in view the importance of stone crushing and issued

directions for allotment of sites in the new 'crushing zone' set up at

village Pali in the State of Haryana. Thus it is quite obvious that the

Courts give equal importance to both ecology and development while

dealing with the cases of environmental degradation.

</p><p id="p_25">             We have heard the learned Senior Counsel Shri Sumeet

Mahajan, for the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_26">             The main thrust of arguments of the learned counsel for the

petitioners is that water pollution is being caused by the industry. So it

requires shifting and sealing. A company called M/s Ansal Township

and Project Ltd. merged into Petitioner No 3. That company entered into

an agreement dated 3.7.2006 (Annexure P-2) with the respondents No.1

to 4. It is one of the terms and conditions of the agreement that State

Government shall not allow polluting industries in the periphery of the

project area (upto 500 meters from project boundary). The official

respondents are not complying with terms of agreement. As per terms of

the agreement the industry should be shifted. The said term and

condition and agreement dated 3.7.2006 reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">             "Clause 5 (iii) (J)- The State Govt. shall not allow
             Polluting Industries in the periphery (upto 500 mtrs from
             project boundary) of the project area."</blockquote><p id="p_27">


</p><p id="p_28">             The contention of the petitioners is not sustainable on the

face of it. It is no where mentioned in the agreement that already

existing industries are to be relocated/ shifted. The Industry is in

existence much prior to agreement dated 3.7.2006. The counsel for the

petitioners admits existence of the factory since early 70's or around that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> CWP No.19379 of 2011                                                   8</span>



period. Petitioners were fully aware about the existence of the Industry.

They should have refrained from accepting the proposal for the project.

Now petitioners cannot say that they are investing huge amount, but

polluting industry is in existence within 500 meters from the project

boundary contrary to the terms of agreement. They entered into an

agreement with their eyes open and was fully aware of the existence of

the industry. Now he cannot say that the industry should be shifted.

</p><p id="p_29">            The Learned counsel for the petitioners further contended

that although said Industry is in existence since 1972 much prior to the

agreement of petitioner No 3 but it is a polluting unit. Initially it was

known as Swaraj Combine Factory. Thereafter, it was taken over by M/s

Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd, as a Swaraj Division. Now it is known as

Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd. Swaraj Division, Phase IV, Industrial

Area, SAS, Nagar, Mohali. Mahindra &amp;Mahindra, is one of the world's

largest tractor manufacturer and Swaraj Division is its manufacturing

unit situated in Mohali. The Industry manufactures about 100 tractors

daily, 300 combines per year and 300 forklifts per year and also

manufactures various spare parts of tractors, combines and forklifts. The

Industry is spread over an area of about 32 acres. Its manufacturing

processes involve surface treatment, heat treatment and paint, resultantly

causes immense water and air pollution. He made reference to the

photographs (Annexure P-7) annexed with the writ petition. So, counsel

for the petitioners argued that industry is required to be shifted and

sealed.
</p>
<p id="p_30">            The Learned counsel for petitioners failed to substantiate

the contention raised by him. There is no authentic material and cogent

evidence available on the record from which it could be concluded that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> CWP No.19379 of 2011                                                   9</span>



the industry is causing air and water pollution resultant degradation of

the environment in the surroundings of the project. There is no data on

record such as Local Environment Audit Report, the Environment

Assessment Report or any other material to prove the pollution caused

by the industry in question. We do not think that merely on the basis of

photographs or large production by the industry per day, a direction

deserves to be issued for relocation/ shifting and stopping the activities

of the industry. The concern and fears of the petitioners regarding

mother Earth are welcome. For each major concern there are many

anxieties. This case is based on pessimistic assumptions. The

pessimistic assumptions extrapolated into future leads to divergent

predictions. Possibilities for exceed the actualities. So contention of the

petitioners that industry is causing in pollution is unfounded and hence

rejected.

<p id="p_31">              We can take judicial notice that State of Punjab is

predominately agricultural and farm equipments are in dire need. They

are being produced in the Industry. Farm machination helps in effective

utilization of inputs to increase the productivity and labour. The

ancillary and support industries also grow with the industry. Country

witnessed unprecedented growth in agriculture, which helped India to

graduate from hunger to self sufficiency in food grains. It is popularly

known as "Green Revolution". The Industry is running since early 70's

and is in continuous production. It is providing equipments for the

agricultural needs of the State of Punjab and the Country. The

agricultural production with new technology provided by this Industry is

also helping in the agricultural progress of the State of Punjab and had

saved to major extent paddy and wheat straw burning so is preventing

degradation of environment. Many types of ultra safe devices and

appliances are being produced by the industry. The industry is providing

opportunities of employment and imparting practical training to the new

entrants in the field of Mechanical Engineering and to the students of

management.
</p>
<p id="p_32">             We cannot appreciate the contentions of Sh. Mahajan

counsel for petitioners for shifting/ relocation and sealing of the industry

for reasons that it would result in loss of employment to significant

proportion of the workers, skilled as well unskilled, employed in the

industry. That may leads to widespread violent street protests.

</p><p id="p_33">             We can say that development and environment issue is a

classic conflict between competing priorities - clean air and water to

protect public health versus job for workers. Relocating industry will

result in relocating workers and supporting sectors like grocery shops

and tea stalls. The relocation results into unorganized employment. If

the workers are not relocated with industry,         they will disperse in

search of alternative earning opportunities for survival of their families.

The petitioners are completely silent about the effect of relocation and

effect of depriving anyone of job, is an inordinate burden and stress on

workers and their families. The loss of employment would create many

more problems like loss of dignity, increased tension in households and

wife beating, loss of education of children, health, borrowings and debt,

cutting down on food , child labour and women taking up casual and

part time work etc.

             Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the

industry is violating the terms of consent granted to the industry under

the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Water Act</a>. If the industry is violating the terms of the 'consent', the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> CWP No.19379 of 2011                                                   11</span>



petitioners could bring these facts to the notice of competent authorities

under the anti pollution laws; the authority can withdraw 'consent'. The

petitioners may file appeal under <a href="/doc/1577175/" id="a_10">Section 48</a> of the Water Act. The

petitioners have not availed the alternative remedy of appeal as

permissible under the provisions of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">Water Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_12">Air Act</a>, 1987.

It is common knowledge that such petitions are being filed often with

oblique ulterior motives. We are of the considered opinion that there is

absolutely no merit in this contention. Petitioners No.1 and 2 appear to

be tools in the hands of petitioner No.3 . The 'Court of Justice' should

not be polluted by such unscrupulous litigants by restoring to extra

ordinary jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_34">             Even if it is presumed that industry is violating the terms of

consent. There is statutory weaponry to finish the foe of pollution. The

legislature had provided sufficient safe guards under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_13">Environment

Protection Act</a>, 1986, Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Air Pollution Act</a>, 1987. Those authorities empowered under

the Environmental Laws can be approached for redressal of such

grievances. These authorities have sufficient powers to check industrial

effluents. Such authorities can even restrain and stay the operation of

industry on evaluation of the impact of pollution caused by the industry

on the environment. This can be assessed by the Committee of Experts.

There is no authentic data available with the writ petition in this regard

whether respondent No.5 is causing pollution beyond its limits or is

working within limits of 'consent' granted to the said industry. The

principle of sustainable development and environment protection is the

order of the day. Without industrialization, the country cannot progress.

However, it is also the duty of the industry that they should work within
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11"> CWP No.19379 of 2011                                                    12</span>



the norms set for pollution and adhere to the terms of consent granted to

them. In a country like India, meeting the basic need of the population

is also one of the issues. Needs of the poorest strata of the mankind and

their security are also to be kept in view. If industries are not allowed to

run, it will create unemployment which will ultimately result into

starving not only the individuals but also the families which are

dependent upon them. In fact, this industry is source of employment to

the residents of the area and others. Industrialization itself ensures a

good environment as all the equipments are required to protect the

environment and make it pollution free are also produced in the

industry. Nobody can dispute the need of protecting the environment.

After all, people are entitled to pure air and water. The maintenance and

conservation of ecological is also one of the basic needs. We cannot

over-look that protection of the environment is subservient to

industrialization.    Industrialization not only creates wealth and

opportunities to large part of the population but is also necessary for

preserving environment.

<p id="p_35">             Unless we are industrialized, we will never get respect in

the community of Nations. We will not be able to promote the welfare

of our people as we will not be able to generate wealth, employment

opportunities, as is stated in <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_16">Article 38</a> of the Constitution of India .

Articles 39, 41 and 43 of the Constitution of India being Directive

Principles provide for right to adequate means of livelihood, right to

work, to education and guarantees living wages for workers. Without

industrialization, our people shall not be able to get work, education,

employment benefits and other public assistances as are enshrined in the

Constitution of India. All this require huge resources and funds which

can be generated by industries. The massive unemployment can also be

eradicated by industrialization.

<p id="p_36">             So far as the contention regarding providing of Storm

Water System and Sewerage System is concerned, petitioners had not

even impleaded the Public Health Department and the Punjab Water

Supply and Sewerage Board as respondents. They can represent in this

regard to the authorities. Representations (Annexures P-10 and P-11)

attached with the writ petition are of the year 2008, and it appears that

petitioner No.3 and others are not keen to pursue said representations

for the reasons best known to them. We can infer that petitioners are not

serious about the Sewerage System and Storm Water and Drainage

System.                    In view of the above, we are of the opinion

that the present writ petition is devoid of merit.
