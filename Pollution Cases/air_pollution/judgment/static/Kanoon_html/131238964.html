</p><p id="p_5">2.    This is the fifth round of litigation pertaining to the

Integrated Infrastructure Corridor and Finance Project 8 situated

between      Bangalore      and     Mysore,     Karnataka,       consisting         of

residential, industrial and commercial facilities, such as, among

other things, self­sustaining Townships, expressways, utilities

and amenities including power plants, industrial plants, water

treatment plants and other infrastructural developments, as

more specifically described in the Infrastructure Corridor Project

Technical Report9 dated August, 1995, as amended.
</p>

<p id="p_6">3.    The first round of litigation was in the form of a public

interest litigation filed by H.T. Somashekar Reddy before the High

Court, questioning the requirement of land for the Project as per

the FWA for development of industrial infrastructure facilities

(residential, commercial, industrial etc.) and to quash the FWA

besides directing an enquiry to be conducted by Central Bureau

of Investigation10.      That challenge was rejected by the Division

Bench of the High Court vide judgment and order dated

21.9.1998 in Writ Petition No. 29221/1997 11 and which decision

came to be affirmed by this Court on 26.3.1999 in SLP(C) No.

4922/1999, dismissing the said special leave petition in limine.
</p>


<p id="p_7">4.    The second round of litigation was at the instance of J.C.
</p>
<p id="p_8">Madhuswamy and Srirama Reddy, again a public interest

litigation to question the land acquisition proceedings initiated by

the State for implementation of the Project. The main grouse in

this petition was about excess land being acquired for real estate

purpose near Bangalore at interchange areas to pass on the

benefit to the Project Proponents and illegal sale of land for

construction of Bangalore Exhibition Centre. The group of writ

petitions raising aforementioned challenge being Writ Petition

Nos. 45334/2004 (GM­RES­PIL), 45386/2004 (PIL­LA­KIADB)

and 48981/2004 (GM­RES­PIL) came to be disposed of by the

Division Bench of the High Court vide judgment and order dated

3.5.2005, resulting in dismissal of stated writ petitions and

issuance of a direction to the State to continue to implement the

Project.    That decision was affirmed by this Court in State of

Karnataka &amp; Anr. Vs. All India Manufacturers Organisation

&amp; Ors.12.

under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_3">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> in the course of

</p>

<p id="p_15">7.    The present (fifth) round of litigation, however is by the

Project Proponents themselves, who had applied to the Planning

Authority for grant of permission for construction of group

housing scheme at the stated location(s). That permission having

been rejected on 7.2.2015, subject writ petitions were filed before

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      6</span>


the High Court, which have been disposed of by the common

judgment and order dated 15.10.2019 of the Division Bench, in

the following terms: ­

                                   “ORDER


</p><p id="p_16">        (i)    Writ petitions are allowed.

<p id="p_17">        (ii)  Communication bearing No. BMICAPA/339/Praa.
        Pra. Pa/1541/20 11­12 dated 07.02.2015 (Annexure­A)

        expeditiously and at any rate, within an outer limit of 6
        weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order.
</p><p id="p_19">        (iv)   Costs made easy.”


</p><p id="p_20">8.   Considering the fact that this is the fifth round of litigation

before this Court and that the importance of the Project has

already been taken note of in the earlier decisions, we deem it

apposite to confine to the factual matrix essential to answer the

matters in issue in reference to the relief granted by the High

Court vide impugned judgment.
</p>

<p id="p_21">9.   Shorn of unnecessary details, the State and the NICE had

executed the FWA on 3.4.1997, setting out various terms for the

purposes of developing the proposed infrastructure corridor. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                        7</span>


FWA was followed by supplementary agreements dated 6.10.1999

and     31.3.2000       between   the       same   parties.      Besides   the

supplementary agreements, a Tripartite Agreement was executed

between the State, NICE and NECE on 9.8.2002.
</p>

<p id="p_22">10. The FWA delineates the location(s)/areas where the five self­

sustaining Townships were to be set up.                       The subsequent

agreements between the State and the Project Proponents do not

alter the substance of that dispensation.                 The FWA makes

reference to provisions in the PTR in respect of certain matters.
</p>

<p id="p_23">11. Indeed, the Outline Development Plan 14/Master Plan was

prepared by the Planning Authority for the new planning area on

12.2.2004 and had received approval of the State. However, the

ODP/Master Plan was not intended to materially change or alter

the location(s) for Townships specified in the FWA.
</p>

<p id="p_24">12. The State in exercise of its powers under the Karnataka

Town and Country Planning Act, 196115, made amendments to

the Zonal Regulations of ODP/Master Plan of various towns and

cities permitting the single plot usage for residential purpose

subject to certain conditions vide notification dated 10.3.2006.

</p><p id="p_26">13. In the backdrop of the stated agreements, ODP/Master Plan

and the amendment to Zonal Regulations of ODP/Master Plan,

the Project Proponents submitted an application on 6.1.2012 to

the Planning Authority for sanction of group housing scheme in

53 acres 5 guntas of land, which included lands transferred to

the Project Proponents under sale deeds and notified under

Section 28(4) of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act,

196616.
</p>

<p id="p_27">14. Later       on, the         Project Proponents submitted modified

development plan on 5.5.2012 for permission to set up group

housing scheme in 42 acres 30 guntas of land by excluding the

lands in respect of which no sale deed was executed in their

favour. The Planning Authority vide letter dated 28.5.2012 called

upon the Project Proponents to furnish certain documents,

namely, sketches, No Objection Certificates (NOCs), detailed

project report etc., since in its view, the application submitted by

the Project Proponents was defective in that regard.             The

Planning Authority also moved a proposal to place the matter for

approval before the High­Level/Empowered Committee.
</p>


<p id="p_28">16 For short, “the KIADA Act”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  9</span>


</p><p id="p_29">15. The Project Proponents submitted the clarifications and

documents in support of the modified development plan vide

communication dated 6.6.2012 and 5.7.2012.            The Planning

Authority, however, vide letter dated 17.7.2012 called upon the

Project Proponents to furnish more documents i.e. RTCs,

clarification pertaining to the possession over the proposed land

and NOC for water supply in support of their application. The

Project Proponents claimed to have submitted NOC received from

the Karnataka Fire and Emergency Services Department on

10.9.2012.
</p>

<p id="p_30">16. The Planning Authority in its 34th General Meeting convened

on 12.9.2012 resolved that the application of the Project

Proponents    be    placed   before    the   High­Level/Empowered

Committee for decision. As a consequence of this resolution, the

Planning Authority vide letter dated 3.11.2012 directed the

Project Proponents to stop work on proposed lands till a decision

was taken by the High­Level/Empowered Committee, having

noticed that some unauthorised road construction activity was

being carried out by the Project Proponents.          The Planning

Authority    had   thus   kept   the   modified   development   plan
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                 10</span>


submitted by the Project Proponents in abeyance till the decision

of the High­Level/Empowered Committee.
</p>

<p id="p_31">17. Once again, the Planning Authority vide letter dated

15.1.2013 directed the Project Proponents to stop unauthorised

work of construction of road, laying of water pipeline and

electricity cables in the concerned area.         In response, on

23.3.2013, the Project Proponents requested the Planning

Authority    to   issue   necessary   approvals    (Commencement

Certificates) against their request letters including letter dated

5.5.2012.    The Planning Authority vide letter dated 30.4.2013,

informed the Project Proponents that appropriate decision would

be taken on the modified development plan dated 5.5.2012 only

after the decision of the High­Level/Empowered Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_32">Accordingly, the Project Proponents were once again asked to

stop all construction activities until final decision on the proposal

was taken.
</p>

<p id="p_33">18. The Project Proponents then filed Writ Petition Nos. 57249­

57250/2013 (GM­RES) and 57266­57267/2013 (GM­RES) before

the High Court for quashing of the decision of the Planning

Authority taken in its 34th General Meeting held on 12.9.2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                   11</span>


and instead to grant approval in reference to the modified

development plan dated 5.5.2012. The Project Proponents had

also sought a declaration that the approvals were deemed to have

been granted in terms of Section 15(2) of the KTCP Act and to

direct the Planning Authority to forthwith issue Commencement

Certificate in reference to the application dated 5.5.2012.
</p>

<p id="p_34">19. When the said writ petitions were pending, the Principal

Secretary, Public Works, Ports and Inland Water Transport

Department of the State, vide letter dated 19.12.2013, directed

the Planning Authority to await the decision of the High­

Level/Empowered Committee constituted under the FWA before

considering the request of the Project Proponents, which would

involve    change    of   land   use    and   approval   of   residential

developments.       On 25.6.2014, the Planning Authority issued

notice under Section 15(4) of the KTCP Act to the Project

Proponents directing, inter alia, to refrain from taking up the

development works at the proposed sites and to remove the

works already done and restore the land to its original form.
</p>

<p id="p_35">20. The writ petitions filed by the Project Proponents being Writ

Petition   Nos.     57249­57250/2013          (GM­RES)   and     57266­
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                               12</span>


57267/2013 (GM­RES) came to be disposed of on 16.12.2014

recording the statement of the counsel for the Planning Authority

that appropriate decision would be taken on the modified

development plan dated 5.5.2012 submitted by the Project

Proponents expeditiously. The High Court directed the Planning

Authority to send appropriate communication to the Project

Proponents by 15.3.2015.
</p>

<p id="p_36">21. Before the decision was taken by the Planning Authority,

the Project Proponents submitted their response to the notice

dated 25.6.2014 issued by the Planning Authority under Section

15(4) of the KTCP Act, on 6.1.2015. The Planning Authority took

decision on 7.2.2015 on the application filed by the Project

Proponents dated 5.5.2012 regarding the modified plan for group

housing scheme. The Planning Authority rejected that proposal,

for the reasons noted in the communication dated 7.2.2015,

                                             BMICAPA, Bangalore.”

The above communication was assailed by the Project Proponents

before the High Court and it was prayed that a writ be issued

directing    the   Planning     Authority    to   grant    Commencement

Certificate for the proposed group housing scheme. Those writ

petitions [Writ Petition Nos. 16576­16577/2015 and 18481­

18491/2015 (GM­RES)] have been disposed of by the Division

Bench of the High Court vide impugned judgment.
</p>

<p id="p_47">22. The High Court, after considering the stand taken by both

the   sides,       formulated      three    points/questions        for   its

consideration, as noted in the impugned judgment, which read

thus: ­

          “9…..
</p><p id="p_48">          (1)    Whether writ petitions are liable to be dismissed on
          the ground of same not being maintainable as it relates to
          discharge of contractual obligations between the
          petitioner and third respondent?
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                     OR
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                            15</span>


              Whether writ petitions are liable to be dismissed on the
              ground of FWA providing for redressal of grievances of
              petitioner to be routed through High Level Committee?
              (2)    Whether     communication      dated    07.02.2015
              ­Annexure­A issued by first respondent rejecting the
              prayer of the petitioner for approval of development plan
              for group housing in the Sy.Nos. indicated therein is liable
              to be upheld or quashed?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              (3)       What order?”

At the outset, the High Court, while considering point No. 1, dealt

with the argument regarding maintainability of writ petitions. It

referred to the decisions of this Court in <a href="/doc/884513/" id="a_4">Tata Cellular vs.

Union         of        India17</a>,   <a href="/doc/952082/" id="a_5">Raunaq    International      Ltd.    vs.   IVR

Construction Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>.18, <a href="/doc/1371839/" id="a_6">Association of Registration

Plates vs. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>.19 and <a href="/doc/187501619/" id="a_7">Michigan Rubber

(India) Limited vs. State of Karnataka &amp; Ors</a>.20. Thereafter,

the High Court proceeded to observe as follows: ­

              ‘‘15. At the outset it requires to be noticed that
              petitioners are seeking for quashing of the communication
              dated 07.02.2015 (Annexure­A) addressed to the
              petitioners whereunder the approval of the plan for Group
              Housing which requires to be approved by BMIC­first
              respondent has been rejected. A perusal of the said
              communication would clearly disclose that nowhere first
              respondent has either contended or whispered about non
              consideration of the application submitted by the
              petitioners on the ground of petitioners having sought for
              enforcement of a contractual obligation or on the ground
              FWA providing for mechanism to enable the petitioners to

17   (1994)   6   SCC   651
18   (1999)   1   SCC   492
19   (2005)   1   SCC   679
20   (2012)   8   SCC   216
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                            16</span>


work out their right as per said mechanism. On the other
hand, first respondent by virtue of the said authority
being the planning authority empowered under the FWA
to grant approval, has examined the prayer of the
petitioners for approval of the plan for group housing and
has rejected the same by assigning five (5) specific
reasons. It is nowhere stated said application of petitioner
is not being considered on account of petitioner is
attempting to enforce a contractual obligation or said
application has to be placed before High Level/Power
Committee. Thus, prima facie contention of third
respondent with regard to maintainability of the writ
petitions cannot be accepted.
</blockquote><p id="p_49">16. In fact, petitioners herein had approached this
Court in W.P. No. 57429­50/2013 and connected matters
at the first instance when first respondent had resolved to
refer said application to High Level Committee
whereunder this Court had disposed of the writ petition
by order dated 16.12.2014 based on stand by counsel
appearing for BMIC therein undertaking to consider the
application on merits. In said proceedings third
respondent herein was a party and in fact, no
statement of objections had been filed by the third
respondent raising contention now raised and thereby
it would clearly indicate that third respondent is
attempting to improvise its stand stage by stage and
step by step.
</p><p id="p_50">17. In the instant case, petitioner has impugned the
communication       dated     07.02.2005      (Annexure­A)
whereunder application filed by the petitioner for approval
of Group Housing has been rejected and said right of the
petitioner to seek approval stems out of the FWA entered
into between the petitioner and GOK and the
consequential agreements. It is agreed between the
parties that under clause 3.1.1 it is the obligation of the
GOK to use its best efforts to grant and cause its
Governmental Instrumentalities, Government of India and
its instrumentalities to grant, all approvals required in
connection with the Infrastructure Corridor project
including the approvals indicated in Schedule II of FWA.
The approval under the Town and Country Planning Act,
1961 has been referred at Sl. No. 15 of Schedule II.
Respondents ­ 1 and 2 being the statutory authority
conferred with the power under the Karnataka Town and
Country Planning Act to accord approval for the
"Proposed Development Plan" submitted by the petitioner,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                              17</span>


they are required to examine the application filed by
petitioner for Group Housing and approve or reject said
plan in accordance with the statutory provisions. In fact,
petitioner by its communication dated 03.07.2014
(Annexure­H13) addressed to first respondent has
contended that on account of development plan for Group
Housing having not been approved, <a href="/doc/1228205/" id="a_8">Section 15</a> which is a
deeming provision under the Town and Country Planning
Act, 1961 would be applicable. In other words,
petitioner has sought for enforcement of statutory
right. As such, the contention of respondents that
petitioner has to avail the remedy available under
clause 4.1.2 of FWA cannot be accepted. At the cost of
repetition, it requires to be noticed that when the
application of the petitioner for grant of approval of Group
Housing was not disposed of by first respondent,
petitioner had approached this Court in W.P. Nos. 57249­
250/2013 and 57266­267/2013 which came to be
disposed of by the Division Bench by order dated
16.12.2014 (Annexure­J) in the light of statement made
by the Planning Authority namely, first respondent
herein. The statement so made which came to be recorded
by the Division Bench in the said writ petitions reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "2. Before the petitions could be heard on
      merits, a statement is proposed to be made
      for BMICAPA, which being acceptable to the
      petitioners, the petitions are to be disposed of
      in terms of the statement as under:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">            "The applications dated 05.05.2012 and
            21.04.2013 (both at Annexure­F in each
            set of petitions) shall be considered by
            the BMICAPA within a period of three
            months and the decisions thereon shall
            be communicated to the petitioners by
            the BMICAPA on or before 15.03.2015".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      3. Accordingly, making the above statement,
      the order of the Court, by consent, the
      petitions are disposed of in the aforesaid
      terms, with no order as to costs. Since none
      of the contentions of the parties are
      considered or pressed at this stage, the rights
      and contentions of the parties remain open to
      be agitated, if need be, in future."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                               (emphasis supplied by
      us)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                             18</span>


</blockquote><p id="p_51">18. In the said writ petitions, GOK was also represented
by the Special Government Advocate and the statement
made by the first respondent in the said proceedings
would clearly indicate that application of the petitioner
was required to be considered under the provisions of the
Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act, 1961 and as
such, it came to be considered on merits and has been
rejected on five (5) grounds as already noticed
hereinabove. Hence, these writ petitions being
dismissed on the ground of petitioner having remedy
under the FWA does not arise. Petitioner having
sought to enforce statutory right as well as the
impugned communication stemming out of FWA being
challenged on the ground of misuse of statutory
powers by the respondent ­ authorities, contention
raised with regard to maintainability of writ petitions
is to be necessarily held as untenable and said
contention is liable to be rejected.
</p><p id="p_52">19. It would not be out of context to state that the very
same      petitioner  had     sought   for    issuance     of
commencement certificate for residential layout plan
relating to land measuring 14 acres 35 guntas in Sy. No.
27/2A of Kommaghatta village, Kengeri Hobli, Bangalore
South Taluk and 17 acres 39 guntas in Sy. Nos. 164/4(P),
164/5, 165P, 166P, 167/1P, 168(P), 241(P), 242(P),
247(P), 248(P), 252(P) of Kengeri village, Kengeri Hobli,
Bangalore South Taluk enclosing therewith layout plan.
Since portions of land in Sy. No. 27/2A measuring 7.27
acres was reflected in ODP as Park, Open space/Traffic
and transportation/agricultural, petitioners herein sought
for change of land use and as such, petitioners had
requested first respondent ­ authority herein to
recommend to the Government for change of land use.
This request was turned down by first respondent by its
decision taken at its 33rd General Meeting held on
29.05.2012 and first respondent had resolved to place the
matter before High Level/Empowered Committee. Being
aggrieved by said decision, petitioner herein approached
this Court in W.P. Nos. 37298­299/2013 and Division
Bench by order dated 22.11.2013 allowed the said writ
petition on the ground first respondent being the Planning
Authority is bound to take its decision in accordance with
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_9">Section 14A</a> of the Act. Further direction was also issued
to first respondent to consider the request of petitioner for
change of land use strictly in accordance with the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_10">Section 14A</a> of the Act. Similar direction had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                   19</span>


       also been issued to first respondent by Division Bench of
       this Court in W.P. Nos. 37300­301/2013 by order dated
       22.11.2013. In the said writ petitions, State namely, third
       respondent herein had been arrayed as second
       respondent and was represented by learned Advocate and
       in the said writ petitions, there was no plea raised with
       regard to maintainability of said writ petitions. As such,
       third respondent herein cannot be permitted to raise
       said ground in these writ petitions by attempting to
       improve its case step by step. Even otherwise, on
       merits also, we have held said contention not being
       tenable for the reasons already recorded.
</p><p id="p_53">       20. That apart, contract in question also having
       element of public interest, we are of the considered
       view that writ petitions are maintainable and as such,
       contention raised regarding non­maintainability of
       writ petitions stands rejected.’’
                                             (emphasis supplied)

The High Court then considered point No. 2 and by referring to

clause 1.1.3 in the Tripartite Agreement dated 9.8.2002, held

that it was a clear admission of the State that stage­1 of the

infrastructure corridor would include 10 (ten) interchanges and

Townships. On that basis, the High Court held that the Planning

Authority ought not to entertain any doubt regarding the

Townships being established at the interchanges. Further, the

High Court in the first round of litigation in H.T. Somashekar

Reddy (supra) had held that Townships can be established by

the Project Proponents under the FWA. It extracted paragraph

66 of the said decision in support thereof. The High Court then
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                     20</span>


examined the first ground on which the application dated

5.5.2012 was rejected by the Planning Authority and observed

thus: ­

          “23. The Outline Development Plan (for short 'ODP')
          came to be approved by the Government of Karnataka on
          12.02.2002 as per Annexures­L and L­1 respectively and
          same would indicate that area proposed by the petitioner
          for putting up residential buildings would fall within
          yellow zone/residential zone and thereby plan submitted
          by petitioner is in compliance with the zoning regulations
          and permitted under the ODP. In fact, plan submitted by
          petitioner along with application dated 05.05.2012, as
          rightly pointed out by Sri. D.L.N. Rao, learned Senior
          Counsel appearing for petitioner when juxtapositioned
          with the ODP, it would clearly demonstrate that plan
          submitted by the petitioner is in conformity with the
          zoning regulations. In fact, Hon'ble Apex Court by its
          order dated 03.11.2009 passed in C.P. No. 96/2007 has
          directed that project should be completed as per the ODP
          dated 12.02.2004.
</p><p id="p_54">          24. Under FWA Clauses 3.1.1, 3.2.3, 3.2.5 and 3.2.6 it
          is incumbent upon Government of Karnataka (for short
          'GOK') to make best efforts to grant and cause its
          instrumentalities all approvals required in connection
          with project including approvals specified under Schedule
          2 of the agreement whereunder it is clearly specified that
          "petitioner would receive the requisite permissions,
          approvals, sanctions and/or licences...." under the Acts
          and Rules of GOI and GOK as specified thereunder. This
          would also include granting approval under Karnataka
          Town and Country Planning Act, 1961. In fact, under
          Clause 3.2.3 it is agreed that GOK would not restrict
          the use of land in any way and petitioner would have
          freedom and discretion to develop and use the land as
          generally contemplated by the agreement and it would
          also be incumbent upon the GOK to zone and re­zone
          and caused to be done in a manner consistent with
          use in the infrastructure project as contemplated
          under the agreement and under Clause 3.2.5 it is
          understood by GOK that development of townships
          would have many components and take many forms
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                 21</span>


       including the industries, businesses and services
       contemplated in Schedule 4 of FWA.
</p><p id="p_55">       25. In the light of above findings, contention raised
       by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for
       respondent No. 3 with regard to petitioners could not
       have approached the first respondent directly for plan
       approval on the ground that all approvals required in
       connection with the infrastructure corridor project
       had to be granted by the High Level Empowered
       committee consisting of members from each affected
       ministries of GOK, would not hold water and complete
       answer to such technical plea being raised has been
       laid to rest by the Hon'ble Apex Court in its judgment
       rendered on 20.04.2006 in the matter of <a href="/doc/348205/" id="a_11">STATE OF
       KARNATAKA         AND   OTHERS     vs.    ALL     INDIA
       MANUFACTURERS ORGANIZATION</a> reported in (2006)
       4 SCC 683 whereunder it has been held to the
       following effect:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">             "In the future also, we make it clear that
             while the State Government and its
             instrumentalities are entitled to exercise
             their contractual rights under the FWA,
             they must do so fairly, reasonably and
             without malafides; in the event they do
             not do so, the Court will be entitled to
             interfere with the same."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       Hence,     first     ground       on which plan
       approval/permission has been refused cannot be
       sustained and it is liable to be rejected and
       accordingly it stands rejected.’’
                                           (emphasis supplied)

</blockquote><p id="p_56">23. The High Court then examined the second ground in the

impugned communication dated 7.2.2015 and observed that the

document was never demanded by the Planning Authority.
</p>

<p id="p_57">24. While dealing with the third ground, in the impugned

communication, it noted that the entire cost of acquisition of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                22</span>


land in question and implementation of the project, was to be

borne and carried out by the Project Proponents. The State, on

issuing notification under Section 4A(1) of the KTCP Act on

13.7.1999, had notified the appellant No. 1 (in C.A. Nos. 2116­

2128/2020) to be a separate Planning Authority for the

infrastructure corridor in question.     And that Authority had

prepared ODP/Master Plan for the new planning area. Relying

on the observations in All India Manufacturers Organisation

(supra), the High Court opined that the lands have been acquired

for the Project which is an integrated infrastructure project and

not limited only to construction of road as indicated in the

impugned communication. It once again relied on clause 1.1.3 of

the Tripartite Agreement and also the communication dated

19.12.2013 and noted that it was not open to the Cabinet to

unilaterally cancel the Tripartite Agreement dated 9.8.2002.      It

then noticed the amendment of Section 2(7a) of the KIADA Act,

which defines “industrial infrastructural facilities”. It then moved

over to consider the issue about return of the subject lands to the

State Government after 30 years and for that, referred to the

recitals in the sale deeds. The High Court held that it is agreed

between the parties that what is to be transferred back is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                    23</span>


“Transferred Toll Road Assets”, as defined in the FWA on

completion of the concession period. As regards the “Transferred

Township Assets”, clause 7.2 of the FWA was adverted to and it

concluded as follows: ­

        ‘‘37.   A plain reading of expression "Transferred Toll
        Road Assets", "Transferred Township Assets", along with
        Clause 6.8 of FWA, it would indicate that petitioner has
        to transfer to GOK at the end of concession period,
        "Transferred Toll Road Assets" upon terms and conditions
        mutually agreed by the parties as set forth in Clause 6.8.
        Thus, there is no ad­idem between the parties with
        regard to townships being transferred by the
        petitioner to GOK. Under Schedule 5 it is more
        specifically indicated as to the assets, which are to be

                                           (emphasis supplied)

The High Court thereafter adverted to the ODP/Master Plan

prepared by the Planning Authority and opined that it defines the

developmental activities to be carried out at the interchanges.
</p>
<p id="p_61">After extracting the relevant portion thereof and adverting to the

correspondence between the Public Works Department (PWD) of

the State and the Planning Authority and the discussion during

the 34th General Meeting of the Planning Authority, the High

Court concluded that interchange areas at link road and

peripheral road are permitted for residential developments as per

the FWA.   It then went on to consider the argument of “single

plot” and held that the plan submitted by the Project Proponents
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                25</span>


was in respect of one single plot, wherein they had proposed to

develop group housing block wise.      The High Court was also

impressed by the argument of the Project Proponents that the

Department of Town and Country Planning in respect of these

very Project Proponents had granted approval for residential

layout in Survey No. 15/1 (part), 16 &amp; 18 (part) measuring 15

acres 38½ guntas at Varashansandra Village, Kengeri Hobli,

Bangalore North Taluk for allotting sites to land losers followed

by issuance of Commencement Certificate dated 7.3.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_62">Therefore, the High Court went on to observe that it would not lie

in the mouth of the Planning Authority to approbate and

reprobate on the same subject matter.         The High Court also

adverted to the permissions accorded by the Planning Authority

for setting up housing scheme by private persons nearby

interchanges. After referring to those instances, the High Court

concluded that the Planning Authority was adopting policy of

pick and choose for grant of approval or sanction.
</p>

<p id="p_63">25. As    regards   the   fourth     ground    in    the   impugned

communication, the same was also overturned on the finding

that the Authority committed factual error in that regard. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                26</span>


High Court opined that the plan submitted by the Project

Proponents did not violate any condition.
</p>

<p id="p_64">26. Resultantly, the High Court was pleased to set aside the

impugned      communication    dated   7.2.2015    rejecting   the

application preferred by the Project Proponents for permission to

construct group housing scheme at the location(s) referred to in

the application dated 5.5.2012 and issued a direction to the

Planning Authority to grant Commencement Certificate as sought

by the Project Proponents.
</p>

<p id="p_65">27. Feeling aggrieved, the Planning Authority and the State have

filed separate appeals by special leave, assailing the impugned

judgment.     The thrust of assail is that the High Court has

completely undermined the scheme of the FWA, which was

binding on the Project Proponents and the State.      The Project

Proponents could develop the project only as per the specified

components of the Project.      The FWA was founded on the

extensive exercise of holistic development of the area as recorded

in the PTR.    The theme of the PTR was duly deliberated at

different levels and eventually an informed decision was taken by

the Authority to implement the report (PTR) subject to certain
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                27</span>


changes and modifications. Consistent with such decision, the

FWA was executed between the Project Proponents and the State.
</p>
<p id="p_66">The terms and conditions set out in the FWA, are self­contained.
</p>
<p id="p_67">The parties (Project Proponents and the State) are bound to

comply with the same in its letter and spirit. The essence of the

FWA can be traced to the recitals therein. To wit, the Project was

necessitated to achieve an orderly development of Bangalore as a

major industrial, commercial and residential city in the manner

prescribed.   The contours of development work have been

delineated in such a manner so as to ensure amongst other

things, self­sustaining townships, expressways, utilities and

amenities, including power plants, industrial plants, water

treatment plants and other infrastructural developments, as

referred to in the PTR dated August, 1995, as amended.        The

development work was to promote industrial, commercial and

economic activities, so as to generate new job opportunities for

the residents in and around the infrastructure corridor, promote

tourism, decongest traffic in Bangalore and Mysore, ensure

smooth and safer traffic between Bangalore and Mysore and

provide a world class expressway between the two cities.      The

utility of the land that would be offered by the State for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                 28</span>


Project was clearly defined and prioritised.   The Project was to

consist of a limited­access toll expressway; electric power

transmission     line;   water    pipeline;    and   fibre    optic

telecommunications cabling including construction of southern

section of the Bangalore City Outer Peripheral Road connecting

National Highway (NH)­7 and National Highway (NH)­4.          As a

limited­access expressway with a continuous barrier on either

side, the road would prevent ribbon development, increase

efficiency of individual travel and cargo movement, and improve

vehicle safety. Originally, seven “Township” areas in the entire

project were earmarked and clearly identified, but after due

consideration of all aspects, it was decided to reduce the number

of “Townships” to only five, identified as Townships 1, 2, 4, 5 and

7 in the PTR. The “possible business and services” of the Project

have been articulated in Schedule 4 of the FWA to include real

estate and housing as one of the activities.
</p>

<p id="p_68">28. According to the appellants, the proposal submitted by the

Project Proponents was for development of group housing

scheme.   That was not in accord with the usage of the land

specified in the FWA and the relevant specifications in the PTR.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                               29</span>


<p id="p_69">The PTR as well as FWA recognise development of “Townships”

and not group housing scheme as such. The two concepts are

materially different. Further, the subject proposal to construct

group housing scheme was in area other than the identified five

Townships in the FWA and the PTR, which was not permissible in

terms of the FWA. Besides, the proposal submitted by the Project

Proponents vide communication dated 5.5.2012 to develop group

housing scheme in the stated area also did not include other

components required to be constructed and provided for in the

Townships. Being a deviation of the FWA, it was essential for the

Project Proponents to first take permission of the State, as

provided in the FWA, which could be granted on the basis of the

opinion of the “Empowered Committee”.       Until grant of such

permission, it was not open to the Project Proponents to maintain

any application or submit proposal directly to the Planning

Authority merely on the basis of the ODP/Master Plan and the

municipal laws concerning the town planning scheme under the

KTCP Act. It is urged that the High Court posed wrong questions

to itself and proceeded to answer the same, that too in a manner

which is untenable and founded on erroneous assumptions.
</p>
<p id="p_70">Despite the limited relief claimed by the Project Proponents, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                30</span>


High Court went ahead with the issue of validity of the Cabinet

decision of the State in respect of the tripartite agreement. That

was uncalled for.   Similarly, it proceeded to answer the issue

regarding the “single plot” which ought to have been left for

consideration of the competent authority.
</p>

<p id="p_71">29. In substance, the argument of the appellant is that in

absence of prior permission of the State regarding deviation from

the FWA, it was not open to the Planning Authority to process the

application/proposal   under    consideration.     Nor   such   an

application could be treated as a valid application by the

Planning Authority, for the purpose of Section 15 of the KTCP Act

regarding deemed permission.         It is urged that the proposal

submitted by the Project Proponents, if accepted, would result in

allowing development on the toll road or at toll road interchanges,

which cannot be made part of the Townships in view of the

express provision in that regard in the FWA. In case the Project

Proponents were not in agreement with the stipulations in the

FWA or the conditions specified by the competent authority of the

State, they could resort to remedy of resolution of disputes

provided for in the FWA itself, before the Committee or by way of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                      31</span>


arbitration, as the case may be. However, the Project Proponents

could not have directly approached the Planning Authority for

grant of permission and the High Court for issue of writ of

mandamus against the Planning Authority. In other words, no

relief could be granted to the Project Proponents unless the State

had agreed to the deviation. Significantly, the State had advised

the Planning Authority vide letter dated 19.12.2013 pointing out

that, before taking any decision with respect to change in land

use and approving residential complex, decision of Empowered

Committee constituted under the FWA be obtained. It is urged

that    the    Project      Proponents     were   conscious   about    their

obligations.      That is manifest from the letter sent by NICE to

Executive Member of the Karnataka Industrial Development

Board21, dated 6.1.1998, including from the stand taken by them

before the High Court in different proceedings. It is also urged

that the PTR and the FWA clearly provide for the sequence of

implementation and execution of the Project and it is open to the

State to insist for execution of Project strictly in that order. The

Project    Proponents        cannot   be    allowed   to   disregard   these

obligations.
</p>

<p id="p_72">21 For short, “the KIADB”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                32</span>


</p><p id="p_73">30. It is further urged that the logic invoked by the High Court

is, to say the least, unstatable.    Inasmuch as, merely because

“Housing” is mentioned in “Real Estate” column in Schedule 4, it

would not follow that the other components of the “Townships”

specified in the FWA and the PTR are dispensed with. On the

other hand, the FWA, if read as a whole alongwith the relevant

stipulations in PTR referred to in FWA, it would be evident that

the Project ought to be implemented in the manner specified

therein including the establishment of Townships.       Housing

scheme would only be one of the components of the “Townships”

to be constructed at the designated location of the five

Townships. That the lands on which development was proposed

were allotted to the Project Proponents for implementation of the

Project only as per the FWA with obligation to retransfer the

“Transferred Toll Road Assets” back to the State. This has been

completely misinterpreted by the High Court. Further, the High

Court was more impressed by the fact that in the earlier writ

petition filed by the Project Proponents, the Planning Authority

had agreed to consider the modified proposal dated 5.5.2012

submitted by the Project Proponents. The assurance so given by

the Planning Authority cannot be the basis to disregard the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                33</span>


binding obligations of the Project Proponents flowing from the

FWA regarding the manner in which the Project should be taken

forward.
</p>

<p id="p_74">31. The appellants urge that the fact that permissions were

granted by the Planning Authority in respect of the neighbouring

lands of private persons for construction of group housing

complex or for that matter given to the Project Proponents in

respect of some other area, cannot be the basis to disregard the

obligations flowing from the FWA and the PTR.        The housing

scheme to be constructed by the Project Proponents must be in

the designated areas/location(s) specified as “Townships” and

only in the manner specified in the FWA and the PTR. For, the

FWA refers to the PTR in some measure, and by such reference

the stipulations and specifications regarding the execution of the

Project given in the PTR would get incorporated in the FWA to

that extent. The Project Proponents are obliged to adhere to all

such stipulations.
</p>

<p id="p_75">32. Concededly, the right of the Project Proponents flows from

the FWA and is circumscribed by the same. If proposed deviation

is to be ignored, the whole purpose for which the Project has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                34</span>


been conceived, will be defeated. It would not be a development,

as planned in the PTR and approved in the FWA. It is, therefore,

not open to the Project Proponents to rely on general provisions

applicable to other lands in the neighbourhood not covered by

the FWA. It is urged that it is essential to keep in mind that the

private land is made available to the Project Proponents by the

State after acquiring it from land owners for implementation and

execution of the Project. The regional or the zonal plan showing

the entire area as yellow zone being residential, would, therefore,

be of no avail to the Project Proponents. The Project Proponents

cannot be heard to say that unless they are permitted to develop

group housing scheme, it would not be possible for them to

finance the Project, inasmuch as, the manner of financing the

Project and generation of revenue is already specified in the FWA.
</p>
<p id="p_76">It is urged that in any case, the High Court exceeded its

jurisdiction in issuing mandamus against the Planning Authority,

directing to issue Commencement Certificate, as sought by the

Project Proponents vide modified proposal dated 5.5.2012.
</p>

<p id="p_77">33. The Project Proponents, on the other hand, would reiterate

the stand taken by them before the High Court and which had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                               35</span>


found favour with the High Court.      According to the Project

Proponents, the High Court in the facts of the present case, was

justified in not only quashing the communication issued by the

Planning Authority, dated 7.2.2015, but also directing the

Planning Authority to issue Commencement Certificate, as

prayed in terms of the modified proposal dated 5.5.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_78">According to them, the State authorities including the Planning

Authority have been obstructing the implementation of the

Project, which has been approved long back and elucidated in the

FWA dated 3.4.1997. The group housing scheme is one of the

activities clearly permitted by the FWA. And being a permissible

activity, it was unnecessary for the Project Proponents to

approach the State or the Empowered Committee, as the case

may be. As a matter of fact, the Empowered Committee is not a

statutory Committee.   It is only a facilitation Committee under

the FWA to ensure smooth implementation of the Project. In any

case,   the   four   grounds   articulated   in   the   impugned

communication dated 7.2.2015 issued by the Planning Authority,

make no reference to the requirement of obtaining prior approval
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                36</span>


from the State or the Empowered Committee. The State cannot

be heard to raise any objection in that regard in the present

proceedings, as it did not raise the same in the earlier writ

petition filed by the Project Proponents bearing Writ Petition Nos.
</p>
<p id="p_79">57249­57250/2013 (GM­RES) and 57266­57267/2013 (GM­

RES), to which it was made party. In fact, an order was passed

on the basis of the assurance given by the Planning Authority

that it would consider the modified proposal submitted by the

Project Proponents on 5.5.2012 within specified time. According

to the Project Proponents, the reasons recorded by the High

Court are in the context of the arguments canvassed before it and

invited by the parties.
</p>

<p id="p_80">34. It is urged that the entire action of the Planning Authority

and the stand taken by the State is replete with mala fides. This

Court even on the earlier occasion, had taken notice of the

obstructions    created   by   the   State   authorities   in   the

implementation of the Project, as can be discerned from the

observations in All India Manufacturers Organisation (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_81">It is urged that the Project Proponents were not invoking the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                   37</span>


deeming provision, but have pursued grounds to assail the

reasons stated by the Planning Authority in the impugned

communication dated 7.2.2015.           The High Court dealt with all

the four grounds noted by the Planning Authority in the

impugned communication and justly concluded that the same

were unsustainable.         Having said that, the High Court was

justified in issuing direction to the Planning Authority for grant of

Commencement Certificate, as it was satisfied that no fruitful

purpose would have been served by relegating the Project

Proponents before the same (Planning) Authority.             For, it was

determined to create obstruction in the implementation of the

Project.    It is urged that the Planning Authority having issued

ODP/Master Plan, was obliged to process the modified proposal

submitted by the Project Proponents on that basis. The land use

categorised in ODP/Master Plan refers to outer peripheral road

including the land reserved for interchanges.            The High Court

had considered this aspect and accepted the stand of the Project

Proponents that it is clear from perusal of the ODP/Master Plan

that the land in question can be used for various purposes

including    residential,    commercial,    industrial    developments,

which would be in consonance with clause 3.2.3 of the FWA. It is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                               38</span>


urged that the Project Proponents had agreed to undertake and

carry on the construction of group housing scheme in strict

compliance of the ODP/Master Plan. The Project Proponents are

also relying on the argument of the Advocate General of the State

of Karnataka, reproduced in paragraph 41 of the judgment of the

High Court in Writ Petition No. 3438/2010 dated 15.6.2011,

wherein it was pleaded on behalf of the State that the PTR was

only a proposal and the ODP­2004 was the approved alignment

of the road.   It is urged that the State having approved the

ODP/Master Plan, was bound to give effect thereto and cannot be

allowed to approbate and reprobate relying on the PTR/FWA. It

is contended that this Court in All India Manufacturers

Organisation (supra) had negatived the submission of the State

that 5119.37 acres of land was required for the toll road in the

PTR, however, in the FWA, the area was enhanced to 6999 acres.
</p>
<p id="p_82">It is urged that the PTR is not a sacrosanct document and the

parties accepted various modifications to the same.    It is also

urged that the State cannot be permitted to raise the same plea,

which would be otherwise hit by principles of constructive res

judicata.   According to the Project Proponents, the issue
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                39</span>


regarding the development of land reserved for “Townships” has

attained finality and cannot be raised again in light of the dictum

in All India Manufacturers Organisation (supra) including

dismissal of review petition raising the same ground now urged

by the State. Further, there is no infirmity in the view taken by

the High Court, much less regarding the direction issued vide the

impugned judgment.
</p>

<p id="p_83">35. We have heard Mr. C.A. Sundaram, learned senior counsel

for the appellant­Planning Authority, Mr. Chandra Uday Singh,

learned senior counsel for the State and Dr. Abhishek Manu

Singhvi and Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel for the

Project Proponents.
</p>

<p id="p_84">36. Considering the rival submissions, we are inclined to accept

the argument of the appellants that the High Court in paragraph

9 of the impugned judgment (reproduced in paragraph 22 of this

judgment), posed wrong questions to itself and that led to the

erroneous and untenable conclusion deduced by it.              The

fundamental issue is: whether the subject modified plan

submitted by the Project Proponents directly to the Planning

Authority for approval is replete with deviations and/or violation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                    40</span>


of the stipulations and specifications in the FWA? In that, the

FWA had circumscribed the user of the land in terms of the

location(s), as well as, the area thereof for implementation of the

Project. If so, was it imperative for the Project Proponents under

the FWA to obtain prior approval of the State including that of

the Empowered Committee? And if that was declined or granted

in part, should they take recourse to remedy of resolution of

disputes or through arbitration mechanism, as provided in the

FWA itself? If all these questions were to be answered in favour

of the Project Proponents, only then the Court could be called

upon to examine the justness of the four reasons recorded by the

Planning Authority. The High Court, in our opinion, hastened to

examine the justness of the reasons given by the Planning

Authority   for   rejecting   the   proposal,   vide   the   impugned

communication dated 7.2.2015.
</p>

<p id="p_85">37. For answering the matters in issue in proper perspective, it

would be essential to first understand the purpose of the

Integrated Infrastructure Corridor and Finance Project (the

Project). It was conceived and formalised to construct a privately

financed infrastructure corridor and seven new Townships
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                        41</span>


between Bangalore city and Mysore city in Karnataka State. The

Project also included construction of the southern section of the

Bangalore City Outer Peripheral Road.                     The infrastructure

corridor was to include a modern, four­lane (extendable to six­

lane)    limited     access   expressway;          potable     water,    sewage

treatment, and electric power transmission facilities; and fibre

optic communication cables. The southern section of the Outer

Peripheral Road was to link the infrastructure corridor with the

region’s entire highway network.              The report (PTR) plainly sets

out that the seven new Townships were to be organic, self­

sufficient communities, each with its own unique economic base

and directly served by the infrastructure corridor. All this would

fulfil   the   National   and   State         policy   goals   for   population

dispersion,        infrastructure   modernisation              and      economic

development,        and   inevitably,        economic    and    infrastructure

privatisation. As a limited­access expressway with a continuous

barrier on either side, the road was intended to prevent ribbon

development, increase efficiency of individual travel and cargo

movement, and improve vehicle safety. It also notes that it was

intended to provide access to existing and proposed Townships,

for which nine (9) interchanges were to be constructed along the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                    42</span>


length of the expressway. Location(s) of the interchanges, as well

as, the “Townships” area were clearly demarcated in the PTR.
</p>

       The expressway will bypass congested village roadways,
       eliminating conflict between inter­city and local traffic. By
       limiting access to the expressway and charging tolls, local
       traffic will be discouraged from using the corridor. As a
       result, the corridor will significantly reduce travel time
       between Bangalore and Mysore to about one and one­half
       hours. The design of the expressway will, to the greatest
       extent possible, maintain the travel patterns of the rural
       populace. For the most part, local cross roads, although
       separate from the expressway, will be maintained through
       the construction of bridges and culverts. Where crossing
       the expressway with a local roadway or cattle path is not
       feasible, local access roads will connect to nearby
       roadways that do cross the corridor. Bridges and

       will serve as cattle crossings during the dry season.
       The expressway and its facilities will be constructed of the
       best materials and implemented using state­of­the­art
       highway engineering and construction techniques. The
       expressway will be constructed to high standards of
       roadway safety with two marked lanes in each direction
       and divided by a wide landscaped median. The roadway
       alignment and pavement surface will be designed to
       ensure safe travel and a smooth ride. To achieve this
       objective, the expressway will be designed using innovative
       materials and construction techniques such as jointless
       cement concrete pavement. All bridges will be but of
       modern materials. The roadway surface will be graded to
       prevent water pooling and curves will be banked to
       enhance driving safety.”

regards the Townships development, the relevant portion of the

PTR reads thus: ­

        “TOWNSHIP DEVELOPMENT SUMMARY

        The Consortium proposes to design, acquire land for, and
        construct seven new townships as part of the Bangalore­
        Mysore Infrastructure Corridor. The townships will be
        developed entirely by the Consortium, including the
        provision of infrastructure municipal services, and
        recreation facilities. The creation of the new
        townships will provide significant benefits to
        Bangalore, Mysore, the investment corridor, and the
        entire state of Karnataka. The townships are being
        planned to be compatible with their environments.
        They will strengthen the rural agricultural economies
        of the area and maintain the stability of existing rural
        settlements.
</p>
<p id="p_95">        Each of the proposed townships has a unique identity
        determined by its economic base. The urban form,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                          44</span>


transportation network, and municipal services serve and
are guided by the basic purpose and theme of the
community. The proposed townships are as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">    Corporate Center: A home for corporate
    headquarters, offices and research and
    development facilities.
</blockquote>
<pre id="pre_2">    Industrial   Center:   A     self­sufficient
    community      dedicated      to       clear
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_17">    manufacturing and industrial research and
    development.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">    Agricultural Center: A town centered on a
    university    and    institute   dedicated to
    agricultural research and its application.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">    Eco­tourism Center: An environmental park
    and cultural arts center which will become a
    destination for Indians and foreign travellers
    who wish to learn about the region’s
    environmental      resources,     fine    and
    performing arts, and heritage crafts.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">    Heritage Center: A pilgrimage site with
    conference and traditional healing facilities.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">    Commercial Center: A residential suburb of
    Bangalore with retail, light industry, and
    municipal support services.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">    Farming and Market Center: A farming
    community with a market center for the sale of
    locally grown produce.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_96">Beyond these themes, the communities share a common
planning philosophy. The towns must be modern, but
accommodate traditional Karnataka lifestyles, customs,
and cultural values. Transportation access and utility
infrastructure will be provided to a greater ultimate
development capacity than will be initially needed for
those areas to be created by the Consortium. This excess
capacity will permit the new townships to
accommodate future growth with minimal disruption.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                   45</span>


<p id="p_97">        Each township has a primary town center with
        supporting neighbourhood centers. The residential
        areas are planned to include a range of housing
        models and are situated so that the walking distances
        to work, school, or shopping are not greater than ½
        mile (0.9 km). Elementary schools are located in each
        neighbourhood. Parks and recreation facilities are
        generously allocated to neighborhoods and town
        centers. Transportation access to the expressway and
        internal vehicle and pedestrian circulation patterns
        are considered carefully. …”

The other crucial aspect predicated in the PTR is the manner in

which the Project needs to be implemented and prioritized

including the Townships. It reads thus: ­


        PROJECT SCHEDULING AND PHASING:
</p>
<p id="p_98">        The current project schedule and phasing plan is
        responsive to the financial plan of the Consortium, and it
        meets the transportation and township development
        needs of the region. A master schedule illustrating the
        Bangalore­Mysore      Infrastructure    Corridor   Project
        elements and their interrelationships is presented on the
        following page.
</p>
<p id="p_99">          The project schedule and phasing plan has been
        developed that sequentially constructs the expressway
        elements of the project. Township development is
        phased to financially support the construction of the
        Expressway and the southern section of the Outer
        Peripheral Road. The project phasing can be
        summarised as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">            Construction of the Southern section of the
            Outer peripheral Road around Bangalore City

            year 2 and extend over a period of 12­15 years.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">            Development in each of the townships would
            be concurrent with the construction of the
            community and municipal services. This will
            enable the financing of these township
            elements and allow the consortium to
            manage their cash flow.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_100">        Once construction of the various expressway elements
        has been completed, tolled traffic operations will
        commence. For example, it is envisioned that the
        Southern section of the Outer Peripheral Road would
        open for traffic operations at the end of year three. Upon
        completion of each subsequent expressway section, it
        would also be opened for traffic operation.”

                  “1. TOWNSHIPS ALONG THE CORRIDOR

        This part of the report deals with the analysis of
        developing    seven    urban     townships    with   all
        infrastructure and civic facilities along the Bangalore­
        Mysore expressway.
</p>
<p id="p_103">        Historically, the chieftain from Magadi, Kempegowda
        built Bangalore during 1597 and established a few towers
        on the boundary limits of Bangalore. The Mughals
        conquered it in 1687. It is said, it was sold to Chikka
        Devaraya in 1690 for Rupees three lakhs. It was Hyder
        Ali who got it as a personal jagir in 1759. However in
        1791, Tippu Sultan was given suzerainty over it after the
        Treaty of Srirangapatnam. After the fall of Tippu at
        Srirangapatnam, the same was returned to the Hindu
        Royalty in 1799. A military cantonment of the British was
        established in 1809 and Bangalore later on flourished as
        an administrative centre since 1830. It grew
        spectacularly after 1951.
</p>
<p id="p_104">        1.3.       The population of Bangalore was 12 lakhs
        during 1961 and it rose to 29 lakhs as per 1981 census.
        In 1981, it was the fifth most populated city in the
        country and accounted for 25% of the population of the
        state – Hubli­Dharwad, the next urban centre accounting
        for a fifth of Bangalore size population.
</p>
<p id="p_105">        1.4.    Compared to Karnataka’s growth in population
        during 1981­91 which was 20.09%, the growth of
        population of Bangalore urban area was 59.08% during
        1971­81 and 38.00% in 1981­91 and that of rural
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                           48</span>


Bangalore was 24.30% during 1971­81 and 14.70% in
1981­91.
</p>
<p id="p_106">1.5.    As against this, Mysore with a population of 6.52
lakhs in 1991 recorded a growth of 24.97% in 1971­81
and 21.58% in 1981­91 at the district level. Various
agencies estimated the expected population of Bangalore
during 2001 as 70 lakhs (Town Planning Department)
and 82 lakhs (anticipated by Bangalore Water supply and
sewage Board). The Comprehensive Development Plan
(CDP) 1984 for 2001 of Bangalore Development Authority
(BDA) projected a population of 70.00 lakhs for Bangalore
in 2001. The revised (1995) CDP for 2011 AD proposed
land uses for 56,465 hac. as against 43,928 hac. During
2001. This is in addition to the green belt, surrounding
the conurbation area.
</p>
<p id="p_107">1.6.    The rapid increase in population necessitated
a thinking process to contain Bangalore to a
reasonable size, assure it the desired level of civic
and social services to keep its premier status and
direct additional growth to alternate places in a
desirable manner. The acute problems of Bangalore
are increasing level of pollution, pressure on land,
acute shortage of water, inadequate sewaging system
and lack of proper sewage treatment and disposal
arrangements, shortage of power, shortage of
residential        accommodation,          inefficient
telecommunication system, paucity of land space
within green belt etc.

1.7.     Bangalore, located at an elevation of +900m is
suffering for want of a good transport system, inter and
intracity wise. A reliable power supply system to assure
1000mw was planned as a part of Karnataka power
requirement. Tourist and amusement areas like T.G.
Halli Reservoir, Hesarghatta Tank, Bannerghata National
Park and Ramohalli Banyan Tree and Kanva Reservoir
were considered, but no active steps taken. The region
lacks the facility of good environment parks or
amusement places.
</p>
<p id="p_108">The above and many other factors indicate that there
is a need for a policy to establish urban growth
centers,    with   dependable   infrastructure   and
accessibility to the metropolitan area along a fast
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                           49</span>


corridor. Examples of this nature are many in
Switzerland, Norway, Mourville away from Paris in France
are just a few instances of polycentred settlements
working as countermagnets, with a strong support base.
The townships along the proposed Bangalore Mysore
Expressway would go a long way in reducing pressure
on Bangalore. These settlements should, however,
take into account the growth pressure likely to be
faced by them after a decade of their completion.
Creation of new settlements is likely to bring in
better results compared to improvements and
modification or creating new urban extensions to
metropolitan Bangalore as these actions need to
necessarily serve under severe constraints on the
other facilities like land, transport and power. Usewise
for any unit of expenditure, the efficacy of modifications
will be comparatively less. The environment and purity
will only reduce. But in the case of new settlements, it
will be easier to achieve better results. It is, however,
necessary to ensure that the existing structures and
balances in the rural sector are not thoughtlessly
disturbed; the emphasis in the new townships should
be for achieving a high degree of green and low rise
and low density development.
</p>
<p id="p_109">A very important aspect is to give orientation towards
the direction in which new townships should grow.
Referring to Bangalore, good transport facilities towards
Mysore are in the offing which is a good boost for
industrial and tourism growth. Mysore having an
excellent source of shelter, tourism, industry, and raw
materials, will serve very well the purpose of an
important supporting city (as the other end of a corridor
of development with other facilities and settlements
dispersed judiciously in between). Secondly, there are
three medium irrigation projects near about Bangalore
viz the Manchanabale Project, the lggalur project and the
Arobele project, which can yield some water for
supporting the growth. Rivers Arakavati Shimsa and
Cauveri are on the corridor towards Mysore. The Ground
Water department ascertained that there is good ground
water development possibility for making about 33,000
additional well structures in Bangalore; 41,600 in Mysore
and 42,100 in Mandya. At least it indicates good ground
water condition at depths ranging 50m and more. By far
the climatic and physical conditions in this area are very
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                           50</span>


congenial, compared to some other areas in Karnataka.
Therefore, it is most desirable to develop the belt as a
corridor with settlements of high order of infrastructure
well connected to the two metropolitan towns of
Bangalore and Mysore.
</p>
<p id="p_110">Selection of Townships

1.10    Estimates indicate that the population of
Bangalore will reach 85 lakhs by 2011. There is an
absolute need to restrict the population to 70 lakhs by
2011. Even for achieving this objective, a number of
measures to prepare Bangalore for sustaining a holding
capacity of 70 lakhs will be required to be taken. The
proposal now is an effort to absorb almost 7 to 8 lakhs
population in the proposed corridor by developing seven
townships    (Mandya,     Maddur,    Ramanagram     and
Chanpatna shall be geared to absorb about 2.0 lakhs
additional population). The balance of 6 lakh population
has to be diverted across towards other countermagnets
and some administrative actions taken.
</p>
<p id="p_111">1.10.2. The selection of the seven townships and the
need for land has been done by physical examination
of the present ground level conditions and
development. Since an expressway is being considered,
a comprehensive view has been taken about the
availability of access to the corridor from the proposed
townships each of which will be given an access to the
expressway.
</p>
<p id="p_112">1.10.3. Availability of      water is     an important
consideration. There are no water sources of perennial
nature, barring Cauveri which can be tapped for water
supply to these townships. Ground water conditions do
indicate the presence of water at depths 40 to 50m
between the rocks, but this is not an adequate source to
sustain the nature and level of development. Even the
National Water Policy hints that drinking water for urban
areas shall be met from surface flows, and only in rural
areas, extensive dependence on tube wells may be
considered. Heavy exploitation of subsoil water can
reduce the growth of greens. The idea of bringing water
from Cauveri along the expressway and supplying to the
townships is the only solution. Some water to be tapped
trough tube wells and water ponding by digging lakes can
be only auxiliary measures.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                            51</span>



<p id="p_113">1.10.4. Efforts are being made to avoid acquisition of
lands which are under good cultivation. Such lands
which are good for agriculture and gardens are being
almost avoided. Forest land is also being avoided. Since it
is necessary to have one expanse of land of about 2,000
acres and more for about 1.0 lakh population (or more),
search was made for presence of continuous plots of
land, as far as possible, forming a regular geometric
figure without wedges projecting in or out. However in a
few cases, a few villages and major district roads exist on
ground in the midst of such expansive areas. In such
cases, the villages and road are to be integrated suitably
with other planning, and some measures will have to be
taken to integrate them with main area. This will be a
right step to encourage the rural settlements adopting
new norms of a system and not distort, or feel disparities.
</p>
<p id="p_114">1.11.     The area on the corridor towards Maddur and
Mandya are highly agricultural in character with existing
irrigation facilities. It is for this reason that more
townships are located in the first half of the corridor
nearer to Bangalore and only 2 out of seven in the
other half of corridor nearer Mysore.
</p>
<p id="p_115">Fig. 3.1 (Section­I) shows the location of the
townships and the areas and the location of
expressway. Where the township area is away from the
expressway, a dedicated road with good specification is
proposed to be constructed up to the expressway as a
part of the township development. They will be served
through the Expressway interchanges.
</p>
<p id="p_116">To avoid speculation, no survey of land has been done.
Help of Topo maps has been taken to know ground
conditions. Ground conditions are further examined by
limited walking along. There are some changes on ground
since the last survey work was done for preparing topo
maps. Land use maps of each township have been
prepared to indicate the suggested breakup of areas.
After the land is finally selected and ground survey
done to some extent of precision (the existing maps
are to a scale of 1:50,000), the land uses firmed up
and density can be finally decided with zoning and
other development components like FAR, Height, Set
Backs, Architectural Control etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                    52</span>


        1.14.    The present comprehensive development plan for
        Bangalore shows the following land use pattern. In
        addition, there is a green belt on the periphery

        Residential                             43.16%
        Commercial                               2.91%
        Industrial                               6.81%
        Public and Open Spaces                  13.79%
        Public and semi public                   8.69%
        Transportation                          20.72%

        1.15.    Some townships are exclusively designed to
        promote industry and one for Environment and
        amusement. The land use pattern at city level in
        Bangalore cannot be extended for townships outside.
        The land use pattern in the other township areas will
        generally be as below.

expansion of cities is running out of control, and the

The present exercise is to contain this phenomenon by
planning the infrastructural corridor having seven new
townships to cater to the varying and complex needs of
the region, along the proposed expressway connecting
Bangalore and Mysore. These are indicated on the index
map.
</p>
<p id="p_118">The new townships would be of relatively small sizes,
designed to encourage pedestrians circulation and
maintain close proximity to surrounding open space.
The plans indicate an abundance of space flowing
throughout the community. The special endeavour has
been made to preserve natural wooded areas or unusual
topographical characteristics in all the towns. The
existing villages are assimilated in the overall schemes of
development as they are existing on all sites. The human
scale predominates in the total planning of all the new
town ships which are planned as self­contained
communities seeking a balance between sources of
employment, business centres, centre for fashion
technology, medical and other research centres etc. are
suitably located in various townships which are
essentially organic elements in a broad programme of
decentralization of the congested urban centres of
Bangalore and Mysore.
</p>
<p id="p_119">In all townships, the floor­space required to be
occupied by people and ground space for circulation
has been carefully worked out. The emerging pattern
is a balance between these elements. The high rise
‘Land Mark’ buildings, for all towns have been
thought of essentially in the commercial sectors, to
dominate the skyline and also to be seen from the
Expressway.
</p>
<p id="p_120">The grid pattern is followed for roads with circles and
radials in some cases. Three types of principal rights of
way have been followed, the respective width being 33.0,
24.5 m and 18.00 m.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                            54</span>


<p id="p_121">Each neighbourhood in the new townships has a small
sub centre for shopping, a primary school, and social
facilities. The secondary schools serve several
neighbourhoods.
</p>
<p id="p_122">Fig. 3.1 indicates the general locations of the
townships along the proposed Expressway and
existing Bangalore­Mysore State Highway No.17. The
existing villages and towns are also indicated. The
distance in km is shown on the drawing along the
alignment of proposed Expressway. There are five
townships with in the distance of 40 kms from Bangalore
and two townships in the vicinity of Mysore on either side
of the Kaveri River.
</p>
<p id="p_123">Township No.1 assumes great significance due to its
proximity to Bangalore. It is situated on either side of the
Expressway on the fringes of the Outer Ring Road of
Bangalore city. The nature of this township may be
roughly identified as a corporate township providing
facilities for Research and Development, Business Centre,
Hotels,      Golf   Course,   Residential,   and     related
infrastructure. Some facilities from the core of the city
could be shifted here in a planned and organised
manner.
</p>
<p id="p_124">The entrance and exit to the township is through an
interchange and toll­booths. This is located on the west of
the town. The town is provided with a Green Belt on its
periphery. Due consideration has been given to the
ecological and environmental factors. The total area of
the township is 2792 acres.
</p>
<p id="p_125">The ‘Land Mark’ buildings are proposed at appropriate
locations.
</p>
<p id="p_126">The city is designed as a self­contained entity with all
facilities, including a hospital and a college with
appropriate number of primary schools, high schools and
other town requirements.
</p>
<p id="p_127">2.8     Township No. 2 is located about 10 kms from
the Bangalore conurbation boundary. The site is
proposed to be developed as a commercial township,
contributing to relieve the pressures of urbanization.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                           55</span>


<p id="p_128">Covering an area of 1868 acres, the township is situated
about 7­8 kms off the Bangalore­Mysore Expressway and
4 kms from the existing railway line and state highway
No.17 to the south of the township.
</p>
<p id="p_129">The existing site features are more or less suitably
modified according to the layout with an exception of a
few rirulets, natural water bodies and hillocks and rocky
outcrops scattered within the site boundary. The
proposed township site is bounded by two roads leading
to Bangalore from Nejjala and Bidadi towns. A number of
existing settlements are present all around the site
boundary especially towards the south while two
settlements fall within the site boundary.
</p>
<p id="p_130">The basic design of this township revolves around the
central core. This central core is the major commercial,
business, services and institutional hub of the town. The
residential area is distributed all around this central
core.
</p>
<p id="p_131">The multifunctional central core offers varied services,
right from a commercial complex to hotel, bus terminal
municipal offices, institutional and office use, hospital,
and college, all located within 2 kms from the farthest
point in the township and hence confirms to the
standards of human scale, facilitating use of non
motorised form of transport.
</p>
<p id="p_132">The road layout is more or less a grid pattern. Each
residential pocket is to be developed as a self­contained
neighbourhood with facilities like school, playground,
park, dispensary, convenient shopping etc.

The environmentally friendly nature of the township is
emphasized by developing the township for non­
motorised transport system, encompassing the existing
settlements within the overall structure of the township
and provision of a green buffer all along the site
boundary besides the provision of community parks and
trees lining the major roads of the township.
</p>
<p id="p_133">Last but not the least is the link to the proposed
Expressway which will be provided through an
interchange on the expressway.

2.10.     Town ship No. 4 is about 36­37 kms. west of
Bangalore along the proposed Expressway. The site has
an area of about 1660 acres and is meant for the
industrial land use. It is intended to accommodate
different types of plots for the various industries. A green
buffer is maintained all round the township and the
environmental considerations shall be well looked after.
The site has an approach from the Expressway. The
necessary provision has also been maintained for the
public and semi­public and the green areas. The town
shall be designed on the lines of a modern Industrial
township will all necessary trapping.
</p>
<p id="p_135">2.11.   Township No. 5 is north of township no.4. This
township is located near the existing Bangalore­Mysore
State Highway No.17 and also near the existing Railway
line.
</p>
<p id="p_136">The site of this township in on the north of the existing
village of Archahakra Halli, which is along the State
Highway No.17 from where an existing roadway leads to
the hinterlands. This road passes through the entire
length of the proposed township. This proposed township
has a mix of cultural and residential land use and it
occupies an area of about 2700 acres. The town shall
have a medical centre with a full­fledged hospital with
centres for the study of various types of medical systems
like Allopathy, Ayurveda etc. it will also have a centre for
religious studies with subcentres for all world religion
and will accommodate special centre for the Vedic
studies. Housing also forms the major component of this
township.

Township No. 7 is in the near vicinity of Mysore City,
about 3 km on its outskirts and about 1 km on the north
of Kaveri River. It occupies an area of 4010 acres. The
township is designed for Ecotourism and all facilities
have been provided to meet this target.
</p>
<p id="p_138">This is the township of contrasts. It will have an
Amusement Park, Golf Course and hotels with some
residential neighbourhoods. A town centre with
commercial, public buildings and other necessary
infrastructure facilities is provided.

<p id="p_139">All these townships together provide for necessary
infrastructure support required in this region for
perspective requirements.
</p>
<p id="p_140">The townships will be developed in line with modern town
planning practices. Special consideration should be
shown while detailing open spaces parks and greens.
Special attention is to be given to Agricultural Zone and
the Agriculture University where uses like agriculture,
horticulture farming, chilling centers, farm houses and
accessory buildings will be planned.
</p>
<p id="p_141">Since the detailed layout and architectural control &amp;
drafting zoning applicable norms is not within the scope
of this report, this is not attempted; also it is an exclusive
work, which has to be handled separately. However there
are certain points which have links with land use
planning and which need to be considered in
development planning. They are listed below.
</p>
<p id="p_142">1.   Road hierarchy has to be planned to avoid main
     traffic in a subcity going through residential areas.
</p>
<p id="p_143">2.   Wind Rose is to be kept in view while treating high
     rise buildings vs. low rise buildings.
</p>
<p id="p_144">3.   Continuous green may be attempted to allow
     minimum public use of motorised transport –
     encourage cycle or pedestrian movement.
</p>
<p id="p_145">4.   All high rise buildings to be on wide roads only.
</p>
<p id="p_146">5.   Drainage and greens to be integrated

</p><p id="p_147">6.   Low rise buildings to be attempted to harmonize
     with environment

</p><p id="p_148">7.   Energy savings should be an important criterion
     while detailing architectural plans.
</p>
<p id="p_149">8.   Local zoning to ensure a low noise environment for

translated into a formal decision of the State with some

modifications and changes to the recommendations made

therein. Finally, the Framework Agreement (FWA) was executed

between the State and NICE. Even this agreement at the outset ­

in the recitals, unambiguously refers to the PTR and the

necessity to implement the Project as finally approved by the

Government in larger public interest. The relevant recitals read

thus: ­

Suffice it to observe that the underlying concern of the State was

about the increasing urbanisation problems and to assuage the

hardship caused on that account to the general public.                The

Project, as envisaged and finalised was intended to achieve the

objective of orderly development of Bangalore as a major

industrial, commercial and residential city.             The Integrated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                   61</span>


Infrastructure Corridor (the Project) was to consist of residential,

industrial and commercial facilities, amongst other things, self­

sustaining   townships,     expressways,    utilities   and   amenities

including power plants, industrial plants, water treatment plants

and other infrastructural developments, as envisaged in the PTR,

as amended.     The objective of the Project was also to ensure

smooth and accident­free traffic between Bangalore and Mysore;
</p>
<p id="p_156">to create new job opportunities for the residents in and around

the Infrastructure Corridor; promote tourism; decongest traffic

etc.
</p>

<p id="p_157">41. Notably,    the   PTR    had    suggested     creation    of   seven

Townships, but in the final decision, as noted in the FWA, only

five Townships have been approved as part of the Project being

Townships 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7. It was a conscious decision taken by

the State to have limited number of self­sustaining Townships in

the entire belt, so as to fulfil the National and State policy goals

of population dispersion and to ensure proper functionality in the

region.   In other words, the FWA predicates that the Project

Proponents will be allowed to develop only five Townships at the

demarcated     locations   and   which     are   self­sustaining    with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                 62</span>


sufficient infrastructure for ensuring smooth and accident­free

traffic on Bangalore­Mysore Expressway stretched to about 140

kilometres. Keeping that objective in mind, the stipulations and

specifications in the FWA read with the relevant portion of the

PTR will have to be examined. There is no room for giving liberal

meaning to the stipulations and specifications which would

inevitably defeat and frustrate the underlying objective of the

Project ­ of orderly development of Bangalore City and to address

the ever­increasing urbanisation problems.
</p>

<p id="p_158">42. Be it noted that the FWA executed between the State and

the Project Proponents delineates the nature of contract and the

scope of work to be carried out by the Project Proponents, as per

the terms and conditions specified therein.       It is an integrated

project   not   only   for   construction   and    management      of

Expressway, but also creation of Townships at the demarcated

location(s) as per the specifications and area earmarked therefor.
</p>
<p id="p_159">The “Infrastructure Corridor” has been defined as having the

same meaning as set forth in the recital (4th WHEREAS clause) of

the FWA.    It means, collectively, the Land, the Toll Road, the

Townships, the Power Plants, the Telecommunication Facilities,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                   63</span>


Water Supply Facilities and the Waste Water Treatment Facilities

and   other    developments,      and     the    acquisition,       design,

construction, engineering, financing and implementation thereof,

as referred to in the PTR. “Townships” is, therefore, an identified

and well­defined component of the “Infrastructure Corridor

Project”. It has been defined as follows: ­

        ““Townships” means the townships described as
        Townships 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 in the Infrastructure Corridor
        Project Technical Report which will be developed by the
        Company and/or the Project Companies for the industrial
        and commercial growth and other development of the
        Infrastructure Corridor, and the provision of roads,
        supply of water and electricity, street lighting, sewage,
        conservancy and such other conveniences and socio­
        economic infrastructure, inter alia comprising of housing
        schools, hospitals, shopping complexes, parks and open
        spaces as set forth in Schedule 4 attached hereto.”

From this definition, it is amply clear that only five Townships

(each having different purpose – such as Corporate Centre,

Industrial Centre, Ecotourism Centre, Heritage Centre and

Commercial Centre) have been envisaged in the Infrastructure

Corridor Project.   The location(s) of these five Townships have

been identified in the PTR. Besides the location(s), the extent of

area to be utilised for creation of each Township has also been

specified in the PTR, which applies proprio vigore to the

expression “Townships” in the FWA. The term “Townships”, no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                      64</span>


doubt, includes housing, but a standalone group housing scheme

cannot be regarded as a Township as such.               The Townships

would, however, comprise of not only housing, but also schools,

hospitals, shopping complexes, parks and open spaces, as noted

in Schedule 4, which reads thus: ­

Infrastructure Corridor Project. The bifurcation of the extent of

To put it differently, the Project Proponents are obliged to

construct the five Townships at the demarcated location(s) only

and to the extent of land specified therefor. Any other proposal of

the Project Proponents would be nothing short of deviation from

the FWA in particular. It is not necessary for us to dilate on the

essential     specifications        and     components             to     constitute   a

Township. Suffice it to observe that the Project Proponents are

obliged to construct housing in the area demarcated for

Townships        and     ensure          that     the      other        socio­economic

infrastructure components such as schools, hospitals, shopping

complexes, parks and open spaces etc. are also provided for

within the Townships.                   The construction of the essential

components including housing, as expressly provided in the

FWA, must also comply with the municipal laws governing such

constructions. For, Schedule 2 of the FWA reads as follows:­

is open to the Project Proponents to deviate from the PTR within

the defined norms to the extent such deviation is required to

enable the parties to realise the full benefits intended from

development of the Project. But, that is required to be done only

with prior written approval of the State. This is made amply clear

by <a href="/doc/839152/" id="a_29">Article 7.1</a> of the FWA itself. <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_30">Article 7</a> reads thus: ­

    mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The failure

Considering the fact that the State is obliged to facilitate the

Project Proponents to deviate from the PTR specifications adopted

in the FWA for the development of Townships, that does not

mean that the Project Proponents will set up housing complex at

location(s) other than those demarcated for five Townships

including not providing for other components of Townships in the

proposal or limit the proposal only to one component, such as

housing and excluding the other mandatory components ­

schools, hospitals, shopping complexes, parks and open spaces

etc.   Such interpretation cannot be countenanced and if

accepted, it would inevitably defeat the very purpose of the well­

defined project intended to address the increasing urbanisation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                      75</span>


problems and for orderly development of Bangalore City including

smooth and accident­free traffic between Bangalore and Mysore

Expressway.
</p>

<p id="p_222">45. The    next    question     is:   whether    the   stipulations   and

specifications in the FWA regarding the scope of work and the

application of both parties stood modified or altered due to

supplementary agreements dated 6.10.1999 and 31.3.2000?
</p>
<p id="p_223">Even on a fair reading of these agreements, we find that there is

no express clause therein which would alter the scope of work

and the obligations of both parties regarding the setting up of five

self­sustaining Townships only at the demarcated location(s).
</p>
<p id="p_224">The supplementary agreements, however, deal with other aspects

with which we are not concerned nor are the same relevant to

decide the matters in issue. Similarly, the Tripartite Agreement

dated 9.8.2002 between the State, NICE and NECE also does not

alter or modify the stipulations and specifications for setting up

of five self­sustaining Townships only at the demarcated

locations. The High Court has placed emphasis on clause 1.1.3

of the Tripartite Agreement, which reads thus: ­

        “1.1.3    Stage 1 of the Infrastructure Corridor shall mean
</p><p id="p_225">                  (a)   Toll road (Section ­A)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                                  76</span>


</p><p id="p_226">                 (b) Acquisition of the land and such rights,
                 title and interests therein as may be necessary
                 for the above­mentioned roads and development
                 and sale of land.
</p><p id="p_227">                 (c)  Basic development and sale of land,
                 including that at ten (10) interchanges and
                 Township­1”

We fail to understand as to how this clause can be construed to

mean that the original stipulations and specifications regarding

the five designated Townships in the FWA stood modified or

altered in any manner. This clause only deals with the meaning

of “Stage 1 of the Infrastructure Corridor”.        Indeed, clause (c)

thereof refers to Township–1, but that reference is in the context

of basic development and sale of land, and by no stretch of

imagination, can be construed to mean that Township–1

(Corporate Centre) could be set up at any other location much

less at intersections demarcated in the PTR.          The purpose of

intersections is to provide for free flow of traffic across the area.
</p>
<p id="p_228">All the five Townships referred to in the PTR are indisputably far

away from intersections.     Despite that, the Project Proponents

have proposed for group housing scheme in Section A of the

Project at inter<a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_37">sections 5</a>/<a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_38">7</a> thereat on the peripheral road. This

is notwithstanding the fact that even the Tripartite Agreement
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                                77</span>


does not modify the location(s) and specifications for the

Townships referred to in the PTR, which forms part of the FWA.
</p>

<p id="p_229">46. The thrust of the argument of the Project Proponents is that

housing is a permitted usage, in terms of the ODP/Master Plan.
</p>
<p id="p_230">For, the area for which the proposal for group housing scheme

had been submitted is within yellow zone/residential zone. The

question is: whether the Project Proponents can rely solely on

ODP/Master Plan, notified by the Planning Authority in exercise

of statutory function as a Planning Authority (for the entire area

including the Project area)?   The ODP/Master Plan, no doubt,

would apply and must be reckoned if any building proposal/plan

is submitted to the Planning Authority.     However, the Project

Proponents are obliged to develop the Project only in the manner

provided for in the FWA.    For, the right to develop the Project

bestowed on the Project Proponents flows, primarily, from the

FWA and the supplementary agreements in that regard. Unless

the FWA enables the Project Proponents to set up Townships at

location(s) other than location(s) for five Townships demarcated

in the FWA read with PTR and as standalone group housing

scheme, the question of Project Proponents unilaterally using the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">                                 78</span>


allotted land for construction of a group housing scheme spread

over in 42 acres and 30 guntas, that too at location(s) other than

demarcated for five Townships, cannot be countenanced. Only

upon grant of prior permission by the State in that regard, the

stipulations   in   the   FWA   (about    the   location(s)   of   the

Townships/group housing scheme), would stand relaxed and

modified and the Project Proponents would then be entitled to

pursue such proposal with the Planning Authority.         The State

can do so in terms of <a href="/doc/416232/" id="a_39">Article 3.2.3</a> and the Project Proponents can

request the State in that regard by invoking the enabling

provision in <a href="/doc/839152/" id="a_40">Article 7.1 (both of the FWA).</a>
</p>

<p id="p_231">47. To put it differently, the zone specified in the ODP/Master

Plan per se is not enough to allow the Project Proponents to

unilaterally use the land made over to them after acquisition

from private land owners for the Project, for purpose and manner

other than specified in the FWA and the PTR.
</p>

<p id="p_232">48. Much emphasis was placed on the order dated 3.11.2009

passed by this Court in Contempt Petition (C) No. 144/2006 and

connected contempt petitions in          Civil Appeal Nos. 3492­

3494/2005 and connected appeals to contend that the Planning
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">                                  79</span>


Authority and the State were obliged to allow the Project

Proponents to complete the Project and also permit them to use

the land allotted to them, as per the alignment specified in the

ODP/Master Plan dated 12.2.2004.              The said order dated

3.11.2009 reads thus: ­

          “We have heard the learned counsel for the parties on
       the Contempt Application.
</p><p id="p_233">          After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and
       after going through the materials on record and the
       application for Contempt, we are of the view that pending
       final disposal of the Contempt proceeding, the following
       order may be passed: ­
          By a final Judgment, this Court directed the
       State/respondents to implement the Bangalore­Mysore 1
       Infrastructure Corridor Project. Unfortunately, the said
       project has not yet been implemented by the
       State/respondents. On 4th of February, 2009, when this
       Contempt proceeding was taken up for hearing by this
       Court, Mr. G. E. Vahanvati, learned Solicitor General of
       India (as he then was) appearing for the State, stated
       before the Court that the State Government has decided
       to implement the Judgment of the High Court of
       Karnataka, as upheld by this Court, and needs time for
       implementation of the decision. Unfortunately, in spite of
       such submission made by the learned Solicitor General of
       India (as he then was), we are informed that the project
       has not yet been implemented. While some argument was
       advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and the
       Advocate General of the State, who is present today in
       Court, who submitted before us that the State has
       already taken all steps to implement the project and in
       fact, some lands have already been allotted to the
       applicants. Since the learned Advocate General of the
       State submitted that all possible steps have been taken to
       implement the project and to act in compliance with the
       Judgment of this Court, we direct that the 2 State
       Government shall constitute a Committee to be headed by
       the Chief Minister of Karnataka for the purpose of
       implementation of the project in question, which will
       submit a report by 22nd of November, 2009 as to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">                                  80</span>


       allotment and possession of lands for completion of
       the project and such steps can be taken within the
       time that may be mentioned in the report and the
       project shall be allowed to be completed as per the
       alignment specified in the Outline Development Plan
       dated 12th of February, 2004 issued by the Bangalore
       Mysore    Infrastructure  Corridor   Area   Planning
       Authority as per the Town and Country Planning Act.
         Let this matter be placed for further orders on 26 th of
       November, 2009 at 3.30 PM.”
                                             (emphasis supplied)

Indisputably, these contempt petitions were in reference to the

order passed by this Court on 20.4.2006 in Civil Appeal Nos.
</p>
<p id="p_234">3492­3494/2005 and connected appeals.             Those appeals were

against the decision of the High Court, which had considered two

questions posed before it, as noted in paragraph 21 of the

reported judgment in All India Manufacturers Organisation

(supra). The same reads thus: ­

        “21. The High Court in the impugned judgment (vide
        para 18) raised the following two questions for
        consideration in the three writ petitions:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">            “(1) Whether the FWA entered into between the
            Government of Karnataka and Nandi was a result
            of any fraud or misrepresentation as alleged by
            J.C. Madhuswamy and others and the State
            Government?
</blockquote><p id="p_235">        (2) Whether any excess land than what is required for
        the Project had been acquired by the State Government
        and whether it is open to it to raise such a plea?””

The High Court allowed the writ petitions and directed the State

and all its instrumentalities, including the KIADB to execute the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">                                81</span>


Project as conceived originally and to implement the FWA in its

letter and spirit. That direction was the subject matter of assail

by the State on the ground that the direction amounted to

mandamus to specifically perform the FWA, which is extremely

complex contract.   At the same time, the State had contended

that the Project was vitiated by fraud, misrepresentation and

mala fide.    However, the latter plea was given up before this

Court as noted in paragraph 24 of the reported judgment.
</p>

<p id="p_236">49. The fact remains that the original proceedings in the form of

writ petitions were filed as public interest litigation before the

High Court, challenging the Project in question, the stipulations

in the FWA and because in the garb of the Project, acquisition of

excess land was resorted to by the State, which would eventually

result in undue profiteering by Project Proponents.         In our

opinion, neither the judgment rendered in appeal by this Court in

All   India   Manufacturers    Organisation      (supra)   nor   the

observation found in the order dated 3.11.2009 will be of any

avail to the Project Proponents.     For, the Court was not called

upon to adjudicate the question even indirectly, as to whether the

subject proposal for setting up of group housing scheme could be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">                                   82</span>


proceeded directly before the Planning Authority just because it

is in conformity with the ODP/Master Plan and even though it is

proposed at a location different than the demarcated location(s)

for the five Townships in the FWA read with the PTR. No such

plea was raised by the Project Proponents. In other words, none

of the Court orders referred to by the Project Proponents had

examined the questions/issues involved in these appeals.
</p>

<p id="p_237">50. Admittedly, in the present case, the modified proposal

submitted by the Project Proponents on 5.5.2012 for developing

42 acres 30 guntas of land as group housing scheme, pertained

to Survey Nos. 17(P), 18, 19, 20/1, 20/3, 21/1(P), 21/2A2(P),

21/2B(P),   21/2C(P),     21/2D(P)        and   21/2E(P)    at   village

Kommagatta,     Kengeri   Hobli,        Bangalore   South   Taluk    (at

inter<a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_41">section 5</a>/<a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_42">7</a>, Section A of the Project on the peripheral road).
</p>
<p id="p_238">It was not for setting up of Township as such. Neither the PTR

nor the FWA envisages construction of standalone group housing

scheme, that too at a location other than demarcated location(s)

for five Townships. Thus, it was a clear case of deviation from

the stipulations and specification contained in the FWA read with

the PTR; and to relax or modify the same, prior permission of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">                                    83</span>


State is made mandatory in terms of the <a href="/doc/839152/" id="a_43">Article 7.1.</a>              For that

reason, the Planning Authority had informed the Managing

The survey sketch clearly shows the existing bridge, road,

<p id="p_255">2. Your second query requesting us to provide “No

of the Framework Agreement since it can be clearly seen
from the sale deeds executed by the KIADB transferring
title of the above survey numbers, photocopy of which

owners of the land in question without any
restrictions/limitations on the use of the land. This is in
conformity with the FWA where under the State
Government has agreed that it will not restrict use of
land in any manner and we shall be fully entitled at our
discretion to industrial and commercially develop the
land. We reproduce below for you ready reference clauses
3.2.3 and 3.8.3 of the FWA which read as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">        3.2.3 GOK, covenants that will not restrict the
        use of the Land in any way and that the
        Company shall have full freedom and discretion
        to industrially and commercially develop and use
        the land as generally contemplated by this

<p id="p_256">3.8.3 GOK understands that each of the
components of the Infrastructure Corridor
Project is an integral part of the Industrial and
commercial development of the Infrastructure
Corridor ma manner designed and calculated to
maximize the full industrial and commercial
growth, potential and quality of life in such
corridor. Accordingly, GOK shall use its best
efforts to cause land of appropriate width from
the outer boundaries of the entry and exist
points (rampways interchanges) of the Toll Road
the outer boundaries of each of the Townships,
each as identified by the Company, not to be
rezoned for use other than for farming (such
area being called herein the “Greenbelt”). The
appropriate width referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence shall be determined by the
appropriate Local Planning Authority. In the
event an area to be included in the Greenbelt is
on the date hereof already developed, GOK shall
not be required to rezone such land for the
Greenbelt, GOK acknowledges and agrees that
the Greenbelt will protect and buffer the Toll
Road and the Townships from unfettered and
uncontrolled development which would cause
irreparable harm to the Toll Road and the
Townships and undermine the goals and
purposes of the infrastructure Corridor Project
contemplated hereby and that in the event of
breach of this Paragraph 3.8.3 no adequate
namely, would exist and damages would be
difficult to measure and accordingly, the
Company shall be entitled to Injunctive relief for
specific performance pending resolution of any
Dispute involving the provisions of this
Paragraph 3.8.3.      In the event any Person
attempts to use the land designated for the
Greenbelt for purposes other than farming, the
Company may in its sole discretion take any and
all steps it deems necessary or required,
including the initiation of legal action against
such Person, to step or prevent such
unauthorized use. GOK shall support to the full

<p id="p_275">The Cabinet in its meeting on 30.08.2007 with respect to
the subject matter as mentioned above while referring to
<a href="/doc/1200881/" id="a_45">Article 1.1.3</a> of the Tripartite Agreement entered into
between M/s. NICE, M/s. NECEL and the Government of
Karnataka on 09.08.2002 while referring to clauses in
the said agreement namely (c) basic development and
sale of land including that at ten (10) interchanges and
Township 1 as follows­

</p><p id="p_276">(iii) NICEL or anyone who is implementing the BMICP
shall not be entitled to sell/alienate any portion of the
land in the interchanges/road portion of the BMICP.
Necessary steps be taken by the concerned department to
cancel the agreement dated 09.08.2002 between NICE
and the Government of Karnataka insofar as it
introduces clause for sale of land in Para 1.1.3 or
elsewhere in the agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_277">Apart from that, the judgments rendered in the context of
implementation of the project by the High Court of
Karnataka and Supreme Court mandate execute the
project as conceived originally and upheld in Somashekar
Reddy’s case and to implement the FWA in letter and
spirit. The clauses in the Tripartite Agreement dated
09.08.2002 which are in contradiction with the FWA are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">                            90</span>


to be ignored. Further, the agreement dated 09.08.2002
is to be limited to assignment only.
</p>
<p id="p_278">The PTR submitted by M/s NICE is a prominent part of
the FWA and the project will have to be implemented in
accordance with the Technical Report. As per the
definition of Toll Road and Township in the FWA which is
reproduced below, the Toll Road is to be specifically
restricted to Toll Road as defined. Further, for the
residential and commercial development, Township has
been separately provided for and in such Township,
different commercial and residential plans being
provided, the same are to be implemented in accordance
with the rules.
</p>
<p id="p_279">“Toll Road” means the portion of the infrastructure
corridor project consisting of Phase I Road, Phase II
Road, Phase III Road, Phase IV Road, Phase V Road,
Phase VI Road, the Bangalore Feeder, the Mysore Feeder,
Link Road and the Outer Peripheral Road collectively;
</p>
<p id="p_280">“Townships” means the townships described as Township
1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 in the Infrastructure Corridor Project
Technical Report which will be developed by the company
and/or project companies for the industrial and
commercial growth and other development of the
infrastructure corridor and the provision of roads, supply
of water, and electricity, street lighting, sewage,
conservancy, and such other conveniences and socio­
economic infrastructure, inter alia, comprising of
housing, schools, hospitals, shopping complexes, parks
and open spaces as set forth in Schedule 4 attached
hereto.
</p>
<p id="p_281">M/s. NICE has completed the Peripheral Road and Link
Road. However, with respect to the facilities that are
necessary for drivers of vehicles being plied on such road,
such as petrol bunks, service stations, and truck
terminals, it is noticed that till date none of these
facilities have been provided for.
</p>
<p id="p_282">In the light of the above points, before any decision is
taken with respect to change in land use and approval

have to be placed before the Empowered Committee

</p><p id="p_284">52. The fact remains that <a href="/doc/839152/" id="a_46">Article 7.1</a> of the FWA obliges the

Project Proponents to submit proposal to the State for approval in

case of any deviation. No such proposal was submitted to the

State.    Instead, the Project Proponents pursued the matter

directly with the Planning Authority.              In that sense, prior

approval of the State for deviating from the FWA and in particular

constructing housing complex at location other than demarcated

for Townships, is not forthcoming. Admittedly, no such approval

was taken. If such proposal was to be submitted to the State, it

would be open to the State to examine the same on its own or

refer the matter to the Empowered Committee constituted for

resolving such issues, as envisaged in <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_47">Article 4</a> of the FWA.

                                                 (emphasis supplied)

Indeed, the Empowered Committee is not a statutory committee,

but it can be so constituted in terms of <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_50">Article 4</a> read with

Schedule 6, consisting of high officials of the concerned

departments.       This is only to facilitate quick processing of the

proposals and implementation of the Infrastructure Corridor

Project    with    mutual     understanding       and    due    consultation

wherever necessary.          We may assume that the Empowered

Committee may not agree with the proposal, as it may be of the

view that the deviation is quite substantial and would disrupt the

core objective of the Integrated Infrastructure Corridor (the

Project), which has been designed with purpose of holistic and

orderly development of the region as a whole. In that eventuality,

the Project Proponents would be required to resort to mechanism

of resolution of disputes envisaged in <a href="/doc/1163710/" id="a_51">Article 18</a> of the FWA,

which reads thus: ­

                  “<a href="/doc/1163710/" id="a_52">ARTICLE 18.</a> RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES
          18.1 Mutual Discussions. In the event of a Dispute, the
          Parties shall endeavour to resolve such Dispute by

          (30) days of Notice of such Dispute.

          to the Expert. If the Expert does not arrive at a decision
          within sixty (60) days or if either Party does not accept
          the decision of the Expert, then either Party may, upon
          giving Notice to the other Party, refer the Dispute

         immediately for arbitration in accordance with Paragraph
         18.3.
</p><p id="p_294">         …..”

</p><p id="p_295">53.     A priori, it must necessarily follow that the Project

Proponents cannot and ought not to have directly approached the

Planning Authority for grant of stated permission in reference to

the provisions in the KTCP Act or ODP/Master Plan.                      As

aforesaid, if the proposal to be submitted by the Project

Proponents      was    compliant      with    the    stipulations      and

specifications given in the FWA read with the PTR, only then the

Project Proponents could justifiably approach the Planning

Authority directly for grant of permission as per the extant

regulations and municipal laws applicable in that regard, to

construct buildings and structures for establishing a Township.
</p>
<p id="p_296">In    other   words,   the   proposal/application      of   the     Project

Proponents would be a valid proposal/application to the Planning

Authority only if it was to be in strict compliance with the land

use specified in the FWA read with the PTR.             In case of any

deviation therefrom, it ought to accompany a formal prior

approval of the State or the Empowered Committee, as the case

may be, so that it can be processed further by the Planning

Authority.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">                                96</span>


<p id="p_297">54. Much emphasis was placed on the fact that the appellants

had permitted the Project Proponents to construct housing

complex at a location outside the demarcated area for the five

Townships referred to in the FWA.       Similarly, as the stated

location was falling in yellow zone being residential, the other

neighbouring private land owners were permitted to develop their

property for housing complex. This argument does not take the

matter any further for the Project Proponents, inasmuch as the

land in question has been allotted to the Project Proponents by

the State after acquiring it from private land owners for

implementation of the Project. For that reason, the use of the

land should be strictly in conformity with the FWA and the

applicable stipulations in the PTR. It is not open to the Project

Proponents to contend that they can unilaterally develop the land

allotted to them by the State in the manner other than specified

in the FWA, being bound by the contractual obligations flowing

from the FWA.
</p>

<p id="p_298">55. Notably, the State had granted prior permission to the

Project Proponents to construct housing units at location(s) other

than the five Townships.       That was to accommodate the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">                                97</span>


concerned land losers in connection with the same Project as per

the policy of the State. Besides, the stated housing complex is

not spread over in 42 acres and 30 guntas of land, so as to

disrupt the holistic development envisaged in the FWA/PTR. In

any case, that could be done only after obtaining prior approval

of the State in that regard. As regards permission given to the

private land owners, as aforesaid, that was given by the Planning

Authority as per the applicable town planning regulations and in

particular the use specified in the ODP/Master Plan. For, their

lands did not form part of the Project and also because they are

not bound by the stipulations in FWA in particular, unlike the

Project Proponents.
</p>

<p id="p_299">56. Reverting to the factum of assurance given by the Planning

Authority in the earlier round of writ petition(s) that the modified

proposal/application dated 5.5.2012 will be considered in

accordance with law and also that the State was party to that

petition, in our view, it does not entail in acquiescence or waiver

of the jurisdictional issue by the State (regarding necessity of

seeking prior approval of Empowered Committee and No

Objection   (Certificate)/approval   from   the   concerned   State
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">                                 98</span>


authorities).   In that, the assurance given by the Planning

Authority cannot come in the way of the State to urge that in law,

the Project Proponents had no authority to develop the lands in

question except as per the stipulations and specifications

prescribed in the FWA read with the relevant clauses of the PTR.
</p>
<p id="p_300">As a matter of fact, the earlier writ petitions were not decided on

merits, but came to be disposed of leaving all contentions open,

in lieu of the assurance given by the Planning Authority that it

would consider the modified application as per law.          In the

present writ petitions, therefore, the State in the larger public

interest is duty­bound to take a legal plea regarding jurisdictional

issue including the extent of right of the writ petitioners (Project

Proponents) being limited to stipulations in the FWA.         Thus,

neither the unilateral assurance given by the Planning Authority

nor the fact that such specific reason has not been recorded by

the Planning Authority in the impugned communication or that

the State was party to the said writ petitions, would denude the

State from raising the legal question regarding the scope of the

FWA disentitling the Project Proponents for grant of any relief in

the subject writ petitions. Further, the High Court in the guise of

issuing mandamus to the Planning Authority for issuing the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">                                99</span>


Commencement Certificate, in effect, has prevented the State

from calling upon the Project Proponents to strictly abide by the

stipulations in the FWA. That cannot be countenanced.
</p>

<p id="p_301">57. It is urged that this Court had held that it would be open to

the Project Proponents to carry on construction work of housing

on lands which are not falling within the Townships area, if the

same were otherwise permissible under the ODP/Master Plan

and the town planning regulations. This submission is founded

on complete misreading of the observations in the decision of this

Court in All India Manufacturers Organisation (supra).           As

noticed earlier, the lis before this Court including review

petition(s) had arisen on account of the challenge to the FWA and

also the acquisition of land for the purpose of the corridor project

being excessive.   Neither the High Court nor this Court was

called upon to answer the issue now raised by the Project

Proponents that it was free to construct standalone group

housing scheme and at location(s) outside the demarcated five

Townships (in the FWA/PTR).
</p>

<p id="p_302">58. Thus understood, the argument of the Project Proponents

that the plea taken by the State is hit by res judicata and in any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">                                        100</span>


case, by principles of constructive res judicata, cannot be

countenanced.        As a matter of fact, the Project Proponents did

not pursue the plea of res judicata or of constructive res judicata

before the High Court, as is evident from the points for

consideration formulated by the High Court in paragraph 9

reproduced in the earlier part of this judgment (in paragraph 22).
</p>
<p id="p_303">Even if it can be considered as a question of law, in our opinion,

the same does not arise in the fact situation of the present case.
</p>

<p id="p_304">59. The Project Proponents had also placed reliance on the

dictum of the High Court in S.M. Mohan Rao Nadgir vs. State

of Karnataka &amp; Ors.22, which, in our opinion has no bearing on

the question that arises for our consideration. Paragraph 10 of

the said decision as reproduced in the written submission filed

by the Project Proponents, in fact merely sets out the factual

matrix of that case and is certainly not an opinion of the Court

answering the plea required to be adjudicated in the present

appeals.     Even the observation in Dakshinamurthy vs. B.K.
</p>
<p id="p_305">Das, IAS &amp; Ors.23, being an order passed in Contempt Petitions

filed in Civil Appeal Nos. 3492­3494/2005 and connected appeals

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">                               101</span>


[decided on 20.4.2006, as reported in All India Manufacturers

Organisation (supra)] will be of no avail to the Project

Proponents. The fact recorded that the Project shall be allowed to

be completed as per the alignment specified in the ODP/Master

Plan, as noted therein, has no bearing on the questions dealt

with in the present appeals.
</p>

<p id="p_306">60. Be it noted that the Project can be taken forward by the

Project Proponents only in conformity with the stipulations and

specifications in the FWA and the PTR. Additionally, the Project

Proponents are also obliged to ensure compliance of ODP/Master

Plan and if so complied, the Planning Authority cannot create any

impediment.    If the State accords approval to the deviation in

terms of the FWA itself, the Project Proponents may be competent

to carry on such a work. To put it differently, prior approval of

the State for deviation from the stipulations and specifications in

the FWA is the quintessence.     We do not wish to burden this

judgment with the argument about attitude of the concerned

authorities in creating obstructions in completion of the Project

because no official has been named in the writ petitions filed by

the Project Proponents being responsible for that situation.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_102">                                  102</span>


<p id="p_307">61. The argument of the Project Proponents that the housing

complexes can be constructed even at intersections by placing

reliance on the observations in All India Manufacturers

Organisation (supra), is begging the question.             The issue is:
</p>
<p id="p_308">whether it is open to the Project Proponents to deviate from the

stipulations and specifications of the FWA, in particular, in

respect of Townships without prior approval of the State? The

issue considered in the earlier rounds of litigation by this Court

was on the basis of stand taken by the State to defend the

Project, the FWA and the acquisition of land for the purpose of

the project. In the present appeals, the matter is required to be

examined in the context of the stand of the Project Proponents

that they are free to carry on construction of housing scheme at

any location of their choice even outside the demarcated

location(s)   for   five   Townships,   stretched   over    about   140

kilometres of the expressway, in the FWA and the PTR.
</p>

<p id="p_309">62. Reverting to the dictum in M. Nagabhushana (supra), the

same will also be of no avail to the Project Proponents as it does

not militate against the Planning Authority and State, in

particular. As already noted, the State is competent to maintain
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">                                103</span>


its stand that the legal right of Project Proponents flows only from

the terms and conditions specified in the FWA read with the PTR.
</p>
<p id="p_310">That is a just plea available to the State and must be taken by it

in the larger public interest to ensure that the objective of the

Integrated Corridor Project (the Project) is not marginalised,

undermined or frustrated in any manner.         If development as

desired by the Project Proponents on the stretch of 140

kilometres of the expressway is allowed, it would result in

development in manner other than the one planned and

conceived in the FWA and the PTR, the objective of which is to

provide for holistic and orderly development of the self­sustaining

Townships with all basic infrastructure and civic facilities and to

ensure smooth and accident­free traffic between Bangalore and

Mysore; population dispersal as per the National/State policy; to

create new job opportunities for the residents in and around the

Infrastructure Corridor; promote tourism; and decongest traffic

etc.
</p>

<p id="p_311">63. It is not necessary for us to dilate on other aspects

regarding the efficacy of the FWA and the PTR or the other

agreements executed between the parties, having held that it is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">                                   104</span>


for the State to consider the proposal for allowing the Project

Proponents to deviate from the stipulations and specifications of

the FWA and the PTR and until that decision is taken by the

State   or     its   instrumentalities    including   the   Empowered

Committee constituted in terms of the FWA, the Planning

Authority    cannot     process   the    proposal/application     directly

submitted to it by the Project Proponents. Further, such non­

compliant      proposal/application      submitted    by    the   Project

Proponents directly to the Planning Authority must be regarded

as infirm, invalid and non­est in law.
</p>

<p id="p_312">64. The next question is: whether the findings recorded by the

High Court for setting aside the reasons given by the Planning

Authority in the impugned communication dated 7.2.2015, can

be said to be the just approach of the High Court? In view of the

conclusion reached by us hitherto, it is not necessary for us to

dilate on the correctness of the view taken by the High Court in

that regard.
</p>

<p id="p_313">65. Suffice it to observe that assuming the High Court was right

in taking the view as it did to set aside the communication dated

7.2.2015, it was certainly not right in issuing mandamus to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">                                     105</span>


Planning     Authority    to    straightaway      grant    Commencement

Certificate in respect of the modified proposal. The appropriate

order that could have been passed by the High Court in such a

situation after setting aside the communication dated 7.2.2015,

would have been to relegate the Project Proponents before the

Planning     Authority    for   proceeding      with    this   proposal   in

accordance with law and applicable regulations expeditiously

after considering the other issues/points raised by the State.
</p>
<p id="p_314">The Project Proponents would, however, rely on the exposition in

paragraph 27 of the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/627562/" id="a_53">Badrinath vs.

Government of Tamil Nadu &amp; Ors</a>.24, which reads thus: ­

         “27. This flows from the general principle applicable to
         “consequential orders”. Once the basis of a proceeding is
         gone, may be at a later point of time by order of a superior
         authority, any intermediate action taken in the meantime
         – like the recommendation of the State and by the UPSC
         and the action taken thereon – would fall to the ground.
         This principle of consequential orders which is applicable
         to judicial and quasi­judicial proceedings equally
         applicable to administrative orders. In other words, where
         an order is passed by an authority and its validity is being
         reconsidered by a superior authority (like the Governor in
         this case) and if before the superior authority has given
         its decision, some further action has been taken on the
         basis of the initial order of the primary authority, then
         such further action will fall to the ground the moment the
         superior authority has set aside the primary order.”

Reliance is also placed on Section 15 of the KTCP Act, in

particular, proviso thereto, which reads thus: ­

24 (2000) 8 SCC 395
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">                          106</span>

We are not impressed by this submission. The reported decision

pressed into service does not go to the extent of justifying the

direction issued by the High Court vide impugned judgment to

issue Commencement Certificate. Indisputably, the question of

issuing Commencement Certificate would arise only if the

Planning Authority was fully satisfied that the proposal/plan

submitted by the Project Proponents is compliant in all respects

in reference to the extant town planning rules and regulations.
</p>
<p id="p_322">Moreso, because it is not a case where the Project Proponents

were invoking the provision regarding deemed approval of the

modified plan submitted on 5.5.2012.
</p>

<p id="p_323">66. As a result, we have no hesitation in taking view that the

direction issued by the High Court in the impugned judgment, in

any case, cannot be countenanced in law. But this question, if

we may say so, has become academic for the view that we have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">                                 108</span>


already taken that the Project Proponents could not have directly

approached the Planning Authority for approval of modified

proposal, which was replete with deviations from the stipulations

and specifications in the FWA read with the PTR.      This is so

because the right in favour of the Project Proponents to carry on

development work on the lands referred to in the FWA and the

PTR would enure only in conformity with the stipulations and

specifications in the stated documents.    It is not open to the

Project Proponents to develop the land in any other manner,

unless permitted by the State.
</p>

<p id="p_324">67. Taking overall view of the matter, we have no hesitation in

allowing the present appeals filed by the Planning Authority and

the State of Karnataka and thereby setting aside the impugned

judgment of the High Court with liberty to the Project Proponents

to first approach the State (under <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_59">Article 7</a> of the FWA) for its

prior permission to allow them to deviate from the stipulations

and specifications in the FWA and the PTR. Upon consideration

of such proposal, the competent authority of the State may take

appropriate decision in the matter and if need be, obtain prior

opinion of the Empowered Committee.       However, this process
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">                                     109</span>


must be completed in right earnest and no later than six months

from the date of submission of the proposal to the competent

authority of the State.      If the decision is adverse to the Project

Proponents, it would be open to them to take recourse to the

disputes resolution mechanism in terms of <a href="/doc/1163710/" id="a_60">Article 18</a> of the FWA,

if so advised. Only after prior permission is granted by the State

regarding the proposed deviations, the Project Proponents may

then apply to the Planning Authority for permission to construct

buildings/structures    as     per    the   applicable   town       planning

regulations, which be considered on its own merits in accordance

with law uninfluenced by its earlier communication dated

7.2.2015.
</p>

<p id="p_325">68. We leave all other contentions available to concerned parties

open to be considered by the concerned forum/Court on their

own merits in accordance with law.
</p>

<p id="p_326">69. Accordingly, the impugned judgment and order is quashed

and set aside and the stated writ petitions filed by the Project

Proponents   stand     dismissed       with   liberty    to   the    Project

Proponents, as aforesaid. The appeals are allowed in the above
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">                                110</span>


terms. There shall be no order as to costs. Pending interlocutory

applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
