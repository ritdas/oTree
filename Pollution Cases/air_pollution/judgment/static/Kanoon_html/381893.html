ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 


 

<p id="p_1">1.	This
appeal, preferred under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_1">Section 378</a> of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973, is directed against the order of acquittal passed by
the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad in Criminal Case
No.229 of 1990 on 27.11.1997.
</p> 

 


 

 


 

<p id="p_2">2.	The
appellant, who has been serving as a Law Officer with the Gujarat
Pollution Control Board constituted under <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_2">Section 4</a> of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, filed criminal complaint
against respondent Nos.1 to 3 for the offence punishable under
<a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_4">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_6">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_7">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_8">47</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the  Act ).
The learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad framed charge
and proceeded with the matter and examined the prosecution witnesses
namely complainant   Dahyabhai Kalubhai Solanki and Mahendrasinh
Madhavsinh Rakhol and considered documentary evidences such as
authority which was given to the complainant to lodge the complaint
vide Exh.6, the powers given to the complainant by the Board vide
Exh.8, reply filed by  respondent No.1 vide Exh.10, notice vide
Exh.11 and the report of the public analyst. The learned Judge has,
after considering the entire gamut of oral deposition as well as the
documentary evidence on record of the case, held that as the
prosecution committed breach of <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_10">Section 21</a> of the Act and Rule 27 of
the Gujarat Water (Prevention and
Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as the
 Rules 1976 ), respondent Nos.1 to 3 are required to be
acquitted for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_11">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_12">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_13">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_14">44</a>
and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_15">47</a> of the Act.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">3.	The
appellant, being dissatisfied with the order of acquittal, has
preferred the present appeal. The learned advocate for the appellant
submitted that the learned Judge has not appreciated the oral
deposition as well as the documentary evidence, more particularly,
report of the analyst in proper perspective, while acquitting
respondent Nos. 1 to 3 for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_16">Sections 24</a>,
<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_17">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_18">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_19">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_20">47</a> of the Act. It is submitted by the learned advocate
that all the due procedures were completed while collecting the
samples and there was no breach of <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_21">Section 21</a> of the Act and Rule 27
of Rules 1976, as held by the learned Judge in acquitting respondent
Nos.1 to 3. Thus, it is submitted by the learned advocate that the
order passed by the learned Judge is required to be set aside and
respondent Nos.1 to 3 be convicted for the offence punishable under
<a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_22">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_23">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_24">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_25">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_26">47</a> of the Act.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_4">4.	None
appears for respondent Nos.1 to 3, though served and, therefore, the
matter has proceeded ex-parte
against respondent Nos.1 to 3. Learned A.P.P. Ms.Krina Calla,
representing respondent No.4-State, submitted that the learned Judge
has committed the egregious error in acquitting respondent Nos.1 to 3
under <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_27">Section 21</a> of the Act read with Rule 27 of Rules 1976 and,
therefore, the impugned order is required to be quashed and set aside
and respondent Nos.1 to 3 be convicted for the offence punishable
under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_28">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_29">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_30">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_31">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_32">47</a> of the Act.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_5">5.	I have heard learned
advocate Mr.Sunil L. Mehta for the appellant and learned A.P.P.
Ms.Krina Calla for respondent No.4-State at length and in great
detail. This Court has also undertaken a complete and comprehensive
appreciation of all vital features of the case as well as the entire
evidence on record.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_6">6.	I have also taken into
consideration the reasons assigned by the learned Judge while
acquitting respondent Nos.1 to 3 for the offence punishable under
<a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_33">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_34">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_35">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_36">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_37">47</a> of the Act. On behalf of the
prosecution, complainant   Dahyabhai Kalubhai Solanki has been
examined and witness   Mahendrasinh has also adduced the deposition
in support thereof. However, considering the entire evidence on
record of the case, it is clear that the prosecution has committed
breach of <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_38">Section 21</a> of the Act and Rule 27 of Rules 1976 and,
therefore, benefit of the same is required to be given to the accused
in view of the decision rendered in the case of Dahyabhai
Kalubhai Solanki V/s. Devine Intermediates &amp; Chemicals &amp;
Ors., reported in 1996 (1) G.L.R. 729. Thus,
considering the evidence on record of the case and the reasons
assigned by the learned Judge, I do not find any infirmity in the
judgment rendered by the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,
Ahmedabad while acquitting respondent Nos.1 to 3 for the offence
punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_39">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_40">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_41">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_42">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_43">47</a> of the Act.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_7">7.	This
is an acquittal appeal in which Court would be slow to interfere with
the order of acquittal. Infirmities in the prosecution case go to the
root of the matter and strike a vital blow on the prosecution case.
In such a case, it would not be safe to set aside the order of
acquittal, more particularly when the evidence has not inspired
confidence of the learned Judge who had opportunity to observe
demeanour of the witnesses. As this Court is in general agreement
with the view expressed by the learned Judge, the Court does not
think it necessary either to reiterate the evidence of prosecution
witnesses or to restate the reasons for acquittal given by the
learned Judge and this Court is of the opinion that expression of
general agreement with the view taken by the learned Judge would be
sufficient in the facts of the case. This is so, in view of the
decisions rendered by the Supreme Court in the cases of (1)
<a href="/doc/582191/" id="a_44">Girija Nandini Devi &amp; Ors. v. Bijendra Narain Chaudhari</a>, AIR 1967
SC 1124, and (2) <a href="/doc/1474119/" id="a_45">State of Karnataka v. Hema Reddy and another</a>, AIR
1981 SC 1417. On overall
appreciation of evidence, this Court is satisfied that there is no
infirmity in the reasons assigned by the learned Judge for acquitting
the respondent. Suffice it to say that the learned Judge has given
cogent and convincing reasons for acquitting the respondent. The
learned advocate for the appellant has failed to convince this Court
to take a view contrary to the one already taken by the learned Judge
and, therefore, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_8">8.	For
the foregoing reasons, the appeal fails and it is hereby dismissed.
</p>
