<p id="p_4">                                It is case of the petitioners that after meeting the formalities as per

            the 1992 Rules, he moved an application on 10.01.2012 for grant of No Objection

            Certificate to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (in short 'the Board').

            During process of verification by the officers of the Board, vide letter dated

            30.01.2012, it was intimated that the land where the applicant wishes to set up a

            stone crusher does not fall within the forest zone and there is no bird sanctuary

            existing nearby.        It was only stated that 'No Objection Certificate' cannot be

            granted because qua mining of the minor minerals, ban has been imposed in

            Mewat district. In the above said letter, it is clearly mentioned that after July,

            2011, 'No Objection Certificate' has been given to 35 units and if new units are

            allowed to be set up, it is going to be a big problem in future because owners take

            mineral from Rajasthan at higher rates and on account of availability of cheaper

            illegal material, they indulge in unauthorized mining.

            concerned authorities, documents showing that fact are placed on record from page

            nos. 89 to 94 of the paper book. The Board recommended case of the petitioners

            for grant of 'No Objection Certificate' to the District Level Clearance Committee

            (DLCC) vide letter dated 02.02.2012. The request of the petitioners was so placed

            before the said Committee on 18.06.2012. Following proceedings were noted qua

            prayer made by the petitioners against Agenda Item No. 4:-

            above order, affidavit of Sh. P.K. Chaudhery, Chief Secretary to the Government

            of Haryana was filed in the Hon'ble Supreme Court wherein, it was stated that

            DLCC constituted to grant consent to establish new stone crushing units under The

            Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, in its meeting on 09.02.2012,

            has decided not to give consent to establish new stone crushing units in view of

            ban on mining in the district. It was further stated that to stop illegal mining, the

            State of Haryana has issued an order on 21.04.2012 deciding not to issue any fresh

            licence to set up stone crushing unit. The relevant portion of that letter dated

            21.04.2012 reads thus:-

            the State, no fresh licence be granted because the new stone crushing units are

            likely to encourage obtaining of raw material from unauthorized or illegal sources

            especially when the import of mineral from legal sources, from outside the State is

            insufficient even for the existing stone crushers.

</p><p id="p_21">                                This order appears to have been passed because it was compulsion

            of the State Officers to show some activity undertaken by them because affidavit

            was to be filed in the Supreme Court. Instead of dealing with the situation to stop

            illegal mining, an attempt was made to deny right to the applicants to set up new

            stone crushers. To say that illegal mining will be encouraged is no ground to stop

            setting up of the stone crushing units. The State was supposed to take remedial

            measures to stop the illegal mining by putting in regulatory methods.

            1183 licenced units, 548 are closed and 635 are functional. After denying right to

            the petitioners to set up a new unit, in Mewat district alone, licences of 17 units

            were renewed. In Mewat district, 71 units are running. If activities of those 71

            units can be regularized, it is very surprising as to why the activities to be

            undertaken by the fresh units cannot be put under watch. While issuing order

            dated 21.04.2012, virtually, the 1992 Rules have been set at knot. Inability of the

            State Government to stop illegal mining cannot be taken as a ground not to grant

            new licences as per the 1992 Rules. It appears that said order has been issued with

            charge the rate of material the way they like.           The action taken is totally

            discriminatory. It violates the provisions of Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution

            of India. Similarly situated persons have been dealt with separately. At the time

            of hearing, no justification was given to issue order dated 21.04.2012 stopping

            grant of new licences to set up crushing units except that it will increase illegal

            mining. The State is not helpless and if any unit is indulging in illegal activities,

            action can be taken and the licence can be cancelled.           Instead of doing that

            exercise, a short cut method has been adopted to stop progress of the industry in
