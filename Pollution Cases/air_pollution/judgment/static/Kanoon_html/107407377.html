                     ----------------------------------------
                      W.P.(C).No.13180 of 2017-V
                    -----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 30th day of August, 2017

                                JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">             The petitioners in the writ petition raise a specific

contention against the 5th respondent's hollow bricks unit; that the

same is functioning without obtaining necessary statutory licenses,

permissions, consent and No Objection Certificates under the Air

(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and the D &amp; O Rules

made under the Kerala Municipalities Act, 1994.

</p><p id="p_2">             2. The 5th respondent appeared and filed a counter

affidavit, producing the statutory licences and the permissions. It was

also contended that admitting the issue of licences and permissions,

a suit was filed by the very same petitioners, seeking an injunction

against the renewal of license; with the 5th respondent and the

Municipality in the party array. The petitioners have suppressed the

said fact in the writ petition and have taken up a totally different

contention; that the 5th respondent is running the hollow bricks unit

without any sanctions or permit.
</p>
<p id="p_3"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WP(C) No.13180 of 2017          - 2 -</span>


</p><p id="p_4">           3. In the context of the counter affidavit, the learned

Counsel appearing for the petitioners only argued that the issue of

the distance as specified in Exhibit P3 have been violated. In

Exhibit P3, the hollow bricks unit has to have a minimum set back

of 25 metres and a minimum distance of 50 metres to residences

and other establishments. The learned Standing Counsel for the

Kerala State Pollution Control Board [for brevity "PCB"], would

submit that Exhibit P3 would be applicable only prospectively and

the specific contention of the 5th respondent in his counter is that

the Unit was started in 2011 and P3 is dated 20.07.2011. This is an

issue which could be raised before the PCB, who could carry out

necessary verification.
</p>
<p id="p_5">           4. However, the writ petition is not on the said lines. As

was noticed, the writ petition specifically alleged that the 5th

respondent is carrying on the unit without licenses and

permissions. The 5th respondent asserts that a license was

obtained by the 5th respondent from 2011 onward and the unit has

been continuously operating from then. Exhibit R5A is the license

issued by the Municipality for the year 2015-16 and Exhibit R5B is

that issued for the year 2016-17. When a renewal was sought for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WP(C) No.13180 of 2017            - 3 -</span>


the year 2017-18, an objection was raised by the petitioners before

the Municipality that there was no consent to operate issued by the

PCB. The 5th respondent having produced Exhibit R5C, Integrated

Consent to Operate; the learned Standing Counsel for the

Municipality submits; the license has been renewed for the year

2017-18 also. In such circumstances, the contentions raised in the

writ petition are devoid of merit.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             5. It is seen from Exhibit R5F, a plaint filed by the

petitioners themselves before the Munsiff's Court, Karunagappally,

numbered as O.S.No.202 of 2016, that they had specifically in

paragraph 6 admitted to the licenses having been issued to the 5th

respondent on his exerting undue influence on the official

respondents. The prayer in the suit was also to injunct the

Municipality from renewing the D&amp;O Licence.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             6. Obviously the petitioners had approached the

Munsiff's Court with a suit and on not obtaining an injunction, has

approached this Court with totally different contentions. It is

pertinent that this Court had also, on the basis of the contentions

raised in the writ petition, directed the 2nd respondent to carry out

an inspection and stop the unit if the unit is carried out without

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WP(C) No.13180 of 2017           - 4 -</span>


licenses and permissions. The petitioners are guilty of suppression

of material facts in the writ petition and are also guilty of taking

quite contrary and opposite stances in the suit and the writ petition.

The averments made in the suit specifically reveal the petitioners'

knowledge of the various licences and permissions obtained by the

5th respondent. However, in the writ petition filed, the petitioners

have asserted that the unit is carried out without the necessary

statutory licenses; which is a deliberate falsehood.

</p><p id="p_8">            In the above circumstances, the writ petition would

stand dismissed with exemplary cost of Rs.5,000/- [Rupees five

thousand] each, which the petitioners would pay to the 5th

respondent. If the petitioners pay such amounts and then raise a

complaint before the PCB as to the violation of distance rule, then

the same shall be considered by the PCB. The 5th respondent

would be entitled to establish before the PCB that the unit was

established prior to Exhibit P3.
