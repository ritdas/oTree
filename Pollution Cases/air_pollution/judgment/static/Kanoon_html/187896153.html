Kotkapura in District Faridkot (Punjab) which is stated to be run by

respondent No.6 allegedly without any authorization/permit/license from the

Government/State as the same creates nuisance and hazard to life and health

of the general public.

been deposed in the affidavit that respondent No.6 (Bhupinder Singh)

applied for grant of license vide application dated 19.09.2006 for running

the Saw Mill. After thoroughly scrutinizing and verifying the authenticity of

the particulars stated in the application alongwith the related documents

appended thereto, a license No.341/FDK/2008-2009 dated 10.06.2008

(Annexure R-4/1) was granted to run the Mill with one 36" vertical band

saw, 42" vertical band saw and one 42" horizontal band saw. The said

license is stated to be valid up to 10.06.2018. It is further stated that the Saw

</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">5.             In the replication filed by the petitioner, none of the aforesaid

pleading has been controverted or denied.
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.             Having gone through the pleadings and after perusal of the

record appended thereto, I am of the opinion that the writ petition is devoid

of any merit and the same is liable to be dismissed for the reasons stated

hereinafter.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.             The prayer in the writ petition is based on the premise that the

official respondents are allowing private respondent No.6 to run/operate the

Saw Mill illegally without any authorization/permit/license from the

competent authorities. However, as is borne out from the record appended

with the return filed by official respondents as also by respondent No.6 that

appropriate sanction/permission/ license have been granted to respondent

No.6. Thus, the entire edifice of the writ petition in view thereof collapses.

The petitioner has had the liberty to challenge the said permission/sanction,

in the event, he so wished or was advised that the same have not been

granted in accordance with law. Yet the same have never been challenged

by him either by instituting any other collateral proceedings or even in the

present writ proceedings.</p><pre id="pre_2">

</pre><p id="p_11">8.          There are many other allegations levelled in the writ petition

which though have been threadbare dealt with by respondent No.6 as also

by official respondents in the respective affidavits filed by them in response

to the writ petition but I need not dwell on the same in view of the fact that

scope of the writ petition is confined to seek mandamus on the ground that

the Saw Mill is running/operating illegally without any sanction.

</p><p id="p_12">9.          Accordingly, confining myself to the legality of running of the

Saw Mill, I am of the view that the same is operating/running after having

obtained the necessary sanction/permission. The writ petition is, therefore,

dismissed being devoid of any merit. However, liberty is granted to the

petitioner to take appropriate steps to challenge the permission/license

granted to the petitioner, if so advised, by instituting appropriate

proceedings, in accordance with law.
