and <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_4">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code read with <a href="/doc/1901551/" id="a_5">Section 59(iii)</a> of

the Food Safety &amp; <a href="/doc/79442359/" id="a_6">Standards Act</a>. This case was registered

Vazhuthacaud junction, Thiruvananthapuram.                           The allegation

was that on 10.7.2012, the second                             accused    prepared

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl.M.C.No.1266 of 2013          2</span>

food article by name 'Shavarma', which was injurious to health

and that      was sold to several persons, who developed

complications and that, around       10 persons were admitted in

purchased and consumed 'Shavarma' from the restaurant of

the petitioners     on  10.7.2012    and he   developed     serious

gastro problem,      which resulted in his death at Bangalore.

It is further known that with regard      to the death of Sachin

Mathew Roy, Crime No.UDR/No.52/12 under <a href="/doc/411677/" id="a_7">section 174</a> of

the Code of Criminal Procedure was registered in Kalasipalayam

police station and it is being investigated.

</p><p id="p_3">      3. On the basis of the complaint received, Museum

police has registered Crime No.732/2012        alleging    offences

under <a href="/doc/285163/" id="a_8">Sections      273</a>, <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_9">328</a> and    <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_10">34</a> of the  Indian Penal Code

read with <a href="/doc/770337/" id="a_11">section 59</a> (iii) of the Food Safety and Standard

Act, 2006. During the course of investigation, on         18.7.2012

around 4 p.m the petitioners surrendered before the            Sub

Inspector of Polcie, Museum police station and they were

arrested    and produced before the        Judicial   First   Class

Magistrate Court-III, Thiruvananthapuram on         19.7.2012 and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl.M.C.No.1266 of 2013         3</span>

they were remanded to judicial custody and after 50 days of

judicial custody, the petitioners were    granted bail.    After

the death of    Sachin Mathew Roy, the Food Safety Authority

has   filed  a    complaint  before the   Judicial First  Class

Magistrate Court -III, Thiruvananthapuram and it is pending

as C.C.No.231/2012 as against the first petitioner. The case

of the petitioners is that after the coming into force the Food

Safety and Standard Act, the general provisions in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12"> the Indian

Penal Code</a> regarding the same subject matter is impliedly

repealed    and they    cannot   be dealt with  under both the

enactments.        Further  different procedure and    different

punishment have been provided under the later Act namely

Food Safety and Standard Act, 2006 and severe punishment

has been provided for selling unsafe food causing death and

this Act has repealed the existing         <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_13">Prevention of Food

Adulteration Act</a> and       taken care of all type of offences

relating to sale of food and consequences ensued on account

of sale of    such food. So, under the circumstances, they

cannot be proceeded      against under two enactments and they

prayed for quashing the proceedings on that ground.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl.M.C.No.1266 of 2013           4</span>

filed a statement contending as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_5">      On the strength of a complaint received from one Jijesh,

a crime was         registered in Museum        police  station as

that on account of consumption of the same, several other

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl.M.C.No.1266 of 2013         5</span>

persons also infected by food poisoning and a death was

reported from Bangalore of one Sachin Mathew Roy who also

consumed     the    'Shavarma' bought   from   'Salwa    Cafe'.

preparation and sale of the same and so they were arrested on

18.7.2012 and were remanded to judicial custody. <a href="/doc/770337/" id="a_17">Section 59</a>

</p><p id="p_6">(iii) of Food Safety and Standard     Act  was   added as that

offence was also committed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      5. When the death of Sachin Mathew Roy was reported

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl.M.C.No.1266 of 2013          6</span>

from Bangalore, Kalasipalayam police registered a case as

UDR.No.52/2012 under <a href="/doc/456664/" id="a_18">section 174</a> of the Code and inquest

was    conducted and postmortem examination was        conducted

and it was revealed that he also died on account of the food

poisoning due to consumption of 'Shavarma' sold from the shop

of the accused persons and on that basis,       they have added

<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_19">Section 304</a> of the Indian Penal Code also and investigation

is pending. When it was revealed that a complaint was filed by

the Food Safety and Standard Authority and that is pending as

C.C.No.231/2012       against the first petitioner and <a href="/doc/770337/" id="a_20">section 59</a>

</p><p id="p_8">(iii) of   Food Safety and Standard Act was added in that

complaint, they filed a report to delete that section from the

First Information Report. The allegation that the police has no

power to investigate the offence under this Act is not correct.

No crime was registered under the provisions of the Food

Safety and Standard Act and the petitioners were not arrested

in connection with the the offences under that Act. They are

independent and distinct offences and it was not covered by the

<a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_21">Special Act</a>.      Dr. G. Samuel has filed a petition along with

father of deceased Sachin Roy Mathew before Kerala State

Human Rights Commission, Thiruvananthapuram and that is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Crl.M.C.No.1266 of 2013          7</span>

also pending       consideration before the Commission       as

HRMP.No.3985/2012 and HRMP.No.4007 of 2012. So according

to the respondents, the petitioners are not entitled to get the

relief of   quashing the proceedings and      they prayed   for

dismissal of the petition.

<p id="p_9">      6. The third respondent filed a statement contending as

severely    affected by    food poisoning by    consuming  the

'Shavarma'        in the  evening on     10.7.2012    from the

restaurant and they were       undergoing  treatment    at PRS

Food       Safety      Officer, Mobile     Vigilance    Squad,

Thiruvananthapuram was entrusted to enquire the matter and

report. By about 8 p.m       on   12.7.2012  he met   Sri.Shobi

Thilakan and Dr. Rakesh of Gastroenterology Department at

the hospital, who was treating these patients and prepared

statement. It is a clear case of food poisoning and Sri. Shobi

Thilakan asserted that the 'Shavarma' he consumed was the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Crl.M.C.No.1266 of 2013          8</span>

reason for the      food poisoning and explained the course of

events as he purchased four 'shavarma' parcel        by 8 p.m on

10.7.2012, went home and he and his wife and two children

ate the same       by 9 p.m. By early morning, all of them started

vomiting and had Diarrhea etc. He had also informed           that

Aravind, aged 14, Muhammed Ammar, aged 8, Krishnanthampi

and three other family members were also under treatment at

the   PRS Hospital due to consumption of 'Shavarma'. Out of

them, Anand was in the IC Unit whose condition was critical.

Food    Safety     Officer,  Mobile      Vigilance         Squad,

Thiruvananthapuram had conducted inspection in the premises

of 'Salwa Cafe' at 9.30 p.m on 12.7.2012 and       found that the

hotel was running in unsanitary conditions and the proprietor

failed to produce the PFA licence or Food Safety Standard

Licence and medical fitness certificate of employees and hence

ordered to close down the hotel under oral instruction from

Commissioner of Food Safety.

<p id="p_11">      7. On 13.7.2012, considering the gravity of offence, the

Commissioner       of  Food   safety  himself issued   emergency

prohibition order under <a href="/doc/884408/" id="a_22">section 34</a> of the Food Safety &amp;

'Salwa Cafe' running in building bearing number 15/1989. The

depositions of the injured were taken on 14.7.2012 from PRS

Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram. On         15.7.2012  there was a

flash news in        visual media that one Scahin Mathew Roy

passed away at Bangalore by consuming 'Shavarma' sold from

the said restaurant. Enquiry was conducted in the matter and

depositions of all concerned were taken by the       Designated

Officer and Food Safety Officer.      These things revealed that

they had also taken     'shavarma'  from the said restaurant on

10.7.2012 night. So it is clear from the circumstances that the

licensee of the shop      had   sold  the unsafe 'Shavarma' and

thereby committed the offence, manufacturing and selling of

unsafe food and thereby        caused death of one person   and

serious injury to several persons.     Sri.A.Satheeshkumar was

appointed as Food Safety Officer for the State of Kerala      by

there is no bar in proceeding against the person in two

those who are violating the provisions of the Act will be held

involved in the manufacture, sale and otherwise connected

with the act of sale and all who were responsible          for the

commission of the offence can be proceeded against. Further

the offences under the Food Safety and Standard Act is a

technical offence and if there is any flow in following the

procedure, it will ends acquittal and scope of investigation is

very less     in that case, whereas offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_51"> the Indian

the two acts were mutually              exclusive and there was no

impediment to their existence side by side two acts did not

impliedly overrule <a href="/doc/356470/" id="a_115">section 133</a> of the Code. While considering

the provisions,    the Supreme Court has observed as follows:

</p><p id="p_44">                "There is   presumption    against    a   repeal    by

         implication; and the reason of this rule is based on the

         theory that the legislature while       enacting a law has

         complete knowledge of the existing       laws on the same

         subject-matter, and therefore, when it does not provide a

         repealing provision, the intention is clear not to repeal the

         existing legislation.
</p>
<p id="p_45">                When the new Act contains a repealing section

         mentioning the     Acts which    expressly    repeals,    the

         presumption    against   implied   repeal of other laws is

         further strengthened on the principle expressio unius

         (persone vel     rei) est exclusio   alterius (The   express

         intention of one person or     thing is the    exclusion   of

         another). The continuance of the existing legislation, in

         the   absence of an       express provision of   repeal by

         implication lies on the party asserting the same. The

         presumption is, however, rebutted and        a    repeal is

         inferred by necessary implication when the provisions of

         the later Act are so inconsistent with or repugnant to the

         provisions of the earlier Act that the two cannot stand

         together. But, if the two can be read together and some

         application can be made of the words in the earlier Act, a

         repeal will not be inferred.
</p>
<p id="p_46">                The necessary questions to be asked are:
</p>
<p id="p_47">         (1)Whether     there is direct conflict   between the two

         provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_48">         (2). Whether     the legislature intended to lay down an

         exhaustive   Code     in  respect of  the   subject -matter

         replacing the earlier law.
</p>
<p id="p_49">         (3) Whether the two laws occupy the same field.

         When the court applies the doctrine, it does no more

         than give effect to the intention of the legislature by

         examining the scope and the object of the two enactments

         and by a comparison of their provisions.     The matter in

         each case is one of the construction and comparison of

         the two statutes. The court leans against implying a

         repeal. To determine whether a later statute repeals by

         implication   an      earlier  statute, it is necessary to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">Crl.M.C.No.1266 of 2013              30</span>

         scrutinize the terms and consider the true meaning and

         effect of the earlier   Act.    Until  this is  done, it is

         impossible to ascertain whether any inconsistency exists

         between the two enactments."

and another and Sondabhai Hanubhai Bharwad v. State

of Gujarat and another (2014 (9) SCC 772), where it has been

observed that provisions under the Mines and Mineral

(Development       and  <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_158">Regulation) Act</a>,    1957 is only barring

investigation of an offence under <a href="/doc/129679104/" id="a_159">Section 4</a>(1-A) read with

Penal Code</a> that will not be a bar for the police to investigate

and file final report and Magistrate taking cognizance of the

offence for that offence.   It is clear from the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_162">General Clauses Act</a> that if the act committed is an offence

under two enactments, there is nothing barring for proceeding

against them under      two    enactments but     they cannot be

sentenced for the same separately. Further if they are distinct

and different offence, then there is no bar for imposing

separate sentence as well as it will not amount to double

jeopardy as provided under <a href="/doc/17858/" id="a_163">Article 20(2)</a> of the Constitution

of India.

<p id="p_58">      34. It is seen from the allegations in the complaint filed by

the Food Safety Officer          under the Food Safety         and

Standard Act that only      the first petitioner had committed

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">Crl.M.C.No.1266 of 2013          36</span>

the offence under that Act, as he being the licensee and owner

of the restaurant, others who are involved in the commission of

the act have not been implicated.    But in the case registered

by the police apart from the first petitioner, others   who are

responsible for running the restaurant and preparation of the

food and sale of the same were also implicated. The procedure

to be followed, nature of evidence to be collected, points to be

proved and ingredients of the offence in both       are entirely

different. One is a technical offence and other is an offence to

be proved based on evidence to be collected by the investigating

agency. Even if technical offence fails, the substantive offence

investigated by the police on the basis of materials collected

will prevail over the other.

<p id="p_59">        35. If the intention of the Legislature is to repeal or

remove the provisions under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_164"> the Indian Penal Code</a> also in

respect of the offence relating to     food, then they ought to

have deleted those provisions also as has been done in

respect of giving bribe from<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_165"> the Indian Penal Code</a>         when

<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_166">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> was enacted dealing with those

acts. That was not done in this case. Further the Legislature

was    very clear     when a   schedule was added,    they only

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">Crl.M.C.No.1266 of 2013         37</span>

repealed certain enactments which were dealing with sale and

manufacture of food earlier and not all the provisions which

were    dealing with the same     subject matter   in the other

enactments like<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_167"> Indian Penal Code</a> also. The above view is clear

from the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/701326/" id="a_168">State of Bombay

v. S.L. Apte</a> (AIR 1961 KHC 537),         <a href="/doc/172560102/" id="a_169">Om Praksh Gupta v.

Ali Khan and others</a> (1988 KHC 1071) as well. So in view of

the authoritative pronouncement of the Supreme Court, I am

with great respect disagreeing with the dictum laid down by the

Allahabad High Court in Writ Petition No.8254(MB)/2010

M/s. Pepsico India Holdings (Pvt). <a href="/doc/443222/" id="a_171">Ltd and another           v.

<p id="p_60">      36. Further it is also seen from the court  before whom

the case is pending, which was instituted on the basis of a

complaint under the Food Safety and Standard Act though

higher punishment was provided that court has no jurisdiction

to award such a        punishment,  whereas   under the police

investigation case, it will be committed to the Sessions Court

and    the Sessions     Court  has   power to     award severe

punishment as provided under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_172"> the Indian Penal Code</a>. Further

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">Crl.M.C.No.1266 of 2013        38</span>

if it is proved by the prosecution that the persons who are

selling the food articles were aware of the consequences of

the food being sold, which is likely to cause injurious to health

and even cause death, then apart from the same being falling

under the provisions of the Food Safety and Standard Act, it

will fall under the provisions of <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_173">Section 304</a> of the Indian

Penal Code as well, which is a distinct and separate offence,

for which prosecution can be independently proceeded with by

the police on the basis of a complaint given by the affected

party. So only the offence under <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_174">Section 59(3)</a> of the Act

alone can be proceeded with by the Food Safety Officer as an

empowered officer and other offences which will not fall

under that Act and persons      against  whom prosecution can

be launched for the same offences, who are not covered by

the Food Safety and Standard Act, the only remedy available

to the affected person is to move the police for regular

investigation under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_175"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure and proceed

against them for the offence provided under the general law

namely<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_176"> Indian Penal Code</a>. So, under the circumstances, the

submission made by the counsel for the petitioners that the

police case initiated on the basis of the complaint is barred in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">Crl.M.C.No.1266 of 2013           39</span>

view of the provisions of the Food Safety and Standard Act is

not sustainable and the same is liable to be rejected and the

petitioners are not entitled to get the relief quashing Crime

No.732/2012 of Museum police station, Thiruvananthapuram

claimed in the petition and the same is liable to be dismissed.
