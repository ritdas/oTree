(Vigilance), Keonjhar in VGR Case No. 19 of 2011 and have further

prayed to discharge them from the offences under Sections 13(2) read

with <a href="/doc/1101716/" id="a_1">Section 13(1)(d)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act,1968, <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_2">Sections

1988.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2.          Since all these Revision Petitions are arising out of the

very same impugned order dated 19.07.2019 passed in VGR Case No.

19 of 2011 by the learned Special Judge (Vigilance), Keonjhar, they

are heard together analogously and disposed of by this common

order.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.          The case in nutshell is that a mining lease was granted in

favour of Late Banshidhar Patnaik, the father of the accused-

petitioner in CRLREV No.534/2019 Jitendranath Patnaik over an

area of Ac.260.00 dec. for Manganese and Iron Ore. Mining lease so

granted for Manganese was for 20 years and for Iron Ore was for 30

years. The lease period started on 31.07.1959. However, in the year

1967 said Banshidhar Patnaik surrendered the mining lease in

respect of Manganese but continued in respect of Iron Ore. Before

expiry of the said lease period, he applied for renewal of the lease on

30.07.1988 for the break up area, but without the de-reservation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               -4-</span>


proposal though there were forest areas within the applied area.

However, no renewal of fresh lease was granted in his favour after

31.07.1989, but the period was further extended for one year more

i.e., till 31.07.1990 in view of Rule 24-A of the Mineral Concession

Rules, 1960 as it then was.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">4.         Allegedly accused Jitendranath Patnaik (petitioner in

CRLREV No. 534/2019), on 7.11.1991 applied on behalf of his father

Bansidhar Patnaik to the Government in the Department of Steel and

Mines through the Deputy Director of Mines, Joda for grant of

working permission pending renewal of mining lease.      The working

permission was granted for 6 months and extended from time to time

till 26.12.1994 without any approval by the Ministry of Environment

and Forest. Said Banshidhar Patnaik (father of the petitioner) died on

5.11.1995. The Ministry of Environment and Forest in its letter dated

3.9.1998 communicated the permission for DRP (De-reservation

Proposal) over an area of Hc.18.02 for 10 years which was

coterminous with the permission granted under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_9">MMDR Act</a>.


</p><p id="p_9">5.         In the meantime accused Jitendranath Patnaik in his

letter dated 6.9.1996 requested the Government in Steel and Mines

Department for 20 years renewal of the mining lease, however,

without submitting the application in proper form. Further, another

proposal for renewal was submitted by the said accused Jitendranath

Patnaik on 25.07.2008 for 20 years enclosing       a WILL, allegedly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 -5-</span>


executed by his father Late Banshidhar Patnaik, which was already

declared forged by the learned District Judge, Keonjhar vide its order

dated 26.3.2001 passed in Misc. Case No. 5 of 1996.


</p><p id="p_10">6.          It is the case of the prosecution that, the said accused

Jitendranath Patnaik in conspiracy with other accused persons

continued the illegal mining activities from 1999 to 2009 causing

heavy pecuniary loss to the Government to the tune of Rs.130.39

crores, and to their personal gain.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">7.          The FIR was lodged on 18.11.2009 by the D.S.P.,Vigilance

and charge sheet was submitted on 26.03.2013. The learned Judge

took cognizance of the aforesaid offences on 11.06.2013.    There were

15 numbers of accused persons and due to death of one accused,

namely, S. Sahoo, presently 14 accused persons are there.


</p><p id="p_13">8.          Except the petitioner-accused Jitendranath Patnaik, all

other petitioners-accused persons are Government Officials.       The

common submission on behalf of all the petitioners in challenging the

impugned order of the learned Vigilance Judge, with prayer for

discharge, is that the court below has failed to appreciate the

provision of law that, in absence of the complaint being presented by

the competent authority, the order of cognizance is not sustainable in

the eye of law. As per <a href="/doc/83054370/" id="a_10">Section 22</a> of the MMDR Act, since there is a

bar for taking cognizance of any offence under the said Act unless the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                -6-</span>


complaint in writing is made by a person authorized in this behalf by

the Government, the cognizance taken on the report of Vigilance

Police is bad in the eye of law.     It is further submitted that in the

Orissa Minerals (Prevention of Theft, Smuggling &amp; Illegal Mining and

Regulation of   Possession, Storage, Trading     and    Transportation)

Rules, 2007 (hereinafter referred as OMPTS Rules), the „competent

authority‟ as defined under Rule 2(1)(b) is any officer mentioned in

Schedule-I appended to the said Rules.       Bringing attention of this

Court to said Schedule -I, it is pointed out that the name of any such

Vigilance Official is not appearing as such in the schedule. Therefore,

the complaint at the instance of the Vigilance Police and initiation of

the proceeding thereof by taking cognizance of the offences by the

court below is vitiated. It is also submitted that, whatever may be the

contravention is, of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_11">MMDR Act</a> or MCD Rules,

the same never mean to constitute the offence of theft. The learned

court below has not appreciated the law properly, and held that, since

the petitioner did not challenge the order taking cognizance of the

offences, their prayer for discharge at this stage cannot be

entertained. In addition to this submission, it is also submitted on

behalf of the petitioners Akshya Kumar Das (petitioner in CRLREV

No.615/2019) and Nityananda Mohanty (petitioner in CRLREV

No.616/2019) that, they have retired from service on 30.04.1994 and

in the year 1996 respectively and therefore, initiation of any judicial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  -7-</span>


proceeding against them after four years of their retirement is not

permissible in view of the provision contained in Rule 7(2)(c) of the

OCS (Pension) Rules, 1992.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">9.          In support of their contention that, the cognizance of the

offences under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_12">MMDR Act</a> and MCD Rules without the complaint

being lodged by any competent authority as per the mandate in

<a href="/doc/83054370/" id="a_13">Section 22</a> of the MMDR Act and Schedule-I of the OMPTS Rules is

unsustainable and      the proceeding against the petitioners is also

vitiated, they rely on the decision in the case of State of NCT of Delhi

Vs. Sanjay, reported in (2014) 9 SCC 772 and a judgment of this

Court dated 9.7.2019 passed in CRLMC No. 2440 of 2010 (Ramesh

Kumar Agrawal Vs. State of Odisha &amp; Ors.), reported in 2019 SCC

Online Ori.226.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">10.         On the other hand it is submitted on behalf of Vigilance

Department that, the Vigilance Officials have been duly empowered

and authorized to conduct enquiry and investigation in respect of all

such offences by the Notification of Government dated 14.01.2010.

Therefore, the contention of the petitioners that the Vigilance D.S.P. is

not authorized to lodge the complaint in respect of those offences is

not at all correct and liable to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_18">11.         To examine this submission, it is first required to see

Sec.22 of the MMDR Act and the relevant provisions of the OMTPS

Rules. <a href="/doc/83054370/" id="a_14">Section 22</a> speaks as follows:

<p id="p_20">12.           Rule 15 of the OMPTS Rules prescribes that, no court

<p id="p_47">14.            In the case of State of NCT (supra), the Hon‟ble Supreme

Court has held at paragraphs 69 and 70 as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">               "69. Considering the principles of interpretation and the wordings
              used in <a href="/doc/83054370/" id="a_31">Section 22</a>, in our considered opinion, the provision is not
              a complete and absolute bar for taking action by the police for
              illegal and dishonestly committing theft of minerals including sand
              from the riverbed. The Court shall take judicial notice of the fact
              that over the years rivers in India have been affected by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                  -11-</span>


           alarming rate of unrestricted sand mining which is damaging the
           ecosystem of the rivers and safety of bridges. It also weakens
           riverbeds, fish breeding and destroys the natural habitat of many
           organisms. If these illegal activities are not stopped by the State
           and the police authorities of the State, it will cause serious
           repercussions as mentioned hereinabove. It will not only change
           the river hydrology but also will deplete the groundwater levels.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">              70. There cannot be any dispute with regard to restrictions
           imposed under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_32">MMDR Act</a> and remedy provided therein. In
           any case, where there is a mining activity by any person in
           contravention of the provisions of <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_33">Section 4</a> and other sections of
           the Act, the officer empowered and authorised under the Act shall
           exercise all the powers including making a complaint before the
           Jurisdictional Magistrate. It is also not in dispute that the
           Magistrate shall in such cases take cognizance on the basis of the
           complaint filed before it by a duly authorised officer. In case of
           breach and violation of <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_34">Section 4</a> and other provisions of the Act,
           the police officer cannot insist the Magistrate for taking
           cognizance under the Act on the basis of the record submitted by
           the police alleging contravention of the said Act. In other words,
           the prohibition contained in <a href="/doc/83054370/" id="a_35">Section 22</a> of the Act against
           prosecution of a person except on a complaint made by the officer
           is attracted only when such person is sought to be prosecuted for
           contravention of <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_36">Section 4</a> of the Act and not for any act or
           omission which constitutes an offence under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_37"> the Penal Code</a>."</blockquote><p id="p_48">

</p><p id="p_49">           Similarly this Court in the case of Ramesh Kumar

Agrawal (supra), relying on the aforesaid decision of the Supreme

Court has quashed the order of cognizance taken for the offence

under <a href="/doc/53181972/" id="a_38">Section 21</a> of the MMDR Act.
</p>
<p id="p_50">
</p><p id="p_51">15.        It is true that in the aforesaid two cases relied upon by

the petitioners, the Police had instituted the complaint and submitted

the final report. The Police had no authorization for doing enquiry or

investigation or to take any legal action in respect of any offence

under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_39">MMDR Act</a>.       But here is a case, which clearly shows that

the Vigilance Police of and above the rank of Inspector, have been

specifically authorized to conduct the investigation/enquiry and to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                 -12-</span>


take all legal action pertaining to illegal mining activities in the State

including the offences under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_40">MMDR Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_41">Forest Conservation Act</a>

and OMPTS Rules.        It is true that none of the petitioners have

challenged or are questioning the power of Government to issue the

Notification dated 14.01.2010 authorising Vigilance Police in that

respect. Undisputedly the validity of notification dated 14.1.2010 is

not questioned. The averments and submissions made on behalf of

the petitioners are completely silent about the said Notification made

in favour of the Vigilance Police. On the other hand, as seen from the

Notification dated 14.01.2020 issued by the Government in Home

Department and the Notification dated 19.12.2009 issued by the Steel

and Mines Department, Government of Odisha, they are neither

overlapping to each other nor the Notification dated 14.01.2010 is

found in conflict with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_42">MMDR Act</a> or the OMPTS

Rules. A bare perusal of the notification dated 14.01.2010         clearly

shows that it has given power to the Vigilance Police to investigate or

lodge complaint for such offences under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_43">MMDR Act</a> and other

relevant Acts / Rules. Therefore, in view of the specific authorization

made in favour of the Vigilance Officials in that respect, the

contentions of the petitioners cannot be accepted that the Dy.

Superintendent of Police (Vigilance) is not authorized to file the

complaint for the offences against the requirement of <a href="/doc/83054370/" id="a_44">Section 22</a> of

the MMDR Act. Therefore, in my considered opinion the complaint at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                 -13-</span>


the instance of Vigilance Police and investigation conducted by them

against the petitioners is maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_52">
</p><p id="p_53">16.         It would not be out of place to mention here that the

'competent authority' as prescribed in Rule 15 of the OMPTS Rules is

in addition to the „person authorized' as mentioned in <a href="/doc/83054370/" id="a_45">Section 22</a> of

the MMDR Act. Therefore, it is immaterial to discuss who would be

the competent authority for the purpose, because the term „competent

authority‟ is in addition to the „person authorized in this behalf‟ as per

Rule 15 of the OMPTS Rules, against the prescription of <a href="/doc/83054370/" id="a_46">Section 22</a> of

the MMDR Act.
</p>
<p id="p_54">
</p><p id="p_55">17.         It is argued on behalf of the petitioners that the action in

lifting the mineral even by violating the provisions as per the

allegations would never amount to theft under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_47"> the Indian Penal Code</a>.

But, in my considered view, this argument does not appear

convincing in view of the observation of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court

made in the case relied upon by the petitioners in the case of State of

NCT (supra). It is further observed in the said decision that where a

person without any lease or license or authority extract minerals and

remove and transport them with an intent to remove dishonestly, is

liable to be punished of committing such offence under <a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_48">Sections 378</a>

and <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_49">379</a> of the IPC. In paragraphs 71, 72 and 73 of the judgment the

Hon‟ble Supreme Court held as follows:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                  -14-</span><p id="p_56">


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                 "71. However,    there may be a situation where a person

         those minerals in a clandestine manner with an intent to remove
         dishonestly those minerals from the possession of the State, is
         liable to be punished for committing such offence under <a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_50">Sections
         378</a> and <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_51">379</a> of the Penal Code.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                  72. From a close reading of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_52">MMDR
         Act</a> and the offence defined under <a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_53">Section 378</a> IPC, it is manifest
         that the ingredients constituting the offence are different. The
         contravention of terms and conditions of mining lease or doing
         mining activity in violation of <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_54">Section 4</a> of the Act is an offence
         punishable under <a href="/doc/53181972/" id="a_55">Section 21</a> of the MMDR Act, whereas
         dishonestly removing sand, gravel and other minerals from the
         river, which is the property of the State, out of the State's
         possession without the consent, constitute an offence of theft.
         Hence, merely because initiation of proceeding for commission of
         an offence under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_56">MMDR Act</a> on the basis of complaint cannot
         and shall not debar the police from taking action against persons
         for committing theft of sand and minerals in the manner
         mentioned above by exercising power under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_57"> the Code</a> of Criminal
         Procedure and submit a report before the Magistrate for taking
         cognizance against such persons. In other words, in a case where
         there is a theft of sand and gravel from the government land, the
         police can register a case, investigate the same and submit a final
         report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_58">Section 173</a> CrPC before a Magistrate having
         jurisdiction for the purpose of taking cognizance as provided in
         <a href="/doc/954690/" id="a_59">Section 190(1)(d)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                  73. After giving our thoughtful consideration in the matter,
         in the light of the relevant provisions of the Act vis-à-vis<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_60"> the Code</a>
         of Criminal Procedure and<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_61"> the Penal Code</a>, we are of the definite
         opinion that the ingredients constituting the offence under the
         <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_62">MMDR Act</a> and the ingredients of dishonestly removing sand and
         gravel from the riverbeds without consent, which is the property of
         the State, is a distinct offence under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_63">IPC</a>. Hence, for the
         commission of offence under <a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_64">Section 378</a> IPC, on receipt of the
         police report, the Magistrate having jurisdiction can take
         cognizance of the said offence without awaiting the receipt of
         complaint that may be filed by the authorised officer for taking
         cognizance in respect of violation of various provisions of the
         <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_65">MMDR Act</a>. Consequently, the contrary view taken by the different
         High Courts cannot be sustained in law and, therefore, overruled.
         Consequently, these criminal appeals are disposed of with a

<p id="p_57">18.        The additional argument, what is urged on behalf of the

from service since 1994 and 1996 respectively and cognizance being
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                 -15-</span>


taken on 11.06.2013, the same is barred under Section 7(2)(c) of the

OCS (Pension) Rules, 1992, is not found acceptable.      It is because

Rule 7 has a limited field of application and cannot be extended to

put an absolute bar against criminal prosecution. In the case of State

of Maharashtra Vs. Keshav Ramchandra Pangare &amp; Another,

reported in (1999) 9 SCC 479, the respondent Keshav Ramchandra

Pangare retired as Dy.Engineer, P.W.D. in the State of Maharaashtra.

challenge before the Bombay High Court was that the complaint being

filed beyond the period of four years from the date of commission of

the offence, it is barred by Rule 27(3) of the Maharashtra Civil

Services (Pension) Rules, 1982. The Bombay High Court accepted the

plea and held that Rule 27 of the Pension Rules was directly

applicable and it is mandatory that prosecution should be launched

within four years from the date of commission of offence and

consequently   quashed    the    criminal   proceeding   against   the

respondent. The said judgment was challenged by the State of

Maharashtra before the Supreme Court. Rule 27 of the Maharashtra

Civil Services (Pension) Rules 1982 is a pari materia provision with

Rule 7 of the OCS (Pension) Rules, 1992. On interpretation, it is held

by the Supreme Court that, those provisions of the Pension Rules is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                   -16-</span>


only meant for the purpose of granting, withholding or withdrawing

the pension and it‟s operation would be in the limited field and cannot

supersede the period of limitation prescribed under the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_79">Cr.P.C</a>. The

relevant observation of the Supreme Court is reproduced below:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">            "9. Similarly, in the present case, Rule 27(1) provides the right of
     Government to withhold or withdraw a pension and in that context the
     said rule is to be interpreted. Under the said rule, the Government may,
     inter alia, order withholding or withdrawing a pension or any part
     thereof, if, in any departmental or judicial proceedings, the pensioner is
     found guilty of grave misconduct or negligence during the period of his
     service. It also empowers the Government to order the recovery from
     such pension of the whole or part of any pecuniary loss caused to the
     Government if, in any departmental or judicial proceedings the
     pensioner is found guilty of grave misconduct or negligence during the
     period of his service. In the context of the second part of sub rule (1),
     sub rule (3) is to be read and interpreted. If something is to be recovered
     from the pension payable to the employee then the judicial proceeding or
     departmental inquiry is required to be started within the period
     prescribed under the sub-rule (2) or sub-rule (3) but that would not
     debar the prosecuting agency from launching the prosecution for the
     offence of grave misconduct. This rule is to be read with the previous
     Rule 26 which provides that future good conduct shall be an implied
     condition of every grant of pension and Government may withhold or
     withdraw a pension or part thereof, if the pensioner is convicted of a
     serious crime or is found guilty of grave misconduct. But the Pension
     Rules 26 and 27 do not lay down any period of limitation for prosecution
     or could not supersede the period of limitation prescribed under
     the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_80">Cr.P.C</a>. Rule 27 is only meant for the purpose of granting,
     withholding or withdrawing the pension and hence its operation would
     be in the limited field of granting or withholding pension to the
     Government employees.

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">     10.    Relying upon the decision in State of Punjab Vs. Kailash
     Nath,(1989)1 SCC 321, the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High
     Court in <a href="/doc/1360894/" id="a_81">Prabhakar Govind Sawant v. State of Maharashtra and others</a>,
     (1991) Maharashtra Law Journal 1051, rejected the contention that the
     prosecution was barred under Rule 27 of the Pension Rules as it was
     launched after the period of four years. In that case, the learned Judge
     also referred to <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_82">Article 254</a> of the Constitution and held that the
     provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_83"> of the Criminal Procedure Code</a> shall have an overriding effect
     and shall prevail notwithstanding any provision in the Pension Rules
     framed by the State Government. It is unfortunate that the attention of
     the learned Single Judge was not drawn to the said decisions which are
     of a binding nature at least as far as the High Court is concerned. That
     apart, learned Single Judge, instead of jumping to a conclusion solely
     based on Rule 27 of the Pension Rules should have examined the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                 -17-</span>


       relevant provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_84"> of the Code</a> before axing   down   the   criminal
       prosecution in respect of serious offences."

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">            This Court also by relying the said decision of the

Supreme Court, in the case of Fani Bhusan Das &amp; Anr. Vs. State

of Odisha (CRLMC Nos. 258 &amp;686 of 2004, and 2626 of 2007),

reported in 2018 SCC Online 310, has observed that the provision

of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_85">Cr.P.C</a>. shall have an overriding effect and shall prevail

notwithstanding any provision in the Pension Rules, and therefore,

the provisions of OCS (Pension) Rules, 1992 would not give any relief

to the petitioners.</blockquote><p id="p_58">

</p><p id="p_59">            So the contention of these two petitioners to give them

immune from criminal prosecution by virtue of Rule-7 of the OCS

(Pension) Rules is found without substance and accordingly rejected.


</p><p id="p_60">19.         A further contention is made on behalf of the petitioner

Jitendranath Patnaik that in absence of all legal heirs of the lessee

Late Bansidhar Patnaik, the prosecution against him alone is not

maintainable. This contention has no leg to stand because as per the

allegation he is the only legal heir of late Bansidhar Patnaik, who

applied for renewal by producing the forged WILL and is also the

beneficiary of the ill-got minerals. When other legal heirs have not

played any role in such illegal mining, they need not be brought into

the sphere of prosecution because onl--y being the legal heirs under

the law will not attract any offence itself, without actus reus and mens

rea.
