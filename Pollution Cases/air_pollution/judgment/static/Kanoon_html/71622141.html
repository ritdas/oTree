<p id="p_1">1.		The
present Special Criminal Application under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the
Constitution of India read with <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_2">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal
Procedure has been preferred by the petitioner herein -
original complainant - Gujarat Pollution Control Board to quash
and set aside the impugned judgement and order dated 21/03/2007
passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Gondal Camp at Jetpur in
Criminal Revision Application No.37 of 2003 as well as order passed
by learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Jetpur dated 30/12/2002
passed below Exh-54 in Criminal Case No.379 of 1989, by which,
learned Magistrate has discharged respondent Nos.2 &amp; 3 herein -
original accused for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/73521/" id="a_3">Sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/120844/" id="a_4">44</a>
read with 47 of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1974 [hereinafter referred to as "the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water Act</a>"] for
breach of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_7">Sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_8">25</a> of the Water Act. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_2">2.		Facts
leading to the present petition, in nutshell, are as under: 
</p>
 


<p id="p_3">		The
petitioner herein - original complainant has filed/instituted
Criminal Case No.379 of 1989 against the accused persons for the
offences punishable under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_9">Sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_10">44</a> read with 47 of the
<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">Water Act</a>, who was authorised person to file the complaint for and on
behalf of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. That the learned
Magistrate directed to issue summons/ process against the accused
persons for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_12">Sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_13">44</a> read
with 47 of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_14">Water Act</a>. Thereafter, the accused persons submitted
application Exh-54 in Criminal Case No.379 of 1989 before learned
Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Jetpur for discharge solely on the
ground that the petitioner, who filed the complaint was not
authorised and he cannot be said to have authority to file the
complaint. Relying upon decision of the learned Single Judge of this
Court reported in 2002(1) GCD 472, learned Magistrate has allowed the
said application and discharged the accused persons on the ground
that the petitioner was not having authority to file the complaint
for and on behalf of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. Being
aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the order passed by learned
Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Jetpur dated 30/12/2002 passed
below Exh-54 in Criminal Case No.379 of 1989 in discharging the
accused persons, the petitioner herein - original complainant
preferred Criminal Revision Application No.37 of 2003 before learned
Sessions Court and learned Additional Sessions Judge, Gondal Camp at
Jetpur by order dated 21/03/2007 has been pleased to dismiss the said
Criminal Revision Application and has confirmed the order passed by
learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Jetpur. Being aggrieved by
and dissatisfied with the aforesaid two orders, the petitioner herein
</p><p id="p_4">- original complainant has preferred the present petition under
<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_15">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_5">3.		Mr.Meena,
learned advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner herein -
original complainant has submitted that the decision of the learned
Single Judge reported in 2002(1) GCD 472 (supra), which has been
relied upon by both the Courts below, has been set aside by Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Gujarat Pollution Control Board V/s.
Nicosulf Industries &amp; Exports Private Limited and others reported
2009(2) SCC 171 and it is held that grant of sanction to file
the complaint would be in law and authorisation to file the complaint
and, therefore, authorisation/ sanction would be a valid if it is
given by the State Board. Therefore, it is requested to allow the
present petition and to quash and set aside the orders passed by both
the Courts below  and direct the concerned Magistrate to proceed
further with the aforesaid case in accordance with law and on merits.
</p>

 


 


 


<p id="p_6">4.		Mr.Trivedi,
learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original accused is not
in a position to dispute that the decision of the learned Single
Judge, which has been relied upon by both the Courts below, has been
set aside by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Nicosulf
Industries &amp; Exports Private Limited and others (supra) and
he is also not in a position to show any contrary decision to the law
laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of  Nicosulf
Industries &amp; Exports Private Limited and others (supra). 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_7">5.		Mr.K.L.Pandya,
learned Additional Public Prosecutor has supported the learned
advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner herein -
original complainant and has requested to allow the present petition.
</p>

 


 


 


<p id="p_8">6.		Heard
learned advocates appearing on behalf of the respective parties at
length. Considering the order passed by learned Judicial Magistrate,
First Class, Jetpur passed below Exh-54 in Criminal Case No.379 of
1989 discharging the accused persons as well as impugned judgement
and order dated 21/03/2007 passed by the learned Revisional Court
confirming the order passed by learned Judicial Magistrate, First
Class, Jetpur, it appears that both the Courts below have relied upon
the decision of the learned Single Judge in the case of Nicosulf
Industries &amp; Exports Private Limited and others (Supra) while
discharging the accused persons. It is not in dispute that decision
of the learned Single Judge rendered in the case of Nicosulf
Industries &amp; Exports Private Limited and others (supra) has
been set aside by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Gujarat
Pollution Control Board V/s. Nicosulf Industries &amp; Exports
Private Limited and others reported in 2009(2) SCC 171 and
in Paragraph Nos.16 and 17, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed
and held as under: 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_9">"16.	There
is no substantial difference in the language of the amended Section
</p><p id="p_10">49. The High Court proceeded on the basis that the complaint was
illegal since the complaint filed was not duly authorised. Though the
High Court proceeded on the basis of amended <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_16">Section 49</a>, the amended
as well as unamended provisions require the State Board to file a
complaint or to authorise any of its officers to file the complaint.
The authorisation has to be by the State Board. According to the
Board, under <a href="/doc/546828/" id="a_17">Section 11-A</a> of the Act it had delegated to the Chairman
the power to authorize an officer to file a complaint. The Resolution
dated 27-3-1984 refers to the delegation of power for sanctioning
prosecution. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_11">17.	The
High Court has held that the power to sanction a complaint is
distinct from the power to authorise the complaint. This view is
clearly unsustainable for the reason that if the provisions are
construed in the context that as a check over the complaint filed,
then the grant of sanction to file a complaint would be in law an
authorisation to file the complaint. The stand of the appellant is
that the difference between sanction and authorisation in the context
of provisions of the Act and in contradistinction to the provisions
of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18">IPC</a> and<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_19"> the Code</a> is more semantic than real. The stand is well
founded." 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_12">7.		Under
the circumstances, view taken by the learned Single Judge in the case
of Nicosulf Industries &amp; Exports Private Limited and others
(supra) has not been accepted by Hon'ble Supreme Court and the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has held and observed as above. Under the
circumstances, the impugned order passed by learned Judicial
Magistrate, First Class, Jetpur discharging the accused persons on
the ground that the petitioner, who has filed the impugned complaint
was not authorised to file the complaint, cannot be sustained and the
same deserves to be quashed and set aside. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_13">8.		In
view of the above and for the reasons stated hereinabove, the
application succeeds. The judgement and order dated 21/03/2007 passed
by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Gondal Camp at Jetpur in
Criminal Revision Application No.37 of 2003 as well as order dated
30/12/2002 passed by learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Jetpur
below Exh-54 in Criminal Case No.379 of 1989 are hereby quashed and
set aside and learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Jetpur is
hereby directed to proceed further with Criminal Case No.379 of 1989
in accordance with law and on merits. Rule is made absolute to the
aforesaid extent.
