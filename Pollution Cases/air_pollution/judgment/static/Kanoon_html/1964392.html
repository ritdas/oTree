</pre><p id="p_1">		      J U D G M E N T
Kuldip Singh, J.
</p><p id="p_2">     Taj Mahal - The Taj - is the "King Emperor" amongst the
World -	 Wonders. The  Taj is the final achievement and acme
of the	Moghul Art. It represents the most refined aesthetic
values. It  is a  fantasy - like grandeur. It is the perfect
culmination and	 artistic interplay of the architects' skill
and the	 jewellers' inspiration.  The marble-in-lay walls of
The  Taj  are  amongst	the  most  outstanding	examples  of
decorative workmanship. The elegant symmetry of its exterior
and the	 aerial grace  of its domes and minarets impress the
be holder  in a	 manner never to be forgotten. It stands out
as  one	  of  the   most  priceless  national  monument,  of
surpassing beauty  and worth,  a glorious  tribute to  man's
achievement in Architecture and Engineering.
</p><p id="p_3">     Lord Roberts  in his  work "Forty	one years  in India"
describes The Taj as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "Neither  words  nor  pencil  could
     give to the most imaginative reader
     the  slightest   idea  of	all  the
     satisfying	 beauty	 and  purity  of
     this glorious  conception. To those
     who have  not seen it, I would say,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     - Go  to India;  the Taj  alone  is
     well worth the journey."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     A poet describes The Taj as under:-
     "It is too pure, too holy to be the
     work of  human hands.  Angels  must
     have brought  it from  heaven and a
     glass case should be thrown over it
     to preserve  it from each breath of
     air."</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">     Sammuel Smith  in his  Book about	The Taj explains the
impact as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     "We stood	spell-bound  for  a  few
     minutes at	 this lovely apparition;
     it hardly seems of the earth. It is
     more  like	 a  dream  of  Celestial
     beauty, no	 words can  describe it.
     We felt  that all	previous  sights
     were damned  in comparison, No such
     effect is	produced  by  the  first
     view of  St. Peter's  or  Milan  or
     cologne Cathedrals.  They	are  all
     majestic, but  this is  enchantment
     itself. So perfect is its form that
     all other structures seem clumsy."</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">     The Taj is threatened with deterioration and damage not
only by	 the  traditional  causes  of  decay,  but  also  by
changing social	 and economic conditions which aggravate the
situation with	even more  formidable phenomena of damage or
destruction.  A	 private  sector  preservation	organisation
called "World Monuments Fund" (American Express Company) has
published a  list of 100 most endangered sites (1996) in the
World. The  Taj has  been included in the list by stating as
under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     "The Taj  Mahal -	Agra- India" The
     Taj Mahal,	 Marble Tomb  for Mumtaz
     Mahal, wife  of emperor Shah Jahan,
     is considered the epitome of Mughal
     monumental domed  tombs  set  in  a
     garden. The  environment of Agra is
     today best	 with problems	relating
     to	 the  inadequacy  of  its  urban
     infrastructure for	 transportation,
     water and	electricity. The densest
     pollution near  the  Taj  Mahal  is
     caused    by    residential    fuel
     combustion,   diesel   trains   and
     buses,  and   back-up   generators.
     Construction of  the proposed  Agra
     Ring Road	and  Bypass  that  would
     divert the estimated daily 6,50,000
     tons of  trans-India truck	 traffic
     awaits financing.	Strick	controls
     on industrial pollution established
     in	 1982	are  being   intensively
     enforced following	 a 1993	 Supreme
     court Order.  The Asian Development
     Bank's proposed  $300 million  loan
     to the Indian government to finance
     infrastructure  improvement   would
     provide the  opportunity  to  solve
     the chronic problems. Agra contains
     three   World    Heritage	  Sites,
     including the Taj Mahal."</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">     According	 to    the   petitioner,    the	  foundries,
chemical/hazardous industries  and the	refinery at  Mathura
are  the   major  sources   of	damage	 to  The   Taj.	 The
sulphurdioxide emitted	by  the	 Mathura  Refinery  and	 the
industries when	 combined with	Oxygen -  with	the  aid  of
moisture -  in the  atmosphere forms  sulphuric acid  called
"Acid rain"  which has	a corroding  effect on	the gleaming
white marble.  Industrial/Refinery  emissions,	brick-kilns,
vehicular   traffic   and   generator-sets   are   primarily
responsible  for   polluting  the  ambient  air	 around	 Taj
Trapezium (TTZ).  The petition	states that the white marble
has yellowed  and blackened  in places. It is inside the Taj
that the  decay is more apparent. Yellow pallor pervades the
entire monument.  In places  the yellow	 hue is magnified by
ugly brown and black spots. Fungal deterioration is worst in
the inner  chamber where  the original	graves of shah-Jahan
and Mumtaz  Mahal lie. According to the petitioner The Taj -
a monument  of international  repute -	is  on	its  way  to
degradation  due   to  atmospheric   pollution	and   it  is
imperative that	 preventive steps  are taken  and soon.	 The
petitioner has	finally sought appropriate directions to the
authorities concerned  to take	immediate steps	 to stop air
pollution in the TTZ and save The Taj.
</p><p id="p_7">     The Report	 of the	 Expert Committee  called "Report on
Environmental  Impact  of  Mathura  Refinery"  (Varadharajan
Committee) published  by the Government of India in 1978 has
been annexed  along with  the writ petition. Para 4.1 of the
conclusions therein is as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     "There  is	  substantial  level  of
     pollution of  sulphur  dioxide  and
     particulate  matter   in  the  Agra
     region. The  possible  sources  are
     all coal  users consisting	 of  two
     Power Plants,  a  number  of  small
     industries	    mainly     foundries
     (approximately 250)  and a	 Railway
     Shunting Yard.  As far as suspended
     particulate matters  are concerned,
     because	of    use    of	   coal,
     contribution will	be  substantial.
     Even though  the  total  amount  of
     emission of  sulphur  dioxide  from
     these  sources  may  be  small,  on
     account of	 their proximity  to the
     monuments,	 their	contribution  to
     the air quality of the zone will be
     considerably high."</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">     Varadharajan  Committee   made,   among   others,	 the
following recommendations:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     "Steps may	 be taken to ensure that
     no	 new  industry	including  small
     industries or other units which can
     cause   pollution	  are	 located
     northwest	 of    the   Taj   Mahal
     .................	Efforts	 may  be
     made to relocate the existing small
     industries,    particularly     the
     foundries, in an area south east of
     Agra beyond  the Taj  Mahal so that
     emissions	from   these  industries
     will not be in the direction of the
     monuments.	      ..................
     Similar considerations may apply to
     large industries such as Fertilizer
     &amp; Petrochemicals.	Such  industries
     which   are    likely   to	   cause
     environmental pollution  may not be
     located in the neighbourhood of the
     refinery.	The   Committee	 further
     recommends that  no large	industry
     in	 the   Agra   region   and   its
     neighbourhood    be     established
     without   conducting    appropriate
     detailed  studies	 to  assess  the
     environmental   effect    of   such
     industries	  on	the   monuments.
     Location should  be so chosen as to
     exclude	 any	 increase     in
     environmental  pollution	in   the
     area.    ..........The    Committee
     wishes to	record its  deep concern
     regarding	the  existing  level  of
     pollution in  Agra.  It  recommends
     that an  appropriate  authority  be
     created   which	could	 monitor
     emissions by  industries as well as
     the  air	quality	 at  Agra  on  a
     continuous	 basis.	 This  authority
     should be	vested	with  powers  to
     direct industries causing pollution
     to limit  the level of emission and
     specify  such   measures	as   are
     necessary to  reduce  the	emission
     whenever the pollutant level at the
     monuments	  exceeds     acceptable
     limits. The  Committee particularly
     desires that  recommendations  made
     in regard	to reduction of existing
     pollution levels  at Agra should be
     converted to a time-bound programme
     and  should   be  implemented  with
     utmost  speed.   ............   The
     Committee	also   recommends   that
     studies  should  be  undertaken  by
     competent agencies	 to explore  the
     possibility   of	protecting   the
     monuments	by   measures  such   as
     provision of  a green  belt  around
     Agra in  the region between Mathura
     and   Agra.   ..............   Even
     though   assurances    have    been
     obtained  from  IOC  that	adequate
     precaution	 would	 be   taken   to
     contain the pollution on account of
     using coal	 in the power plant, the
     Committee is  of the  opinion  that
     till  such	 time  this  problem  is
     studied  in   depth  and	suitable
     technologies have	been found to be
     satisfactorily  in	 use  elsewhere,
     the use  of coal  in  the	refinery
     power plant should be deferred."</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">     The Central  Board for  the Prevention  and Control  of
Water Pollution,  new Delhi,  published a report (Control of
Urban  Pollution  Series  CUPS/7/1981-82)  under  the  title
"Inventory and	Assessment  of	Pollution  Emission  in	 and
Around	Agra-Mathura   Region  (Abridged)".   The   relevant
findings are as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     "Industrial activities which are in
     operation	in  Agra  city	and  its
     outskirts could  be categorized  as
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     (i)  Ferrous  Metal  Casting  using
     Cupolas (Foundry); (ii) Ferro-alloy
     and  Non-Ferrous	Castings   using
     Crucibles,	 Rotary	  Furnaces  etc.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">     (iii) Rubber  Processing; (iv) Lime
     Oxidation	and   Pulverising;   (v)
     Engineering;  (vi)	  Chemical;  and
     (Table  4-1).   .............   The
     contribution  of	sulphur	 dioxide
     through emission primarily from the
     combustion	   from	    the	   fuels
     comprising hard  coke, steam  coal,
     wood and  fuel oil	 is estimated as
     3.64 tonnes per day from industrial
     activities in the Agra City and its
     outskirts	  (Table    5-3).    The
     vehicular contribution as estimated
     from  traffic   census  in	 6  road
     crossings is  only 65  kg a  day or
     0.065 tonnes  a day  and should  be
     considered	  negligible   for   the
     present   (Para   7.4).   ......The
     Contribution  of	sulphur	 dioxide
     from  the	 5  recognised	distinct
     discrete sources  in tonnes per day
     are  2.28,	 2.28,	1.36,  1.21  and
     0.065 from	 (i) two  thermal  power
     stations,	(ii)   foundries,   (ii)
     other industries  in Agra	(iv) two
     railway marshalling  yards and  (v)
     Vehicular	 traffic   respectively.
     Omitting	  contribution	    from
     vehicular traffic	as because it is
     considered negligible, the relative
     contributions  from   the	other  4
     distinct sources are 32, 32, 19 and
     16.9 per cent. With the elimination
     of	 the   first  and   the	 further
     sources-by	 closing  down	the  two
     thermal power station and replacing
     coal fired	 steam engines by diesel
     engines   in    the   two	 railway
     marshalling yards-about 50 per cent
     (48.9 to  be  exact)  cut	down  of
     sulphur   dioxide	  emission    is
     expected."</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">     The National Environment Engineering Research Institute
(NEERI) gave  "Over-view report"  regarding  status  of	 air
pollution around  The Taj  in 1990.  Relevant  part  of	 the
report is as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     "The    sources	of    pollution,
     including small  and  medium  scale
     industrial units, are scattered all
     around   Taj    Mahal.   High   air
     pollution load  is thus pumped into
     the Taj  air-shed. Sudden	rises in
     concentration   level   are   often
     recorded  in   all	 directions   in
     gaseous  as   well	 as  particulate
     pollutant depending  upon the local
     micro climatic conditions. ........
     ON four  occasions during	the five
     year air  quality monitoring, the 4
     hrly average  values of  802 at Taj
     Mahal were	 observed to  be  higher
     than 300  ug/m3, i.e.  10 folds  of
     the promulgated CPCB standard of 30
     ug/m3  for	  sensitive  areas.  The
     values exceeded  even the	standard
     of 120  ug/m3  set	 for  industrial

     enclosed along  with the affidavit.
     The industries are required to file
     their replies to the notices by May

     the U.P. Pollution Control Board to
     issue a  public notice  by	 getting
     the same  published  in  two  local

<p id="p_20">     Pursuant to this Court's order (quoted above) the board
filed affidavit	 dated August  5, 1993	wherein it is stated
that public  notice was published in two local newspapers of
Agra on	 may 17, 1993 and two National Newspapers on may 18,
1993 calling  upon the	industries  to	file  their  replies
during the  extended time. The affidavit states that all the
listed industries  were polluting  industries and 507 out of
them, had  not even  installed	any  air  pollution  control
device. The 212 industries who did not respond to the notice
and failed to take any step towards installing the pollution
control devices	 were closed  by the  order dated august 27,
1993 with immediate effect. The closure order was to operate
till the time necessary pollution control devices were to be
set up by the industries concerned.
</p><p id="p_21">     Meanwhile, NEERI  submitted its  report  dated  October
16/18,	1993  regarding	 sulphur  dioxide  emission  control
measures at  Mathura Refinery.	Since the  Mathura  Refinery
matter is being dealt with separately it is not necessary to
go into	 the details  of the  report. Suffice it to say that
apart from  short term	strategy, the  NEERI recommended the
use of	natural gas,  setting up  of  Hydro  cracking  unit,
improved sulphur  Recovery Unit,  Chemo-biochemical  Sulphur
Recovery and  the  setting  up	of  green  belt	 around	 the
refinery. The  NEERI report  examined in  detail  the  decay
mechanism  and	 status	 of   The  Taj	 marble.   How	 the
deterioration of  marble  occurs,  is  stated  by  NEERI  as
under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">     "The deterioration of marble occurs
     in two  modes. In	the first  mode,
     weathering	 takes	 place	if   the
     marble is sheltered under domes and
     cornices, and protected from direct
     impact of	rain. Here  a  crust  is
     formed, which  after  some	 period,
     exfoliates	  due	 to   mechanical
     stresses. In case of marble exposed
     to	 rain,	 gradual  reduction   of
     material occurs,  as  the	reaction
     products	are   washed   away   by
     rainfall  and   fresh   marble   is
     exposed. The  crusts are formed due
     to	  Sulphur   Dioxide,   but   the
     cumulative	   effects     of    all
     pollutants are move damaging. It is
     also  observed  that  trace  metals
     present in	 fly ash  and  suspended
     particulate matter, e.g. manganese,
     Iron and  Vanadium act as catalysts
     for oxidation  of Sulphur	Dioxide,
     and in  turn enhance degradation of
     marble calcite to gypsum."</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">     The NEERI	report indicates the air-pollution effect on
The Taj in the following words:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">     "The  Taj	 Mahal	marble	 samples
     analysed by  NEERI in  1993  reveal
     that  the	black  soot  on	 certain
     protected	surfaces  contains  0.6%
     Calcium and  traces of Sulphate. X-
     ray diffraction  studies  indicated
     that   soot   a   quartz	(Silicon
     Dioxide) are the major constituents
     of the  black coating  at Taj Mahal
     (Lal and  Holden,	ES  &amp;  T,  April
     1981). The	 origin of  soot can  be
     traced back to the fuel consumption
     around  the   sensitive   receptor,
     while  quartz   is	  derived   from
     geocrustal	  origin    and	  causes
     surface abrasions.	 Soot in  itself
     is not  chemically destructive, but
     with  tar	it  acts  as  a	 soiling
     agent.  Absorption	 of  the  acidic
     gases  is	 enhanced  due	 to  the
     presence	of   soot/smoky	  matter
     resulting	in  long  term	effects.
     Further,  the   presence  of   soot
     reduces the  aesthetic value of the
     monument. Ambient	air  around  Taj
     Mahal is  polluted	 primarily  from
     point/line sources	 and has adverse
     impacts  on  building  material  by
     alternation of marble and sandstone
     structures	  at   micro-crystalline
     level.  The  earlier  studies  have
     revealed that the concentrations of
     gaseous	pollutants    and    SPM
     (predominantly  soot   and	  carbon
     particles)	 are   relatively   high
     during winter  months  due	 to  the
     frequent	 inversion    conditions
     restricting  vertical   dispersion.
     During monsoon  seasons,  suspended
     particles are  washed away and this
     cycle  of	pollutant  built-up  and
     subsequent	   removal     continues
     exposing  fresh   surface	of   the
     monument to the pollutants."</blockquote>

<p id="p_25">     The NEERI	in its	project proposal  dated December 19,
1993 regarding	feasibility of utilisation of natural gas as
replacement of	conventional fuel  in the industrial sectors
of Agra, Mathura and Firozabad stated as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">     "The Ministry  of	Environment  and
     Forests   (MEF),	 retained    the
     National Environmental  Engineering
     Research	Institute   (NEERI)   in
     December 1992  to redefine	 the Taj
     Trapezium. The  study was completed
     in July  1993. Stringent  pollution
     control   regulations   have   been
     stipulated	 by  the  Government  of
     India  but	 the  industries  within
     Agra  area	  are  not  meeting  the
     prescribed emission  standards. One
     of	 the   reasons	 is   that   the
     industries use  coal and  coke  for
     their  fuel  requirements.	 Amongst
     the options  proposed  in	the  Air
     Environment Management  Plan in Taj
     Trapezium	 report,    NEERI    has
     suggested change  over  to	 cleaner
     fuel like ONG for mitigation of air
     pollution in the region. As per the
     directives of  the Hon'ble	 Supreme
     Court of  India, NEERI  proposed  a
     study	on	 techno-economic
     feasibility   of	utilisation   of
     compressed natural	 Gas (CNG)  as a
     replacement of  solid/liquid  fuels
     (eg, Coal,	 FO, LSHS  etc.) in  the

     is expected  to increase  to  38-39
     MMSCMD in	1998-99 as  projected by
     GAIL. Based  on the existing energy
     demand,   NEERI	has    projected

     Aligarh District. Both these places
     are about 60/65 Kms. away from Agra
     and are outside the Taj environment

     within the	 Taj Trapezium which are
     to	  be	shifted	  outside    the

<p id="p_30">     When the  matter came up for consideration on March 31,
1994, this  Court while examining the question of relocating
the industries, passed the following order:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">     "......  Mr.   Venugopal,	 learned

<p id="p_31">     This Court	 on April 11, 1994 examined the NEERI report
dated July,  1993. The	Ministry of  Environment and Forests
retained NEERI	in January,  1993 to  undertake an extensive
study with  a view  to	redefining  the	 Taj-Trapezium)	 and
realienating the  area management  environmental  plan.	 The
NEERI submitted	 its final report to the government of India
in July, 1993. A copy of the report was placed on the record
of this Court. The report was prepared under the guidance of
Dr. P.	Khanna, director, NEERI and the project leaders were
Dr. A.N.  Aggarwal and	Dr. Mrs.  Thakra. In addition, there
was a  team of	about 30  scientists  participating  in	 the
project. The  NEERI in	its report  has found as a fact that
the industries	in the	TTZ  (districts	 of  Agra,  mathura,
Ferozabad and  Bharatpur) are  the main	 source of pollution
causing damage	to the	Taj. The NEERI has suggested various
measures for  controlling the  pollution in the area. One of
the suggestions	 made  is  the	shifting  of  the  polluting
industries to  an area	outside the  TTZ. The  other notable
recommendation	is   the  setting   up	of  the	 Green	Belt
Development Plan  around The  Taj to save it from the effect
of pollution.  Under the Directions of this Court, the green
belt as	 suggested by  NEERI is	 already in  the process  of
being planted/grown  around the	 Taj. The  matter  is  being
processed separately.
</p><p id="p_32">     This court	 on April  11, 1994  after  hearing  learned
counsel for the parties, passed the order indicating that as
a first	 phase the  industries situated in Agra be relocated
out of	TTZ. While  the industries  were being	heard on the
issue of relocation, this court on April 29, 1994 passed the
following order:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">     "....Efforts are being made to free
     the prestigious Taj from pollution,
     if there  is any,	because	 of  the
     industries located	 in  and  around

     order that	 the basis of the action
     initiated	by  this  Court	 is  the

     Ministry	of    Environment    and

<p id="p_33">     Pursuant to  above	 quoted	 order,	 the  government  of
India, Ministry	 of Environment	 and Forests,  by the  order
dated May  18, 1994  appointed an  exert committee under the
chairmanship of Dr. S. Varadharajan.
</p><p id="p_34">     Meanwhile the  Indian Oil	Corporation placed on record
its report  on the  feasibility study  regarding the  use of
safe alternate	fuel by	 the Mathura  Refinery.	 The  report
suggested the  use of  natural gas as the most optimum fuel.
Once the natural gas is brought to Mathura there would be no
difficulty in  providing the same to the other industries in
TTZ and outside TTZ. This Court on August 5, 1994 passed the
following order:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">     "Pursuant	to  this  Court's  order
     dated  31.3.1994	the  Indian  Oil
     Corporation has  placed  on  record
     the final report on the feasibility
     study for	using alternate	 fuel at
     Mathura Refinery.	In the beginning
     of the  Report summary  along  with
     Indian Oil Corporation's experience
     on	 the   subject	is   given.  The
     conclusion of  the	 summary  is  as
     under:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_35">     "Out of the various alternate fuels
     (viz Natural  Gas, propane,  LPG  &amp;
     Nephtha) studied for use in process
     fired  heaters   and   boilers   in
     Mathura Refinery,	Natural	 Gas  is
     the most  optimum fuel  in view  of
     wide   international    experience,
     safety  &amp;	 minimum  implementation
     time frame.  Other alternate  fuels
     Propane, LPG &amp; Nephtha are valuable
     saleable  products	  and  therefore
     scarcely used  in the  world  as  a
     fuel  for	process	 fired	heaters.
     Liquid naphtha  forms vapour clouds
     from possible  leakages from burner
     flanges  on   underside  of   fired
     heather. In  view of  this, it  may
     not be  prudent to recommend use of
     naphtha in large size heaters (e.g.
     AVU furnaces)  &amp; boilers of Mathura
     Refinery with air preheaters."
	  The feasibility  study  report
     specifically suggests  that natural
     gas  is  the  most	 economical  and
     appropriate alternate-fuel	 for the
     Mathura Refinery.	The question for
     consideration,   is   :   By   what
     method/route the  natural gas is to
     reach Mathura and made available to
     the Refinery  at Agra.  The summary
     of the  report in	para 4.4 in this
     respect states as under:-
	  "A new  loop line  of 36  inch
     diameter from  Bijaipur to Dadri is
     being  laid  by  Gas  Authority  of
     India Limited  (GAIL) under the Gas
     Rehabilitation    and     expansion
     project  and  is  scheduled  to  be
     commissioned by  June 1996.  Supply
     of Natural	 Gas to Mathura Refinery
     will require  laying a  new 10 inch
     diameter 13  km  long  branch  line
     tapped off from the above expansion
     project at	 Shahpur.  The	proposed
     branch line to Mathura Refinery can
     be	 completed   within   the   time
     schedule of  commissioning the  new
     loop line as above."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">	  Mr. M.C. Mehta, the petitioner
     in-person	herein	 has,	however,
     suggested that  instead  of  laying
     the pipe line from Bijapur to Dadri
     via Mathura, it would be economical
     and time  saving  exercise	 to  lay
     down  the	 lines	from   Auria  or
     Babrala to	 Mathura.  According  to
     him, this would be in conformity to
     the  Report  already  submitted  by
     NEERI  in	 this  respect.	 he  has
     further submitted that if the pipe-
     line is  drawn from Auria, it would
     also  serve   the	 industries   at

     for  the	Indian	Oil  Corporation
     states  that  he  would  place  the
     suggestion before	the  experts  of

     necessary	to   re-locate	 various
     industries	   located     in    Taj
     Trapezium.	    The	     Vardharajan

     have to be relocated but this court
     finally left  it to the Ministry of
     Environment and  Forest to	 examine
     the  two	reports	 and   give  its

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_67">     The industries  in Agra  have  been
     dealt in  paras 92,  93, 95  and 96
     which are as under:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_68">     "92.   Industries	 in   Agra   and
     Ferozabad have been asked to instal
     APCD  to	reduce	essentially  SPM
     level in  air emissions.  UPPCB has

     Ferozabad could  be identified  and
     developed	as   industrial	 estates

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_71">     95.  When	 industrial  units   are
     relocated, it  would be appropriate
     to modernise  technology  equipment
     and buildings.  Most of  the  units
     will    need    very    substantial
     financial assistance.  The value of
     the present  sites and their future
     use have to be determined. It would
     not   be	desirable   to	 promote
     residential colonies and commercial
     establishments  in	  such	 vacated
     areas as  they may	 in turn  add to
     the problems  of water  supply  and
     atmospheric  quality  by  excessive
     use of  energy.  Major  changes  of
     this  nature  would  need	a  clear
     development planning  strategy  and
     resources,	 and   will  also   take
     several years for implementation.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_72">     96.  There	  is  urgent   need  for
     quicker measures  which could  lead
     to better	environment,  especially
     in the Taj Mahal. For this purpose,
     it is  necessary to  effect overall
     reduction in  coal/coke consumption
     by industries  and others	in  Agra
     and   in	 Taj   Trapezium    Zone
     generally.	 The  present  level  of
     consumption of 129 metric tonne per
     day    by	   industry    can    be
     substantially   reduced	by   new
     technology and  by use  of LPG  and
     HSD  of   low   sulphur.	Stricter
     standards	for   emissions	 may  be
     evolved when such technological and
     fuel changes  are effected. Support
     for development of modifications in
     design    and     operation     and
     demonstration should  be  provided.
     Some assistance  to industries  for
     adoption of these may be considered
     after careful  examination	 of  the
     costs and	benefits to the industry
     and   to	 society.   All	   those
     industries	  not	responding   for
     action  for  feasible  changes  and
     contributing disproportionately  to
     atmospheric pollution  have to face
     action."</blockquote>
<p id="p_47">     The Taj  being a  monument on  the World Heritage List,
the Government	of India  sought the  expert advice  through
UNESCO on  the structural  and chemical preservation aspects
of the	monument.  Accordingly,	 two  experts,	namely,	 Dr.
Mentrizio marbeilli and Dr. M. Larze Tabasso visited the Taj
Mahal between  January 17-30,  1987 to	study  the  problems
pertaining to  the conservation of marble and sand stones in
The Taj	 and recommended  remedial  measures.  According  to
them, the  yellowishness of the marble is due to (a) SPM and
</p><p id="p_48">(b) dust  fall impinging  on the  surface. Opinions  of	 the
Archaeological Survey  of India and other scientists annexed
to the	Varadharajan Report  unanimously say that the yellow
shadow of the marble on different parts of The Taj including
four minarets  is mainly  due  to  SPM	and  the  dust	fall
impinging on the surface. The comments of the Archaeological
Survey of India as noticed in the Varadharajan Report are as
under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_73">     "On the  structural side,	the  Taj
     mahal  is	 in  a	sound  state  of
     preservation   and	   the	 studies
     conducted so  far also  confirm the
     same. The	only threat  to the  Taj
     Mahal  is	from  the  environmental
     pollution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_74">     The Science  wing	of  the	 ASI  is
     continuously monitoring  the  level
     of	 suspended  particulate	 matter,
     sulphur dioxide  concentration  and
     sulphation rate.  The studies  made
     in this regard shows that suspended
     particulate matter	 level has  been
     found to be higher than the maximum
     permissible level	100 kg/m3.  This
     has imparted a yellowish appearance
     on the surface of the Taj Mahal."</blockquote>
<p id="p_49">     After  careful  examination  of  the  two	Varadharajan
Reports (1978 and 1995) and the various NEERI reports placed
on record, we are of the view that there is no contradiction
between the  two  sets	of  reports.  In  the  1978  Report,
Varadharajan  found   substantial  level  of  air  pollution
because of  sulphur dioxide  and SPM in the Agra region. The
source,	 according   to	 the   report,	was  the  coal-users
including  approximately   250	 small	 industries   mainly
foundries. The excess of SPM was because of the use of coal.
The Report  specifically recommended  in para  5.4  for	 the
relocation of the existing small industries particularly the
foundries. The	1995 Varadharajan  Report clearly shows that
the standard  of atmospheric  pollution is  much higher than
the 1981-85  period which  according to	 the Report  is also
because of  heavy traffic  and operation of generating sets.
NEERI reports have clearly recommended the relocation of the
industries from the TTZ.

<p id="p_51">     The chronology  of the  orders quoted  by	us  in	this
judgment shows	that this  Court  took	cognizance  of	this
matter in  January 1993.  There are  four NEERI reports, two
Varadharajan reports and several reports by the Board. After
examining all  the reports  and	 taking	 into  consideration
other material	on the	record, we  have  no  hesitation  in
holding	 that	the  industries	  in  the   TTZ	 are  active
contributors to	 the air  pollution in	the said area. NEERI
and   Varadharajan    (1978)   reports	 have	specifically
recommended the	 relocation  of	 industries  from  the	TTZ.
Although  the  Board  has  placed  on  record  list  of	 510
industries which  are responsible  for air  pollution but in
view of	 our order  dated April 11, 1994. (quoted above), we
are confining  this order only to 292 industries located and

industry by itself. More than two million tourists visit The
Taj every  year. It  is a source of revenue for the country.
This Court  has monitored this petition for over three years
with the  sole object  of preserving  and protecting The Taj
from  deterioration   and  damage  due	to  atmospheric	 and
environmental pollution.  It cannot be disputed that the use
of coke/coal by the industries emit pollution in the ambient
air. The  objective behind  this litigation  is to  stop the
pollution while encouraging development of industry. The old
concept that  development and  ecology cannot go together is
no longer acceptable. Sustainable development is the answer.
The development	 of industry is essential for the economy of
the country,  but at  the same	time the environment and the
eco-systems have to be protected. The pollution created as a
consequence  of	  development  must  commensurate  with	 the
carrying capacity of our eco-systems.
</p><p id="p_411">     Various orders  passed by	this Court from time to time
(quoted above)	clearly indicate  that the relocation of the
industries from TTZ is to be resorted to only if the natural
gas which  has been  brought at	 the doorstep  of TTZ is not
acceptable/available by/to  the industries  as a  substitute
for coke/coal.	The GAIL  has already invited the industries
in TTZ	to apply  for gas  connections. before	us Mr. kapil
Sibal  and  mr.	 Sanjay	 parikh,  learned  counsel  for	 the
industries have clearly stated that all the industries would
accept gas  as an  industrial-fuel. The industries operating
in TTZ which are given gas connections to run the industries
need  not  relocate.  The  whole  purpose  is  to  stop	 air
pollution by banishing coke/coal from TTZ.

of India  &amp; Ors.,  JT</a> 1996  (7) sc  375,  has  defined	"the
precautionary principle"  and the  "polluter pays principle"
as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_87">     "11. .......  We are,  however,  of
     the view  that  "the  precautionary
     principle" and  "The polluter Pays"
     principle are essential features of
     "Sustainable   Development".    The
     "Precautionary Principle" -- in the
     context  of  the  municipal  law  -
     means:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_88">     (i)  Environmental	 measures  -  by
     the  State	  Government   and   the
     statutory	 authorities	-   must
     anticipate, prevent  and attack the
     causes	  of	   environmental
     degradation.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_89">     (ii)      Where there  are	 threats
     of serious and irreversible damage,
     lack of scientific certainty should
     not  be   used  as	  a  reason  for
     postponing	 measures   to	 prevent

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_90">     developer/industrialist   to   show
     that his  action is environmentally
     benign.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_91">     12.  "The Polluter	 Pays" principle
     has  been	 held  to   be	a  sound
     principle by  this court  in Indian
     Council for Enviro-Legal Action vs.
     Union of  India J.T.  1996 (2) 196.
     The Court	observed "We  are of the
     opinion that  any principle evolved
     in this  behalf should  be	 simple,
     practical	 and   suited	to   the
     conditions	  obtaining    in   this
     country".	The   Court  ruled  that
     "Once the	activity carried  on  is
     hazardous or  inherently dangerous,
     the   person   carrying   on   such
     activity is liable to make good the
     loss caused  to any other person by
     his activity  irrespective	 of  the
     fact  whether  he	took  reasonable
     care   while    carrying	on   his
     activity. The rule is premised upon
     the very  nature  of  the	activity
     carried   on."   Consequently   the
     polluting	    industries	     are
     "absolutely  liable  to  compensate
     for the  harm  caused  by	them  to
     villagers in  the affected area, to
     the soil  and  to	the  underground
     water and	hence, they are bound to
     take  all	 necessary  measures  to
     remove sludge  and other pollutants
     lying in  the affected  areas". The
     "Polluter	 Pays"	  principle   as
     interpreted  by  this  court  means
     that  the	absolute  liability  for
     harm to the environment extends not
     only to  compensate the  victims of
     pollution	but  also  the	cost  of
     restoring	   the	   environmental
     degradation.  Remediation	 of  the
     damaged environment  is part of the
     process	   of	    "Sustainable
     Development" and  as such	polluter
     is liable	to pay	the cost  to the
     individual sufferers as well as the
     cost  of	reversing  the	 damaged
     ecology.

     provides for  the	constitution  of

     Control  Board   by   the	 Central
     Government and  the constitution of

     by various State governments in the
     country. The  Boards function under
     the  control   of	the  Governments
     concerned. <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">The  Water Act</a> prohibits
     the use  of streams  and wells  for
     disposal of polluting matters. Also
     provides	for    restrictions   on
     outlets and  discharge of effluents
     without obtaining	consent from the

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_96">     14.  In view of the above mentioned
     constitutional    and     statutory
     provisions we have no hesitation in
     holding  that   the   precautionary
     principal	and  the  polluter  pays
     principle	 are	part   of    the
     environmental law of the country."</blockquote>
<p id="p_413">     Based on  the reports  of various technical authorities
mentioned in  this judgment,  we have  already	reached	 the
finding	 that  the  emissions  generated  by  the  coke/coal
consuming industries  are air-pollutants  and have  damaging
effect on  The Taj  and the  people living  in the  TTZ. The
atmospheric pollution  in TTZ  has to  be eliminated  at any
cost. Not even one per cent chance can be taken when - human
life apart - the preservation of a prestigious monument like
The  Taj   is  involved.   In  any  case,  in  view  of	 the
precautionary  principle  as  defined  by  this	 Court,	 the
environmental measures	must anticipate,  prevent and attack
the causes of environmental degradation. The 'onus of proof'
is on an industry to show that its operation with the aid of
coke/coal is  environmentally benign.  It is, rather, proved
beyond doubt  that the	emissions generated  by the  use  of
coke/coal by the industries in TTZ are the main polluters of
the ambient air.
</p><p id="p_414">     We,  therefore,   hold  that  the	above-mentioned	 292
industries shall  as per  the schedule	indicated  hereunder
change-over to	the natural  gas as  an industrial-fuel. The
industries which  are  not  in	a  position  to	 obtain	 gas
connections -  for any	reason - shall stop functioning with
the aid	 of coke/coal in the TTZ and may relocate themselves
as per the directions given by us hereunder.
</p><p id="p_415">     We order and direct as under:-
(1)  The industries  (292 listed above) shall approach/apply
tot he GAIL before February 15, 1997 for grant of industrial
gas-connection.
</p><p id="p_416">(2)  The industries  which are	not in	a position to obtain
gas connections and also the industries which do not wish to
obtain gas connections may approach/apply to the Corporation
(UPSIDC)/Government before  February 28,  1997 for allotment
of alternative plots in the industrial estates outside TTZ.
(3)  The GAIL  shall take  final decision  in respect of all
the applications  for grant  of gas connections by March 31,
1997 and communicate the allotment letters to  he individual
industries.
</p><p id="p_417">(4)  Those industries which neither apply for gas connection
nor for	 alternative industrial	 plot shall stop functioning
with the  aid of coke/coal in the TTZ with effect from April
30, 1997.  Supply of  coke/coal to these industries shall be
stopped	 forthwith.   The  District   Magistrate   and	 the
Superintendent of  Police shall	 have  this  order  complied
with.
</p><p id="p_418">(5)  The GAIL shall commence supply of gas to the industries
by June	 30, 1997.  As soon as the gas supply to an industry
commences, the	supply of  coke/coal to	 the  said  industry
shall be stopped with immediate effect.
(6)  The Corporation/Government	 shall	finally	 decide	 and
allot alternative  plots, before  March	 31,  1997,  to	 the
industries which are seeking relocation.
(7)  The relocating industries shall set up their respective
units  in  the	new  industrial	 estates  outside  TTZ.	 The
relocating industries  shall not function and operate in TTZ
beyond December	 31, 1997.  The closure by December 31, 1997
is unconditional  and irrespective  of the  fact whether the
new unit outside TTZ is completely set up or not.
(8)  The Deputy	 Commissioner, Agra  and the  Superintendent
(Police),  Agra	  shall	 effect	  the  closure	of  all	 the
industries on December 31, 1997 which are to be relocated by
that date as directed by us.
(9)  The U.P.  State Government/Corporation shall render all
assistance to  the industries  in the process of relocation.
The allotment  of plots,  construction of factory buildings,
etc. and issuance of any licence/permissions, etc., shall be
expedited and granted on priority basis.
(10) In order to facilitate shifting of industries from TTZ,
the State  Government and all other authorities shall set up
unified single	agency consisting  of  all  the	 departments
concerned to  act as  a nodal  agency to  sort out  all	 the
problems of  such industries.  The  single  window  facility
shall be set up by the U.P.State Government within one month
from today.  The Registry  shall communicate  this direction
separately to  the Chief  Secretary, Secretary	(Industries)
and Chairman/Managing  director, UPSIDC along with a copy of
this judgment.	We make	 it clear that no further time shall
be allowed to set up the single window facility.
(11) The State	Government shall  frame a scheme for the use
of the	land which  would become  available  on	 account  of
shifting/relocation of	the industries before June 30, 1997.
The State  Government may seek guidance in this respect from
the order of this Court dated May 10, 1996 in I.A. No. 22 in
writ Petition (Civil) No. 4677 of 1985.
(12) The shifting  industries on  the relocation  in the new
industrial estates shall be given incentives in terms of the
provisions of  the Agra	 Master Plan and also the incentives
which  are  normally  extended	to  new	 industries  in	 new
industrial estates.
</p><p id="p_419">(13) The  workmen   employed  in   the	above-mentioned	 292
industries shall  be entitled  to the rights and benefits as
indicated hereunder:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_97">     (a)  The workmen shall have continuity of employment at
     the new  town and	place where the industry is shifted.
     The terms	and conditions of their employment shall not
     be altered to their detriment.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_98">     (b)  The period  between the closure of the industry in
     Agra and  its restart  at the place of relocation shall
     be treated	 as active  employment and the workmen shall
     be paid their full wages with continuity of service.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_99">     (c)  All those  workmen who  agree to  shift  with	 the
     industry shall  be given  one year's wages as 'shifting
     bonus' to	help them  settle at  the new  location. The
     said bonus shall be paid before January 31, 1998.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_100">     (d)  The workmen  employed in the industries who do not
     intend to	relocate/obtain	 natural  gas  and  opt	 for
     closure, shall be deemed to have been retrenched by May
     31, 1997, provided they have been in continuous service
     (as defined  in <a href="/doc/288001/" id="a_13">Section 25-B</a> of the Industrial Disputes
     Act, 1947) for not less than one year in the industries
     concerned before  the said	 date. They  shall  be	paid
     compensation  in	terms  of  <a href="/doc/1944207/" id="a_14">Section  25-F(b)</a>  of	 the
     Industrial Disputes  Act. These  workmen shall  also be
     paid, in  addition,  six  years'  wages  as  additional
     compensation.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_101">     (e)  The compensation  payable to	the workmen in terms
     of this judgment shall be paid by the management within
     two months of the retrenchment.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_102">     (f)  The gratuity	amount payable	to any workman shall
     be paid in addition.</blockquote>
<p id="p_420">     Before parting with this judgment, we may indicate that
the industries in the TTZ other than 292 industries shall be
dealt  with   separately.  We  direct  the  board  to  issue
individual notices  and also  public notice to the remaining
industries in the TTZ to apply for gas connection/relocation
within one month of the notice by the Board. The Board shall
issue notice within one month from today. The matter to come
up for	further monitoring in this respect before this Court
on April 4, 1997.
</p><p id="p_421">     We may also indicate that this Court by order dated May
10, 1996 has stopped the operation of all the brick kilns in
the TTZ	 with effect  from August  15, 1996.  This court  by
order dated  September 4, 1996 has directed that the fly-ash
produced in the process of the functioning of thermal plants
may be	supplied to  the brick kilns for the construction of
bricks. This  would  be	 a  useful  step  to  eliminate	 the
pollution caused by fly-ash.
</p><p id="p_422">     This  Court  is  separately  monitoring  the  following
issues for controlling air pollution in TTZ:-
</p><p id="p_423">(a)  The setting  up of	 hydrocracker unit and various other
devices by the Mathura Refinery.
</p><p id="p_424">(b)  The setting  up of	 50  bed  hospital  and	 two  mobile
dispensaries by	 the mathura Refinery to provide medical aid
to the	people living  in the surrounding areas (Court order
dated August 7, 1996).
</p><p id="p_425">(c)  Construction of  Agra bypass  to divert all the traffic
which passes  through the  city. Under	directions  of	this
Court, 24  kms' stretch	 of the bypass shall be completed by
the end of December 1996 (Court order dated April 10, 1996).
</p><p id="p_426">(d)  Additional amount of Rs. 99.54 crores sanctioned by the
Planning Commission  to be  utilised by the State Government
for the	 construction  of  electricity	supply	projects  to
ensure 100  per cent  uninterrupted electricity	 t the	TTZ.
This is	 necessary to  stop the operation of generating sets
which are  major source	 of air	 pollution i  the TTZ (Court
orders dated  April 10, 1996, May 10, 1996, August 30, 1996,
September 4, 1996 and September 10, 1996).
</p><p id="p_427">(e)  The construction of Gokul Barrage, water supply work of
Gokul Barrage,	roads around Gokul Barrage, Agra Barrage and
water supply of Agra Barrage, have also been undertaken on a
time  schedule	 basis	to  supply  drinking  water  to	 the
residents of  Agra and to bring life into river Yamuna which
is next	 to the	 Taj (Court  order dated  May 10,  1996	 and
August 30, 1996.).
</p><p id="p_428">(f)  Green belt	 as recommended	 by NEERI  has been  set  up
around Taj. Pursuant to continuous monitoring of this Court,
the Green Belt has become a reality.
</p><p id="p_429">(g)  This Court	 suggested to  the  Planning  Commission  by
order  dated  September	 4,  1996  to  consider	 sanctioning
separate allocation for the city of Agra and the creation of
separate cell  under the  control of  Central Government  to
safeguard and  preserve the  Taj, the city of Agra and other
national heritage monuments in the TT.
</p><p id="p_430">(h)  All  emporia  and	shops  functioning  Within  the	 Taj
premises have been directed to be closed.
</p><p id="p_431">(i)  Directions have  been issued to the Government of India
to decide  the issue,  pertaining to  declaration of Agra as
heritage city within two months.
</p><p id="p_432">     We are mentioning these issues dealt with by this Court
because it may be necessary to monitor some of these matters
to take	 them to  a logical extent. This Court may look into
these matters on April 4, 1997.
</p><p id="p_433">     The issue	relating to  292 industries is thus disposed
of.
