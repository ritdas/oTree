Zambian Company is not capable of being punished with imprisonment at

all since a company cannot be punished by imprisonment.

Section providing for a mandatory imprisonment for two years or more,

otherwise, the words used would have been imprisonment 'upto' two years

or more and not 'for' two years or more.

<p id="p_55">

</p><p id="p_56">25.     Referring to Section 91 of the Zambian Act under which the alleged

conviction took place, it was submitted that the sentence was for

imprisonment not exceeding three years or fine, which will not have the

same meaning as contemplated in <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_25">Section 29A</a> (d). The intent of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_26">Section

29A(d)</a> can be gleamed from the Regulations themselves and cannot be made

applicable to stale events where the conviction has taken place more than

eight years ago, as in the instant case. Therefore, according to learned

Senior Counsel, 'Vedanta Limited' cannot be held to be ineligible in terms of

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_27">Section 29A(d)</a>.

Stand of the Counsel for 'Mr. Neeraj Singhal'



</p><p id="p_59">27.     The case of the Appellant- 'Mr. Neeraj Singhal' is that 'Tata Steel Ltd.'

</p><p id="p_60">- 'Resolution Applicant' is a 'connected person' of 'Tata Steel UK'. The

aforesaid 'connected person' has been found guilty on two counts under the

'Health and Safety at <a href="/doc/1017644/" id="a_30">Work Act</a>, 1974, UK' (hereinafter referred to as "U.K

Act") vide an order dated 2nd February, 2018 for failing to discharge its

duties under <a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_31">Section 2(1)</a> of the 'U.K Act'. The objection raised is that since

'Tata Steel UK' has been convicted by order dated 2nd February, 2018 passed

by the Crown Court at Kingston Upon Hull of an offence punishable with

imprisonment for two years or more it attracted disqualification under

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_32">Section 29A</a> (d) of the 'I&amp;B Code'.

submitted that the said provision makes a person ineligible to submit a

elements:
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">          i.    The 'person' (which includes a company) should have been

         ii.    That offence should be 'punishable' by imprisonment of two

                years or more. Even imprisonment of just two years (and not

                more) is sufficient to attract 29A (d) of the 'I&amp;B Code'.



</blockquote><p id="p_65">30.     It was submitted that a Company can never incur the disqualification

under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_35">Section 29A</a> (d) of the 'I&amp;B Code' even if it had committed a very

serious crime and also has been convicted of that crime cannot be accepted.

Such an interpretation being contrary to the 'Statement of Objects and

Reasons' for the introduction of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_36">Section 29A</a>, which exclude all undesirable

persons from the 'Resolution Process'.

interpretation so as to advance the objects for which it has been enacted

below the same, no such disqualification is contemplated.



</p><p id="p_73">34.     According to learned Senior Counsel, as per                            the   'sentencing

of imprisonment on a Company and thereby the only available penalty is

that of a fine which has actually been done.

case.

punishment of imprisonment of two years or more in order to attract

disability, whereas under the English Law both have been provided. It has

accordingly been argued that where 'imprisonment or fine' are envisaged the

Courts have the discretion to impose fine and where the imprisonment is the

only punishment, a company cannot even be prosecuted as imposition of

custodial sentence is a legal impossibility. In support of his submissions,

reliance has been placed on the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

which we will refer at appropriate stage.

</p><p id="p_143">55.     The expression 'punishable' actually qualifies the offence relatable

thereto and functionally couples the offence with the punishment which

may be either of imprisonment or fine or both. The word 'punishable'

calibrates the range of punishment/sentence for the offence and is

commensurate thereto as legislatively envisaged. The word used in <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_80">Section

29A</a> (d) is 'punishable' and not 'punished', therefore, the word 'punishable' is

a link between the offence and the penalty prescribed by law depending on

the gravity of the offence but in no way is an indicator of the viability or

feasibility of the implementation of the punishment of the convicted. The

offence so much so that if anyone is convicted of that offence and is

punishable for the sentence prescribed by way of imprisonment, the

disqualification,       debarment        and/or        ineligibility   stemming   from   such

                   precedent. While it may be permissible for the court

                   to read the word "and" as "or", or vice versa,

                   whatever the interpretation, it must be uniformly

                   applied to all situations. If the conjunction "and" is

                   read disjunctively as "or", then the intention of

                   Parliament would definitely be defeated as the

                   mandatory term of imprisonment would not be

                   available even in the case of a natural person. We

Claim of 'Larsen and Toubro Limited'- ('Operational Creditor')



</p><p id="p_197">81.     The Appellant- 'Larsen and Toubro Limited'- ('Operational Creditor')

(hereinafter referred to as "L&amp;T") has also challenged the order dated 15th

May, 2018, challenging the cost of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Only)

imposed by the Adjudicating Authority on the Appellant- 'L&amp;T'.



</p><p id="p_198">82.     Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant submitted that

'Resolution Applicants' ('Tata Steel Limited') cannot exercise any discretion

over allocation of the amounts Rs. 1200 crores to be paid to the 'Operational

Creditors'. Reliance has been placed on <a href="/doc/284008/" id="a_119">Section 55(4)(b)</a> of the Transfer of

Property Act, 1883 and submitted that the said provision creates a statutory

charge in favour of the Appellant, which cannot be extinguished by the

'Resolution Applicant' taking recourse of the 'I&amp;B Code'.



</p><p id="p_199">83.     However, such submission cannot be accepted as the 'Resolution

Applicant' is to file 'Resolution Plan' in the manner as prescribed under the

'I&amp;B Code' and the Regulations framed thereunder.



</p><p id="p_200">84.     <a href="/doc/40836587/" id="a_120">Section 30(2)</a> of the 'I&amp;B Code' mandates the 'Resolution Professional'

to examine each 'Resolution Plan' received by him. The 'Resolution

payment of insolvency resolution process costs in a manner specified by the

Board in priority to the repayment of other debts of the 'Corporate Debtor'

(clause (a)) and provides for repayment of the debts of 'Operational Creditors'

in such manner as may be specified by the Board which shall not be less

than the amount to be paid to the 'Operational Creditors' in the event of a

liquidation of the 'Corporate Debtor' under <a href="/doc/54578607/" id="a_121">Section 53</a> (clause (b)). In view of

the specific provisions and <a href="/doc/40836587/" id="a_122">Section 30(2)</a> (b), the Appellant cannot derive any

advantage out of <a href="/doc/284008/" id="a_123">Section 55(4)(b)</a> of the Transfer of Property Act, 1883.

Applicant' has allocated Rs. 1,200 crores for payment in favour of the

'Operational Creditors' i.e. about 83% of the dues. The main grievance of the

Appellant is that the allocation has been made by the 'Resolution Applicant'-

('Tata Steel Limited') with certain discretion, which is not permissible.



</p><p id="p_202">86.     Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 'Tata Steel Limited'

outstanding financial debt of the 'Corporate Debtor' which is Rs. 56,051/-

crores.

</p><p id="p_204">87.     It was also submitted that if the 'Corporate Debtor' goes into

'NIL' amount.

'Resolution Plan', the claim of the 'Operational Creditors' will be settled to

the extent of Rs. 1,200 Crores within a period of twelve months.

aforesaid amount subsequently increased to Rs. 1,422 Crores is the

substantial amount offered towards meeting 'Operational Creditors' claims,

as long as they meet the requirements of the 'Resolution Plan'.

</p><p id="p_213">93.     The grievance of the Appellant- 'Mr. Brij Bhushan Singal' is against

the 'Resolution Plan' submitted by the 'Tata Steel Limited' as approved by

the Adjudicating Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_214">

</p><p id="p_215">94.     It was submitted that the approval of the 'Resolution Plan' is illegal as

it purports to transfer the 'preference shares' of the 'preference shareholders'

of 'Bhushan Steel Limited' unilaterally and without their consent for a fixed

consideration of Rs. 100/- as against Rs. 2269 crores.



</p><p id="p_216">95.     It was submitted that the Adjudicating Authority ought to have

rejected the 'Resolution Plan' as it is illegal in so much as its implementation

has led to automatic redemption and cancellation of the preferential shares

of the Appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_217">

</p><p id="p_218">96.     It was submitted that the 'Resolution Plan' is violative of <a href="/doc/1291060/" id="a_125">Section 55</a> of

the Companies Act, 2013.
</p>
<p id="p_219">

</p><p id="p_220">97.     As per 'I&amp;B Code', the shareholders are not treated to be creditors. It

is the promoters/shareholders who are responsible for initiation of

'Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process' which resulted due to non-

payment of dues of the 'Financial Creditor(s)' and/or the 'Operational

Creditor(s)', apart from 'Secured Creditor(s)' or 'Unsecured Creditor(s)'.

Therefore, there is no scope for argument left to the shareholders or any

other provisions of law.
</p>
<p id="p_221">

</p><p id="p_222">98.     The 'Resolution Plan' automatically does not amount to transfer or

reduction of shares, including preferential shareholding. It is merely a

proposal of one or other 'Resolution Applicants' and once it is approved by

the 'Committee of Creditors' and thereafter by the 'Adjudicating Authority'

under <a href="/doc/1810383/" id="a_126">Section 31</a>, will be binding on all the stakeholders, including the

'Corporate       Debtor',      'Members'        (shareholders),         'Financial   Creditors',

'Operational Creditors' etc. If the provision of <a href="/doc/1291060/" id="a_127">Section 55</a> of the Companies

Act, 2013 is to be complied, it can be complied only after the approval of the

'Resolution Plan'. Before the approval of the 'Resolution Plan' is approved by

the Adjudicating Authority, the 'Resolution Plan' being mere a proposal, the

question of following <a href="/doc/1291060/" id="a_128">Section 55</a> of the Companies Act, 2013 does not arise.



</p><p id="p_223">99.     For the reasons aforesaid, we are not inclined to interfere with the

impugned order dated 15th May, 2018.

have already initiated recovery proceedings against the 'Corporate Debtor'

for recovering the alleged forest lands alleged to have been encroached by

the 'Corporate Debtor'; litigations are pending in different Courts. In this

background, after hearing the counsel for the 'Resolution Professional', the

Adjudicating Authority held that the 'Resolution Applicant'- 'Tata Steel

Limited' is aware of the proceedings and that whatever assets held by the

'Corporate Debtor' alone is to be taken over. If the title of land is defective, it

cannot be cured upon taking over the assets of the 'Corporate Debtor' by the

'Resolution Applicants'. The Adjudicating Authority for the said reason held

that remedy available to the Applicant/State of Jharkhand and its Officers,

having already initiated and pending against the 'Corporate Debtor', allowing

or rejecting the 'Resolution Plan' will not affect the legal remedy.



</p><p id="p_228">102. We find no reason to differ with aforesaid observation of the

Adjudicating Authority as it is always open to the State of Jharkhand and its

Officers to act in terms of the decisions, if any, given by the Court of

disputed land in question.
