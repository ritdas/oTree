   CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE SANJAY PRIYA
   ORAL JUDGMENT
     Date : 25-02-2019

             Heard learned counsel for petitioner and the State.

             The petitioner is aggrieved by order as contained in

     Annexure-7 which is letter bearing no. T. 3605 dated 19.3.2015

     issued under signature of Member-Secretary, the Bihar State

     Pollution Control Board, Patna whereby the consent to Establish

     (NOC) the Brick Kiln plant of the petitioner as granted vide

     letter T. 2056 dated 25.2.2011 has been cancelled and

     application for Emission consent order dated 8.1.2015 has been

     rejected and further a direction was issued for closer of the

     Brick Kiln plant with immediate effect.
</p>
<p id="p_12">             Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that
 Patna High Court CWJC No.1956 of 2016 dt.25-02-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           2/4</span>




         aforesaid order as contained in Annexure-7 has been passed

         without following the principle of Natural justice. No notice was

         ever      issued and served to him. It is further submitted that

         without affording opportunity of proper hearing, the order has

         been passed. In support of his submission, learned counsel for

         petitioner has relied upon judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court

         since reported in (1998)8 SCC 1 ( <a href="/doc/172383107/" id="a_1">Whirlpool Corporation vs.

         Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai &amp; Others</a>),wherein, it

         has been held that alternative remedy has been consistently

         held by this Court not to operate as a bar in at least three

         contingencies, namely, where the writ petition has been filed

         for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights or where

         there has been a violation of the principle of natural justice or

         where the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction

         or the vires of an Act is challenged. There is a plethora of case-

         law on this point but to cut down this circle of forensic

         Whirlpool, we would rely on some old decisions of the

         evolutionary era of the constitutional law as they still hold the

         field."
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">                 Learned counsel for the petitioner has further submitted

         that in the instant case, proper notice was sent to the petitioner.
 Patna High Court CWJC No.1956 of 2016 dt.25-02-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           3/4</span>




                 In the counter affidavit, he has enclosed the copy of the

         dispatch register to show that notice was issued to the petitioner

         by registered post. He further submits that after passing of the

         order as contained in Annexure-7, the petitioner has filed fresh

         petition before the authority as contained in Annexure-10 dated

         26.5.2015 and the authority concerned after considering the

         subsequent application, has passed the order vide memo no. T-

         2932 dated        17.3.2016 as contained in Annexure- D to the

         counter affidavit.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                 Learned counsel for the State submits that now the

         petitioner has efficacious alternative remedy to file appeal

         against the aforesaid orders under provision of <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_2">Section 31</a> of the

         Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.

</p><p id="p_16">                 Learned counsel for petitioner submits that subsequent

         order passed by the authority vide Annexure- D has reiterated

         the reason earlier given by the authority       in the order   as

         contained in Annexure-7. He further submits that unless the

         order passed vide Annexure-7 is set aside he will not be able to

         get any relief by the Appellate Authority.

</p><p id="p_17">                 This Court feels that Appellate Authority is competent to

         hear the appeal         against both the orders as contained    in

         Annexure-7 as well as Annexure-D to the counter affidavit. The
              Patna High Court CWJC No.1956 of 2016 dt.25-02-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                        4/4</span>




                      order contained in Annexure D has been passed only after taking

                      into consideration the earlier order passed by the Authority as

                      contained in Annexure-7.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                              Accordingly, this writ petition is disposed off with

                      direction to the petitioner to file appeal before the competent

                      authority under provision of <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_4">Section 31</a> of the Air (Prevention

                      and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 challenging the order(s) as

                      contained in Annexure-7 of the writ petition and Annexure- D to

                      the counter affidavit, within a period of one month from the date

                      of this order. The competent appellate authority, after affording

                      opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and looking into all the

                      relevant documents filed on his behalf will pass appropriate

                      order in accordance with law within a period of three months

                      from the date of filing of such appeal by the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_19">                              It is made clear that limitation in filing the appeal will be

                      condoned by the Appellate Authority because the petitioner was

                      seeking remedy in this Court by filing the writ petition.
