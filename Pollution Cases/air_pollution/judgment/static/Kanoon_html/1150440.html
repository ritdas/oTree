:ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">	The petitioner has approached this court with a prayer, for issuance of a
writ, in the nature of mandamus, directing the respondent Nos.1 and 2 to stop or
control the noise pollution caused by the respondents Nos.3 and 4 by using
amplifiers and loud speakers, outside the Natesar Alayam, Illathar Samudayam,
Manavalakurichy, Kanyakumari District.
</p><p id="p_2">	2.Para 3  of the affidavit filed in support of this petition reads as
under:-
</p><p id="p_3">	"I also filed a suit as O.S.No.161 of 2004 before the I Additional
District Munsif, Eraniel against the Superintendent of Police, Nagercoil, the
first respondent herein and others, to give effect to GO MS.No3845, dated
29.11.1977 and various other Government Orders. The suit was partly decreed. The
learned District Munsif granted decree for mandatory injunction against the
Superintendent of Police, Kanyakumari District, to implement GO MS.No.3845,
dated 29.11.1977 with other amendments from time to time relating to sound
pollution in the matter of playing music and songs using amplifiers and speakers
in Natesar Alayam, Illathar Samudayam at Manavalakurichy giving opportunity to
the President, Secretary and Treasurer to get necessary license within
reasonable time."
</p>
<p id="p_4">	3.In view of the fact that the petitioner already approached the civil
court and decree was passed in his favour, which has attained finality. The
petitioner instead of executing the decree, has filed this writ petition seeking
a writ, in the nature of mandamus, which on the face of it, is not maintainable,
specially when the execution proceedings have been stayed by this court, in a
revision petition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	4.The learned counsel for the petitioner, vehemently contended that the
Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has also issued instructions to the
respondents to control the Noise pollution.  The copy of the order passed, by
Pollution Control Board, does not form part of the pleadings in the writ
petition, therefore no notice of it can be taken. In any case, it is for the
petitioner to workout his remedy under the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Pollution Control Act</a>, for violation
of the order passed by the Pollution Control Board. This cannot be a basis to
maintain the writ petition, after the suit was filed on the same cause of
action, stood finally decided.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	5.The learned counsel for the petitioner also placed reliance on the
judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench of this court, in the case of M.S.Appa
Rao M.S. vs. Government of Tamil Nadu and another, [1995-1-L.W.319], to contend
that this court can issue directions to control the pollution.  The reliance on
the judgment is totally misplaced as in the said case, there was no dispute on
facts nor was a case where civil court had already decided the lis, as in the
present case.
</p><p id="p_7">	6.It has been fairly conceded by learned counsel for the petitioner that
execution application was also filed to execute the decree, and the respondents
herein have filed revision in this court, and the execution of the decree has
been stayed. The jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a> cannot be invoked, to defeat the
order passed by this court in exercise of revisional jurisdiction.  This writ is
nothing but misuse of the process of court.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	7.The writ is totally misconceived, and deserves to be dismissed with
costs.
</p>
<p id="p_9">	8.Consequently, the writ petition is dismissed with costs being not
competent.
</p>
<p id="p_10">	9.The costs are assessed at Rs.10,000/- [Rupees Ten thousand only].
Connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
