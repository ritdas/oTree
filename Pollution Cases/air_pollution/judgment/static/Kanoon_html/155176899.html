                            THOMAS P. JOSEPH, J.
                           --------------------------------------
                           O.P.(Crl.) No.1358 of 2011
                           --------------------------------------
                     Dated this the 11th day of April, 2011.

                                     JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       Respondents 1 and 2 appear through Standing Counsel, Advocate Shri

M.K.Chandramohan Das. Respondents 4 and 5 appear through counsel.

Learned Public Prosecutor takes notice for respondent No.3.



</p><p id="p_2">         2.  Challenge in this proceeding is to Exts.P8 and P9, orders passed

by the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Thiruvalla (respondent No.3) purporting to be

under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_1">Sections 133</a> and <a href="/doc/529017/" id="a_2">142</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short, "the

Code"). The proceeding was initiated on the complaint of respondent No.5

which, in short is that petitioner is constructing a sewage and water treatment

plant without permission from the appropriate authorities for treatment of sewage

and waste water formed on account of a large assembly of people in the

compound where the plant is being erected. The                  Sub Divisional Magistrate

issued Ext.P8, order under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_3">Section 133</a> of the Code directing petitioner to

remove the sewage tank 'constructed in an unscientific manner' and that if

petitioner has any objection in doing so, he has to prefer his objection before the

Sub Divisional Magistrate on          29.04.2011 at 3 p.m. The Sub Divisional

Magistrate also issued    Ext.P9, order dated 17.03.2011 restraining petitioner

from continuing with construction of the sewage and water treatment plant 'in an

unscientific manner'.
</p>
<p id="p_3">OP(Crl.)No.1358/2011


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                         2</span>

</p><p id="p_4">         3.   Petitioner contends that it is incorrect to say that construction is

being done in any unscientific manner and at any rate, the Sub Divisional

Magistrate is not competent to pass orders with respect to any possible, future

nuisance, not to say about prevention of construction of the plant itself. Learned

counsel    for respondents would contend that it is without permission from

respondent No.1 (for short, "the PCB") that petitioner is continuing          with

construction of the sewage and water treatment plant, the collection of sewage

and waste water causes nuisance to the Public and in the circumstances the

Sub Divisional Magistrate has passed the impugned orders. Learned counsel

have invited my attention to the relevant documents. It is pointed out from

Ext.P6, letter dated 26.02.2011       of the Environmental Engineer of       PCB

addressed to the petitioner that the       present action of petitioner is illegal

(obviously being in violation of the provisions of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986.

</p><p id="p_5">      4.      It is seen from Ext.P6 that the Environmental Engineer (respondent

No.2) who, I am told is the appropriate authority to sanction establishment and

operation of sewage and waste treatment plant has issued certain directions to

the petitioner such as -
</p>
<p id="p_6">      (1)   Provide a sewage treatment plant of adequate capacity to treat the

effluent generated from your premises within 45 days.

</p><p id="p_7">      (2)    Stop discharging the wash water from auditorium premises to public

OP(Crl.)No.1358/2011


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           3</span>

road with immediate effect.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       (3)    Clean the affected wells and provide drinking water supply to all

affected residents until their wells are rejuvenated with fresh water.

</p><p id="p_9">       (4)    Apply and obtain consent of the Board to operate the establishment

within 30 days.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       (5)    Report the action taken on the above directions within 7 days.

</p><p id="p_11">       5.     So far as Ext.P8, order is concerned, no interference is required

since that order issued under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_6">Section 133</a> of the Code and though contains a

direction to the petitioner to remove what respondent No.3 would describe as

'unscientific construction', it is followed by an option to the petitioner to prefer

his objection if any in the matter before respondent No.3 on 29.04.2011. It is

open to the petitioner to do so.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        6.    So far as Ext.P9, order of injunction is concerned, the operation

and establishment of       sewage and water treatment plant can only be in

accordance with the provisions of the Act which I have referred above and

approval by the Environmental Engineer (respondent No.2).

</p><p id="p_13">        7.    In the light of the controversy involved in the case what is required

is to direct that Ext.P9, order of injunction will remain in force until respondent

No.2, the Environmental Engineer has granted approval for establishment and

operation of the sewage and water treatment plant. On getting approval for

establishment of the plant it is open to the petitioner to proceed with the

OP(Crl.)No.1358/2011


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           4</span>

construction but its operation will commence only on getting approval of

respondent No.2. Ext.P9, order of injunction passed by the Sub Divisional

Magistrate is to be modified to that extent.
</p>
<p id="p_14">          8.   On the question whether notwithstanding the approval granted by

respondent No.2, operation of the sewage and water treatment plant caused any

nuisance is a matter which the Sub Divisional Magistrate has to decide in

accordance with the provisions of Chapter X of the Code.

</p><p id="p_15">              Resultantly this Original Petition (Criminal) is disposed of in the

following lines:
</p>
<p id="p_16">       i.     So far as Ext.P8, order is concerned, it is made clear that it is open

to the petitioner to raise his objection in the matter before the Sub Divisional

Magistrate as provided in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7"> the Code</a> and in case any such objection is preferred

the Sub Divisional Magistrate shall proceed in the matter as provided under law.

</p><p id="p_17">       ii.    It is directed that petitioner shall establish and operate the sewage

and water treatment plant only on getting approval from respondent No.2. On

getting approval for establishment it is open to the petitioner to proceed with

establishment of the plant. But, operation of the plant will again be on getting

approval of    respondent No.2.Ext.P9, order of injunction passed by the Sub

Divisional Magistrate will stand modified to the above extent.

</p><p id="p_18">       iii.   Notwithstanding the approval granted by respondent No.2 as above

stated, whether operation of the sewage and water treatment plant caused any

OP(Crl.)No.1358/2011


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                        5</span>

nuisance as pleaded by respondent No.5 is a matter which the Sub Divisional

Magistrate has to decide in accordance with Chapter X of the Code.

</p><p id="p_19">       iv.   Respondent Nos.2 and 3 shall expedite their proceedings in the

matter.      Parties can approach respondents 2 and 3 as the case may be, for

early disposal of the representation/proceeding.
