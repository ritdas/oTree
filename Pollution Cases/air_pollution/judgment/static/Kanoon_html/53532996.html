          (PER : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE J.B.PARDIWALA)


     Since the legal issues raised in both the writ applications
are more or less the same, those were heard together and are
being disposed of by this common judgment.
</p>

<p id="p_6">     The      challenge   in   both     the    above   captioned       writ
applications is to the legality and validity of a Master Circular
dated 2nd July 2012 issued by the Reserve Bank of India in
respect of 'willful defaulter' and the notices were issued by the
respective banks, calling upon the petitioners to show-cause as
to why they should not be declared as willful defaulters in
terms of the Reserve Bank of India's Master Circular.

<p id="p_8">     The petitioner no.1 is a proprietary firm. The petitioner
no.2 is a company registered under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_1">Indian Companies Act</a>,
1956, having its Registered Office within the State of Gujarat.
The petitioner no.3 is the Director of the petitioner no.2
Company and the petitioner no.4 is the Guarantor and also a
Director of the Petitioner no.2 Company.

respondent no.2 Punjab National Bank. The respondent no.2
Bank noticed that the loan account of the petitioners was a
Non-Performing Asset (NPA) since 30th June 2012 with the
outstanding of Rs.1027 lac (as on the date of the NPA)
including the interest at the applicable rate.
</p>

<p id="p_10">      Despite regular reminders from the bank for payment of
the dues, no steps were taken by the petitioners in that regard.
Therefore, the respondent no.2 Bank issued a show-cause
notice dated 19th February 2013 followed by a second show-
cause notice dated 14th May 2013 and a final notice dated 8th
January      2014 on the premise that the petitioners had
defaulted in repayment of the loan amount and the funds
borrowed from the Bank were siphoned off and not used for
the purpose for which the amount of the loan was disbursed,
for which the petitioners were called upon to show-cause as to
why they should not be declared as 'willful defaulters' in terms
of    the       RBI    Master       Circular            DBOD       No.CID-

in the petition including a prayer to declare the RBI Master
Circular dated 2nd July 2012 referred to above as ultra vires

     Special Civil Application No.10120 of 2014 :
</p>

<p id="p_14">     The petitioners availed of the facility of the Home Saver
Account vide sanction letter dated 30th September 2010 to the
tune of Rs.3,45,87,900/- in Account No.48111724 from the
respondent no.2 - Standard Chartered Bank. The petitioners
availed one more facility of the Home Saver Account by
sanction letter dated 30th September 2010 of Rs.1,45,12,100/-
vide Account No.48134899 from the respondent no.2 -
Standard Chartered Bank.             The Account No.48134899 was
declared as NPA on 1st December 2013 whereas the Account
No.48111724 was declared as NPA on 10th January 2013.
</p>

<p id="p_15">     On 3rd April 2014, the petitioners addressed a letter to
the respondent no.2 Bank requesting for a closure of both the
accounts.
</p>

<p id="p_16">     On 20th May 2014, the petitioners were served with the
notices    under       Section   13(2)     of     the    Securitization     and
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_7">Enforcement of Security
Interest Act</a>, 2002.
</p>

<p id="p_17">     On 20th June 2014, the petitioners were served with the
impugned         notices     under       the       RBI     Circular     DBOD
No.CID.BC.1/20.16.2003/2011-12 dated 1st July 2012, calling
upon them to show-cause as to why they should not be
declared as the willful defaulters.              The petitioners replied to
the said notices on 1st July 2014.
</p>

<p id="p_18">     In the aforesaid background, the petitioners have prayed
to declare the RBI Master Circular dated 1st July 2011 as ultra

vires the Constitution of India and various other enactments.
The petitioners have also prayed that the notice dated 20th
June     2014 issued by the Respondent no.2 Bank under the RBI
Master Circular be also quashed and set-aside.
</p>

<p id="p_19">        Submissions on behalf of the petitioners :
</p>
<p id="p_20">        Mr.Vishwas       Shah   and    Mr.Mitul      Shelat,    the   learned
advocates appearing for the respective petitioners made the
following submissions :
</p>

<p id="p_21">        The RBI Master Circular dated 1st July 2011 as well as the
RBI Master Circular dated 2nd July 2012 in respect of the willful
defaulters and the instructions contained therein are beyond
the legislative competence of the RBI. The circular does not
refer to any provision of law under which it has been issued.
</p>

<p id="p_22">        It has been submitted that the stance of the Reserve
Bank of India that issuance of the Master Circular is in exercise
of the powers conferred under <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_8">Section 21</a> and <a href="/doc/587034/" id="a_9">Section 35-A</a> of
the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, is completely misplaced and
erroneous.         To fortify such submission, strong reliance has
been placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case
of     <a href="/doc/1916813/" id="a_10">Indian     Banks'   Association,          Bombay   and     others   v.
M/s.Devkala Consultancy Service and others</a>, (2004)11 SCC 1.
</p>

<p id="p_23">        The impugned provisions of the Circular are substantive
provisions affecting the rights of the citizens. The substantive
provisions can only be by way of a legislative enactment and
not by exercise of powers to issue directions.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 Page 5 of 162</span>
<p id="p_24">         C/SCA/645/2014                           CAV JUDGEMENT



     It is submitted that to prescribe a particular conduct by a
borrower as a "willful default", to impose the penalty for such a
"willful default" and to prescribe a procedure for adjudication
of the lis regarding the "willful default" are beyond the scope
and ambit of <a href="/doc/222598/" id="a_11">Section 35(A)</a> of the Banking Regulation Act,
1949.
</p>

<p id="p_25">     The Chief General Manager has no power, authority and
locus to issue the Master Circular, however, the circular issued
by the Chief General Manager would not constitute a policy
decision under <a href="/doc/1848249/" id="a_12">Sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/587034/" id="a_13">35A</a> of the Banking Regulation
Act, 1949. The said Circular is required to have the phrase "in
public interest" or "in interest of depositors" or "in interest of
banking policy" and should indicate relevant materials and
reasons that the Circular was being issued after considering
the interest of all the above and for such reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_26">     In support of such submission, strong reliance has been
placed on a decision of the Karnataka High Court in the case of
E.Sathyanarayanan and others v. Reserve Bank of India and
others, reported in (2002)112 Company Cases 272.
</p>
<p id="p_27">     The impugned Circular is violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_14">Article 14</a> of the
Constitution as it has the effect of almost blacklisting the
petitioners from obtaining any new loan from any other bank
or financial institution and it attaches a social stigma on the
Directors who may not be concerned in any manner as regards
the day-to-day affairs and management of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_28">     It is submitted that none of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_15">Reserve
Bank of India Act</a> or the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_16">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949 confers
any power upon the Reserve Bank of India to impose any


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                            Page 6 of 162</span>
       C/SCA/645/2014                              CAV JUDGEMENT



penalty relating to a particular conduct of a borrower.           The
circular confers uncanalized, unbridled and untrammeled
power upon the banks to decide the future of any borrower
and makes the bank a judge in its own cause and also the
decision whether the other banks should lend money to the
borrower declared as a willful defaulter.
</p>

<p id="p_29">     According to the learned advocates appearing on behalf
of the petitioners the policy decision of the Reserve Bank of
India in the form of a Master Circular is nothing but a direct
infringement of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_17">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution which
provides for right to trade, business or profession. A person
may fail in one business, but he cannot be debarred or
prohibited from doing any other business for which he may
have to raise the necessary funds by obtaining loan from a
bank or any other financial institution.
</p>

<p id="p_30">     The Circular pre-supposes a default, which is otherwise
required to be proved in accordance with law before the Debts
Recovery Tribunal established under the Recovery of Debts
Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (Act

defined under Section 2(g) of the RDBI Act, 1993.                 The
question whether there exists any debt or not is a question the
bank is obliged to prove and satisfy before the Debts Recovery
Tribunal under the RDBI Act, 1993, against the borrower.           It
has been submitted that the impugned circular which seeks to
delegate the function of making a judicial inquiry and issue a
declaration regarding the conduct of a borrower as a "willful
default" entails serious consequences.       Such adjudication is

     The former Finance Minister, in his budget speech in
February 1994, had announced that in order to alert the banks
and financial institutions and put them on guard against the
borrowers who had defaulted in their dues or other lending
institutions, the RBI was putting in place arrangements for
circulating amongst the banks/financial institutions, the names
of defaulting borrowers above a threshold limit. The objective
of putting such a reporting mechanism in place was to arrest
the increase of Non-Performing Assets of the banks. He had
further mentioned that the RBI would also publish a list of
defaulting borrowers against whom suits had been filed by
banks and FIs.
</p>

<p id="p_49">     In April 1994, the Reserve Bank of India framed a scheme
of Disclosure of Information on Defaulting Borrowers of Banks
and the Financial Institutions (FIs) for collection/dissemination
of information from/to "banking companies".                    The "banking
company"       for     the   purpose    also      includes    the    "financial
institutions" that may be notified by the Central Government
in this behalf. Under the Scheme, the banks and the notified
FIs were advised on 23rd April 1994 to furnish to the RBI the
prescribed details of defaulting borrowers with outstanding
amount (both funded and non-funded) of one crore and above
which were classified as 'Doubtful' and/or 'Loss' and suit filed
accounts on half yearly basis (September and March).                         The
Scheme had the following objectives;

<p id="p_50">      At   a    meeting   convened       by   the   Central    Vigilance
Commission with the bankers on 24th November 1998, it was
decided that the banks would report all cases of willful default
of Rs.25 lac and above to the RBI, which in turn, would
circulate such lists to all banks on a quarterly basis. Pursuant
to the instructions of the Central Vigilance Commission, the
RBI introduced a scheme under which banks and notified All
India Financial Institutions were required to submit to the RBI
the details of willful defaulters with outstanding of Rs.25 lac
and above. The Scheme came into force with effect from 1st
April 1999. Accordingly, banks and financial institutions started
reporting such cases of willful defaults which occurred or were
detected after 31st March 1999 on a quarterly basis to the RBI.

persistence of the 'willful default' in the financial system in the

institutions       were      advised      on       30th   May      2002      for

<p id="p_52">      Pending the passing of the legislation in respect of Credit
Information Companies, the RBI, in terms of its circular DBOD
No.DL.BC.11/20.16.001/2001-02 dated 4th June 2002, advised
the banks and financial institutions to submit a list of willful
defaulters (of suit filed accounts) of Rs.25 lac and above as on
31st March 2003 onwards, to the Credit Information Bureau
(India) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "CIBIL") only and not to
the RBI. The RBI continues to disseminate exclusively to the
banks and financial institutions for their confidential use the
credit information regarding willful defaulters of Rs.25 lac and
above (non-suit filed accounts) in a consolidated manner as
reported     for       the   purpose   by      the   banks     and    financial

<p id="p_53">      The Reserve Bank has been issuing various circulars from
time to time to the scheduled commercial banks and All India
Notified Financial Institutions with regard to dissemination of
credit information pertaining to the willful defaulters for
cautioning the banks and the financial institutions including
action required to be taken against the willful defaulters. All
these circulars were consolidated in the Master Circular on
Willful Defaulters dated 1st July 2013 (Master Circular) issued
by the RBI. The Master Circular was prepared to ensure that
all the existing instructions on the subject were incorporated
and consolidated in a single document and are available for
the use of the banks and the financial institutions as also on
the website of the RBI. The Circular on Willful Defaulters has

been issued by the RBI under <a href="/doc/1848249/" id="a_46">Sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/587034/" id="a_47">35A</a> of the
Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and are mandatory and binding
on the banks.
</p>

<p id="p_54">     The      Master     Circular    on      Willful   Defaulters     contains
definition of the term "willful defaulter" and it also provides
guidance as to how the terms "diversion of funds" and
"siphoning of funds" are to be construed in the case of "willful
default".    The Master Circular specifically requires the banks
and financial institutions (FIs) to put in place a transparent
mechanism for the entire process so that the provisions of the
Master Circular are not misused and the scope of the
discretionary powers conferred upon the banks and FIs are
kept to the barest minimum. The Master Circular also requires
the banks and FIs to ensure that a solitary or isolated instance
is not made the basis for imposing any penalty on the willful
defaulters.        The   Master      Circular      clearly   prescribes      the
measures required to be adopted by the banks and FIs in
identifying and reporting the instances of willful default.
Paragraph 3 of the Master Circular stipulates that the decision
to classify a borrower as willful defaulter should be entrusted
to a committee of higher functionaries of the bank/FI
concerned headed by the Executive Director and consisting of
two GMs/DGMs as decided by the Board of the Bank/FI.
Further, the decision taken on classification of the willful
defaulters should be well documented and supported by
requisite evidence and should clearly spell out the reasons for
which the borrower has been declared as willful defaulter in
terms of the guidelines issued by the Bank. The bank/FI is also
required to advise the borrower concerned about the proposal
to classify him as willful defaulter along with the reasons


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                  Page 16 of 162</span>
       C/SCA/645/2014                             CAV JUDGEMENT



therefor. The bank/FI is also required to provide a reasonable
time to the borrower for making representation against the
decision to a committee headed by the Chairman and
Managing Director of the bank/FI concerned.        The Bank has
prescribed a detailed procedure for classification of a particular
borrower as a willful defaulter and such classification is
required to be done by the higher authorities in the bank/FI
concerned with a second screening at the level of the highest
authority when a representation is made by the borrower. The
procedure prescribed by the Bank provides ample opportunity
to the borrower to present their case before the highest
authorities in the bank/FI concerned before a decision is taken
on his classification as a willful defaulter.
</p>

<p id="p_55">      The process listed out in the Master Circular has been
carefully designed by a body of experts. The objective is to
built up an adequate, comprehensive and reliable information
system on borrowers so that such willful defaulters are barred
from further institutional credit in terms of the penal measures
listed out therein. The Master Circular provides at the end of
Para 2.5 that -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">     "it would be imperative on the part of the banks and FIs
     to put in place a transparent mechanism for the entire
     process so that the penal provisions are not misused and
     the scope of such discretionary powers are kept to the
     barest minimum.      It should also be ensured that a
     solitary or isolated instance is not made the basis for
     imposing the penal action".</blockquote>


<p id="p_56">      The Master Circular sets out the broad guidelines and the
banks/FIs are expected to follow them dealing with individual
cases. The Master Circular takes every possible care to make

the process transparent and objective. Para 3 of the Master
Circular prescribes the broad framework within which the
banks/FIs      are mandated to constitute and                          operate the
Grievance Redressal Committees, leaving certain amount of
flexibility for each banks/FIs to prescribe its detailed process, if
found necessary, before declaring its borrower as a willful
defaulter.      Further, the mechanism provided under para 3
requires involvement of higher functionaries so that an
objective view is taken.                The process is also transparent
through a detailed documentation supported by requisite
evidence and clear mentioning of reasons for classification of a
borrower as willful defaulter. It also gives ample opportunity
to the borrower to represent itself against the proposed action,
followed by a personal hearing, if required.                           In short, the
principles of natural justice are followed in the said para 3 of
the Master Circular.
</p>
<p id="p_57">       The Reserve Bank of India has been continuously issuing
guidelines      on       'Willful   Defaulters'        in     a    phased     manner
commencing from 20th February                          1999 to discourage the
banks and financial institutions from granting any further
financial aid to the willful defaulters, so as to act as a deterrent
for the 'willful defaulters' and in order to safeguard banks from
the risks of loan repayments, interest and liquidity. The
guidelines contained in the impugned Master Circular have
been    issued          at   the    instance      of    the       Central   Vigilance
Commission and pursuant to the recommendations of the
Working Groups. The instructions contained in the Master
Circular are aimed at curbing the menace of non-performing
assets in banks.             The RBI, by issuing the said Circular, has
taken few positive steps to protect the interests of banks and

financial institutions and to ensure that a list of willful
defaulters is known and made available to other banks and
financial institutions. The said purpose cannot be said to be
arbitrary and unjustified.       The RBI's circulars on 'willful
defaulters' are in consonance with the law of the land and are
meant for ensuring transparency and providing accountability
so that the bank's funds are not misused by the unscrupulous
elements.

<p id="p_60">     Mr.Soparkar, at the outset, submitted that so far as the
Standard Chartered Bank is concerned, the same is a private
bank. Although the same is a Scheduled Bank and figures in
Schedule-II to the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_48">Reserve Bank of India Act</a>, yet it cannot be
termed as an institution or a company carrying on any
statutory or public duty.     Therefore, in such circumstances
although the petitioners of Special Civil Application No.10120
of 2014 may be entitled to challenge the constitutional validity
of the Master Circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India, yet
no writ could be issued by this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_49">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution in so far as the proposed action pursuant to the
issue of show-cause notice is concerned.       In support of his
submission, Mr.Soparkar has placed strong reliance on the
decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_50">Federal Bank
Ltd. v. Sagar Thomas &amp; others</a>, (2003)10 SC 737.

      Mr.Soparkar further submitted that the contention raised
on behalf of the petitioners as regards the absence of power
on the part of the Reserve Bank of India to issue the impugned
Master Circular is also devoid of any merit. According to
Mr.Soparkar, the Reserve Bank of India being one of the
watchdogs of finance and economy of the nation derives the
power from the provisions of <a href="/doc/1848249/" id="a_51">Sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/587034/" id="a_52">35-A</a> of the
Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
</p>

<p id="p_62">      In response to our specific query as regards the control of
the   RBI      upon      the   non-banking        financial   institutions,
Mr.Soparkar drew our attention to Chapter-IIIB of the Reserve
Bank of India Act, 1934, i.e. the provisions relating to Non-
Banking Institutions receiving deposits as Financial Institutions.
Mr.Soparkar invited our attention to <a href="/doc/575472/" id="a_53">Sections 45-H</a> and <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_54">45-I</a> of
the Act, 1934.         <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_55">Section 45-I(c)</a> defines "financial institution"
which means any non-banking institution which carries on as
its business or part of its business any of the activities
enumerated in clauses (i) to (f).
</p>

<p id="p_63">      Mr.Soparkar also invited our attention to <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_56">Section 45-JA</a>
which relates to the power of the bank to determine any policy
and issue directions.
</p>

<p id="p_64">      Mr.Soparkar submitted that the Reserve Bank of India
being a monetary regulator frames the banking policy.                    The
Master Circular impugned in the two petitions is a part of the
banking policy. Such banking policy is specified by the Reserve
Bank of India from time to time in the interest of the banking
system or monetary stability or sound economic growth. While


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                 Page 20 of 162</span>

formulating any banking policy, the Reserve Bank of India has
to give due regard to the interest of the depositors and other
resources of the bank.
</p>

<p id="p_65">     Mr.Soparkar submits that the court sitting in a writ
jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_57">Article 226</a> of the Constitution may not
examine the merits of the policy to find out, whether there
could have been a better policy and interfere with such policy.
Banking     policy     requires    economic        and   fiscal   expertise.
According to Mr.Soparkar, the experts who are qualified to
address the issues are the best people to take an appropriate
decision in the interest of the entire economy of the nation.
</p>

<p id="p_66">     Mr.Soparkar laid much stress on the fact that the NPA
accounts are a big threat to the economy of the nation. The
borrowers, at times, misuse the amount disbursed by the bank
and thereby cause immense loss to a particular bank.                      On
matters affecting policy and those requiring expertise, the
court should be slow and circumspect to interfere unless such
policy is contrary to the statutory provisions, arbitrary or
otherwise unconstitutional.
</p>

<p id="p_67">     Mr.Soparkar submitted that the issue of the Master
Circular by the Reserve Bank of India relating to "willful
default" and "willful defaulters" does not travel beyond the
scope of the delegated legislation. Having regard to the nature
of duties, functions and the role which the Reserve Bank of
India plays as a premier financial institution of the country it
was within the scope and powers of the RBI to issue such a
circular in the interest of the banking system and the economy
of the country.

     Mr.Soparkar submitted that a mere possibility of an
abuse of any provision of law, rule, regulation or a circular like
the one in the present case, by itself, would not be sufficient to
condemn the same as ultra vires the provisions of the
Constitution of India or other banking enactments.
</p>

<p id="p_69">     Mr.Soparkar submitted that the contention of bias and
the bank being a judge in its own cause, is also devoid of any
merit.    Mr.Soparkar submits that the maxim "nemo judex in
causa sua" constitute the basic elements of a fair hearing and
is sought to be applied mechanically without any basis for such
an apprehension.
</p>

<p id="p_70">     According to Mr.Soparkar, the policy decision of the
Reserve Bank of India to issue such a circular cannot be
condemned on mere application of the doctrine referred to
above. In a given case, if the action pursuant to such a policy
decision is found to be tainted with bias, then in such
circumstances, the Court can always correct such an arbitrary
action.   However, that by itself would not render the policy
decision bad in law.
</p>

<p id="p_71">     Mr.Soparkar in support of his submission has placed
strong reliance on a decision of the Supreme Court in the case
of Union of India v. Bipinkumar Jain, 2005(9) SCC 579, and in
the case of <a href="/doc/734532/" id="a_58">Delhi Financial Corporation and another v. Rajiv
Anand and others</a>, (2004) 11 SCC 625.
</p>

<p id="p_72">     Mr.Soparkar submitted that the contention as regards the
unreasonable restriction imposed on a promoter/director of a

company being in direct infringement of the <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_59">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of
the Constitution of India is absolutely devoid of any merit.
According to Mr.Soparkar, although the right to do business is
a fundamental right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_60">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the
Constitution, yet this right is subject to a reasonable restriction
under <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_61">Article 19(6)</a> of the Constitution. The reasonableness of
the restriction has to be determined in an objective manner
and has to be seen from the point of view of interest of the
general public and not merely from the point of view of person
upon whom the restrictions are imposed.
</p>

<p id="p_73">     Mr.Soparkar, therefore, submits that there being no merit
in both the writ-applications, the same deserves to be
rejected.

</p>

<p id="p_82">      It     is     also   well-settled       that    while   examining       the
constitutionality of a statute it must be assumed that the
legislature understands and appreciates the needs of the
people and the laws it enacts are directed to problems which
are made manifest by experience and that the elected
representatives assembled in a legislature enact laws which
they consider to be reasonable for the purpose for which they
are   enacted.          There   is      a     presumption      in   favour     of
constitutionality and a law will not be declared unconstitutional
unless the case is so clear as to be free from doubt. A statute
should not be declared unconstitutional merely because in the
opinion of the Court it violates one or more of the principles of
liberty, of the spirit of the Constitution, unless such principles
and that spirit are found in the terms of the Constitution.

of the Master Circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India, we
deem it necessary to look into the same in little details.

     which the banks and notified All India Financial
     Institutions were required to submit to RBI the details of
     the willful defaulters. Willful default broadly covered the

     consider criminal action wherever instances of

ensuring that the decision to classify a borrower as a willful
defaulter is entrusted to a committee, which is headed by the
Executive       Director   of     the       concerned    banks/financial
institutions. Before a borrower is classified as a willful
defaulter, he is required to be issued a notice along with
documents and other evidence. The borrower is to be provided
with a reasonable time to make representation against such
proposed action. Thereafter, a decision has to be taken,
whether a borrower is to be declared as a willful defaulter and
the borrower is to be informed. Thus, there are number of
stipulation and safeguards in the impugned Master Circular to
protect the interest of the borrowers.

     The object and purpose behind issuing the Master
Circular appears to be plain and simple. The Master Circular
has been issued to take care of the defects and problems
experienced in the past. It is a policy decision which seems to
have been taken after thorough examination of the problems
faced by the banks and the financial institutions. The
foundation of a scheme has been explained in the Master

<p id="p_96">     We are not impressed by such submission canvassed on

was enacted by the Parliament for the regulation of banking
business which, unlike any other business, is a special kind of
business. Banking business is the business of acceptance of
withdrawable deposits of money from the public for the
purpose of lending of investment. While that describes the
ordinary nature of banking, that activity in a developing
society and economy has acquired an evolutionary nature, in
that the essence of banking business in such an economy
involves banks operating as basic financial intermediaries and
playing a key role in the country's economy in general and
mobilisation and distribution of the country's savings in
particular. Banks are the largest repositories of the nation's
savings. The conduct and affairs of the banks influence the
various sectors of the economy. The economic development of
the country depends largely on the safety and soundness of
banking institutions. Banks are also the principal means for
transmitting the credit policies of the country. Having regard to
the delicate position of a bank in the country's economy, the
failure of one bank can have a disastrous effect on the whole
banking system, having the potential of leading to systematic

crisis with prejudicial effect on the economy as a whole. In
view of all these considerations, the banking sector has been a
highly regulated area all over the world. These principles
governing the banking business have been embodied in the
banking laws of India, viz. the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_65">Reserve Bank of India Act</a>, 1934,
and the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_66">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949.
</p>


<p id="p_97">     The significance of the Reserve Bank's position as the
central bank of the country needs no emphasis. As the central
bank and as the primary regulator of the banking business, the
Reserve Bank has been vested with very wide powers and is
also charged with certain duties as reflected in the preambles
to and the provisions of the two legislations referred to above.
The preamble to the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_67">Reserve Bank of India Act</a> states that the
bank is established, inter alia, generally to operate the
currency and credit system of the country to its advantage.
The powers under the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_68">Reserve Bank of India Act</a> as also under
the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_69">Banking Regulation Act</a> have been conferred on the bank
with a view to fulfill these objectives. The various powers under
the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_70">Banking Regulation Act</a> are related to public interest or the
interest of banking policy. The expression "banking policy" has
been defined in clause (ca) of <a href="/doc/1223029/" id="a_71">section 5</a> of the Banking
Regulation Act as under :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_48">     "(ca) 'banking policy' means any policy which is specified
     from time to time by the Reserve Bank in the interest of
     monetary stability or sound economic growth, having due
     regard to the interests of the depositors, the volume of
     deposits and other resources of the bank and the need
     for equitable allocation and the efficient use of these
     deposits and resources."

     This definition and power conferred thereunder on the
Reserve Bank to specify the policy clearly reflect the object
that the banks truly become the instruments of transmitting
economic policies including the credit policies of the country in
a manner expected of them and serve the cause of public
interest. It is the Reserve Bank's function to ensure, as best as
it can, that the said object is achieved. Further, in view of the
adverse effect that a bank's failure may have on the economy,
the statutes also aim that the Reserve Bank's powers are
exercised not only to effectively handle the crisis in the affairs
of a banking company, but also to prevent a perceived failure
or crisis in the affairs of the banking company. In respect of
such matters, Parliament has vested full discretion in the
Reserve Bank and the Central Government so that it should be
open for these authorities to decide, depending upon the
contingencies, the various alternatives or combination of them
as provided by law to ensure protection of the interest of the
depositors, the public interest and the interest of banking
policy.

<p id="p_98">     It also needs to be appreciated that with the liberalisation
in the economy, the banking sector is widely expanding
necessitating basic changes in the profiles of the banks in
relation to the pattern of their shareholding, capital structure,
management composition, as also operational systems, and

even the very manner of conduct of banking business. The
past failures of some private sector banks and huge losses of
public sector banks have only underlined the need for such
changes. Taking note of this, and the changing economic
scenario as also the emerging competitive environment, it has
become        imperative      for     the      banks     to     become         more
professionally managed, widely capital based, to have more
diversified activities, to be more technically advanced. This, in
turn, has also resulted, in a policy by the Reserve Bank for
consolidation of the banking system and other measures in the
interest of the banking system of the country as a whole.
Further, the past failures of some banks raising concern for the
banking system have constrained the Reserve Bank to take
many steps to strengthen the financial soundness of the
banking system. Increasing the capital base of the banks is one
such measure. Similarly, various other policy measures have
been initiated to ensure better quality of assets, induction of
professional            management,        diversified        credit    portfolio,
improved accounting systems, transparency in balance-sheets,
etc.

<blockquote id="blockquote_67">     "But the most important function of the Reserve Bank is
     to regulate the banking system generally. The Reserve
     Bank has been described as a bankers' bank. <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_73">Under the
     Reserve Bank of India Act</a>, the scheduled banks maintain
     certain balances and the Reserve Bank can lend
     assistance to those banks 'as a lender of the last resort'.
     The Reserve Bank has also been given certain advisory
     and regulatory functions. By its position as a central
     bank, it acts as an agency for collecting financial
     information and statistics. It advises Government and
     other banks on financial and banking matters, and for
     this purpose, it keeps itself informed of the activities and
     monetary position of scheduled and other banks and
     inspects the books and accounts of scheduled banks and
     advises Government after inspection whether a particular
     bank should be included in the Second Schedule or not.
     Every scheduled bank is required to send to the Reserve
     Bank and to the Central Government a weekly return of
     its position in a form, which is prescribed. Sometimes,
     however, the Reserve Bank allows a particular bank to
     send its returns once a month instead of every week.
     From these returns, the Reserve Bank prepares and
     publishes consolidated statements showing the monetary
     position in the country. The inclusion of a bank in the
     Second Schedule is the function of the Reserve Bank, and
     under <a href="/doc/1644231/" id="a_74">sections 42(6)(a)(iii)</a> and (b)(ii) it satisfies itself,
     inter alia, that the affairs of the particular bank are not
     being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests
     of its depositors. The Reserve Bank has further the power
     to prohibit any scheduled bank from receiving, after a
     week, any fresh deposits.</blockquote>


<p id="p_101">     The above analysis of some of the provisions of the
     <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_75">Reserve Bank of India Act</a> show that the Reserve Bank of

     supervision, advice and inspection, over banks,
     particularly those desiring that they be included in the

composed of nominated members; but from the nature of
things, it could not be otherwise. Neither election nor
competitive examinations can effectively take the place
of nominations, if the board is to be composed of men of
proven worth and standing, and there is no other method
which can even be contemplated. No doubt, the
members of the board are subject to removal, but neither
integrity nor efficiency is secured only by such
guarantee, and we have no reason to think that the
Reserve Bank acted in this case, or acts in other cases
under pressure or from oblique motives. As was pointed
out in another connection by this court in <a href="/doc/1781810/" id="a_76">All India Bank

Reserve bank not only has powers over banking
companies while they are functioning, but it has also
powers when the banking companies wish or are forced
to cease to function. If a banking company wants to
suspend its business and applies to the High Court for a
moratorium, the application is not maintainable, unless it
is accompanied by a report of the Reserve Bank
indicating that in the opinion of the Reserve Bank the
banking company will be able to pay its debts. When the
High Court grants the reliefs without such report, it has to
call for a report from the Reserve Bank. The High Court is

     arrangements between the banking company and its

     these matters, the satisfaction, inter alia, must be as to
     the interests of the depositors. In reconstruction of

     gives no hearing, records no reasons in writing and does
     not communicate them is met at least in this case by the
     admitted facts. The numerous inspection reports and
     directions issued by the Reserve Bank over a period of
     nearly nine years, together with the application filed in
     this case, prove amply that there was enough hearing of
     and enough communication of the grounds of action to
     the Palai Bank. The Bank had also sufficient time and
     opportunity to establish its own point of view before the
     Reserve Bank. It was impossible that the Reserve Bank,
     with the run on the bank, would sit down to decide after
     hearing whether to take action or not, while withdrawals
     were being at the rate of Rs. 7 lakhs per day. The
     emergency of the situations which may arise, is itself the
     justification for the procedure open under the Act and

       "Mischief was known and the regulatory measure
       was introduced to remedy the mischief. The
       conditions which can be prescribed to effectuate
       this purpose must, a fortiori, to be valid, fairly and
       reasonably, relate to checkmate the abuse of
       juggling with the depositors/investors hard earned
       money by the corporate sector and to confer upon
       them a measure of protection namely availability of
       liquid assets to meet the obligation of repayment of
       deposit which is implicit in acceptance of deposit.
       Can it be said that the conditions prescribed by the
       Deposit Rules are so irrelevant or have no
       reasonable nexus to the objects sought to be
       achieved as to be arbitrary ? The answer is
       emphatically in the negative. Even at the cost of
       repetition, it can be stated with confidence that the
       rules which prescribed conditions subject to which
       deposits can be invited and accepted do operate to
       extend a measure of protection against the
       notorious abuses of economic power by the
       corporate      sector,    to     the   detriment      of
       depositors/investors, a segment of the society
       which can be appropriately described as weaker in
       relation to the mighty corporation. One need not go
       so far with Ralph Nader in America incorporated to
       establish that political institutions may fail to arrest
       or control this ever-widening power of corporations.
       And can one wish away the degree of sickness in
       private sector companies ? To the extent companies
       develop sickness, in direct proportion the
       controllers of such companies become healthy. In a
       welfare State, it is the constitutional obligation of
       the State to protect socially and economically
       weaker segments of the society against the
       exploitation by corporations. We, therefore, see no
       merit in the submission, that the conditions
       prescribed bear no relevance to the object or the
       purpose for which the power was conferred under

     care not to exceed or abuse its power. It must keep
     within the limits of the authority committed to it. It must
     act in good faith and it must act reasonably. Courts are
     not to interfere with economic policy which is the
     function of experts. It is not the function of the courts to
     sit in judgment over matters of economic policy and it
     must necessarily be left to the expert bodies. In such
     matters even experts can seriously and doubtlessly
     differ. Courts cannot be expected to decide them without
     even the aid of experts.

<p id="p_107">     52. This court in <a href="/doc/103959/" id="a_84">Joseph Kuruvilla Vellukunnel v. Reserve
     Bank of India</a>, AIR 1962 SC 1371 held that the RBI is 'a
     bankers' bank and 'lender of the last resort'. Its objective
     is to ensure monetary stability in India and to operate
     and regulate the credit system of the country. It has,
     therefore, to perform a delicate balance between the
     need to preserve and maintain the credit structure of the
     country by strengthening the rule as well as apparent
     credit structure of the banks operating in the country and
     the interest of depositors. In an underdeveloped country
     like ours, where majority of the population are illiterate
     and poor and are not conversant with banking operations
     and in underdeveloped money and capital market with
     mixed economy, the Constitution charges the State to
     prevent exploitation and so the RBI would play both
     promotional and regulatory roles. Thus the RBI occupies
     a place of 'pre-eminence' to ensure monetary discipline
     and to regulate the economy or the credit system of the
     country as an expert body. It also advises the
     Government in public finance and monetary regulations.
     The banks or non-banking institutions shall have to
     regulate their operations in accordance not only with the
     provisions of the Act but also the rules and directions or
     instructions issued by the RBI in exercise of the power
     thereunder. Chapter 3-B expressly deals with regulations
     of deposit and finance received by the RNBCs. The
     directions, therefore, are statutory regulations."

<p id="p_108">     Thus, from the above, the law is well-settled that the

of the country, is empowered to regulate the banking system

<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_86">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949. It is in exercise of such powers
that the Reserve Bank of India has thought fit to issue the
impugned Master Circular.
</p>

<p id="p_109">     We are also not impressed by the submission canvassed
on behalf of the petitioners that the source of power has not
been indicated in the Master Circular and there is no reference
of any public interest in the impugned Circular. In short, the
submission on behalf of the petitioners is that, if the Master
Circular has been issued by the Reserve Bank of India in public
interest, then it should have been stated in so many words
along with the statutory provisions under which the Reserve
Bank of India derives the power.
</p>


<p id="p_110">     It is well-settled that if source of power is traceable,
exercise of such power cannot be set-aside merely because
the same has not been disclosed. In this context, we may
profitably refer to a decision of the Supreme Court in the case
of <a href="/doc/1960330/" id="a_87">Union of India v. Azadi Bachao Andolan</a>, (2004)10 SCC 1.
The issue before the Supreme Court was, whether the
impugned circular issued under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_88">Income Tax Act</a> was ultra
vires <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_89">Section 119</a> of the Act. The Supreme Court in para 46
observed thus, which, in our opinion, answers the contention
canvassed on behalf of the petitioners :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_75">     "46. While commenting adversely upon the validity of the
     impugned circular, the High Court says "that the circular
     itself does not show that the same has been issued under

     the circular is issued under <a href="/doc/618701/" id="a_91">Section 119</a> of the Income-tax
     Act, the same would be legally binding on the revenue.

     The circular does not deal with the power of the ITO to
     consider the question as to whether although apparently
     a company is incorporated in Mauritius but whether the
     company is also a resident of India and/or not a resident
     of Mauritius at all."</blockquote>


<p id="p_111">     It is trite law that as long as an authority has power,
which is traceable to a source, the mere fact that source of
power is not indicated in an instrument does not render the
instrument invalid.
</p>


<p id="p_112">     Although the learned advocates appearing on behalf of
the petitioners have placed strong reliance on a decision of the
Karnataka High Court in the case of E.Sathyanarayanan
(supra), yet with due deference we are unable to subscribe to
the views expressed by His Lordship, more particularly, when
there are Supreme Court decisions on the issue.
</p>


<p id="p_113">     DELEGATED LEGISLATION :
</p>

<p id="p_114">     The above takes us to deal with the submission as
regards the scope and power of the Reserve Bank of India to
issue the Master Circular in exercise of powers under the
delegated legislation.
</p>


<p id="p_115">     It is true that a delegated legislation can be challenged
before the Courts on the ground of being ultra vires the parent
Act. The Courts can adjudge the legality and validity of
delegated legislation by applying the doctrine of ultra vires.
The doctrine of ultra vires has two aspects : substantive and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                           Page 46 of 162</span>
         C/SCA/645/2014                            CAV JUDGEMENT



procedural. When delegated legislation goes beyond the scope
of the authority conferred by, or it is in conflict with, the parent
statute it is invalid and this is known as substantive ultra vires.
When the regulation-making authority deviates from the
procedure, if any, prescribed by the parent statute for making
regulations, it is known as procedural ultra vires. In these writ
petitions, what is urged is the substantive ultra vires only and
not procedural ultra vires. Whenever any person or body of
persons, exercising statutory authority acts beyond the powers
conferred upon him or them by statute, such acts become
ultra vires and, accordingly, void. In other words, substantive
ultra vires means the delegated legislation goes beyond the
scope of the authority conferred on it by the parent statute. It
is a fundamental principle of law that a public authority cannot
act outside the powers i.e., ultra vires, and it has been rightly
described as the central principle and foundation of large part
of administrative law by Prof. Wade in his Treatise on
Administrative Law. The act which is for any reason in excess
of power is ultra vires.

        legislation may be questioned on any of the grounds on
        which plenary legislation is questioned. In addition it may
        also be questioned on the ground that it does not
        conform to the statute under which it is made. It may
        further be questioned on the ground that it is contrary to
        some other statute. That is because subordinate
        legislation must yield to plenary legislation. It may also

     be questioned on the ground that it is unreasonable,
     unreasonable not in the sense of not being reasonable,
     but in the sense that it is manifestly arbitrary".</blockquote>


<p id="p_118">     In the same case, the Court also opined that the power
delegated by the statute to the delegate is limited by its terms
and subordinate to its objects. The delegate must act in good
faith, reasonably, intra vires the power granted and on
relevant consideration of material facts. It has also stated that
all his decisions must be in harmony with the Constitution and
other laws of the land; if they are manifestly unjust or
oppressive or outrageous or directed to an unauthorised end or
do not tend in some degree to the accomplishment of the
objects of delegation, Court might well say, Legislature never
intended to give authority to make such regulations, they are
unreasonable and ultra vires. Thus, delegated legislation or
subordinate legislation can be held valid only if it conforms
exactly to the power granted. Regulations, whether made
under the Constitution or a statute, must be intra vires the
parent law under which power has been delegated. If the
regulation-making power is conferred and the regulations
made are in excess of that power the regulation would be void
even if the Act provided that they shall have effect as if
enacted in the Act. The validity of the regulation is always
open to challenge on the ground that it is unauthorised. The
validity of the delegated legislation is a question of vires, that
is, whether or not the power has been exceeded or otherwise
wrongfully exercised or is inconsistent with the parent Act.
</p>

<p id="p_119">     The doctrine of ultra vires quite often is one of the
recognised       principles/grounds     to     invalidate   a   delegated

legislation. The basic principle of this doctrine is that an
authority being the creature of the law it has only such powers
as are granted to it by the law.

<p id="p_120">     Declaring a rule in the Karnataka Motor Vehicle Rules,
1963 ultra vires the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_93">Motor Vehicles Act</a>, 1939 as the rule was
inconsistent with a section in the Act, the Supreme Court, in
<a href="/doc/1245411/" id="a_94">State of Karnataka v. H.Ganesh Kamath</a>, AIR 1983 SC 550, held
that the rule-making power cannot include within its scope the
power to make a rule contrary to the provisions of the Act
conferring the rule-making power and that conferment of rule-
making power by an Act does not enable the rule-making
authority to make a rule which travels beyond the scope of the
enabling Act or which is inconsistent therewith or repugnant
thereto. The Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1901448/" id="a_95">State of U.P. v. Renusagar Power
Co</a>., reported in AIR 1988 SC 1737, held (Para 76) :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_78">     "If the exercise of power is in the nature of subordinate
     legislation, the exercise must conform to the provisions
     of the statute. All the conditions of the statute must be
     fulfilled. Thus, delegated legislation repugnant to, or
     inconsistent with or in contravention of, or in excess of,
     or overriding the provisions of, the parent Act is ultra
     vires."</blockquote>


<p id="p_121">     Thus, it is clear that if power is conferred to legislate only
with respect to certain topics or for certain purposes or in
certain circumstances, the limits of the power must not be
crossed. For this purpose, the phraseology of the delegating
provision becomes relevant. In applying the doctrine, the Court
has a three-fold task : first, to determine the meaning of the
words used in the Act itself to describe the delegated
legislation which the delegate is authorised to make; secondly,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                            Page 49 of 162</span>
       C/SCA/645/2014                                       CAV JUDGEMENT



to determine the meaning of the subordinate legislation itself,
and, finally, to decide whether the subordinate legislation
complies with that description.
</p>

<p id="p_122">      It also needs to be emphasised before proceeding further
to deal with the contention of the learned counsel for the
petitioner, that in evaluating the vires of the delegated
legislation,     the   Courts    start      with     the   presumption      of
constitutionality,     competence        and       reasonableness     of   the
delegated legislation impugned before it just as the Courts do
in respect of primary legislation by the legislature. As a general
proposition, delegated legislation is regarded as validly made,
and part of the law of the land, until a Court decides otherwise.
</p>

<p id="p_123">      In Hoffman-La Roche v. Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry, (1975) AC 295, Lord Diplock speaking for the House
of Lords referred to this aspect and observed :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_79">      "......the presumption that subordinate legislation is intra
      vires prevails in the absence of rebuttal, and that it
      cannot be rebutted except by a party to legal
      proceedings in a Court of competent jurisdiction who has
      locus standi to challenge the validity of the subordinate
      legislation in question."</blockquote>


<p id="p_124">      Thus, the Court while reviewing the validity of a
delegated       legislation,    should       presume       such   delegated
legislation prima facie to be intra vires and it is for the person
aggrieved to prove affirmatively that the presumption in favour
of constitutionality, competence, fairness and reasonableness
is unsustainable as held by the Apex Court in State of U. P. v.
Baburam, AIR 1961 SC 751. The onus of establishing invalidity
is on the challenger.

     The question whether a particular delegated legislation is
in excess of the power of the supporting legislation conferred
on the delegate, has to be determined with regard not only to
specific provisions contained in the relevant statute conferring
the power to make rule or regulation, but also the object and
purpose of the Act as can be gathered from the various
provisions of the enactment. It would be wholly wrong for the
Court to substitute its own opinion as to what principle or
policy would best serve the objects and purposes of the Act,
nor is it open to the Court to sit in judgment of the wisdom, the
effectiveness or otherwise of the policy, so as to declare a
regulation to be ultra vires merely on the ground that, in the
view of the Court, the impugned provision will not help to carry
through the object and purposes of the Act. The Supreme
Court reiterated the legal position, well established by a long
series of decisions, in <a href="/doc/174675/" id="a_96">Maharashtra State Board of Secondary
and Higher Secondary Education and another v. Paritosh

     concern itself with the wisdom or efficaciousness of such
     rules or regulations. It is exclusively within the province
     of the legislature and its delegate to determine, as a
     matter of policy, how the provisions of the statute can
     best be implemented and what measures, substantive as
     well as procedural would have to be incorporated in the
     rules or regulations for the efficacious achievement of

<p id="p_126">     Applying the aforenoted test, we are unable to hold that
the impugned circular amounts to impermissible delegation of
legislative power. An overall responsibility to find out the well
being of a Banking Company, in improving monetary stability
and economic growth as well as keeping in view the interests
of depositors, the Reserve Bank of India has to formulate its
policy vis-a-vis Banking Companies. 'Banking' as defined in
<a href="/doc/1920038/" id="a_97">Section 5(b)</a> only gives a grammatical meaning of the
transactions of a bank and nothing more. If any management
or supervision is to be done over the banking activities of a
bank, it will have to be governed by banking policy. The
'banking policy' and 'banking' are not independent but co-
ordinating      subjects   and     both       are   covered   within     the
supervisory powers of the Reserve Bank of India within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/587034/" id="a_98">Section 35A</a> of the Banking Regulation Act. Even
otherwise, the directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India
are in the larger interest of the public and it being a body of

borrowers as willful defaulters and the consequences of the
same, then the same could have been done only by enacting a
law within the meaning of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_99">Article 13</a> of the Constitution of
India, otherwise a circular will have no force of law.

<p id="p_131">     It is clear that the Master Circular has been issued with a
particular object. Whether a circular issued by a statutory
authority would be binding or not, or whether the same has a
statutory force or not, would depend upon the nature of the
statute. For the said purpose, the intention of the Legislature
must be considered.

     (b) Nemo judex in causa sua.



</pre><p id="p_139">     The duty to act fairly is the theme of the principles of
natural justice. However, the extent of the duty to act fairly will
normally be very limited where the authority exercises a
function which does not culminate in a binding decision. The
rule generally applies, at least with full force, only to the
conduct leading directly to a final act of the decision, and not
to the making of a preliminary decision or to an investigation
designed to obtain information for the purpose of a report or a
recommendation on which a subsequent decision may be
founded. (see Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol.1(i), 4th Edition,
paras 85 and 94.)



     The standard of fairness may be different where the
proceedings are in inquisitorial form.
</p>


<p id="p_140">     Bias can be classified under three different heads:

     a position that a bias must be assumed."

     "The natural justice 'bias' rule looks to external
     appearances rather than to proof of actual improper
     exercise of power. If the reasonable observer would have
     the requisite degree of suspicion of bias in the decision-
     maker then that decision can be challenged. It is a
     matter of the courts ensuring that 'justice is seen to be
     done'. Since successful challenge is based on
     appearances, it is natural that the types of matter to
     which the rule applies is somewhat confined. As we shall
     see it clearly applies to judicial and disciplinary functions
     but not generally more widely to administrative decision-
     making and actions."

     produce in the minds of the litigant or the public at large
     a reasonable doubt about the fairness of the
     administration of justice. It would always by a question of
     fact to be decided in each case. 'The principle', says
     Halsbury, 'nemo debet esse judex in causa propria sua
     precludes a justice, who is interested in the subject-
     matter of a dispute, from acting as a justice therein'. In
     our opinion, there is and can be no doubt about the
     validity of this principle and we are prepared to assume

     careful approach. If the evidence led by the parties in
     such a case is tested by cross-examination, it would be
     easier to determine where truth lies. But in the absence
     of cross-examination, appreciating the effect of
     competing affidavits is hot an easy matter. In such a
     case, the Court must always enquire on which side the
     probabilities lie and must scrutinise the affidavits very
     critically to determine which of them deserves to be

     course, in individual cases bias may be shown against a
     particular officer but in the absence of any proof of
     personal bias or connection merely because officers of a
     particular corporation are named as the authority does
     not mean that those officers would be biased. As has
     been held by the Constitution Bench, a Managing
     Director is a high-ranking officer. He is not personally

     decision one way or the other which he may be
     interested in supporting. This being the law it will have to

<p id="p_150">     Thus, from the above, if we are permitted to add, it
makes a little difference, whether "likelihood" could be

conducting the proceedings, his attitude towards the aggrieved

party, his attachment to the cause and his frame of mind,
whether preconceived or not. After getting the sum total of all
these, the court must ask, whether it would be enough to
erode the detachment and impartiality of the adjudicating
authority. If there was any likelihood of such erosion, the
decision complained of must be struck down so that the
streams of justice may be kept clear and pure, which is the
basic requirement of administration of justice. Therefore, it
would all depend on a case to case basis. In a given case, if the
court finds the action to be tainted with malafides or bias, then
the same could always be condemned and set at right.
However, only on the apprehension of misuse of such
provision, an otherwise valid statute should not be struck down
or condemned.

     provision. The people, through the Constitution, have
     vested the power to make laws in their representatives
     through Parliament in the same manner in which they
     have entrusted the responsibility to adjudge, interpret
     and construe law and the Constitution including its

     any assumption about the alleged abuse of the power."

them from availing of any additional facilities for floating a new
venture for a period of five years from the date the name of
the willful defaulter is published in the list of 'willful defaulters'
by the Reserve Bank of India. Such unreasonable restriction,
according to the petitioners, is violative of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_127">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of
the Constitution of India i.e. the right to carry on any
profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.

<p id="p_155">      According to the learned advocates appearing on behalf
of the petitioners, even if it is accepted that the Reserve Bank
of India has the power to issue the impugned circular as a
policy decision to curb the menace of the NPA and in larger
public interest, yet the Reserve Bank of India cannot debar any
other bank or financial institution from lending money to the
promoter of the company for a new venture or a project.

Constitution of India although in an altogether different factual
background, yet the principle propounded and explained would
be applicable to the case at hand. The observations of the
Supreme Court in paragraphs 10 to 18 are worth noting :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_100">     "10. It may be mentioned that to test the reasonability of
     a restriction we have to see the subject matter, extent of
     restriction, the mischief which it seeks to check, etc. The
     reasonableness of the restriction has to be determined in
     an objective manner and has to be seen from the point of
     view of the interest of the general public and not merely
     from the point of view of the persons upon whom the
     restrictions are imposed vide <a href="/doc/93885/" id="a_132">Hanif Quareshi v. State of
     Bihar</a>, AIR 1958 SC 731. Moreover, the impugned action
     of the authorities cannot be said to be unreasonable
     merely because in a given case, they may operate
     harshly, vide <a href="/doc/673450/" id="a_133">State of Gujarat v. Shantilal</a>, AIR 1969 SC
     634 (vide Para 52). As observed by the Supreme Court in

     1453 etc., the nature of the right alleged to have been
     infringed, the underlying purpose of the restriction
     imposed and the extent and urgency of the evil sought to
     be remedied thereby, disproportion of the imposition,
     prevailing conditions at the time etc., are the relevant
     considerations for determining whether the restriction is
     reasonable.

<blockquote id="blockquote_101">     11. Further, as held in Jyoti Pershad v. Union Territory of
     Delhi, AIR 1961 SC 1602, the standard of reasonableness
     must also vary from age to age and be related to the
     adjustments necessary to solve the problems which
     communities face from time to time. In adjudging the
     validity of the restriction the Court has necessarily to
     approach the question from the point of view of the social
     interest which the State action intends to promote, vide

</p><p id="p_159">12. Judged by these standards the impugned action of
the authorities cannot be faulted on the ground of lack of
reasonableness. As stated in the counter-affidavits filed
in these cases, the existing wholesale markets have
become the cause of immense traffic congestion in the
city, apart from causing diseases, pollution etc. Hence,
shifting the wholesale markets to the outskirts of the City
or beyond is clearly reasonable.
</p>

<p id="p_160">13. It must be remembered that certain matters are by
their very nature such as had better be left to the
administrative authorities instead of Courts themselves
seeking to substitute their own views and perceptions as
to what is the best solution to the problem. The present
is clearly an instance where this Court should not
interfere with the steps taken by the respondents to
resolve a pressing problem. In matters of policy the
Courts have a limited role and it should only interfere
with the same when it is clearly illegal. That clearly is not
the case here. The impugned action is a salutary step for
undoing a mischief, which was crying out for redress for a
long time, and it is not illegal.
</p>

<p id="p_161">14. As observed by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/93885/" id="a_139">Mohd. Hanif
Qureshi v. State of Bihar</a>, AIR 1958 SC 731, the Court
must presume, that the legislature understands and
correctly appreciates the need of its own people. The
legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm, and may
confine its restrictions to those where the need is
deemed to be the clearest. In our opinion, the same
principle would apply to executive action also, unless
there is clear violation of a statute or a constitutional
provision.
</p>

<p id="p_162">15. In our opinion, the State should not be hampered by
the Court in dealing with evils at their point of pressure.
All legislation, including delegated legislation (such as
the kind we are examining) and executive action is
essentially ad hoc. Since, social problems nowadays are
extremely complicated, this inevitably entails special
treatment for distinct social phenomena. If legislation or
executive action is to deal with realities it must address
itself to variations in society. The State must, therefore,

be left with wide latitude in devising ways and means of
social control and Regulation, and the Court should not,
unless compelled by the law, encroach into this field.
</p>

<p id="p_163">16. As Justice Frankfurter of the U.S. Supreme Court
observed in American Federation of Labour v. American
Sash and Door Co., 335 US 538 (1949) :-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_102">       "Even where the social undesirability of a law may
       be convincingly urged, invalidation of the law by a
       Court debilitates popular Democratic Government.
       Most laws dealing with social and economic
       problems are matters of trial and error. That which
       before trial appears to be demonstrably bad may
       belie prophecy in actual operation. But, even if a
       law is found wanting on trial, it is better that its
       defects should be demonstrated and removed by
       the legislature than that the law should be aborted
       by judicial fiat. Such, an assertion of judicial power
       defeats responsibility from those on whom in a
       democratic society it ultimately rests. Hence, rather
       than exercise judicial review Courts should
       ordinarily allow legislatures to correct their own
       mistakes wherever possible."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_164">In our opinion the same principle would apply to
executive action too.
</p>

<p id="p_165">17. Similarly, in his dissenting judgment in New State Ice
Co. v. Liebemann, 285 U.S. 262 (1932), Mr. Justice
Brandeis, the celebrated Judge of the U.S. Supreme Court
observed that the government must be left free to
engage in social experiments. Progress in the Social
Sciences, as in the Physical Sciences, depends on "a
process of trial and error" and Courts must not interfere
with necessary experiments.
</p>

<p id="p_166">18. Justice Brandeis also observed :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_103">       "To stay experimentation in things social and
       economic is a grave responsibility. Denial of the

     Thus, from the above, it could be said that having regard
to the object with which the Reserve Bank of India issued the
Master Circular and the policy decision to declare the
promoters of the company as willful defaulters, it could not be
said that the same is an unreasonable restriction violating
<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_140">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India.</blockquote>



<p id="p_167">     To sum up, the impugned circular does not suffer from
the vice of lack of power. It has been issued in the interest of
the banking business and is, thus, in public interest. It seeks to
ensure greater transparency and uniformity in identification
and treatment of the willful defaulters. It targets defaulters of
dues in excess of Rs.25 lac, thus laying down the threshold
limit for application of the circular. It applies to only those
defaulters who can be categorized as "willful" as defined in the
circular. It, thus, does not cover those borrowers who are
unable to pay the debt without there being any element of
willfulness. Surely, no borrower can claim a vested right to
seek financial assistance from a bank or a financial institution
no matter how willful or chronic his defaults in repayment of
past dues may have been. The circular, therefore, in general
terms, is not arbitrary.
</p>


<p id="p_168">     However, the matter does not rest over here. There is a
grey area which we have been able to identify so far as the
issue of unreasonable restriction and arbitrariness in the policy
decision of the Reserve Bank of India is concerned.
</p>

     We have noticed that the Master Circular which provides
for the guidelines pertaining to "willful default" and "willful
defaulter" embraces within it even the directors of the
company.
</p>


<p id="p_170">     We may, once again, at the cost of repetition, highlight
few provisions of the Circular which, in our opinion, deserve
consideration. In clause (2.5), which relates to penal measures,
sub-clause (d) reads as under :
</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote_105">     "(d) A covenant in the loan agreements, with the
     companies in which the banks/notified FIs have
     significant stake, should be incorporated by the banks/FIs
     to the effect that the borrowing company should not
     induct a person who is a promoter or director on the
     Board of a company which has been identified as a willful
     defaulter as per the definition at paragraph 2.1 above
     and that in case, such a person is found to be on the
     Board of the borrower company, it would take
     expeditious and effective steps for removal of the person
     from its Board."</blockquote>


<p id="p_171">     Clause (5) is with regard to reporting names of the
directors. Clauses (5.1) and (5.2) read as under :
</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote_106">     "5.1 Need for Ensuring Accuracy

     responsibility for reporting correct information and also
     accuracy of facts and figures rests with the concerned
     banks and financial institutions. Therefore, banks and
     financial institutions should take immediate steps to up-
     date their records and ensure that the names of current
     directors are reported. In addition to reporting the names

     of current directors, it is necessary to furnish information
     about directors who were associated with the company at
     the time the account was classified as defaulter, to put
     the other banks and financial institutions on guard. Banks
     and FIs may also ensure the facts about directors,
     wherever possible, by cross-checking with Registrar of
     Companies.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_107">     5.2 Position      regarding     Independent    and    Nominee
     directors

     Professional Directors who associate with companies for
     their expert knowledge act as independent directors.
     Such independent directors apart from receiving
     director's remuneration do not have any material
     pecuniary relationship or transactions with the company,
     its promoters, its management or its subsidiaries, which
     in the judgment of Board may affect their independent
     judgment. As a guiding principle of disclosure, no
     material fact should be suppressed while disclosing the
     names of a company that is a defaulter and the names of
     all directors should be published. However, while doing
     so, a suitable distinguishing remark should be made
     clarifying that the concerned person was an independent
     director. Similarly the names of directors who are
     nominees of government or financial institutions should
     also be reported but a suitable remark 'nominee director'
     should be incorporated. Therefore, against the names of
     Independent Directors and Nominee Directors, they
     should indicate the abbreviations "Ind" and "Nom"
     respectively in brackets to distinguish them from other
     directors."</blockquote>


<p id="p_172">     Thus, the above makes it clear that all the directors
irrespective of their type are brought within the purview of the
circular for the purpose of declaring them as willful defaulters.
Although in clause (5.2), the Reserve Bank of India has tried to
clarify the position as regards the independent and nominee
directors, yet a plain reading of clause (5.2) would suggest that
even the independent and nominee directors are not spared
but it would be within the discretion of the committee of high

directors.
</p>

<p id="p_173">     The circular speaks about "director" and "independent

</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote_108">     "A. Classification under the Companies Act
     Categories of Directors


     The Companies Act refers to the following two specific
categories of Directors:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_109">     1. Managing Directors; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_110">     2. Whole-time Directors.</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_111">     A Managing Director is a Director who has substantial
powers of management of the affairs of the company subject
to the superintendence, control and direction of the Board in
question. A Whole-time Director includes a Director who is in
the whole-time employment of the company, devotes his
whole-time of working hours to the company in question and
has a significant personal interest in the company as his
source of income.</blockquote>


<p id="p_174">     Every public company and private company, which is a
subsidiary of a public company, having a share capital of more
than Five Crore rupees (Rs. 5,00,00,000/-) must have a
Managing or Whole-time Director or a Manager.
</p>

<p id="p_175">     Further classification of Directors


      Based    on the       circumstances surrounding their
appointment, the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_142">Companies Act</a> recognizes the following
further types of Directors:
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">                           Page 71 of 162</span>
<p id="p_176"> C/SCA/645/2014                              CAV JUDGEMENT




</p><p id="p_177">1. First Directors: Subject to any regulations in the
Articles of a company, the subscribers to the
Memorandum of Association, or the company's charter or
constitution ("Memorandum"), shall be deemed to be the
Directors of the company, until such time when Directors
are duly appointed in the annual general meeting
("AGM").
</p><p id="p_178">2. Casual vacancies: Where a Director appointed at the
AGM vacates office before his or her term of office
expires in the normal course, the resulting vacancy may,
subject to the Articles, be filled by the Board. Such
person so appointed shall hold office up to the time which
the Director who vacated office would have held office if
he or she had not so vacated such office.
</p>

<p id="p_179">3. Additional Directors: If the Articles specifically so
provide or enable, the Board has the discretion, where it
feels it necessary and expedient, to appoint Additional
Directors who will hold office until the next AGM.
However, the number of Directors and Additional
Directors together shall not exceed the maximum
strength fixed in the Articles for the Board.
</p>

<p id="p_180">4. Alternate Director: If so authorized by the Articles or by
a resolution passed by the company in general meeting,
the Board may appoint an Alternate Director to act for a
Director ("Original Director"), who is absent for whatever
reason for a minimum period of three months from the
State in which the meetings of the Board are ordinarily
held. Such Alternate Director will hold office until such
period that the Original Director would have held his or
her office. However, any provision for automatic re-
appointment of retiring Directors applies to the Original
Director and not to the Alternate Director.
</p>

<p id="p_181">5. 'Shadow' Director: A person, who is not appointed to
the Board, but on whose directions the Board is
accustomed to act, is liable as a Director of the company,
unless he or she is giving advice in his or her professional
capacity. Thus, such a 'shadow' Director may be treated
as an 'officer in default' under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_143">Companies Act</a>.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                       Page 72 of 162</span>

</p><p id="p_183">6. De facto Director: Where a person who is not actually
appointed as a Director, but acts as a Director and is held
out by the company as such, such person is considered
as a de facto Director. Unlike a 'shadow' Director, a de
facto Director purports to act, and is seen to the outside
world as acting, as a Director of the company. Such a de
facto Director is liable as a Director under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_144">Companies
Act</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_184">7. Rotational Directors: At least two-thirds of the
Directors of a public company or of a private company
subsidiary of a public company have to retire by rotation
and the term "rotational Director" refers to such Directors
who have to retire (and may, subject to the Articles, be
eligible for re-appointment) at the end of his or her
tenure.
</p>

<p id="p_185">8.    Nominee Directors: They can be appointed by
certain shareholders, third parties through contracts,
lending public financial institutions or banks, or by the
Central Government in case of oppression or
mismanagement. The extent of a nominee Director's
rights and the scope of supervision by the shareholders,
is contained in the contract that enables such
appointments, or (as appropriate) the relevant statutes
applicable to such public financial institution or bank.
However, nominee Directors must be particularly careful
not to act only in the interests of their nominators, but
must act in the best interests of the company and its
shareholders as a whole.The fixing of liabilities on
nominee Directors in India does not turn on the
circumstances of their appointment or, indeed, who
nominated them as Directors. Chapter 4 and Chapter 5
that follow set out certain duties and liabilities that apply
to, or can be affixed on, Directors in general. Whether
nominee Directors are required by law to discharge such
duties or bear such liabilities will depend on the
application of the legal provisions in question, the
fiduciary duties involved and whether such nominee
Director is to be regarded as being in control or in charge
of the company and its activities. This determination
ultimately turns on the specific facts and circumstances
involved in each case.

     B. Classification under the Listing Agreement


      The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, read
with the rules and regulations made thereunder, requires
every company desirous of listing its shares on a recognized
Indian stock exchange, to execute a listing agreement
("Agreement") with such Indian stock exchange. This
Agreement is in a standard format (prescribed by the
Securities Exchange Board of India ("SEBI")), as amended by
SEBI from time to time. The Agreement provides for the
following further categories of Directors:

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_115">     3. Independent Director.</blockquote>


<p id="p_187">     Executive and non-executive Directors


      An Executive Director can be either a Whole-time
Director of the company (i.e., one who devotes his whole time
of working hours to the company and has a significant
personal interest in the company as his source of income), or a
Managing Director (i.e., one who is employed by the company
as such and has substantial powers of management over the
affairs of the company subject to the superintendence,
direction and control of the Board). In contrast, a non-
executive Director is a Director who is neither a Whole-time
Director nor a Managing Director. Clause 49 of the Agreement
prescribes that the Board shall have an optimum combination
of executive and non-executive Directors, with not less than
fifty percent (50%) of the Board comprising non-executive
Directors. Where the Chairman of the Board is a non-executive
Director, at least one-third of the Board should comprise
independent Directors and in case he is an executive Director,
at least half of the Board should comprise independent
Directors. Where the non-executive Chairman is a promoter of
the company or is related to any promoter or person

company shall consist of independent Directors.

"36. The meaning and true import of arbitrariness is
more easily visualized than precisely stated or defined.
The question, whether an impugned act is arbitrary or
not, is ultimately to be answered on the facts and in the
circumstances of a given case. An obvious test to
apply is to see whether there is any discernible
principle emerging from the impugned act and if
so, does it satisfy the test of reasonableness.
Where a mode is prescribed for doing an act and
there is no impediment in following that
procedure, performance of the act otherwise and
in a manner which does not disclose any
discernible principle which is reasonable, may
itself attract the vice of arbitrariness. Every State
action must be informed by reason and it follows
that an act uninformed by reason, is arbitrary. Rule
of law contemplates governance by laws and not by
humour, whims or caprices of the men to whom the
governance is entrusted for the time being. It is trite that
be you ever so high, the laws are above you. This is what
men in power must remember, always.

arbitrariness and the pitfalls to be avoided in all State

<blockquote id="blockquote_124">       "In this context it is important to emphasize
       that the absence of arbitrary power is the
       first essential of the rule of law upon which
       our whole constitutional system is based. In a
       system governed by rule of law, discretion,
       when conferred upon executive authorities,
       must be confined within clearly defined limits.
       The rule of law from this point of view means
       that decisions should be made by the
       application of known principle or without any
       rule it is where he is. If a decision is taken
       without any principle or without any rule it is
       unpredictable and such a decision is the
       antithesis of a decision taken in accordance

<p id="p_195">     It is well-settled that a company, be it a private or public,
being a juristic person, is different from an individual as a
citizen. For all acts of the company each and every director
need not be held responsible. It would depend upon the role of
each of the directors so far as the day-to-day management and
affairs of the company are concerned.

where the concept of piercing of the corporate veil is applied
by the courts in various situations. Two situations where such

                 "29. We are dealing here with an incorporated
                 company. The nature of the personality of an
                 incorporated company which arises from a
                 fiction of law, must be clearly under stood
                 before we proceed to determine whether the
                 word 'citizen' used in the Constitution
                 generally or in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_157">Article 19</a> specially, covers an
                 incorporated       company.       Unlike        an
                 unincorporated company, which has no
                 separate existence and which the law does not
                 distinguish from its members an incorporated
                 company has a separate existence and the
                 law recognises it as a legal person separate
                 and distinct from its members. This new legal
                 personality emerges from the moment of
                 incorporation and from that date the persons
                 subscribing to the memorandum of association
                 and other persons Joining as members are
                 regarded as a body corporate or a corporation
                 aggregate and the new person begins to
                 function as an entity. But the members who
                 form the incorporated company do not pool
                 their status or their personality. If all of them
                 are citizens of India the company does not
                 become a citizen of India any more than if all
                 are married the company would be a married
                 person. The personality of the members has
                 little to do with the persona of the
                 incorporated company. The persona that
                 comes into being is not the aggregate of the
                 personae either in law or in metaphor. The
                 corporation really has no physical existence ;

<p id="p_200">       In the later portion of the judgement, learned Judge

</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_128">                 "65. The next question is whether the State

                 it is contended that if the corporate veil is

<p id="p_201">       In my judgment it is not possible to pierce the veil
       of incorporation in our country to determine the
       citizenship of the members and then to give the
       corporation the benefit of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_160">Art. 19.</a> If we did pierce
       the veil and saw that the corporation was identical
       with Government there would be difficulty in giving,
       relief unless we held that the State can be its own
       citizen. Nor is it possible to raise an irrebuttable
       presumption about the citizenship of the members.
       I have given detailed reasons already in answer to
       the first question posed for our decision. If we go by

<p id="p_202">"....From the above judicial pronouncements, it can be
seen that concept of lifting or piercing the corporate veil
as some times referred to as cracking the corporate shell,
is applied by Courts sparingly and cautiously. It is
however, recognised that boundaries of such principle
have not yet been defined and areas where such
principle may have to be applied may expand.
Principally, the concept of corporate body being an
independent          entity      enjoying       existence
independent of its directors, is a well known
principle. Its assets are distinct and separate and
distinct from those of its members. Its creditors
cannot obtain satisfaction from the assets of its
members. However, with ever developing world and
expanding economic complexities, the Courts have
refused to limit the scope and parameters or areas where
corporate veil may have to be lifted.

     incorporation of an entity is only to create a smoke
     screen to defraud the revenue and shield the individuals
     who behind the corporate veil are the real operators of
     the company and beneficiaries of the fraud, the Courts
     have not hesitated in ignoring the corporate status and
     striking at the real beneficiaries of such complex design.

<p id="p_204">     <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_162">Section 179</a> of the Act itself is a statutory creation of
     piercing of corporate veil. Ordinarily, directors of a

     section(1) of <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_163">section 179</a> of the Act, however, subject to

     In In re National Bank of Wales, Ltd., (1899)2 Ch 629, it
was held that, "A director who is acting honestly himself is
entitled to trust the officers of the company not to conceal
from him what they ought to report to him, if he has no
reasonable ground for suspecting that they are deceiving him."
Directors are not liable for all their mistakes but only for
negligence which is in a business sense culpable or gross. Nor
is a director liable for untrue representations made to the
share-holders if he honestly believed the representations to be
true and had at the time reasonable grounds for his belief.

     "The charge of neglect appears to rest on the assertion
     that Mr.Cory, like the other directors, did not attend to
     any details of business not brought before them by the
     general manager or the chairman, and the argument
     raises a serious question as to the responsibility of all
     persons holding positions like that of directors, how far
     they are called upon to distrust and be on their guard
     against the possibility of fraud being committed by their
     subordinates of every degree. It is obvious if there is such
     a duty it must render anything like an intelligent
     devolution of labour impossible. Was Mr. Cory to turn
     himself into an auditor, a managing director, a chairman,
     and find out whether auditors, managing directors, and
     chairman were all alike deceiving him? That the letters of
     the auditors were kept from him is clear. That he was
     assured that provision had been made for bad debts, and
     that he believed such assurances, is involved in the
     admission that he was guilty of no moral fraud; so that it
     comes to this, that he ought to have discovered a
     network of conspiracy and fraud by which he was
     surrounded, and found out that his own brother and the
     managing director (who have since been made criminally
     responsible for frauds connected with their respective
     offices) were inducing him to make representations as to
     the prospects of the concern and the dividends properly
     payable which have turned out to be improper and false.
     I cannot think that it can be expected of a director that
     he should be watching either the inferior officers of the
     bank or verifying the calculations of the auditors himself.
     The business of life could not go on if people could not
     trust those who are put into a position of trust for the
     express purpose of attending to details of management".

<p id="p_209">     In our opinion, a director of a company other than the
promoter or a direct borrower of the loan from the bank and
could also be a director who has a limited role to play and not
directly or indirectly responsible for the company going in a
debt cannot be restrained, if he himself on his own, wants to
start a business or a new venture, from approaching a bank for
financial assistance. Apart from a social stigma, it is a direct
infringement on the right of such a director to carry on trade or
business under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_165">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>


<p id="p_210">     This provision in the circular shatters the concept of the
identity of a company different and distinct from its directors
without providing any safeguards. It does not distinguish
between      a    director   who   is   involved   in   the   day-to-day
functioning of a company as against those who are not. The
circular paints all directors with the same brush.
</p>

<p id="p_211">     Therefore, we have reached to a conclusion that the
Master Circular, so far as it is sought to be made applicable to
all the directors of the company is arbitrary and unreasonable.

We, at the cost of repetition, state that we are not questioning
the power of the Reserve Bank of India to issue the Master
Circular or even the policy decision regarding the same, but we
are only concerned with the unreasonable restriction imposed
on all the directors of the company. We find an element of
arbitrariness in such policy decision. To this limited extent, we
hold that the Master Circular is violative of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_166">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of
the Constitution of India and deserves to be struck down
partially.
</p>


<p id="p_213">      LEGALITY AND VALIDITY OF THE NOTICE :
</p>
<p id="p_214">      Since we have dealt with all the submissions regarding
the constitutional validity of the Master Circular, we shall now
look into the legality and validity of the notice issued by the
bank so far as the proposed action of declaring the petitioners
as willful defaulters is concerned.
</p>


<p id="p_215">      So far as the petitioners of Special Civil Application
No.645 of 2014 are concerned, they were served with a notice
dated 19th February 2013, indicating that they had been
availing the facilities from the branch office of the bank at
Ahmedabad, the details have been stated in the notice. It has
been further stated that their accounts were classified as
"NPA" on 30th June 2012 with the outstanding balance of
Rs.10,27,23,076=00. They were informed that the bank had
already taken the SARFAESI action and filed O.A. No.200 of
2012 for recovery of Rs.10.80 crore in D.R.T.-I, Ahmedabad. It
is further stated that the bank proposed to classify them as a
willful defaulters for the reasons stated in the notice, mainly

default in meeting its payment/repayment obligation and
siphoning of the funds by utilizing the same for other purpose
rather than for the purpose for which the loan was obtained.
Once again, a second show-cause notice dated 14th May 2013
was issued, calling upon the petitioners to show-cause as to
why they should not be classified as "willful defaulters". The
final notice is dated 8th January 2014, wherein it has been
stated that the petitioners should appear personally before the
Grievances Redressal Committee on 17th January 2014 for
personal hearing in the matter.
</p>


<p id="p_216">     According to Mr.Shah, the learned advocate appearing on
behalf of the petitioners, the impugned show-cause notice fails
to disclose any material against the petitioners. The notice also
fails to give clear fifteen days' time by way of an opportunity to
meet with the same as stipulated in clause 3(iii) of the Circular.
</p>


<p id="p_217">     We have perused the show-cause notices on record. We
may only say that except stating that the accounts have been
classified as "NPA" and that the unit has defaulted in meeting
with its payment/repayment obligation to the bank, no other
materials have been disclosed with a view to give an
opportunity to the petitioners to meet with the show-cause
notice.
</p>


<p id="p_218">     The show-cause notice is absolutely vague and contains
no factual or other materials. We fail to understand on what
basis the bank has alleged in the show-cause notice that the
funds provided by the bank have been siphoned of and the

same were used for the purpose other than the project for
which the loan was sanctioned. If such are the nature of the
allegations, then at least it is expected of the bank to provide
some materials so that the petitioners can meet with the
same. It has to be held that there is violation of the principles
of natural justice. One of the facets of the principles of natural
justice is fairness which, we do not find on the part of the bank
in the proposed action.
</p>


<p id="p_219">     We have noticed one thing that mere failure on the part
of the borrower to repay the amount of loan by itself does not
entail the liability of being termed as a "willful default" and
thereby "willful defaulters". "Willful default" broadly covers the
following :
</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote_136">     (a) Deliberate non-payment of the dues despite adequate
     cash flow and good networth;
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_137">     (b) Siphoning off of funds to the detriment of the
     defaulting unit;

<blockquote id="blockquote_138">     (c) Assets financed either not been purchased or been
     sold and proceeds have been misutilised;

<blockquote id="blockquote_139">     (d) Misrepresentation/falsification of records;
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_140">     (e) Disposal/removal       of     securities   without     bank's
     knowledge;
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_141">     (f) Fraudulent transactions by the borrower.</blockquote>


<p id="p_220">     The show-cause notice is absolutely silent regarding the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">                            Page 89 of 162</span>

same. It could be the case of the bank that there has been a
deliberate non-payment of the dues despite adequate cash-
flow and good net-worth but, before alleging, there has to be
some material with the bank and the same should be prima
facie disclosed to the borrower so that he could make good his
case that there has been no deliberate non-payment of the
dues. For example, if it is the case of the bank that there is
adequate cash-flow and good net-worth and despite that the
borrower has failed in repayment of the loan, then the bank
should disclose the source of information regarding the
adequate cash-flow and good net-worth.
</p>


<p id="p_221">       We are not satisfied with the manner in which the bank
wants to proceed against the petitioners. The bank can
definitely proceed in accordance with the policy decision as
reflected from the Master Circular, but the same has to be in
accordance with law.
</p>


<p id="p_222">       We are of the view that since the show-cause notice is
bereft of basic details and material particulars, the same
deserves to be quashed and set-aside. It would be open for the
bank    to     once     again   issue    a        fresh   show-cause     notice
incorporating the necessary materials and details on the basis
of which it wants to make good its allegations that the
petitioners are willful defaulters within the meaning of the
same as explained in the Master Circular.
</p>

issued to the petitioners of Special Civil Application No.10120

of 2014 is concerned. However, the question is, whether we
can look into the same and issue an appropriate writ, order or
direction to a Standard Chartered Bank which, although is a
scheduled bank figuring in a Second Schedule to the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_167">Reserve
Bank of India Act</a>, 1934, yet is a private bank. Such being the
position, whether the Standard Chartered Bank would be
amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_168">Article 226</a>
of the Constitution of India, is a question which we need to
consider.

<p id="p_224">     In the case of <a href="/doc/1186368/" id="a_169">Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib</a>, AIR 1981 SC
487, the Supreme Court laid down certain relevant tests for
determining whether a company/society/corporation can be
held to be an agency or instrumentality of the State
Government. These tests are as under :--
</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote_142">     "(1) One thing is clear that if the entire share capital of
     the corporation is held by Govt. it would go a long way
     towards indicating that the corporation is an
     instrumentality or agency of Government.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_143">     (2) Where the financial assistance of the State is so much
     as to meet almost entire expenditure of the corporation,
     it would afford Some indication of the corporation being
     impregnated with governmental character.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_144">     (3) It may also be a relevant factor .... whether the
     corporation enjoys monopoly status which is the State
     conferred or State protected.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_145">     (4) Existence of 'deep and pervasive State control may
     afford an indication that the Corporation is a State
     Agency or instrumentality.
</blockquote>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">                            Page 91 of 162</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_146">       C/SCA/645/2014                              CAV JUDGEMENT



     (5) If the functions of the corporation of Public
     importance and closely related to governmental
     functions it would be a relevant factor in classifying the
     corporation as an instrumentality or agency of Govt.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_147">     (6) Specifically, if a department of Govt. is transferred to
     a corporation, it would be a strong factor supportive of
     this inference of the Corporation being an instrumentality
     or agency of Government."</blockquote>


<p id="p_225">     Proceeding further, the Supreme Court held that it was
immaterial whether the corporation was created by a statute
or under a state. The test is whether it is an instrumentality or
agency of the Government and not as to how it was created. In
the said case their Lordships proceeded to observe that the
Government may act through the instrumentality or agency of
a natural person or it may employ the instrumentality or
agency of juridical person to carry out its functions. The test is
that it will be considered to be an agency and instrumentality
of the State. It is true that the corporation is a distinct juristic
entity with a corporate structure of its own and it carries on its
functions on business principles with a certain amount of
autonomy which is necessary as well as useful from the point
of view of effective business management but behind the
formal ownership which is cast in the corporate mould, the
reality is very much the deeply pervasive presence of the
Government, and it is in fact the Government which acts
through the instrumentality or. agency of the corporation or
the juristic person. If the instrumentality and agency of the
Govt. discharges the Governmental functions it must be
subject to same limitations in the field of constitutional law as
the Government itself, though in the eye of the law it would be
a distinct and independent legal entity. In Ajay Hasia's case


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">                             Page 92 of 162</span>

(supra), the Supreme Court was considering the obligations of
instrumentalities and agencies of the Government to respect
the fundamental rights of the citizens and they were held to be
bound to enforce the fundamental rights guaranteed to the
citizens of India under Part III of the Constitution of India. If this
binding was not there, the fundamental rights in the opinion of
the Supreme Court would then be reduced to an idle dream or
a promise of unreality. Because in the constitution philosophy
of a democratic socialist public Govt. has to undertake a
multitude of socio-economic operations and the Govt. having
regard to the practical advantages of functioning through the
legal    device          of   a   corporation         by   resorting   to   create
instrumentalities or agencies which will not exonerate the
Govt. itself from obeying the fundamental rights of the citizens.
In the context of enforcing fundamental rights, the Supreme
Court laid emphasis that by process of judicial construction
fundamental rights cannot be rendered futile and meaningless.
Because in the opinion of the Apex Court, it is the fundamental
rights which alone with the directive principles constitute the
life force of the Constitution of India and they must be put into
effective action by meaningful and purposeful interpretation.
Therefore, it was observed that if a corporation or a company
is the instrumentality or agency of Government, it must be
held to be an authority within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_170">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution and subject to the same basic obligation to obey
the fundamental rights as the Government.
</p>


<p id="p_226">        Applying the test nos.1 and 2 to the facts of the case on
hand, no materials have been placed on record to even
remotely indicate that the share capital of the bank is held by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                                     Page 93 of 162</span>

the Central Government or the State Government, or the bank
is dependent upon the Government for financial assistance.
There is nothing to even remotely suggest that the Standard
Chartered Bank enjoys any monopoly status conferred by the
State. With regard to the fourth test, there is nothing to
indicate existence of "deep and pervasive State control". All
that can be said is that the directives of the Reserve Bank of
India are binding on the bank. With regard to the fifth test,
although it has been very vociferously submitted by Mr.Shelat,
the learned appearing on behalf of the petitioners, that the
functions of the bank are of public importance and further the
bank could be said to be discharging a public function which is
akin to a Governmental function, yet this argument pales into
insignificance in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_171">Federal Bank Limited v. Sagar Thomas and others</a>,
(2003)10 SCC 733. We shall discuss the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of Federal Bank Limited (supra) a
little later.
</p>


<p id="p_227">      While dealing with the test based on functions of the
Coirporation of public importance, the Supreme Court in
Ramana Dayaram Shetty's case, AIR 1979 SC 1628, referred
"to E.S.Evans v. Charles E.Newton, (1966)382 US 296 and
Smith v. Allwright, (1943)32 US 649, and observed that the
decisions show that the test of public or governmental
character of the function is not easy of application and does
not invariably lead to the correct inference because the range
of governmental activity is broad and varied and merely
because an activity may be such as may legitimately be
carried on by Government, it does not mean that a Corporation


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">                           Page 94 of 162</span>
         C/SCA/645/2014                                          CAV JUDGEMENT



which      is     otherwise     a      private        entity,   would     be     an
instrumentality or agency of the Government by reason of
carrying of such activity. In applying the test, therefore, a
further precaution is to be taken and it is to be seen whether
the public nature of the function is impregnated with
governmental             character      or      "tied     or    entwined        with
Government" or fortified by some other additional factor (vide
observations in para 18 column 2 at page 641). In our view,
therefore, the fifth test is also not satisfied.
</p>


<p id="p_228">      Thus, so far as the tests laid down by the Supreme Court
in the case of Ajay Hasia (supra) is concerned, none of the
tests could be said to be fulfilled so as to make the Standard
Chartered Bank, a private bank, amenable to the writ
jurisdiction of this Court.

       corporation set up under a special statute to carry
       on a business or service which Parliament thinks
       necessary to be carried on in the interest of the
       nation is an agency or instrumentality of the State
       and would be subject to the limitations expressed in
       <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_181">Article 13(2)</a> of the Constitution. The State is an
       abstract entity. It can only act through the
       instrumentality or agency of natural or juridicial
       persons. Therefore, there is nothing strange in the
       notion of the State acting through a corporation and
       making it an agency or instrumentality of the
       State".
</p>

<p id="p_232">It is pertinent to note that functional tests became
necessary because of the State having chosen to entrust
its own functions to an instrumentality or agency in
absence whereof that function would have been a State
activity on account of its public importance and being
fundamental to the life of the people.
</p>

<p id="p_233">The philosophy underlying the expansion of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_182">Article 12</a> of
the Constitution so as to embrace within its ken such
entitites which would not otherwise be the State within
the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_183">Article 12</a> of the Constitution has been
pointed out by the eminent jurist H.M. Seervai in
Constitutional Law of India (Silver Jubilee Edition, Vol.1).
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_152">       "The Constitution should be so interpreted that the
       governing power, wherever located, must be
       subjected         to     fundamental      constitutional
       limitations............ Under <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_184">Article 13(2)</a> it is State
       action of a particular kind that is prohibited.</blockquote>
<p id="p_234">       Individual invasion of individual rights is not,
       generally speaking, covered by <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_185">Article 13(2).</a> For,

       that the Corporation must be created by the State

       and it must invade the constitutional rights of
       individuals"(Para 7.54). "The line of reasoning
       developed by Mathew J. prevents a large-scale
       evasion of fundamental rights by transferring work
       done     in   Govt.   Departments     to   statutory
       Corporations, whilst retaining Govt. control.
       Company legislation in India permits tearing of the
       corporate veil in certain cases and to look behind
       the real legal personality. But Mathew J. achieved
       the same result by a different route, namely, by
       drawing out the implications of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_188">Article 13(2)" (Para
       7.57 ibid).</a>
</p>

<p id="p_235">The terms instrumentality or agency of the State are not
to be found mentioned in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_189">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.
Nevertheless they fall within the ken of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_190">Article 12</a>
of the Constitution for the simple reason that if the
State chooses to set up an instrumentality or
agency and entrusts it with the same power,
function or action which would otherwise have
been exercised or undertaken by itself, there is no
reason why such instrumentality or agency should
not be subject to same constitutional and public
law limitations as the State would have been. In
different judicial pronouncements, some of which we
have reviewed, any company, corporation, society or any
other entity having a juridical existence if it has been
held to be an instrumentality or agency of the State, it
has been so held only on having found to be an alter ego,
a double or a proxy or a limb or an off-spring or a mini-
incarnation or a vicarious creature or a surrogate and so
on __ by whatever name called __ of the State. In short,
the material available must justify holding of the entity
wearing a mask or a veil worn only legally and outwardly
which on piercing fails to obliterate the true character of
the State in disguise. Then it is an instrumentality or
agency of the State.
</p>

<p id="p_236">It is this basic and essential distinction between an
'instrumentality or agency' of the State and 'other
authorities' which has to be borne in mind. An authority
must be an authority sui juris to fall within the meaning
of the expression 'other authorities' under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_191">Article 12.</a> A
juridical entity, though an authority, may also satisfy the

test of being an instrumentality or agency of the State in
which event such authority may be held to be an
instrumentality or agency of the State but not the vice
versa.
</p>

<p id="p_237">We sum up our conclusions as under:-
</p>

<p id="p_238">(1) Simply by holding a legal entity to be an
instrumentality or agency of the State it does not
necessarily become an authority within the meaning of
'other authorities' in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_192">Article 12.</a> To be an authority, the
entity should have been created by a statute or under a
statute and functioning with liability and obligations to
public. Further, the statute creating the entity should
have vested that entity with power to make law or issue
binding directions amounting to law within the meaning
of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_193">Article 13(2)</a> governing its relationship with other
people or the affairs of other people __ their rights,
duties, liabilities or other legal relations. If created under
a statute, then there must exist some other statute
conferring on the entity such powers. In either case, it
should have been entrusted with such functions as
are governmental or closely associated therewith
by    being       of   public    importance        or   being
fundamental to the life of the people and hence
governmental. Such authority would be the State,
for, one who enjoys the powers or privileges of the
State must also be subjected to limitations and
obligations of the State. It is this strong statutory
flavour and clear indicia of power __ constitutional
or statutory, and its potential or capability to act
to the detriment of fundamental rights of the
people, which makes it an authority; though in a
given case, depending on the facts and
circumstances, an authority may also be found to
be an instrumentality or agency of the State and
to that extent they may overlap. Tests 1, 2 and 4 in
Ajay Hasia enable determination of Governmental
ownership or control. Tests 3, 5 and 6 are 'functional'
tests. The propounder of the tests himself has used the
words suggesting relevancy of those tests for finding out
if an entity was instrumentality or agency of the State.
Unfortunately thereafter the tests were considered
relevant for testing if an authority is the State and this


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">                       Page 99 of 162</span>
       C/SCA/645/2014                             CAV JUDGEMENT



     fallacy has occurred because of difference between
     'instrumentality and agency' of the State and an
     'authority' having been lost sight of sub-silentio,
     unconsciously and un-deliberated. In our opinion, and
     keeping in view the meaning which 'authority' carries,
     the question whether an entity is an 'authority' cannot be
     answered by applying Ajay Hasia tests.
</p>

<p id="p_239">     (2) The tests laid down in Ajay Hasia's case are relevant
     for the purpose of determining whether an entity is an
     instrumentality or agency of the State. Neither all the
     tests are required to be answered in positive nor a
     positive answer to one or two tests would suffice. It will
     depend upon a combination of one or more of the
     relevant factors depending upon the essentiality and
     overwhelming nature of such factors in identifying the
     real source of governing power, if need be by removing
     the mask or piercing the veil disguising the entity
     concerned. When an entity has an independent legal
     existence, before it is held to be the State, the person
     alleging it to be so must satisfy the Court of brooding
     presence of government or deep and pervasive control of
     the government so as to hold it to be an instrumentality
     or agency of the State."

     "(1) One thing is clear that if the entire share capital of

     way towards indicating that the corporation is an
     instrumentality or agency of Government.
</p>

<p id="p_243">     (2) Where the financial assistance of the State is so much

<p id="p_250">     In the aforesaid context, it will be profitable for us to look
into a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_204">Federal
Bank Limited v. Sagar Thomas and others</a>, (2003)10 SCC 733.
In the said case, the respondent no.1 was working as a Branch
Manager in the Federal Bank. He was suspended on 29th May
1982 since a disciplinary inquiry was ordered into some
charges of misconduct. The Inquiry Officer found him guilty of
the charges and ultimately awarded punishment of dismissal.
The respondent no.1 challenged his dismissal by filing a writ
petition in the High Court. A preliminary objection to the
maintainability of the writ petition was taken by the appellant
Bank, saying that it was a private bank and not a State or its
agency or instrumentality within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_205">Article 12</a> of
the Constitution of India. The learned Single Judge of the High
Court, however, found that the Federal Bank performed a
public duty, and as such, it would get covered under the
definition of 'other authority' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_206">Article 12</a>,
and as such, the writ petition was maintainable. The order
passed by the learned Single Judge was carried in appeal and

the appeal was also dismissed. The Federal Bank challenged
the order passed by the High Court, dismissing the appeal,
before the Supreme Court. The question which fell for the
consideration before the Supreme Court on appeal was,
whether the appellant Bank was a private body or fell within
the definition of a State or legal or other authorities under the
control of the Government within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_207">Article 12</a> of
the Constitution of India.
</p>


<p id="p_251">     The observations of the Supreme Court as contained in
paragraphs 26 to 33 are worth noting :
</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote_157">     "26. A company registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_208">Companies Act</a> for
     the purposes of carrying on any trade or business is a
     private enterprise to earn livelihood and to make profits
     out of such activities. Banking is also a kind of profession
     and a commercial activity, the primary motive behind it
     can well be said to earn returns and profits. Since time
     immemorial, such activities have been carried on by
     individuals generally. It is a private affair of the company
     though case of nationalized banks stands on a different
     footing. There may, well be companies, in which majority
     of the share capital may be contributed out of the State
     funds and in that view of the matter there may be more
     participation or dominant participation of the State in
     managing the affairs of the company. But in the present
     case we are concerned with a banking company which
     has its own resources to raise its funds without any
     contribution or shareholding by the State. It has its own
     Board of Directors elected by its shareholders. It works
     like any other private company in the banking business
     having no monopoly status at all. Any company carrying
     on banking business with a capital of five lacs will
     become a scheduled bank. All the same, banking activity
     as a whole carried on by various banks undoubtedly has
     an impact and effect on the economy of the country in
     general. Money of the shareholders and the depositors is
     with such companies, carrying on banking activity. The


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">                             Page 104 of 162</span>

banks finance the borrowers on any given rate of interest
at a particular time. They advance loans as against
securities. Therefore, it is obviously necessary to have
regulatory check over such activities in the interest of the
company itself, the shareholders, the depositors as well
as to maintain the proper financial equilibrium of the
national economy. The Banking companies have not
been set up for the purposes of building economy of the
State on the other hand such private companies have
been voluntarily established for their own purposes and
interest but their activities are kept under check so that
their activities may not go wayward and harm the
economy in general. A private banking company with
all freedom that it has, has to act in a manner that
it may not be in conflict with or against the fiscal
policies of the State and for such purposes,
guidelines are provided by the Reserve Bank so
that a proper fiscal discipline, to conduct its affairs
in carrying on its business, is maintained. So as to
ensure adherence to such fiscal discipline, if need
be, at times even the management of the company
can be taken over. Nonetheless, as observed
earlier, these are all regulatory measures to keep
a check and provide guideline and not a
participatory dominance or control over the affairs
of the company. For other companies in general
carrying on other business activities may be
manufacturing, other industries or any business, such
checks are provided under the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_209">Companies Act</a>, as indicated earlier. There also, the main
consideration is that the company itself may not sink
because of its own mismanagement or the interest of the
shareholders or people generally may not be jeopardized
for that reason. Besides taking care of such interest as
indicated above, there is no other interest of the State, to
control the affairs and management of the private
companies. The care is taken in regard to the industries
covered under the Industries (Development and
<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_210">Regulation) Act</a>, 1951 that their production which is
important for the economy may not go down yet the
business activity is carried on by such companies or
corporations which only remains a private activity of the
entrepreneurs/companies.

amenable to the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_211">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution. But in certain circumstances a writ may
issue to such private bodies or persons as there may be
statutes which need to be complied with by all concerned
including the private companies. For example, there are
certain legislations like the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_212">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, the
<a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_213">Minimum Wages Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_214">Factories Act</a> or for maintaining
proper environment say Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_215">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 or Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_216">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 etc. or statutes of the like nature
which fasten certain duties and responsibilities statutorily
upon such private bodies which they are bound to
comply with. If they violate such a statutory provision a
writ would certainly be issued for compliance of those
provisions. For instance, if a private employer dispense
with the service of its employee in violation of the
provisions contained under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_217">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in
innumerable cases the High Court interfered and have
issued the writ to the private bodies and the companies
in that regard. But the difficulty in issuing a writ may
arise where there may not be any non-compliance or
violation of any statutory provision by the private body.
In that event a writ may not be issued at all. Other
remedies, as may be available, may have to be resorted
to.

<p id="p_253">28. The six factors which have been enumerated in the
case of Ajay Hasia (supra) and approved in the later
decisions in the case of Ramana (supra) and the seven
Judges Bench in the case of Pradeep Kumar Biswas
(supra) may be applied to the facts of the present case
and see as to those tests apply to the appellant bank or
not. As indicated earlier, share capital of the appellant
bank is not held at all by the government nor any
financial assistance is provided by the State, nothing to
say which may meet almost the entire expenditure of the
company. The third factor is also not answered since the
appellant bank does not enjoy any monopoly status nor it
can be said to be an institution having State protection.
So far control over the affairs of the appellant bank is
concerned, they are managed by the Board of Directors
elected by its shareholders. No governmental agency or
officer is connected with the affairs of the appellant bank
nor anyone of them is a member of the Board of
Directors. In the normal functioning of the private

banking company there is no participation or
interference of the State or its authorities. The
statutes have been framed regulating the financial
and commercial activities so that fiscal equilibrium
may be kept maintained and not get disturbed by
the     malfunctioning       of  such     companies      or
institutions involved in the business of banking.
These are regulatory measures for the purposes of
maintaining the healthy economic atmosphere in
the country. Such regulatory measures are
provided for other companies also as well as
industries manufacturing goods of importance.
Otherwise these are purely private commercial
activities. It deserves to be noted that it hardly
makes any difference that such supervisory
vigilance is kept by the Reserve Bank of India
under a Statute or the Central Government. Even if
it was with the Central Government in place of the
Reserve Bank of India it would not have made any
difference, therefore, the argument based on the
decision of All India Bank Employees' Association
(supra) does not advance the case of the
respondent. It is only in case of malfunctioning of the
company that occasion to exercise such powers arises to
protect the interest of the depositors, shareholders or the
company itself or to help the company to be out of the
woods. In the times of normal functioning such occasions
do not arise except for routine inspections etc. with a
view to see that things are moved smoothly in keeping
with fiscal policies in general.

<p id="p_254">29. There are a number of such companies carrying on
the profession of banking. There is nothing which can be
said to be close to the governmental functions. It is an
old profession in one form or the other carried on by
individuals or by a group of them. Losses incurred in the
business are theirs as well as the profits. Any business or
commercial activity, may be banking, manufacturing
units or related to any other kind of business generating
resources, employment, production and resulting in
circulation of money are no doubt, are such which do
have impact on the economy of the country in general.
But such activities cannot be classified one falling in the
category of discharging duties, functions of public nature.
Thus the case does not fall in the fifth category of cases

enumerated in the case of Ajay Hasia (supra). Again we
find that the activity which is carried on by the appellant
is not one which may have been earlier carried on by the
government and transferred to the appellant company.
For the sake of argument even if it may be assumed that
one or the other test as provided in the case of Ajay
Hasia (supra) may be attracted that by itself would not
be sufficient to hold that it is an agency of the State or a
company carrying on the functions of public nature. In
this connection, observations made in the case of
Pradeep Kumar Biswas (supra) quoted earlier would also
be relevant.
</p>

<p id="p_255">30. We may now consider the two decisions i.e. Andi
Mukta (supra) and the U.P. State Co-operative Land
Development Bank Ltd.(supra)upon which much reliance
has been placed on behalf of the respondents to show
that a writ would lie against the appellant company. So
far the decision in the case of U.P. State Co-operative
Land Development Bank Ltd.(supra) is concerned, it
stands entirely on a different footing and we have
elaborately discussed it earlier.
</p>

<p id="p_256">31. The other case which has been heavily relied upon is
Andi Mukta (supra). It is no doubt held that a Mandamus
can be issued to any person or authority performing
public duty, owing positive obligation to the affected
party. The writ petition was held to be maintainable since
the teacher whose services were terminated by the
institution was affiliated to the university and was
governed by the Ordinances, casting certain obligations
which it owed to that petitioner. But it is not the case
here. Our attention has been drawn by the learned
counsel for the appellant to paragraphs 12, 13 and 21 of
the decision (Andi Mukta) to indicate that even according
to this case no writ would lie against the private body
except where it has some obligation to discharge which is
statutory or of public character.

lays the banking policy in the interest of the
banking system or in the interest of monetary
stability or sound economic growth having due

regard to the interests of the depositors etc. as
provided under <a href="/doc/216565/" id="a_218">Section 5(c)(a)</a> of the Banking
Regulation Act does not mean that the private
companies carrying on the business of or
commercial activity of banking, discharge any
public function or public duty. These are all
regulatory measures applicable to those carrying
on commercial activity in banking and these
companies are to act according to these provisions
failing which certain consequences follow as
indicated in the Act itself. Provision regarding
acquisition of a banking company by the Government, it
may be pointed out that any private property can be
acquired by the Government in public interest. It is now
judicially accepted norm that private interest has to give
way to the public interest. If a private property is
acquired in public interest it does not mean that the
party whose property is acquired is performing or
discharging any function or duty of public character
though it would be so for acquiring authority.
</p>

<p id="p_258">33. For the discussion held above, in our view, a
private company carrying on banking business as a
scheduled bank, cannot be termed as an
institution or company carrying on any statutory
or public duty. A private body or a person may be
amenable to writ jurisdiction only where it may
become necessary to compel such body or
association to enforce any statutory obligations or
such obligations of public nature casting positive
obligation upon it. We don't find such conditions are
fulfilled in respect of a private company carrying on a
commercial activity of banking. Merely regulatory
provisions to ensure such activity carried on by
private bodies work within a discipline, do not
confer any such status upon the company nor puts
any such obligation upon it which may be enforced
through issue of a writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_219">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution. Present is a case of disciplinary action
being taken against its employee by the appellant Bank.
Respondent's service with the bank stands terminated.
The action of the Bank was challenged by the respondent
by filing a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_220">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India. The respondent is not trying to
enforce any statutory duty on the part of the Bank. That

</p><p id="p_259">                                              (Emphasis supplied)



     Thus, if we apply the ratio of the decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Federal Bank (supra), then we have no
difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that a writ petition would
not be maintainable at the instance of the petitioners against a
private bank in so far as the challenge to the legality and
validity of the notice is concerned.

<p id="p_260">     We may quote one more decision of the Supreme Court,

<blockquote id="blockquote_158">     "10. The Writ of Mandamus lies to secure the
     performance of a public or a statutory duty. The
     prerogative remedy of mandamus has long provided the
     normal means of enforcing the performance of public
     duties by public authorities. Originally, the writ of
     mandamus was merely an administrative order from the
     sovereign to subordinates. In England, in early times, it
     was made generally available through the Court of King's
     Bench, when the Central Government had little
     administrative machinery of its own. Early decisions show
     that there was free use of the writ for the enforcement of
     public duties of all kinds, for instance against inferior
     tribunals which refused to exercise their jurisdiction or
     against municipal corporation which did not duly hold
     elections, meetings, and so forth. In modern times, the
     mandamus is used to enforce statutory duties of public
     authorities. The courts always retained the discretion to
     withhold the remedy where it would not be in the interest
     of justice to grant it. It is also to be noticed that the
     statutory duty imposed on the public authorities may not
     be of discretionary character. A distinction had always

been drawn between the public duties enforceable by
mandamus that are statutory and duties arising merely
from contract. Contractual duties are enforceable as
matters of private law by ordinary contractual remedies
such as damages, injunction, specific performance and
declaration. In the Administrative Law (Ninth Edition) by
Sir William Wade and Christopher Forsyth, (Oxford
University Press) at page 621, the following opinion is
expressed:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_159">       "A distinction which needs to be clarified is that
       between public duties enforceable by mandamus,
       which are usually statutory, and duties arising
       merely from contract. Contractual duties are
       enforceable as matters of private law by the
       ordinary contractual remedies, such as damages,
       injunction, specific performance and declaration.
       They are not enforceable by mandamus, which in
       the first place is confined to public duties and
       secondly is not granted where there are other
       adequate remedies. This difference is brought out
       by the relief granted in cases of ultra vires. If for
       example a minister or a licensing authority acts
       contrary to the principles of natural justice,
       certiorari and mandamus are standard remedies.
       But if a trade union disciplinary committee acts in
       the same way, these remedies are inapplicable: the
       rights of its members depend upon their contract of
       membership, and are to be protected by declaration
       and injunction, which accordingly are the remedies
       employed in such cases."

abuse of power and neglect of duty by public authorities.
</blockquote><p id="p_261">However, under our Constitution, <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_222">Article 226</a> is couched
in such a way that a writ of mandamus could be issued
even against a private authority. However, such private
authority must be discharging a public function and that
the decision sought to be corrected or enforced must be
in discharge of a public function. The role of the State
expanded enormously and attempts have been made to
create various agencies to perform the governmental
functions. Several corporations and companies have also
been formed by the government to run industries and to

carry on trading activities. These have come to be known
as Public Sector Undertakings. However, in the
interpretation given to <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_223">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, this
Court took the view that many of these companies and
corporations could come within the sweep of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_224">Article 12</a> of
the Constitution. At the same time, there are private
bodies also which may be discharging public functions. It
is difficult to draw a line between the public functions and
private functions when it is being discharged by a purely
private authority. A body is performing a "public function"
when it seeks to achieve some collective benefit for the
public or a section of the public and is accepted by the
public or that section of the public as having authority to
do so. Bodies therefore exercise public functions when
they intervene or participate in social or economic affairs
in the public interest. In a book on Judicial Review of
Administrative Action (Fifth Edn.) by de Smith, Woolf &amp;
Jowell in Chapter 3 para 0.24, it is stated thus:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_161">       "A body is performing a "public function" when it
       seeks to achieve some collective benefit for the
       public or a section of the public and is accepted by
       the public or that section of the public as having
       authority to do so. Bodies therefore exercise public
       functions when they intervene or participate in
       social or economic affairs in the public interest. This
       may happen in a wide variety of ways. For instance,
       a body is performing a public function when it
       provides "public goods" or other collective services,
       such as health care, education and personal social
       services, from funds raised by taxation. A body may
       perform public functions in the form of adjudicatory
       services (such as those of the criminal and civil
       courts and tribunal system). They also do so if they
       regulate commercial and professional activities to
       ensure compliance with proper standards. For all
       these purposes, a range of legal and administrative
       techniques may be deployed, including: rule-
       making, adjudication (and other forms of dispute
       resolution); inspection; and licensing.</blockquote>

       of the state. Charities, self-regulatory organizations

       universities, the Stock Exchange, Lloyd's of London,
       churches) may in reality also perform some types of
       public function. As Sir John Donaldson M.R. urged, it
       is important for the courts to "recognise the
       realities of executive power" and not allow "their
       vision to be clouded by the subtlety and sometimes
       complexity of the way in which it can be exerted".
       Non-governmental bodies such as these are just as
       capable of abusing their powers as is government."

<p id="p_263">12. In Regina v. Panel on Take-overs and Merges, Ex
parte Datafin Plc. And another (1987) 1 Queen's Bench
Division 815, a question arose whether the Panel of Take-
overs and Mergers had acted in concert with other
parties in breach of the City Code on Take-overs and
Mergers. The panel dismissed the complaint of the
applicants. Though the Panel on Take-over and Mergers
was purely a private body, the Court of Appeal held that
the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court was
adaptable and could be extended to any body which
performed or operated as an integral part of a system
which performed public law duties, which was supported
by public law sanctions and which was under an
obligation to act judicially, but whose source of power
was not simply the consent of those over whom it
exercised that power; that although the panel purported
to be part of a system of self- regulation and to derive its
powers solely from the consent of those whom its
decisions affected, it was in fact operating as an integral
part of a governmental framework for the regulation of
financial activity in the City of London, was supported by
a periphery of statutory powers and penalties, and was
under a duty in exercising what amounted to public
powers to act judicially; that, therefore, the court had
jurisdiction to review the panel's decision to dismiss the
applicants' complaint; but that since, on the facts, there
were no grounds for interfering with the panel's decision,
the court would decline to intervene.

<p id="p_264">13. Lloyd L.J., agreeing with the opinion expressed by Sir

       sole test whether a body is subject to judicial
       review, nor do I so read Lord Diplock's speech. Of
       course the source of the power will often, perhaps
       usually, be decisive. If the source of power is a
       statute, or subordinate legislation under a statute,
       then clearly the body in question will be subject to
       judicial review. If at the end of the scale, the source
       of power is contractual, as in the case of private
       arbitration, then clearly the arbitrator is not subject
       to judicial review."
</p>

<p id="p_266">14. In that decision, they approved the observations
made by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions
vs. Minister for the Civil Service (1985) A.C. 374, 409
wherein it was held:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_162">       "For a decision to be susceptible to judicial review
       the decision- maker must be empowered by public
       law (and not merely, as in arbitration, by agreement
       between private parties) to make decisions that, if
       validly made, will lead to administrative action or
       abstention from action by an authority endowed by
       law with executive powers which have one or other
       of the consequences mentioned in the preceding
       paragraph. The ultimate source of the decision-
       making power is nearly always nowadays a statute
       or subordinate legislation made under the statute;
       but in the absence of any statute regulating the
       subject matter of the decision the source of the
       decision-making power may still be the common law
       itself, i.e., that part of the common law that is given
       by lawyers the label of 'the prerogative.' Where this
       is the source of decision-making power, the power
       is confined to executive officers of central as
       distinct from local government and in constitutional
       practice is generally exercised by those holding
       ministerial rank"

<p id="p_267">15. It is also pertinent to refer to Sir John Donaldson M.R.
in that Take-Over Panel case :

       of factors giving rise to the jurisdiction, essential or
       as being exclusive of other factors. Possibly the only
       essential elements are what can be described as a
       public element, which can take many different
       forms, and the exclusion from the jurisdiction of
       bodies whose sole source of power is a consensual
       submission to is jurisdiction."

<p id="p_269">16. The above guidelines and principles applied by
English courts cannot be fully applied to Indian conditions
when exercising jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_225">Article 226</a> or 32 of
the Constitution. As already stated, the power of the High
Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_226">Article 226</a> is very wide and these powers
have to be exercised by applying the constitutional
provisions and judicial guidelines and violation, if any, of
the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the
Constitution. In the matter of employment of workers by
private bodies on the basis of contracts entered into
between them, the courts had been reluctant to exercise
the powers of judicial review and whenever the powers
were exercised as against private employers, it was
solely done based on public law element involved
therein.

that the petition was not maintainable against the

       of a legal duty by one against whom it is sought. An

<p id="p_275">       (3) However, not all decisions taken by bodies
       in the course of their public functions are the
       subject matter of judicial review. In the
       following two situations judicial review will
       not normally be appropriate even though the
       body may be performing a public function


</p><p id="p_276">       (a) Where some other branch of the law more
       appropriately governs the dispute between
       the parties. In such a case, that branch of the
       law and its remedies should and normally will
       be applied; and


</p><p id="p_277">       (b) Where there is a contract between the
       litigants. In such a case the express or
       implied terms of the agreement should
       normally govern the matter. This reflects the
       normal approach of English law, namely, that
       the terms of a contract will normally govern
       the transaction, or other relationship between
       the parties, rather than the general law. Thus,
       where a special method of resolving disputes
       (such as arbitration or resolution by private or
       domestic tribunals) has been agreed upon by
       the parties (expressly or by necessary
       implication), that regime, and not judicial
       review, will normally govern the dispute.

was held by this Court that the High Court had no

(2003) 10 SCC 733, the respondent was working as a
Branch Manager of the appellant Bank. He was
suspended and there was a disciplinary enquiry wherein
he was found guilty and dismissed from service. The
respondent challenged his dismissal by filing a writ

Bank was performing a public duty and as such it fell
within the definition of "other authorities" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_236">Article

appeal, but the same was dismissed and the decision of
the Division Bench was challenged before this Court. This
Court observed that a private company carrying on
business as a scheduled bank cannot be termed as
carrying on statutory or public duty and it was therefore
held that any business or commercial activity, whether it
may be banking, manufacturing units or related to any
other    kind    of   business    generating     resources,

money which do have an impact on the economy of the

function and that the decision itself has the flavour of
public law element and they relied on the decision of this
Court in <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_239">Andi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas
Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak Trust &amp; Ors. Vs.
V.R. Rudani &amp; Ors</a> (1989) 2 SCC 691. In this case, the
appellant was a Trust running a science college affiliated
to the Gujarat University under Gujarat University Act,
1949. The teachers working in that college were paid in
the pay scales recommended by the University Grants
Commission and the college was an aided institution.
There was some dispute between the University Teachers
Association and the University regarding the fixation of
their pay scales. Ultimately, the Chancellor passed an
award and this award was accepted by the State Govt. as
well as the University and the University directed to pay
the teachers as per the award. The appellants refused to
implement the award and the respondents filed a writ
petition seeking a writ of mandamus and in the writ
petition the appellants contended that the college
managed by the Trust was not an "authority" coming
within the purview of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_240">Article 12</a> of the Constitution and
therefore the writ petition was not maintainable. This
plea was rejected and this Court held that the writ of
mandamus would lie against a private individual and the
words "any person or authority" used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_241">Article 226</a> are
not to be confined only to statutory authorities and
instrumentalities of the State and they may cover any
other person or body performing public duty. The form of
the body concerned is not very much relevant. What is
relevant is the nature of the duty imposed on the body.
The duty must be judged in the light of positive obligation
owed by the person or authority to the affected party. No
matter by what means the duty is imposed, if a positive
obligation exists, mandamus cannot be denied.
</p>

<p id="p_282">29. Thus, it can be seen that a writ of mandamus or
the remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_242">Article 226</a> is pre-eminently a
public law remedy and is not generally available as
a remedy against private wrongs. It is used for
enforcement of various rights of the public or to
compel     the    public/statutory   authorities to
discharge their duties and to act within their
bounds. It may be used to do justice when there is
wrongful exercise of power or a refusal to perform
duties. This writ is admirably equipped to serve as


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">                      Page 120 of 162</span>

a judicial control over administrative actions. This
writ could also be issued against any private body
or person, specially in view of the words used in
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_243">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. However, the scope
of mandamus is limited to enforcement of public
duty. The scope of mandamus is determined by the
nature of the duty to be enforced, rather than the
identity of the authority against whom it is sought.
If the private body is discharging a public function
and the denial of any right is in connection with
the public duty imposed on such body, the public
law remedy can be enforced. The duty cast on the
public body may be either statutory or otherwise
and the source of such power is immaterial, but,
nevertheless, there must be the public law
element in such action. Sometimes, it is difficult to
distinguish between public law and private law remedies.
According to Halsbury's Laws of England 3rd ed. Vol. 30,
page-682,


       "a public authority is a body not necessarily a
       county council, municipal corporation or other local
       authority which has public statutory duties to
       perform and which perform the duties and carries
       out its transactions for the benefit of the public and
       not for private profit."
</p>

<p id="p_283">There cannot be any general definition of public
authority or public action. The facts of each case
decide the point.
</p>

<p id="p_284">30. A contract would not become statutory simply
because it is for construction of a public utility and it has
been awarded by a statutory body. But nevertheless it
may be noticed that the Government or Government
authorities at all levels is increasingly employing
contractual techniques to achieve its regulatory aims. It
cannot be said that the exercise of those powers are free
from the zone of judicial review and that there would be
no limits to the exercise of such powers, but in normal
circumstances, judicial review principles cannot be used
to enforce the contractual obligations. When that
contractual power is being used for public purpose, it is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">                       Page 121 of 162</span>
      C/SCA/645/2014                             CAV JUDGEMENT



     certainly amenable to judicial review. The power must be
     used for lawful purposes and not unreasonably.
</p>

<p id="p_285">     31. The decision of the employer in these two cases to
     terminate the services of their employees cannot be said
     to have any element of public policy. Their cases were
     purely governed by the contract of employment entered
     into between the employees and the employer. It is not
     appropriate to construe those contracts as opposed to
     the principles of public policy and thus void and illegal
     under <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_244">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act. In contractual
     matters even in respect of public bodies, the principles of
     judicial review have got limited application. This was
     expressly stated by this Court in <a href="/doc/1156062/" id="a_245">State of U.P. vs. Bridge
     &amp; Roof Co</a>. (1996) 6 SCC 22 and also in <a href="/doc/318728/" id="a_246">Kerala State
     Electricity Board vs. Kurien E.Kalathil</a> (2000) 6 SCC 295.
     In the latter case, this Court reiterated that the
     interpretation and implementation of a clause in a
     contract cannot be the subject matter of a writ petition.
     Whether the contract envisages actual payment or not is
     a question of construction of contract. If a term of a
     contract is violated, ordinarily, the remedy is not a writ
     petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_247">Article 226.</a>
</p>

<p id="p_286">     32. Applying these principles, it can very well be said that
     a writ of mandamus can be issued against a private body
     which is not a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_248">Article 12</a> of
     the Constitution and such body is amenable to the
     jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_249">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and the
     High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_250">Article 226</a> of the Constitution can
     exercise judicial review of the action challenged by a
     party. But there must be a public law element and it
     cannot be exercised to enforce purely private contracts
     entered into between the parties."

(Fifth Edn.) by de Smith, Woolf &amp; Jowell in Chapter 3 para
0.24 therein it has been stated as follows :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_176">       "A body is performing a 'public function' when it
       seeks to achieve some collective benefit for the
       public or a section of the public and is accepted by
       the public or that section of the public as having
       authority to do so. Bodies therefore exercise public
       functions when they intervene or participate in
       social or economic affairs in the public interest.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_177">       Public functions need not be the exclusive domain
       of the state. Charities, self-regulatory organizations
       and other nominally private institutions (such as
       universities, the Stock Exchange, Lloyd's of London,
       churches) may in reality also perform some types of
       public function. As Sir John Donaldson M.R. urged, it
       is important for the courts to 'recognize the realities
       of executive power' and not allow 'their vision to be
       clouded by the subtlety and sometimes complexity
       of the way in which it can be exerted'. Non-

       capable of abusing their powers as is Government."

the Government's directive and approached the University to

Teachers moved the High Court. The trustees resisted the
prayer on the grounds, inter alia: (1) the Trust is not a
statutory body and is not subject to the writ jurisdiction of the

payment to teachers in the revised pay scales was not binding
on the trust; (3) the University had no power to burden the
trust with additional financial liability by retrospectively
revising the pay scales; (4) the claim for gratuity by retrenched
teachers was untenable; and (5) Ordinance 120E prescribing
closure compensation was ultra vires of the powers of the

     reinstatement. It was contended that the Executive

Committee of the college which was registered under the
<a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_258">Co-operative Societies Act</a> and Affiliated to the Agra
University (and subsequently to Meerut University) was a
statutory body. The importance of this contention lies in
the fact that in such a case, reinstatement could be
ordered if the dismissal is in violation of statutory
obligation. But this Court refused to accept the
contention. It was observed that the management of the
college was not a statutory body since not created by or
under a statute. It was emphasised that an institution
which adopts certain statutory provisions will not become
a statutory body and the dismissed employee cannot
enforce a contract of personal service against a non-
statutory body.
</p>

<p id="p_296">The decision in Vaish Degree College was followed in
Deepak Kumar Biswas case. There again a dismissed
Lecturer of a private college was seeking reinstatement
in service. The Court refuse to grant the relief although it
was found that the dismissal was wrongful. This Court
instead granted substantial monetary benefits to the
lecturer. This appears to be the preponderant judicial
opinion because of the common law principle that a
service Contract cannot be specifically enforced.
</p>

<p id="p_297">But here the facts are quite different and, therefore, we
need not go thus far. There is no plea for specific
performance of contractual service. The respondents are
not seeking a declaration that they be continued in
service. They are not asking for mandamus to put them
back into the college. They are claiming only the terminal
benefits and arrears of salary payable to them. The
question is whether the trust can be compelled to pay by
a writ of Mandamus?
</p>

<p id="p_298">If the rights are purely of a private character no
mandamus can issue. If the management of the
college is purely a private body with no public duty
mandamus will not lie. These are two exceptions to
Mandamus. But once these are absent and when
the party has no other equally convenient remedy,
mandamus cannot be denied. It has to be
appreciated that the appellant-trust was managing

the affiliated college to which public money is paid
as Government aid. Public money paid as
Government aid plays a major role in the control,
maintenance       and      working     of    educational
institutions.     The      aided     institutions      like
Government institutions discharge public function
by way of imparting education to students. They
are subject to the rules and regulations of the
affiliating University. Their activities are closely
supervised      by     the     University     authorities.
Employment in such institutions, therefore, is not
devoid of any public character (See The "Evolving
Indian Administrative Law by M.P. Jain (1983) p
</p><p id="p_299">266). So are the service conditions of the academic
staff. When the University takes a decision regarding
their pay scales, it will be binding on the management.
The service conditions of the academic staff are,
therefore, not purely of a private character. It has super-
added protection by University decisions creating a legal
right-duty relationship between the staff and the
management. When there is existence of this
relationship, mandamus cannot be refused to the
aggrieved party.
</p>

<p id="p_300">The law relating to mandamus has made the most
spectacular advance. It may be recalled that the remedy
by prerogative writs in England started with very limited
scope and suffered from many procedural disadvantages.
To overcome the difficulties, Lord Gardiner (the Lord
Chancellor) in pursuance of Section 3(l)(e) of the Law
Commission Act, 1965, requested the law Commission to
review the existing remedies for the judicial control of
administrative acts and commissions with a view to
evolving a simpler and more effective procedure. The

       Even damages. The procedure was much more
       simple and expeditious. Just a summons instead of
       a writ. No formal pleadings. The evidence was given
       by affidavit. As a rule no cross-examination, no
       discovery, and so forth. But there were important
       safeguards. In particular, in order to qualify, the
       applicant had to get the leave of a judge.
</p>

<p id="p_303">       The statute is phrased in flexible terms. It gives
       scope for development. It uses the words "having
       regard to". Those words are very indefinite. The
       result is that the courts are not bound hand and
       foot by the previous law. They are to 'have regard
       to' it. So the previous law as to who are - and who
       are not - public authorities, is not absolutely
       binding. Nor is the previous law as to this matters in
       respect of which relief may be granted. This means
       that the judges can develop the public law as they
       think best. That they have done and are doing."
       (see - The Closing Chapter by Rt. Hon. Lord Denning
       p. 122)


       There, however, the prerogative writ of mandamus
       confined only to public authorities to compel
       performance of public duty. The 'public authority'
       for them means everybody which is created by
       statute - and whose powers and duties are defined
       by statute. So Government departments, local
       authorities, police authorities, and statutory
       undertakings and corporations, are all 'public
       authorities'. But there is no such limitation for our
       High Courts to issue the writ 'in the nature of
       mandamus'. <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_260">Article 226</a> confers wide powers on the
       High Courts to issue writs in the nature of
       prerogative writs. This is a striking departure from
       the English law. Under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_261">Article 226</a>, writs can be
       issued to 'any person or authority'. It can be issued

81 at pp.84-85,


This article is couched in comprehensive phraseology and
it ex facie confers a wide power on the High Courts to
reach injustice wherever it is found. The Constitution
designedly used a wide language in describing the nature
of the power, the purpose for which and the person or
authority against whom it can be exercised. It can issue
writs in the nature of prerogative writs as understood in
England; but the use of the expression "nature", for the
said expression does not equate the writs that can be
issued in India with those in England, but only draws an
analogy from them. That apart, High Courts can also
issue directions, orders or writs other than the
prerogative writs. It enables the High Courts to mould the
reliefs to meet the peculiar and complicated
requirements of this country. Any attempt to equate the
scope of the power of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_265">Art. 226</a> of
the Constitution with that of the English Courts to issue
prerogative writs is to introduce the unnecessary
procedural restrictions grown over the years in a
comparatively small country like England with a unitary
form of Government into a vast country like India
functioning under a federal structure. Such a construction
defeats the purpose of the article itself."

in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_271">Art. 226</a> are, therefore, not to be confined only
to statutory authorities and instrumentalities of
the State. They may cover any other person or
body performing public duty. The form of the body
concerned is not very much relevant. What is
relevant is the nature of the duty imposed on the
body. The duty must be judged in the light of
positive obligation owed by the person or
authority to the affected_ party. No matter by
what means the duty is imposed. If a positive
obligation exists mandamus cannot be denied.
</p>

<p id="p_310"><a href="/doc/1080534/" id="a_272">In Praga Tools Corporation v. C.V. Imanual</a>, , this Court
said that a mandamus can issue against a person or body
to carry but the duties placed on them by the Statutes
even though they are not public officials or statutory
body. It was observed (at p. 778 of 1969-3 SCR): (at pp
1309-10 of AIR):
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_179">       "It is, however, not necessary that the person or the
       authority on whom the statutory duty is imposed
       need be a public officials or an official body. A
       mandamus can issue, for instance, to an official of a
       society to compel him to carry out the terms of the
       statute under or by which the society is constituted
       or governed and also, to companies or corporations
       to carry out duties placed on them by the statutes
       authorising their undertakings. A mandamus would
       also lie against a company constituted by a statute
       for the purpose of fulfilling public responsibilities.
       (See Halsbury's Law of England (3rd Ed. Vol. II p. 52
       and onwards)."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_311">Here again we may point out that mandamus cannot be
denied on the ground that the duty to be enforced is not
imposed by the statute. Commenting on the
development of this law, Professor De Smith states: "To
be enforceable by mandamus a public duty does not

     necessarily have to be one imposed by statute. It may be
     sufficient for the duty to have been imposed by charter,
     common law, custom or even contract." (Judicial Review
     of Administrative Act 4th Ed. p 540). We share this view.
     The judicial control over the fast expanding maze of
     bodies affecting the rights of the people should not be
     put into watertight compartment. It should remain
     flexible to meet the requirements of variable
     circumstances. Mandamus is a very wide remedy which
     must be easily available lo reach injustice whenever it is
     found". Technicalities should not come in the way of
     granting that relief under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_273">Art. 226.</a> We, therefore, reject
     the contention urged for the appellants on the
     maintainability of the writ petition."
</p>

<p id="p_312">     The ratio discernible from Shri Anadi Mukta Sadguru
(supra) is that, the form of the body concerned is not         very
much relevant. What is relevant is the nature of duty imposed
on the body. A writ of mandamus can be issued against a
person or a body to carry out the duties placed on them by the
statute, even though they are not public officials or statutory
bodies.

     mandamus, etc., or any of them for the enforcement of
     any of the rights conferred by Part-Ill of the Constitution
     and for any other purpose. But, it is well understood that
     a mandamus lies to secure the performance of a public or

     applies for it has a sufficient legal interest.

     mandamus is that there is. one claiming it a legal right to
     the performance of a legal duty by one against whom it is
     sought. An order of mandamus, is, in form, a command
     directed to a person, corporation or inferior Tribunal
     requiring him or them to do a particular thing therein
     specified which appertains to his or their office and is in
     the nature of a public duty. It is, however, not necessary
     that the person on the authority on whom the statutory
     duty is imposed need be a public official or an official
     body.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_182">     It is therefore, clear that a writ of mandamus is an
     extraordinary remedy. It is in form a command directed
     to a person, corporation or an inferior Tribunal requiring
     him or them to do a particular thing therein specified
     which appertains to his or their office and is in the nature
     of a public duty. So long as the duty that is sought
     to be performed is in the nature of a public duty, it
     is not necessary that the person or the authority
     on which the duty is imposed should be a public
     official or an official body. It is further necessary
     that the person claiming a 'writ of mandamus must
     have a legal right to the performance of a legal
     duty by the one against whom the writ is sought."</blockquote>


<p id="p_314">     What is discernible from an exhaustive review of the
case-law, considered and discussed above, may be summed
up thus:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_183">     (1)    For issuing writ against a legal entity, it would have

<p id="p_317">(5)    Normally, mandamus is issued to a public body or
authority to compel it to perform some public duty cast
upon it by some statute or statutory rule. In exceptional

<p id="p_319">     (7)    If a private body is discharging a public function and
     the denial of any rights is in connection with the public
     duty imposed on such body, the public law remedy can
     be enforced. The duty cast on the public body may be
     either statutory or otherwise and the source of such
     power is immaterial but, nevertheless, there must be the
     public law element in such action.

<p id="p_320">     (8)    According to Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd Ed.

     other local authority which has public statutory duties to
     perform and which perform the duties and carries out its
     transactions for the benefit of the public and not for

     public authority or public action. The facts of each case
     decide the point.

answer to the same should put an end to the matter.

     In the case of <a href="/doc/730804/" id="a_281">LIC of India v. Escorts Ltd</a>., AIR 1986 SC
1370, it was contended before the Supreme Court that the Life
Insurance Corporation was an instrumentality of the State, and
was debarred by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_282">Article 14</a> from acting arbitrarily. It was also
contended that it was obligatory upon the Corporation to
disclose the reasons for its action complained of, namely, its
requisition to call an extra-ordinary general meeting of the
company for the purpose of moving a Resolution to remove
some Directors and appoint others in their place.                Such
argument was opposed by the State, contending that the
actions of the State or an instrumentality of the State, which
do not properly belong to the field of public law but belong to
the field of private law, were not subject to judicial review.
Dealing with the said contentions, the Supreme Court observed
:-

     against readily referring to English cases on questions of

itself with the intricacies of trade and commerce. If the
action of the State is related to contractual obligation or
obligations arising out of the contract, the Court may not
ordinarily examine it unless the action has some public
law character attached to it. Broadly speaking, the Court
will examine actions of State if they pertain to the public
law domain and refrain from examining them if they
pertain to the private law field. The difficulty will lie in
demarcating the frontier between the public law domain
and the private law field. It is impossible to draw the line
with precision and we do not want to attempt it. The
question must be decided in each case with
reference to the particular action, the activity in
which the State or the instrumentality of the State
is engaged when performing the action, the public
law or private law character of then action and a
host of other relevant circumstances. When the
State or an instrumentality of the State ventures into the
corporate world and purchases the shares of a company,
it assumes to itself the ordinary role of a share holder,
and dons the robes of a share-holder, with all the rights
available to such a share-holder there is no reason why
the State as a share-holder should be expected to state
its reasons when it seeks to change the management, by

First, the persons or bodies who have legal authority to
determine questions affecting the common law or
statutory rights or obligations of other persons as
individuals. That is the formula stated by Lord Justice
Atkin in <a href="/doc/1752215/" id="a_287">R. v. Electricity Commissioners</a>, ex parte London
Electricity Joint Committee Co., (1920) Ltd, (1924)1 KB
171 / 205 as broadened by Lord Diplock in O'Reilly v.
Mackman (1982) 3, WLR 1096/ 1104).
</p>
<p id="p_333">Second, the persons or bodies who are entrusted by
Parliament with functions, powers and duties which
involve the making of decisions of a public nature....To
which I would add the words of Lord Goddard, C.J. in <a href="/doc/47391987/" id="a_288">R. v.
National Joint Council</a> for Dental Technicians, ex parte

<p id="p_334">"The bodies to which in modern times the remedies of
these prerogative writs have been applied have all been
statutory bodies on whom Parliament has conferred
statutory powers and duties which, when exercised, may
lead to the detriment of subjects who may have to
submit to their jurisdiction".
</p>
<p id="p_335">But those categories are not exhaustive. The courts can
extend them to any other person or body of a public
nature exercising public duties which it is desirable to
control by the remedy of judicial review.
</p>
<p id="p_336">There are many cases which give guidance, but I will just
give some illustrations.
</p>
<p id="p_337">Every body which is created by statute and whose
powers and duties are defined by statute is a
'public authority'. So Government departments, local
authorities, police authorities, and statutory undertakings
and corporations, are all `public authorities'. So are
members of a statutory tribunal or inquiry, and the board

</p><p id="p_339">38. Sir Harry Woolf, a Lord Justice of Court of Appeal,
points out the distinction in the following words :-
</p>
<p id="p_340">"I regard public law as being the system which enforces
the proper performance by public bodies of the duties
which they owe to the public. I regard private law as
being the system which protects the private rights of
private individuals or the private rights of public bodies.
The critical distinction arises out of the fact that it
is the public as a whole, or in the case of local
government the public in the locality, who are the
beneficiaries of what is protected by public law
and it is the individuals or bodies entitled to the
rights who are the beneficiaries of the protection
provided by private law ". (see page 221 of his Article
"Public Law Private Law : Why the Divide? A personal
View (published in "Public Law" Summer (1986)").
</p>
<p id="p_341">The learned Law Lord stated further in the same Article,
at page 223 :
</p>
<p id="p_342">"While public law deals only with public bodies, this does
not mean that the activities of public bodies are never
governed by private law. Like public figures, at least in
theory, public bodies are entitled to have a private life.
There have been suggestions that in the commercial field
public bodies should adopt different and higher ethical
standards than private individuals, but this is not yet
required as a matter of law and in relation to purely
commercial transactions the same law is applicable,
whether or not a public duty is involved. Prima facie, the
same is true in relation to employment. The servant
employed by a public body ordinarily has the same
private rights as any other servant ".

a statutory provision.

important English decisions, where a public duty was
implied even in the absence of a statutory provisions.
They are R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, ex
parte Lain (1967) 2 All ER 770, and <a href="/doc/117218345/" id="a_289">R. v. Panel</a> on take-
overs (1987) 1 All ER 564. In Criminal Injuries
Compensation Board, the relevant facts are the following:
In the year 1964 the Government of Great Britian
announced a Scheme in both Houses of Parliament
providing for compensation to victims of violence and
persons injured while assisting the police. It was a non-
statutory scheme under which compensation was to be
paid ex gratia. The scheme was to be administered by a
Board, who were to be provided with money through a
grant-in-aid, out of which payment would be made when
the Board was satisfied that the compensation was
justified. The widow of a Police Constable who was shot in
the face by a suspect whom he was about to question,
and who subsequently shot himself, applied to the Board
for compensation. The Board awarded compensation, but
made certain deductions, which was questioned by way
of certiorari. The first question before the Court was
"whether the Board are a body of persons amenable to
the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court?". For the Board
reliance was placed upon the well-known words of Atkin,
L.J., in' <a href="/doc/1752215/" id="a_290">R.v. Electricity Commissioners</a> (1924) 1 KB 171, at
p. 205 to the effect that the body of persons to be
amenable to writ jurisdiction must have the legal
authority to determine questions affecting the rights of
subjects and who are under a duty to act judicially. The
Court held that the said words of Atkin. L. J., were not
supposed to be exhaustive of the situation where a
certiorari may issue, and pointed out that the Board,
though not set up under a statute, is set up by the
executive Government, i.e., under the prerogative, and
that its acts are no less lawful on that account. The Court
observed :
</p><p id="p_345">"Indeed, the writ of certiorari has been issued not only to
courts set up by statutes but also to courts whose
authority was derived, inter alia, from the prerogative.
Once the jurisdiction is extended, as it clearly has been,
to tribunals as opposed to courts, there is no reason why
the remedy by way of certiorari cannot be invoked to a
body of persons set up under the prerogative. Moreover,
the Board, though set up under the prerogative and not
by statute, had in fact the recognition of Parliament in
debate and Parliament provided the money to satisfy the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_143">                      Page 141 of 162</span>

Board's awards....".
</p>
<p id="p_346">It was further observed:
</p>
<p id="p_347">"We have, as it seems to me, reached the position when
the ambit of certiorari can be said to cover every case in
which a body of persons, of a public as opposed to a
purely private or domestic character, has to determine
matters affecting subjects provided always that it has a
duty to act judicially. Looked at in this way, the Board in
my judgment comes fairly and squarely within the
jurisdiction of this Court. The Board are, as counsel for
the Board said, "a servant of the Crown, charged by the
Crown, by executive instructions, with the duty of
distributing the bounty of the Crown". The Board are
clearly, therefore, performing public duties. Moreover,
the Board are quite clearly under a duty to act judicially".
</p>
<p id="p_348">The same idea was put forward by Diplock, L.J., in his
separate opinion, where he said :
</p>
<p id="p_349">"If new tribunals are established by acts of Government,
the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court extends to
them if they possess the essential characteristics on
which the subjection of inferior tribunals to the
supervisory control of the High Court is based...".
Ashworth, J., justified the issue of certiorari in that case
on the following basis:
</p>
<p id="p_350">"They (Board) were set up by the executive after the
proposal to set them up had been debated in both
Houses of Parliament, and the money needed to satisfy
their awards is drawn from sums provided by Parliament.
It can therefore be said that their existence and their
functions have at least been recognized by Parliament,
which to my mind has a twofold consequence : in the first
place it negatives any notion that the Board are a private
tribunal, and secondly it confers on the Board what I may
call a public or official character. The number of
applications for compensation and the amounts awarded
by the Board alike show how greatly the general public
are affected by the functioning of the Board ....".
</p>

several English decisions. It would suffice to refer to <a href="/doc/117218345/" id="a_291">R. v.
Panel</a> on Takeovers and Mergers, Ex Parte Datafin (1987)

1 All ER 564. The Panel on Take-overs and Mergers was a
self-regulating unincorporated association which devised
and operated the City Code on Take-overs and Mergers
prescribing a Code of Conduct to be observed in the take-
overs of listed public companies. The panel had no direct
statutory, prerogative or common law powers, nor were
its powers based solely on consensus; its acts were
supported and sustained by certain statutory powers and
penalties introduced after the inception of the Panel. A
decision of the panel was sought to be questioned by
way of certiorari. One of the objections of the
respondents was that the supervisory jurisdiction of the
Court was confined to bodies whose power was derived
solely from legislation or the exercise of the prerogative,
and that the power of judicial review did not extend to a
body such as the Panel on Takeovers. Overruling this
objection, it was held that in determining whether the
decisions of a particular body were subject to judicial
review, the Court was not confined to considering the
source of that body's powers and duties, but could also
look to their nature. Accordingly, if the duty imposed on a
body, whether expressly or by implication, was a public
duty and the body was exercising public law functions,
the Court had jurisdiction to entertain an application for
judicial review of that body's decisions. It was held that,
having regard to the wide-ranging nature and importance
of the matters covered by the City Code on Take-overs
and Mergers and to the public consequences of
noncompliance with the Code, the Panel on Takeovers
and Mergers was performing a public duty when
prescribing and administering the Code and its rules and
was subject to public law remedies. Accordingly, it was
held that an application for judicial review would lie in an
appropriate case. The approach to be adopted in such
cases, it was stated by Sir John Donaldson, M.R., is"to
recognize the realities of executive power".This is what
the learned Master of Rolls stated :-
</p>
<p id="p_352">"In fact, given its novelty, the panel fits surprisingly well
into the format which this court had in mind in R. v.
Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (1967-2 QB 867). It
is without doubt performing a public duty and an
important one. This is clear from the expressed
willingness of the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry to limit legislation in the field of take-overs and
mergers and to use the panel as the centerpiece of his

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_145">                      Page 143 of 162</span>

     regulation of that market. The rights of citizens are
     indirectly affected by its decisions, some, but by no
     means all of whom, may in a technical sense be said to
     have assented to this situation, e.g., the members of the
     Stock Exchange. At least in its determination of whether
     there has been a breach of the Code, it has a duty to act
     judicially and it asserts that its raison d'etre is to do
     equity between one shareholder and another. Its source
     of power is only partly based on moral persuarion and the
     assent of institutions and their members, the bottom line
     being the statutory powers exercised by the Department
     of Trade and Industries and the Bank of England. In this
     context I should be very disappointed if the courts could
     not recognize the realities of executive power and
     allowed their vision to be clouded by the subtlety and
     sometimes complexity of the way in which it can be
     exerted...".
</p>
<p id="p_353">     This rule was reiterated in yet another decision of the
     Court of Appeal in <a href="/doc/117218345/" id="a_292">R. v. Panel</a> on Take-overs and Mergers,
     ex parte Guinness, (1989) 1 All ER 509. This was indeed
     the approach indicated by Mathew, J. in Sukhdev v.
     Bhagatram, AIR 1975 SC 1331, when the learned Judge
     spoke of "the governing power, wherever located" being
     subjected to "fundamental constitutional limitations". The
     learned Judge felt that "the need to subject the power
     centres to the control of the Constitution requires an
     expansion of the concept of State action". (see para 93 at
     p. 1352).

<p id="p_354">     Applying the above test, the Bank herein cannot be called

towards its account holders, which may include the borrowers

of the public. The binding nature of its orders and actions is
confined to its account holders and borrowers and to its

     We may also quote with profit a Full Bench decision of
the Bombay High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/633055/" id="a_293">Shamrao Vithal Co-
operative Bank Ltd. v. Padubidri Pattabhiram Bhat</a>, AIR 1993
Bombay 91. The issue before the Full Bench of the Bombay
High Court was whether the appellant-Bank was "State" within
the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_294">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India, and
whether     the        writ-petition   was      maintainable   against    the
appellants.      In view of conflict of two decisions of the High
Court, the matter was referred to a Larger Bench for
determination.          It was submitted that a Co-operative Bank,
performed an important public function and that itself was
sufficient for coming to the conclusion that it was a "State"
under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_295">Article 12.</a> It was also submitted that in a welfare State,
the definition of "Governmental functions" had to be widened
to include within its scope of functions, which were of public
importance. Hence, any organization which performs a public
function must be considered as a "State" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_296">Article 12.</a> The
Full Bench took the view that it was too broad a proposition
and sounded a note of caution considering the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of Ajay Hasai (supra). The Court
took the view that every organization which carried out a
function, which was of public importance, did not necessarily
become "State" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_297">Article 12.</a> Conferment of "Statehood"
depended upon various other factors also, such as the nexus
of such organizations with the State, the extent of State
control etc. The following observations of the Full Bench are
worth taking note of :-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_186">     "There may be many functions of public
     importance which can be performed by private

     organisation also. We have a large number of
     organisations doing important social work vital to
     the    community.    There    are,   for  example,
     organisations which look after, educate and train
     handicapped persons or the blind, provide them
     with jobs and rehabilitate them. There are private
     charitable organisations which may provide free or
     subsidies housing to the poor or free medical aid.
     They may supply text-books to poor students,
     freeships and scholarships. There may be private
     organisation engaged in transport of goods and
     men.     They  perform     functions   which   are,
     undoubtedly of public importance; and they
     subserve a public need. But this does not
     necessarily make such organisations "State" under
     <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_298">Art. 12.</a>Banking is undoubtedly a function of public
     importance. In fact, the nationalised banks do
     carry out these functions under the control of the
     State. But that does not mean that banks which
     are not so controlled, or banks which are set up by
     private organisations or co-operative societies
     become" State" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_299">Article 12.</a> In a welfare
     State, many activities which are often carried on
     by private organisations are undertaken by the
     State. In such cases the Supreme Court has said
     that we must look at the overall position of the
     organisation in the light of the other tests also,
     especially when the function of the organisation is
     not such as can be carried on only by the State or
     is not connected with governmental functions."</blockquote>


<p id="p_356">     What       is     complained   before       us   is   the   procedural
arbitrariness on the part of the bank. We have examined the
constitutional validity of the Master Circular issued by the
Reserve Bank of India at the instance of the petitioners of
Special Civil Application No.10120 of 2014, but it is difficult for
us to also look into the proposed action on the part of the
Standard Chartered Bank on the premise that the show-cause
notice which has been issued is lacking in material particulars.

     Such being the position, we hold that the Standard
Chartered Bank being a private bank is not amenable to the

<p id="p_359">     We shall now look into the decisions on which strong
reliance has been placed by the learned advocates appearing
on behalf of the petitioners.
</p>

<p id="p_360">     In the case of J.G.Engineers Pvt. Ltd. (supra), a works
contract was awarded by the respondents in favour of the
appellant.       As the work was not completed within the
contractual period, an extension was granted for the period
specified,    without    levying   any      liquidated   damages.        The
contractor continued the work even thereafter.                  At a later
stage, finding the progress to be sold, the Government
terminated the contract. The appellant filed writ petition
challenging the cancellation.             However, in view of the
existence of an arbitration clause, the High Court referred the
parties to arbitration.     The dispute between the parties was
adjudicated by the Arbitrator.        Few counter-claims were also
filed by the respondents, however, all those counter-claims
were rejected. The respondents approached the District Court
under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_301">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_302">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996,

for setting aside the award. However, the court dismissed the
petition.     The High Court set-aside the award on certain
grounds.      In such circumstances, the contractor filed appeal
before      the   Supreme   Court.        In   the   aforesaid    factual
background, the Supreme Court had the occasion to consider
the question, whether one party has committed breach or not,
cannot be decided by the party alleging breach.              A contract
cannot provide that one party will be the arbiter to decide,
whether he committed breach or the other party committed
breach. Such question can only be decided by only the
adjudicatory forum, i.e. a court or an Arbitral Tribunal.              This
decision of the Supreme Court has been relied upon to fortify
the submission canvassed on behalf of the petitioners that the
bank who alleges that a particular borrower has committed a
willful default and deserves to be declared as a willful
defaulter, such adjudication cannot be at the instance of the
bank being the complainant itself. In our opinion, the
aforenoted decision of the Supreme Court has no application to
the case at hand for more than one reasons.                 In the case
before the Supreme Court, there were two parties. One was
the contractor and the second Union of India who assigned the
contract in favour of the contractor. The disputes arose
between the two parties regarding amounts to be claimed.
Thus, it could be seen that the contractor had its own
grievances. Both were interested in their respective claims. In
such circumstances, the Supreme Court observed that whether
the other party committed breach cannot be decided by the
party alleging breach.      Such observations of the Supreme
Court should be read in context with the factual situation which
was before the Supreme Court. In the case at hand, it is not a
dispute as such between the petitioners and the bank by way

<p id="p_361">     In the case of Sadashiv Prakash Brahmachari (supra),
five petitions under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_303">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of India by
the heads of five Madhs in the State of Orissa were filed
challenging certain provisions of the Orissa Hindu Religious
Endowments Act, 1951, as amended by the Orissa Act 18 of
1954, as unconstitutional and ultra vires. The main attack was
in respect of <a href="/doc/1644231/" id="a_304">Sections 42</a> and <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_305">79A</a> of the Act relating to the
schemes for religious of the kind as regards the procedure for
framing     of     the   scheme.   In     making   the   inquiry,    the
Commissioner and the person or persons associated with him
therein were to consult the Trustee and the person having
interest. After the scheme would be settled and the order
determining the scheme would be published in the prescribed
manner, the Trustee or any person having interest may, within
six months of the date of such publication, institute a suit in
the court to modify or set-aside such order. The effect of the
provisions under challenge was that a scheme could be framed
by the Commissioner alone on a report of the Assistant
Commissioner on such inquiry as he would think fit and not by
the Commissioner in association with one or more Government
officers to be appointed for the purpose by the Government.
Secondly, there was no right on suit for challenging the validity
or the correctness of the scheme framed by the Commissioner,
but there was an appeal provided directly to the High Court. In
such circumstances, it was urged before the Supreme Court
that the provisions        were in the form of unreasonable
restrictions and were ultra vires and unconstitutional. It is in
the aforesaid background that the Supreme Court took the

view that in order to judge, whether the provisions in the Act
operated      by       way   of   unreasonable         restrictions   for   the
constitutional purposes, what was necessary to be seen was
whether the person affected got a reasonable chance of
presenting his entire case before the original Tribunal which
had to determine judicially, the question raised and whether
he had a regular appeal to the ordinarily constituted court or
courts to correct the error, if any, of the Tribunal of the first
instance. Relying on such observations of the Supreme Court,
it was sought to be contended that in the present case also the
Master Circular relating to willful defaulters is by way of
unreasonable restrictions as the bank itself would adjudicate
the issue against which there is no provision for an appeal
before any authority. In our opinion, this decision also is of no
assistance to the petitioners as the facts of the case were
altogether different.        The Supreme Court noticed few salient
features of the provisions of the Act and the scheme.                       The
Supreme Court noticed that in the initial stage of the framing
of the scheme under the provisions of the Act, there was, first
of all, something in the nature of a preliminary inquiry by the
judicial officer of the rank of the Munshiff followed by a regular
and the full inquiry before the Commissioner who was of the
rank of the subordinate judge.                      The Inquiry before the
Commissioner was assimilated to and was governed by the
provisions relating to the trial of suits by enjoining that as far
as may be, the same had to be in accordance with the
provisions of the Code of the Civil Procedure relating to the
trial of suits. The Supreme Court further observed in the said
case that, while under the prior Act, the inquiry before the
Commissioner might well have been of the nature of an
executive inquiry by an Executive Officer, the inquiry under

the Amended Act by itself is in the nature of a judicial inquiry
by the judicial officers followed up by right of regular appeal to
the High Court. In the case at hand, there is no question of
any judicial inquiry in accordance with the provisions of the
Civil Procedure Code.

circumstances, the Supreme Court observed that it could not
be argued that a right to adjudicate upon a issue relating to
breach of conditions of the contractor would flow from or was
inhered as a right conferred to assess the damages arising
from breach of conditions.                 The Supreme Court further
observed that assuming for the sake of arguments that the
terms of Clause 12 of the agreement afforded scope for being
construed as empowering the officer of the State to decide
upon the question of breach as well as assess the quantum of
damages, it could not be thought of that the adjudication by
the officer regarding the breach of the contract could be
sustained under the law because a party to the agreement
cannot be an arbiter in his own cause.                 The Supreme Court
further observed that the interests of justice and equity
required that where a party to the contract disputes the
committing of any breach of conditions, the adjudication
should be by an independent person or body and not by the
other party to the contract.             The position would be different
only if there was no dispute or there was a consensus between

the contracting parties regarding the breach of conditions.
Here again, the case is one of contract entered into between
the two parties relating to purchase of paddy under the Paddy
Procurement Scheme, 1959.               Disputes arose between the
parties to the contract and, in such circumstances, the
observations noted above fell from the Supreme Court. This
decision also, in our opinion, is of no assistance to the
petitioners.

<p id="p_363">     In the case of Indian Banks Association (supra), the issue
before the Supreme Court was regarding the authority of the
bankers to round up the then existing interest rate to 0.25%.
The facts before the Supreme Court in brief were that the
<a href="/doc/910984/" id="a_306">Interest Act</a> was enacted by the Parliament w.e.f. 1 st August,
1974 with an object of imposing of tax on the total amount of
interest received by the Scheduled Bank/Credit Institutions on
loans and advances. It was, however, withdrawn in the year
1978, but reintroduced in the year 1980; where after, it was
again withdrawn in the year 1985. The said tax, however, was
reintroduced w.e.f. 1st October, 1991, by reason of the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_307">Finance
Act</a>, 1991. The Reserve Bank of India, vide its circular letter
dated     2nd     September   1991,      advised   all   the    Scheduled
Commercial Banks that the Incident or Interest tax should
prorate be passed on to the borrowers where for a uniform
practice should be followed in consultation with the appellant
before the Supreme Court, viz. Indian Banks' Association. The
Indian Banks' Association acted pursuant to the circular, as
also with a view to formulate a structure of uniform interest
rate chargeable after including interest tax payable, which was
passed on to the borrowers by the bank concerned, advised
them that the rate of interest be loaded with the interest tax of

3% and rounded-up to the next higher 0.25%.                          The Reserve
Bank of India gave its approval to the proposal of the first
appellant before the Supreme Court. Such action on the part of
the appellants therein was questioned by the respondents in a
public interest litigation filed before the Karnataka High Court,
inter alia, on the ground that purported rounding up was illegal
and without jurisdiction as thereby the tax elements came to
be increased and as a result thereof the banks collected an
additional sum of Rs.723.79 crores annually by way of
resorting to rounding up on the basis thereof. In the aforesaid
factual situation, the Supreme Court took the view that the
Reserve Bank of India was not an authority for construction of
the statute, viz. <a href="/doc/910984/" id="a_308">Interest Act</a>, 1974. Its functions were confined
only to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_309">Reserve Bank of India Act</a> and the
<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_310">Banking Regulation Act</a> and not any other statute. It further
observed that the Reserve Bank of India could not have
interpreted the provisions of the <a href="/doc/910984/" id="a_311">Interest Act</a> nor thereby could
have empowered the banks to charge something more from
the borrowers by the process of rounding up of interest.
Ultimately, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeals, holding
that the appellants and the Reserve Bank of India, with a view
to touching the end of their own shadows in the guise of
exercise of their contractual powers vis-a-vis the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_312">Banking
Regulation Act</a>, exceeded their jurisdiction in recovering the
tax   imposed          on   them    by     way       of   interest    under    the
<a href="/doc/51092038/" id="a_313">Parliamentary Act</a>. This decision of the Supreme Court is
sought to be relied upon to fortify the submissions canvassed
on behalf of the petitioner that in the present case also the
Reserve Bank of India could not have issued direction in the
form of a Master Circular relating to "willful default" and
"willful defaulters". According to the petitioners, such policy

decision of the Reserve Bank of India is beyond the scope of its
powers under the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_314">Banking Regulations Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_315">Reserve
Bank of India Act</a>. We are afraid, we are unable to understand
how this decision of the Supreme Court is helpful to the
petitioners.       The Supreme Court took the view that the
Reserve Bank of India should not have undertaken any
exercise under the <a href="/doc/910984/" id="a_316">Interest Act</a>, 1974.              The functions of the
Reserve Bank of India are confined only to the provisions of
the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_317">Reserve Bank of India Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_318">Banking Regulations Act</a>
and not any other statute. We have already explained in detail
that the Master Circular is in exercise of the powers under the
<a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_319">Reserve Bank of India Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_320">Banking Regulation Act</a> and

in no way concerned. Thus, this decision is also, in no manner,
helpful to the petitioners.

<p id="p_364">     In the case of Directorate of Revenue (supra), the
Supreme Court was dealing with a matter relating to the
Narcotic Drugs &amp; <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_321">Psychotropic Substances Act</a>, 1985.                     The
Supreme Court, in view of the few draconian provisions under
the Act, considered the right to privacy as embodied in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_322">Article
21</a> of the Constitution of India.                The Supreme Court was

1985, which empowered the officers under the Act to make
search and seizure of a person at all hours and at all places.
Considering the draconian provisions which may lead to a
harsh sentence, the Supreme Court explained the doctrine of
"due process" as adumbrated under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_325">Article 21</a> of the
Constitution of India which requires striking of balance
between the need of law and enforcement thereof, on the one

on the other.          The Supreme Court, while interpreting the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1644231/" id="a_326">Sections 42</a> and <a href="/doc/1995368/" id="a_327">43</a> of the Act, 1985, observed
that the interpretation which directs a balance between the
enforcement of law and protection of the valuable human
rights of the accused must be resorted to.       A balance, thus,
must be struck in regard to the mode and manner in which the
statutory requirements are to be complied with vis-a-vis the
place of search and seizure. This decision of the Supreme
Court has been relied upon only with a view to highlight the
doctrine of "due process". According to the petitioners, in the
case at hand, the elements of the doctrine of "due process" is
missing. The manner and the mode of inquiry at the end of
the bank itself could not be termed as a "due process". We
are afraid, this decision is also of no assistance to the
petitioners. The aspect of the doctrine of "due process" has
been well explained by us in the earlier part of our judgment.

observed that such was the protection which              the law
guaranteed equally to all persons, and the Constitution
prohibited by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_328">Article 14</a> every State from denying such
protection to anyone.     Taking clue from such observations
made by the Supreme Court, it is sought to be contended in
the present case that having regard to the nature of the
inquiry, more particularly the mode and the manner, it could
not be said that the interest of the borrower is well protected.
We are afraid, this decision is also of no assistance to the
petitioners. The observations of the Supreme Court referred to

<p id="p_366">      In M/s.A-One Mega Mart P. Limited (supra), a Division
Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court was considering
the challenge to the orders passed by the HDFC Bank rejecting
the request of the petitioner for selling the mortgaged property
under Section 13(13) of the Securitisation and Reconstruction
of Financial Assets and <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_329">Enforcement of Security Interest Act</a>,

objection, reliance was placed on the decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Federal Bank Limited (supra). The Division
Bench overruled the objection as regards the maintainability of
the   petition and took the         view that the petition was
maintainable even against a private bank. The Division Bench
considered various decisions of the Supreme Court on the
subject. However, what weighed with the Division Bench in
taking the view that a petition against a private bank would be
maintainable was that under <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_330">Section 17</a> of the SARFAESI Act,
an appeal would lie to the Debts Recovery Tribunal against the

an appeal is maintainable under <a href="/doc/1315108/" id="a_331">Section 18</a> of the said Act to
the Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal. The Court took the
view that an order passed by the DRAT is amenable to the writ
jurisdiction of a High Court. The Court also considered <a href="/doc/6431889/" id="a_332">Section
34</a> of the SARFAESI Act, which is significant in deciding the
issue relating to the writ jurisdiction of a High Court. <a href="/doc/1506503/" id="a_333">Section 34</a>
bars the jurisdiction of a civil court in matters relating to
actions where provisions of the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_334">SARFAESI Act</a> have been
invoked. The Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High
Court took the view that the Constitution guarantees equality
and strikes against any arbitrary action of an authority. It
further observed that it could not be said that wherever any
authority acted in a discretionary or unreasonable manner, the
aggrieved party would be without any remedy either by way of
a civil suit or by invoking the writ jurisdiction of a High Court. In
such circumstances, the Court took the view that it could not
be held that an action by the Scheduled bank, to which the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_335">SARFAESI Act</a> were applicable and had been
invoked by it, would be immune from the extraordinary writ
jurisdiction of that court. We are afraid, this decision of the
Punjab and Haryana High Court is also of no assistance to the
petitioners. We are not concerned with a case wherein any
action is taken or proposed to be taken under the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_336">SARFAESI
Act</a>. The circular of the Reserve Bank of India does not say that
any decision as regards the declaration of willful defaulters will
not be open to challenge before the civil court. There is no bar
so far as the jurisdiction of civil court is concerned.

</blockquote>

<p id="p_369">(1)          The Reserve Bank of India was within its powers to
  issue the Master Circular relating to the willful default
  and willful defaulters as it is empowered to regulate the
  banking system and certain regulatory functions have
  been assigned to it by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_340">Reserve Bank
  of India Act</a>, 1934, and the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_341">Banking Regulations Act</a>,
  1949.
</p>

<p id="p_370">(2)          The Master Circular has been issued by the Reserve
  Bank of India in public interest. Although it has not been
  stated in so many words to have been issued in public
  interest and also the source of power, yet if the source of
  power is traceable, exercise of such power cannot be set-
  aside merely because the same has not been disclosed.
</p>

<p id="p_371">(3)          The Master Circular does not suffer from the vice of
  impermissible        delegation      of     a   legislative   power.   It
  confirms exactly to the power granted.</p><pre id="pre_7">

  completely misplaced. In a given case, if the court finds
  the action to be tainted with malafide or bias, then the
  same could always be condemned and set at right. On
  mere apprehension of misuse of such provision, an
  otherwise valid statute, should not be struck down or

</p>

<p id="p_375">  (8)          The Master Circular seeks to paint all the directors
     with the same brush. The provisions in the circular
     shatter the concept of identity of a company being
     different and distinct from its directors without providing
     any safeguards.

     being a private bank, is not amenable to the writ
