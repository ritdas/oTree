AND

Review WPMP No.25025 of 2014 in W.P.No.35413 of 2013     

ORDER: (per Honble Sri Justice Ramesh Ranganathan)             

      This petition is filed seeking review of the order passed in
W.P. No.35413 of 2013 dated 23.06.2014. The petitioners herein
filed W.P.No.35413 of 2013 seeking a writ of mandamus to set
aside the order passed, by the Debts Recovery Tribunal,
Hyderabad, in S.A. No.97 of 2009 dated 20.09.2009.   S.A. No.97 of
2009 was filed by the petitioners herein, under Section 17 of the
Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and
<a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_1">Enforcement of Security Interest Act</a>, 2002 (for short the
<a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_2">SARFAESI Act</a>), to set aside the proceedings initiated by the 2nd
respondent-bank herein, under <a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_3">Section 13(4)</a> of the SARFAESI Act, 
against the scheduled property as void, illegal and arbitrary; to
direct the 2nd respondent-bank to give a valid discharge of the
liability over the scheduled property; and to deliver the
documents/execute a sale deed in favour of the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_6">      In its order, in S.A. No.97 of 2009 dated 20.09.2013, the
Debts Recovery Tribunal observed that the petitioners had
challenged the action of the 2nd respondent-bank in invoking the
jurisdiction of the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_4">SARFAESI Act</a>, and in taking measures under
<a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_5">Section 13(4)</a> thereof, against the scheduled property solely on the
ground of exclusive ownership of the said property by virtue of an
agreement of sale dated 31.12.2007;  the petitioners had not
pointed out any irregularity committed by the 2nd respondent-
bank, while initiating proceedings for taking measures under
<a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_6">Section 13(4)</a> of the SARFAESI Act and the Rules made thereunder;  
the petitioners had no right over the scheduled property as
ownership was not conveyed in their favour; they had no absolute
right over the property by virtue of the agreement of sale dated
31.12.2007; and they were not entitled to challenge the
proceedings of the 2nd respondent-bank, when proceeding against 
the scheduled property by invoking the provisions under the
<a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_7">SARFAESI Act</a>, because of the default committed by the borrowers  
in servicing their loan account as they were due a large sum of
money to the 2nd respondent-bank.  While dismissing S.A. No.97 of 
2009, the Division bench directed the 2nd respondent-bank to
return Rs.10.00 Lakhs deposited by the petitioners pursuant to the
interim order dated 19.03.2009.
</p><p id="p_7">      Aggrieved thereby, the petitioners invoked the jurisdiction of
this Court by way of W.P. No.35413 of 2013.  The Division Bench,
in its order in W.P. No.35413 of 2013, framed three points for
consideration.  Firstly, whether the second respondent bank  a
private bank - was an instrumentality of the State amenable to
the writ jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India; secondly, whether the agreement of sale,
obtained by the petitioners from respondents 8 and 9, is hit by
<a href="/doc/52478203/" id="a_9">Section 13(13)</a> of the SARFAESI Act? and, if so, whether the
petitioners were entitled to challenge the proceedings initiated by
the 2nd respondent-bank under the Recovery of Debts due to the
Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, and under the
<a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_10">SARFAESI Act</a>?;  and thirdly, whether the petitioners were entitled
to challenge the order of the Debts Recovery Tribunal, in S.A.
No.97 of 2009 dated 20.09.2013, without exhausting the
alternative remedy provided by way of an appeal under <a href="/doc/11945171/" id="a_11">Section 18</a>
of the SARFAESI Act.   On all the three points, the Division bench
held in favour of the 2nd respondent bank and against the
petitioners.  Aggrieved thereby the petitioners have filed this review
petition.
</p><p id="p_8">      Before examining the contentions urged on behalf of the
petitioners, on the reasons why the order of the Division bench in
W.P. No.35413 of 2013 dated 23.06.2014 necessitates review, it is
necessary to examine the scope of enquiry in review proceedings.
Nothing in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_12">Article 226</a> of the Constitution precludes a High Court
from exercising the power of review which inheres in every court of
plenary jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice or to correct
grave palpable errors committed by it.  (<a href="/doc/1415584/" id="a_13">Shivdeo Singh v. State of
Punjab</a> ; <a href="/doc/103414929/" id="a_14">State of Rajasthan v. Surendra Mohnot</a> ).  A review of a
judgment is a serious step, and reluctant resort to it is proper only
where a glaring omission or a patent mistake or like grave error
has crept in earlier by judicial fallibility. The present stage is not a
virgin ground, but review of an earlier order which has the normal
feature of finality. (<a href="/doc/1626241/" id="a_15">Sow Chandra Kante v. Sk. Habib</a> ; Kamlesh
Verma v. Mayawati ).  The earlier order cannot be reviewed unless
the court is satisfied that material error, manifest on the face of the
order, undermines its soundness or results in miscarriage of
justice. (Kamlesh Verma4; Col. <a href="/doc/1693775/" id="a_16">Avtar Singh Sekhon v. Union of
India</a> ).  Error apparent on the face of the proceedings is an error
which is based on clear ignorance or disregard of the provisions of
law.  Such error is an error which is a patent error and not a mere
wrong decision. (<a href="/doc/1959866/" id="a_17">T.C. Basappa v. T. Nagappa</a> ; Kamlesh Verma4). 
It is essential that it should be something more than a mere error;
it must be one which must be manifest on the face of the record.
(<a href="/doc/1450722/" id="a_18">Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Ahmad Ishaque</a> ; Kamlesh Verma4).   
</p><p id="p_9">      Bearing these aspects in mind, let us now examine the order
of the Division bench on each of the three points, the contentions
of the Learned Counsel on either side for and against its being
reviewed, and whether or not each of the points, decided by the
earlier Division bench, necessitates review.
</p><p id="p_10">      On Point No.1 the Division Bench, following the judgment in
B.S.K. Madhavi v.  Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, Vijayawada 
which in turn followed the judgment of the Supreme Court in
<a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_19">Federal Bank Limited v. Sagar Thomas</a> , held that the 2nd
respondent (ING Vysya Bank Limited) was a private bank, and a 
bank within the meaning of <a href="/doc/93577912/" id="a_20">Section 2</a>[c] read with <a href="/doc/112401144/" id="a_21">Section 6</a> of the
SARFAESI Act; a private bank does not perform public functions
merely by providing banking services; the 2nd respondent-bank was
not a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_22">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of
India; though the 2nd respondent bank, was a bank within the
definition under <a href="/doc/93577912/" id="a_23">Section 2</a>[c] read with <a href="/doc/112401144/" id="a_24">Section 6</a> of the SARFAESI
Act, a Writ Petition was not maintainable; the impugned order was
an order passed by the Debts Recovery Tribunal under the
<a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_25">SARFAESI Act</a>; Courts have consistently held that a Writ Petition
was not maintainable though the challenge was against the order
passed by the Debts Recovery Tribunal; though private individuals
and the Debts Recovery Tribunal were parties, the substantive
relief was claimed only against the 2nd respondent- bank; the other
parties were proforma parties impleaded to avoid procedural
difficulties; and applying the law, and the principles laid down in
Federal Bank Ltd9, the Writ Petition was not maintainable,  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_26">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, against a private bank i.e.
ING Vysya Bank Limited.  
</p><p id="p_11">      Sri Krishna Murthy, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of
the petitioners, would submit that, even if the 2nd respondent-bank
is not an instrumentality of the State under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_27">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution of India, they are nonetheless required to discharge
the statutory duties specified in the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_28">SARFAESI Act</a> and the Rules
made thereunder; a Writ Petition, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_29">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India, is maintainable for violation of a statutory
duty; the Supreme Court, in Federal Bank Ltd9, has also held
that, for statutory violations, a writ is maintainable; a Writ Petition
would lie against the 2nd respondent-bank for any action taken by
them contrary to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_30">SARFAESI Act</a> and the Rules
made thereunder; <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_31">Section 13</a> of the SARFAESI Act enables the  
banks to exercise statutory power; Rule 8 of the SARFAESI Rules, 
and Rule 3 in Schedule-II of the Income Tax Act, are statutory
provisions which necessitate compliance; the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_32">SARFAESI Act</a> makes   
no distinction between a public sector bank and a private sector
bank in the case of a non-performing asset; even otherwise, the
order under challenge was the order passed by the Debts Recovery 
Tribunal in S.A.No.97 of 2009 dated 20.09.2013; the order passed
by the Debts Recovery Tribunal (which was under challenge in the
Writ Petition), was in exercise of the powers conferred on it under
<a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_33">Section 17</a> of the SARFAESI Act; the Debts Recovery Tribunal is a
statutory Tribunal against whose order a Writ Petition, under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_34">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, would lie; and the Division
Bench had erred in holding that the Writ Petition was not
maintainable against the 2nd respondent-bank. Learned Counsel 
would rely on <a href="/doc/1059476/" id="a_35">Mardia Chemicals Ltd v. Union of India</a> ; <a href="/doc/67689804/" id="a_36">Edara

Learned Counsel for the 2nd respondent bank, would submit that
the 2nd respondent bank is a private bank and is not an
instrumentality of the State under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_39">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of
India; and as has been rightly held by the Division bench, in the
order under review, a Writ Petition would not lie against the 2nd
respondent bank. 
</p><p id="p_12">      Mandamus and certiorari are public law remedies. They are
not available to enforce private law rights. Every act of a
company/society, which may be a 'State' within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_40">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, does not necessarily belong to the
public law field. A company/society, which is a 'State', may have
its private law rights just like the Government. A contractual
obligation, which is not statutory, cannot, ordinarily, be enforced
by way of a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_41">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. (<a href="/doc/1889207/" id="a_42">Sri
Konaseema Co-operative Central Bank Ltd. v. N. Seetharama  
Raju (FB</a>) ).  It is no doubt true that the 2nd respondent-bank is
not an instrumentality of the State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_43">Article 12</a>
of the Constitution of India and, with regards its private functions,
the jurisdiction of this Court, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_44">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
of India, cannot be invoked.  In this context, the distinction
between public law functions and those in the private law realm
must be borne in mind.
</p><p id="p_13">      Public law is confined to 'public authorities'.  The 'nature of
the persons and bodies against whom relief may be granted by
such orders', that is, by mandamus, prohibition or certiorari, are
divided into two main categories.  First, the persons or bodies who
have legal authority to determine questions affecting the common
law or statutory rights or obligations of other persons as
individuals.  Second, the persons or bodies who are entrusted by
Parliament    with functions, powers and duties which involve the
making of decisions of a public nature.  (Sri Konaseema Co-
operative Central Bank Ltd.14; The Closing Chapter" : Lord
Denning; <a href="/doc/1752215/" id="a_45">R. v. Electricity Commissioners</a>, ex parte London
Electricity Joint Committee Co., (1920) Ltd ; O'Reitly v.
Mackman ).  
</p><p id="p_14">      Public law is the system which enforces the proper
performance by public bodies of the duties which they owe to the
public. Private law is the system which protects the private rights
of private individuals or the private rights of public bodies. The
critical distinction arises out of the fact that it is the public as a
whole or, in the case of local government, the public in the locality
who are the beneficiaries of what is protected by public law and it
is the individuals or bodies entitled to the rights who are the
beneficiaries of the protection provided by private law.  ("Public
Law Private Law : Why the Divide? A personal View (published
in "Public Law" Summer : (1986)" : Sir Harry Woolf; Sri
Konaseema Co-operative Central Bank Ltd.14).   While public law
deals only with public bodies, this does not mean that the activities
of public bodies are never governed by private law. Like public
figures, at least in theory, public bodies are entitled to have a
private life.   The servant employed by a public body ordinarily has
the same private rights as any other servant.  The position may,
however, be different if such relationship is circumscribed by a
statutory provision.  ("Public Law Private Law: Why the Divide?
A personal View (published in "Public Law" Summer : (1986)" :
Sir Harry Woolf; Sri Konaseema Co-operative Central Bank 
Ltd.14).
</p><p id="p_15">        The bodies to which the remedies of these prerogative writs
have been applied have all been statutory bodies on whom
Parliament has conferred statutory powers and duties which, when
exercised, may lead to the detriment of the subjects who may have
to submit to their jurisdiction. (<a href="/doc/328212/" id="a_46">R. v. National Joint Council</a> for
Dental Technicians, ex parte Neate ; Sri Konaseema Co- 
operative Central Bank Ltd.14). Every body which is created by a
statute, and whose powers and duties are defined by a statute, is a
'public authority'. Government departments, local authorities,
police authorities, and statutory undertakings and corporations,
are all 'public authorities'. So are members of a statutory tribunal.
So also, a university incorporated by statute.  But a limited liability
company incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_47">Companies Act</a>s is not a 'public
authority'. Nor is an unincorporated association. (Sri Konaseema
Co-operative Central Bank Ltd.14; The Closing Chapter": Lord
Denning; Tozer v. National Greyhound Racing Club Ltd. ).
These categories are not exhaustive. The Court has been extending
them to any other person or body of a public nature exercising
public duties which it is desirable to control by the remedy of
judicial review. (Sri Konaseema Co-operative Central Bank
Ltd.14; The Closing Chapter" : Lord Denning).
</p><p id="p_16">      While private law functions, of a private body corporate,
cannot be subjectd to challenge in proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_48">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution of India, its public law function is amenable to the
writ jurisdiction of the High Court.  Statutory obligations may be
cast even on private banks, which are not instrumentalities of the
State under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_49">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India, by the
provisions of a statute.  Violation of statutory duties by private

Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_17">      The order under challenge before the Division Bench was an
order passed by the Debts Recovery Tribunal in S.A.No.97 of 2009
dated 20.09.2013.  The Debts Recovery Tribunal is a statutory
body created, by the Central Government, under <a href="/doc/1524608/" id="a_51">Section 3(1)</a> of the
Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act,
1993, and its jurisdiction can be invoked by any person aggrieved
under <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_52">Section 17</a> of the SARFAESI Act, 2002. The Debts Recovery   
Tribunal is a statutory Tribunal, and its orders can be corrected in
certiorari proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_53">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.
Certiorari lies to remove, for the purpose of quashing, the
proceedings of inferior courts of record or other persons or bodies
exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions.  A certiorari lies only
in respect of a judicial or quasi-judicial act as distinguished from
an administrative act. (<a href="/doc/1401120/" id="a_54">Udit Narain Singh Malpaharia v.
Additional Member Board of Revenue, Bihar</a> ).  Wherever any
body of persons having legal authority to determine questions
affecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act
judicially, act in excess of their legal authority they are subject to
the controlling jurisdiction of the Court exercised in a writ of
Certiorari. (<a href="/doc/1453943/" id="a_55">The King v. The Electricity Commissioner</a> ; Udit
Narain Singh Malpaharia19).
</p><p id="p_18">      In order to establish that certiorari will issue, it is enough to
show that the body in question was obliged to act in a judicial
manner, in the sense that it was under an express duty to adopt a
procedure analogous to a judicial procedure, or that it was
required to determine questions of law and fact or otherwise to
exercise a limited yet judicial discretion, or that it was under an
implied duty to act judicially in accordance with natural justice, or
even under a more loosely formulated duty to act fairly. A duty to
act judicially may be inferred from the severity of the impact made
by the exercise of a power or duty on individual interests.
(Halsbury's Laws of England. 4th Edition at page 104;
<a href="/doc/1457597/" id="a_56">Harijander Singh v. Selection Committee, Kakatiya Medical
College, Warangal</a> ).
</p><p id="p_19">      The ambit of certiorari can be said to cover every case in
which a body of persons, of a public as opposed to a purely private
or domestic character, has to determine matters affecting subjects,
provided always that it has a duty to act judicially. If tribunals are
established by Acts of Government, the supervisory jurisdiction of
the High Court extends to them if they possess the essential
characteristics on which the subjection of inferior tribunals to the
supervisory control of the High Court is based. (Sri Konaseema
Co-operative Central Bank Ltd.14; R. v. Criminal Injuries
Compensation Board, ex parte Lain ; <a href="/doc/117218345/" id="a_57">R. v. Panel</a> on take-
overs ). The jurisdiction to supervise, the exercise of jurisdiction
by inferior tribunals, has never been dependent upon the source of
the tribunal's authority to decide issues submitted to its
determination except where such authority is derived solely and
exclusively from agreement of the parties to the determination.
This latter case falls within the field of private contract and is
within the jurisdiction either of an arbitrator or the civil court.
(Harijander Singh21).
</p><p id="p_20">      A writ of certiorari can be issued for correcting errors of
jurisdiction committed by tribunals. These are cases where orders
are passed by inferior courts or tribunals without jurisdiction, or in
excess of it, or as a result of failure to exercise jurisdiction. A writ
can similarly be issued where, in exercise of the jurisdiction
conferred on it, the Tribunal acts illegally or improperly, or where
the procedure adopted in dealing with the dispute is opposed to
principles of natural justice. (<a href="/doc/484719/" id="a_58">Syed Yakoob v. K.S.
Radhakrishnan</a> ). The certiorari jurisdiction of the High Court,
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_59">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, can be invoked
against orders of statutory tribunals, even if the order passed by
such tribunal is in a lis between two private parties.
</p><p id="p_21">      It is no doubt true that the petitioner did not invoke the
certiorari jurisdiction of this Court, but had sought a writ of
mandamus.  A writ of mandamus is a writ which commands a   
public body to perform a public duty imposed on it by law. A
distinction must, therefore, be made between a duty and a mere
power. Mandamus is not limited to judicial acts. It will issue at the
instance of a person whose legal right is involved and a
corresponding statutory obligation is also involved.  There must be
a legal right existing in the petitioner and a corresponding legal
duty upon the authority in order to issue a mandamus.
(Harijander Singh21).  A writ can issue against a public body or
authority or bodies created under statute apart from the State.
Violation of any statutory provision or rule can be a ground for the
issue of such a writ. (Harijander Singh21). Where the authority has
failed to carry out a legal duty imposed on him, and such failure is
destructive of a basic principle of justice, a writ of mandamus
should issue ex debito justitiae to compel him to carry out the
duty. (Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd12).
</p><p id="p_22">        A writ of mandamus can also be issued for statutory
violation by a private body, including private banks such as the
second respondent-bank.  In Federal Bank Ltd.9, the 1st
respondent, who was working as the branch manager of Federal 
Bank, was placed under suspension, and disciplinary action was
initiated against him.  On his being found guilty of the charge, he
was imposed the punishment of dismissal from service.  The 1st
respondent challenged the order of dismissal by way of a Writ
Petition before the High Court.  The objection taken by the
appellant bank, to the maintainability of the Writ Petition, was
negatived by the Learned Single judge holding that Federal Bank
performed a public duty.  The appeal preferred thereagainst was
dismissed by a Division bench of the High Court.  On Federal bank
questioning the said order in appeal, the Supreme Court
observed:-
</p><p id="p_23">    From the decisions referred to above, the position that emerges
is that a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_60">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India may be
maintainable against (i) the State (Government); (ii) an authority; (iii) a
statutory body; (iv) an instrumentality or agency of the State; (v) a company
which is financed and owned by the State; (vi) a private body run substantially
on State funding; (vii) a private body discharging public duty or positive
obligation of public nature; and (viii) a person or a body under liability to
discharge any function under any statute, to compel it to perform such a
statutory function.
</p>
<p id="p_24">    A company registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_61">Companies Act</a> for the purposes of carrying
on any trade or business is a private enterprise to earn livelihood and to make
profits out of such activities. Banking is also a kind of profession and a
commercial activity, the primary motive behind it can well be said to earn
returns and profits. Since time immemorial, such activities have been carried on
by individuals generally. It is a private affair of the company though the case
of
nationalized banks stands on a different footing. There may well be companies,
in which majority of the share capital may be contributed out of the State funds
and in that view of the matter there may be more participation or dominant
participation of the State in managing the affairs of the company. But in the
present case we are concerned with a banking company which has its own  
resources to raise its funds without any contribution or shareholding by
the State. It has its own Board of Directors elected by its shareholders. It
works like any other private company in the banking business having no
monopoly status at all. Any company carrying on banking business with a
capital of five lakhs will become a scheduled bank..  
</p>
<p id="p_25">     .Such private companies would normally not be amenable to     
the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_62">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. But in certain
circumstances a writ may issue to such private bodies or persons as there
may be statutes which need to be complied with by all concerned including
the private companies. For example, there are certain legislations like the
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_63">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_64">Minimum Wages Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_65">Factories Act</a> or for
maintaining proper environment, say the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_66">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 or the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_67">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1974 etc. or statutes of the like nature which fasten certain duties and
responsibilities statutorily upon such private bodies which they are bound
to comply with. If they violate such a statutory provision a writ would
certainly be issued for compliance with those provisions. For instance, if a
private employer dispenses with the service of its employee in violation of
the provisions contained under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_68">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in innumerable
cases the High Court interfered and has issued the writ to the private
bodies and the companies in that regard. But the difficulty in issuing a writ
may arise where there may not be any non-compliance with or violation of
any statutory provision by the private body. In that event a writ may not
be issued at all. Other remedies, as may be available, may have to be
resorted to    

    ..For the discussion held above, in our view, a private company
carrying on banking business as a scheduled bank, cannot be termed as an 
institution or a company carrying on any statutory or public duty. A private
body or a person may be amenable to writ jurisdiction only where it may
become necessary to compel such body or association to enforce any  
statutory obligations or such obligations of public nature casting positive
obligation upon it. We dont find such conditions are fulfilled in respect of a
private company carrying on a commercial activity of banking. Merely regulatory
provisions to ensure such activity carried on by private bodies work within a
discipline, do not confer any such status upon the company nor put any such
obligation upon it which may be enforced through issue of a writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_69">Article
226</a> of the Constitution. Present is a case of disciplinary action being taken
against its employee by the appellant Bank. The respondents service with
the Bank stands terminated. The action of the Bank was challenged by the
respondent by filing a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_70">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India. The respondent is not trying to enforce any statutory duty on the
part of the Bank. That being the position, the appeal deserves to be
allowed.. (emphasis supplied)   

      Service conditions of employees in Federal Bank (a private
scheduled bank) are not governed by statutory regulations.  The
Supreme Court, therefore, held that, in case of disciplinary action
being taken against its employees, Federal Bank was not trying to
enforce any statutory duty on its part; and, in the absence of
violation of any statutory provision, the jurisdiction of the High
Court, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_71">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, could not
have been invoked. The law declared by the Supreme Court in
Federal Bank Ltd9, as is evident from the afore-extracted portions
of the judgment, is that a Writ Petition, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_72">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India, may be maintained against a statutory body
or a person or a body under liability to discharge any function
under any statute, to compel it to perform a statutory function; in
certain circumstances a writ may issue, to such private bodies or
persons, as there may be statutes which need to be complied with
by all concerned including private companies; in cases where there
is no violation of any statutory provision by a private body, a writ
may not be issued, and other remedies may have to be resorted to;
and a private body would be amenable to the writ jurisdiction only
where it becomes necessary to compel such body to enforce any  
statutory obligation and its obligations of a public nature.
</p><p id="p_26">      In Sri Konaseema Co-operative Central Bank Ltd.14 a Full
Bench of this Court held that the bye-laws of a co-operative
society, registered under the <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_73">A. P. Co-operative Societies Act</a>, did
not have the force of law; they were in the nature of a contract;
and, where a Society could not be characterised as a 'State', the
service conditions of its employees, governed by bye-laws, could
not be enforced through a writ petition.   It is evident, therefore,
that service conditions of employees of companies/societies, which
are either governed by bye laws or by provisions which do not have
the force of law, are in the nature of a contract; and in cases where
a company or a society cannot be characterised as a State, the
service conditions of its employees cannot be enforced in writ
proceedings.
</p><p id="p_27">      In B.S.K. Madhavi8, the Writ Petitions were filed against
ICICI Bank Limited, Asset Reconstruction Management Services,  
which was a division of Asset Reconstruction Company (India)
Limited, Dhana Lakshmi Bank Limited, Axis Bank Limited, Citi
Bank, Federal Bank, Karur Vysya Bank, ICICI Home Finance and   
Sundaram Finance.  In all the Writ Petitions, the grievance of the
petitioners was regarding the improper initiation of recovery under
the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_74">SARFAESI Act</a> and declaration of the loan amount, borrowed 
by the borrowers, as a Non-Performing Asset. The Division Bench,
after referring to several judgments, held that a banking company
was a legal entity specialising in banking business; it was required
to obtain a licence from Reserve Bank of India, which exercised
absolute control and regulation over its banking operations; the
rules and regulations, and the guidelines, of Reserve Bank of India
were non-negotiable and non-discriminatory; they were binding on
all the banks which were included in the II Schedule to the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_75">Reserve
Bank of India Act</a>; a bank, like any other company, can issue
shares to the public, borrow loans, accept deposits and also engage
in other permissible financial business; as held by the Supreme
Court, in Federal Bank Ltd9, a private bank is not a State within
the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_76">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India; and such
private banks do not perform public functions by providing
banking services.
</p><p id="p_28">      As held by the Division Bench, in B.S.K. Madhavi8, a private
scheduled bank is not a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_77">Article 12</a> of
the Constitution of India; and, in providing banking services, it
does not perform public functions.  Any complaint regarding
inadequacy of non-statutory banking services provided by a private
bank, including declaring the account of a borrower as a non-
performing asset, cannot be questioned in writ proceedings under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_78">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.  However for failure of
private scheduled banks to discharge statutory functions, or duties
prescribed by law (either plenary or subordinate), the jurisdiction
of the High Court, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_79">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India,
can be invoked.   To the extent the Division bench held otherwise,

Recovery Tribunal, the petitioners could not defeat the claim of the
secured creditor i.e. the 2nd respondent-bank; time and again, the
Supreme Court had held that sale of property, in contravention of
<a href="/doc/52478203/" id="a_81">Section 13(13)</a> of the SARFAESI Act, was invalid; the sale in favour
of the petitioners, by respondents 4 to 7, was invalid and hit by
<a href="/doc/52478203/" id="a_82">Section 13(13)</a> of the SARFAESI Act; and, on the basis of a void
agreement, the petitioners were not entitled to claim any
preferential right over the claim of the 2nd respondent-bank.  Point
No.2 was also held in favour of the 2nd respondent-bank, and
against the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_30">      Sri Krishna Murthy, Learned Counsel appearing for the

the 2nd respondent-bank against the petitioners herein, the
Division Bench, by its order dated 27.08.2012, had specifically
rejected the contention, urged on behalf of the 2nd respondent-
bank, that the agreement of sale was null and void under <a href="/doc/52478203/" id="a_83">Section
13(13)</a> of the SARFAESI Act; and as the order passed by the 
Division Bench in W.P. No.27307 of 2011 dated 27.08.2012 is a
judgment inter-parties, it is not open to the subsequent Division
Bench to take a view contrary thereto.  On the other hand Sri K.V.

the Division Bench in holding that sale of property, in
contravention of <a href="/doc/52478203/" id="a_84">Section 13(13)</a> of the SARFAESI Act, is not valid.

</p><p id="p_32">      Before the Division bench, in W.P.No.27307 of 2011, it was
contended that the agreement of sale should be declared null and
void under <a href="/doc/52478203/" id="a_86">Section 13(13)</a> of the SARFAESI Act.  The Division
bench, in its order in W.P. No.27307 of 2011 dated 27.08.2012,
held that an agreement for sale is not prohibited by the said
provision and, if at all entered into, that would be subject to the
mortgage already created by the borrower in favour of the
petitioner; it cannot, therefore, curtail the rights of the banks in
any manner whatsoever; and the contention, to declare such an
agreement of sale as null and void, was also not tenable.  The
Division bench further held that the Appellate Tribunal had found
that the Debt Recovery Tribunal had not considered the matter on
merits.  Hence, they remanded the matter only on merits, and
found in favour of the respondents therein (petitioners herein) on
the question regarding <a href="/doc/52478203/" id="a_87">Section 13(13)</a> as well as <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_88">Section 17</a> of the

order was justified.
</p><p id="p_33">      The order of the Division bench, in W.P. No.27307 of 2011
dated 27.08.2012, is a judgment inter-parties and is binding both
on the petitioners and the respondents herein. In so far as the
parties to a lis are concerned, they will always be bound by the
decision of a Court.  In other words, either of the parties will not be
permitted to reopen the issue decided by such a decision.
(Supreme Court <a href="/doc/20720737/" id="a_89">Employees Welfare Association v. Union of 
India</a> ). A previous decision on a matter in issue is a composite
decision; the decision of law cannot be dissociated from the
decision on facts on which the right is founded. A decision on an
issue of law will be res judicata in a subsequent proceeding if it be
the same as in the previous proceeding. (<a href="/doc/1847465/" id="a_90">Sushil Kumar Mehta v.
Gobind Ram Bohra</a> ; <a href="/doc/1006709/" id="a_91">Mathura Prasad Sarjoo Jaiswal v. 
Dossibai N. B. Jeejeebhoy</a> ; Supreme Court Employees Welfare   
Association25). The earlier Judgment, on the points decided on
fact or of law or of fact and law, is conclusive in every subsequent
proceeding between the same parties.  (<a href="/doc/1850397/" id="a_92">Swamy Atmananda v.   
Swami Bodhananda</a> ; <a href="/doc/899065/" id="a_93">Ishwar Dutt v. Land Acquisition 
Collector</a> ). An order of a Court/Tribunal of competent
jurisdiction directly upon a point creates a bar, as regards a plea,
between the same parties in some other matter in another
Court/Tribunal, where the said plea seeks to raise afresh the very
point that was determined in the earlier order.  (Swamy
Atmananda28; Iswar Dath29). An order passed by a Court/Tribunal 
having jurisdiction over the subject matter, and over the parties,
cannot be ignored as a nullity unless such erroneous orders are
corrected in accordance with law.   Such orders bind the parties in
a subsequent litigation.  (Barkat Ali Vs. Badrinarain ).   Issues
which have been concluded inter-parties cannot be raised again in
proceedings inter-parties.  (<a href="/doc/255258/" id="a_94">State of Haryana v. State of
Punjab</a> ).
</p><p id="p_34">      In its order in W.P. No.27307 of 2011 dated 28.08.2012, the
Division bench held that an agreement of sale was not prohibited
by <a href="/doc/52478203/" id="a_95">Section 13(13)</a> of the SARFAESI Act; if at all entered into, that
would be subject to the mortgage already created by the borrower
in favour of the bank; and it could not, therefore, curtail the rights
of the banks in any manner whatsoever.  As this finding is binding
inter-parties, this question could not have been re-agitated before
the Division bench in W.P. No.35413 of 2013, and the Division
Bench ought not to have re-examined this question to hold that
the sale in favour of the petitioners was void ab initio in view of the
interdict contained under <a href="/doc/52478203/" id="a_96">Section 13(13)</a> of the SARFAESI Act.  To
the extent the Division bench, in W.P. No.35413 of 2013, examined
this question, in a subsequent proceeding inter-parties, the order
under review suffers from an error apparent on the face of the
record and necessitates being reviewed.  Point No.2 is answered in
favour of the review petitioners.
</p><p id="p_35">      On Point No.3 the Division Bench, relying on the judgments
of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/59938062/" id="a_97">Narayana Chandra Ghosh v. UCO   
Bank</a> ; <a href="/doc/15322/" id="a_98">Kanaiyalal Lalchand Sachdev v. State of
Maharashtra</a> ; <a href="/doc/175816/" id="a_99">United Bank of India v. Satyawati Tandon</a> ;
and <a href="/doc/51987756/" id="a_100">Commissioner of Income Tax v. Chhabil Dass Agarwal</a> ,  
held that, against the order passed by the Debt Recovery Tribunal
under <a href="/doc/141981259/" id="a_101">Section 17(1)</a> of the SARFAESI Act, an appeal would lie to
the appellate authority under <a href="/doc/11945171/" id="a_102">Section 18</a> of the SARFAESI Act, and
hence the same cannot be questioned before the Court compelling 
it to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_103">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India; the High Court could not pass an order,
exercising its extra-ordinary power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_104">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India, since there is an alternative, effective and
efficacious statutory remedy available to the petitioners to prefer
an appeal before the Appellate Authority under <a href="/doc/11945171/" id="a_105">Section 18</a> of the
SARFAESI Act; and they found no ground to grant any relief in the
Writ Petition.
</p><p id="p_36">      Sri Krishna Murthy, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of
the petitioners, would submit that existence of an alternative
remedy is not a bar for invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_106">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India; the remedy of an
appeal is neither effective nor efficacious; when the Debts Recovery
Tribunal had specifically recorded findings contrary to its earlier
order, and the order of this Court, the petitioners cannot be
relegated to the alternative remedy of an appeal all over again; the
conditions imposed under the second proviso to <a href="/doc/11945171/" id="a_107">Section 18</a>,
regarding pre-deposit, renders the remedy of an appeal ineffective;
and the order of the Division Bench necessitates review on this
ground also.  On the other hand, Sri K.V. Subrahmanya Narusu, 
Learned Counsel for the 2nd respondent - bank, would submit that
the statutory remedy of appeal, under <a href="/doc/11945171/" id="a_108">Section 18</a> of the SARFAESI 
Act, is effective and efficacious; and the petitioners cannot, without
exhausting the alternative remedy, straightaway invoke the extra-
ordinary jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_109">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_37">      It is not in dispute that, against the order passed by the
Debt Recovery Tribunal, in S.A. No.97 of 2009 dated 20.09.2013,
the petitioners herein have the remedy of a statutory appeal under
<a href="/doc/11945171/" id="a_110">Section 18</a> of the SARFAESI Act.  It is no doubt true that existence
of an alternative statutory remedy of an appeal would not bar
exercise of jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_111">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India.  The power of the High Court, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_112">Article 226</a> or 227 of
the Constitution, has not been taken away because of the
alternative efficacious remedy provided under the statute.  The
power of judicial review and/or superintendence are the basic
features of the Constitution which cannot be taken away
absolutely but should be exercised in exceptional cases. (<a href="/doc/925018/" id="a_113">State of
Karnataka v. Vishwabharathi House Building Coop. Society</a> ;
<a href="/doc/172667955/" id="a_114">L&amp;T Finance Limited v. Anup Kumar Bera</a> ).  While the powers 
conferred upon the High Court, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_115">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution, to issue to any person or authority, including in
appropriate cases any Government, directions, orders or writs
including the five prerogative writs for the enforcement of any of
the rights conferred by Part III or for any other purpose are very
wide, and there is no express limitation on the exercise of that
power, at the same time every High Court is bound to keep in view
the rule of self-imposed restraint evolved by Courts while
exercising power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_116">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.  (Satyawati
Tondon34).  While Courts have recognised some exceptions to the 
rule of alternative remedy, ordinarily the High Court will not
entertain a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_117">Article 226</a> of the Constitution if an
effective alternative remedy is available to the aggrieved person or
the statute, under which the action complained of has been taken,
itself contains a mechanism for redressal of grievance. When a
statutory forum is created by law for redressal of grievances, a writ
petition should not be entertained ignoring the statutory
dispensation.  (Chhabil Dass Agarwal35; <a href="/doc/1133533/" id="a_118">Thansingh Nathmal v.
Superintendent of Taxes</a> ; <a href="/doc/23675/" id="a_119">Titaghur Paper Mills v. State of
Orissa</a> ).
</p><p id="p_38">      It is in the discretion of the Court either to entertain a Writ
Petition or to relegate the petitioners to the remedy of a statutory
appeal.  While exercising power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_120">Article 226</a>, the High Court
would certainly take note of the legislative intent manifested in the
provisions of the Act, and would exercise their jurisdiction
consistent with the provisions of the enactment. (<a href="/doc/78882931/" id="a_121">Mafatlal
Industries Ltd. v. Union of India</a> ; Chhabil Dass Agarwal35; <a href="/doc/808713/" id="a_122">G.
Veerappa Pillai v. Raman &amp; Raman Ltd</a>. ; <a href="/doc/678253/" id="a_123">CCE v. Dunlop India

<a href="/doc/517393/" id="a_125">Shivgonda Anna Patil v. State of Maharashtra</a> ; <a href="/doc/1697169/" id="a_126">C.A. Abraham

<a href="/doc/1968473/" id="a_130">Punjab National Bank v. O.C. Krishnan</a> ).
</p><p id="p_39">      Writ jurisdiction cannot normally be invoked if a statutory
remedy of appeal is provided under the Act.  If a statutory appeal
lies, then, ordinarily, the aggrieved party has to challenge the order
in an appeal and not by filing a writ petition. (<a href="/doc/14643105/" id="a_131">Civily Kallarackal v.
Vehicle Factory</a> ; Whirlpool Corporation47; <a href="/doc/57003820/" id="a_132">Paschim Gujarat
Vij Co. Ltd. v. Devabhai Memabhai Myatra</a> ).  The Rule that the
High Court will, ordinarily, not entertain a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_133">Article
226</a> of the Constitution, if an effective remedy is available to the
aggrieved person, applies with greater rigour in matters involving
recovery of taxes, cess, fees, other types of public money and the
dues of banks and other financial institutions.  While dealing with
such petitions, etc, the High Court must keep in mind that the
legislations enacted by Parliament and State Legislatures for
recovery of such dues are a code unto themselves in as much as 
they not only contain a comprehensive procedure for recovery of
the dues but also envisage constitution of quasi-judicial bodies for
redressal of the grievance of any aggrieved person.  In all such
cases, the High Court must insist that, before availing the remedy
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_134">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, a person must exhaust the
remedies available under the relevant statute.  (Satyawati
Tondon34). 
</p><p id="p_40">      The mere fact that the second proviso to <a href="/doc/21395465/" id="a_135">Section 18(1)</a> of the
SARFAESI Act stipulates that no appeal shall be entertained
unless the borrower has deposited, with the Appellate Tribunal,
50% of the amount of debt due from him, as claimed by the
secured creditors or determined by the Debts Recovery Tribunal,
whichever is less and can reduce the amount to not less than 25%
of the debt, does not render the remedy of an appeal ineffective or
not efficacious.  The right to appeal is a statutory right, and can be
circumscribed by the conditions in the grant.  If the statute gives a
right to appeal upon certain conditions, it is upon fulfilment of
those conditions that the right becomes vested and exercisable to
the appellant. (<a href="/doc/1958793/" id="a_136">Vijay Prakash D. Mehta v. Collector of
Customs</a> ).  As the right of appeal is a creature of a statute, there
is no reason why the legislature, while granting the right, should
not impose conditions for its exercise.  (<a href="/doc/1752505/" id="a_137">Seth Nand Lal v. State of
Haryana</a> ; <a href="/doc/166337/" id="a_138">Shyam Kishore v. Municipal Corpn. of Delhi</a> ;
<a href="/doc/1648125/" id="a_139">Anant Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of Gujarat</a> ).  Without a statutory
provision, creating a right of appeal, the person aggrieved is not
entitled to file an appeal. In the absence of any special reasons,
there is no legal or constitutional impediment to the imposition of
conditions for the exercise of the right to appeal.  Such conditions
merely regulate the exercise of the right of appeal so that the same
is not abused by a recalcitrant litigant, and there is no difficulty in
the enforcement of the order appealed against in case the appeal is
ultimately dismissed. It is open to the Legislature to impose an
accompanying liability upon a party upon whom a legal right is
conferred or to prescribe conditions for the exercise of the right.
Any requirement for the discharge of that liability or the fulfilment
of that condition, in case the party concerned seeks to avail of the
said right, is a valid piece of legislation. (Anant Mills Co. Ltd.56).
The requirement of pre-deposit under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/11945171/" id="a_140">Section 18</a>
of the SARFAESI Act is mandatory and there is no reason 
whatsoever for not giving full effect to the provisions contained in
<a href="/doc/11945171/" id="a_141">Section 18</a> of the Act.  Deposit, under the second proviso to <a href="/doc/21395465/" id="a_142">Section
18(1)</a> of the Act, is a condition precedent for preferring an appeal
under the said section. (Narayan Chandra Ghosh32).  As the
conditions of pre-deposit, under <a href="/doc/21395465/" id="a_143">Section 18(1)</a> of the SARFAESI
Act, have been upheld by the Supreme Court in Narayana 
Chandra Ghosh32, it cannot be said that imposition of such a
condition would render the remedy of an appeal ineffective.
</p><p id="p_41">        It is only where there can reasonably be no two opinions
entertained about it, is a clear case of an error apparent on the
face of the record made out.  (<a href="/doc/1536859/" id="a_144">M/s. Thungabhadra Industries Ltd
v. Govt. of A.P</a> ; Surendra Mohnot2).  If the view adopted by the
Court in the original judgment is a possible view it is difficult to
hold that there is an error apparent.  (<a href="/doc/1277731/" id="a_145">Northern Indian Caterers
(India) Ltd. v. Ltd. Governor of Delhi</a> ).  The possibility of two
views on the subject is not a ground for review.  (Kamlesh Verma4;
<a href="/doc/80351/" id="a_146">Lily Thomas v. Union of India</a> ). Mere disagreement with the
view expressed in the judgment is not a ground for invoking the
review jurisdiction.  (<a href="/doc/93595604/" id="a_147">Union of India v. Sandur Manganese &amp; Iron
Ores Ltd</a> ).  Exercise of discretion by the Division Bench, to
relegate the petitioner to the statutory remedy of appeal, and to
refrain from exercising jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_148">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India, is undoubtedly a possible view.  Even if the
view expressed by Sri Krishna Murthy, Learned Counsel appearing 
on behalf of the petitioner, is also presumed to be a possible view,
no interference is called for where the view of the High Court is one
of the two or more possible views, and the order passed by it
cannot be said to suffer from an error apparent on the face of the
record necessitating its review.
</p><p id="p_42">      While point Nos.1 and 2, decided by the Division bench in
W.P. No.35413 of 2013 dated 23.06.2014, necessitate being 
reviewed, and the conclusions recorded thereunder being set aside,
we see no reason to review the order on point No.3.  Consequently
the contentions urged by the petitioner, on the validity of the order
of the Debt Recovery Tribunal in S.A.No.97 of 2009 dated
20.09.2013, cannot be examined on merits.    To the extent that
the petitioner has been relegated to the remedy of a statutory
appeal, under <a href="/doc/21395465/" id="a_149">Section 18(1)</a> of the SARFAESI Act, the review
petition fails and is, accordingly, dismissed.
