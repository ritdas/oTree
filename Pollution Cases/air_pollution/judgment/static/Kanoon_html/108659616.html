               W.P.(c) No. 26688 OF 2013-I
               -------------------------------------------------
     DATED THIS THE 20th DAY OF DECEMBER, 2013.

                          J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Challenge in this writ petition is against Ext.P1 notice

issued by the 4th respondent for disconnection of electric

supply to the industry run by the petitioner. It is mentioned

in Ext.P1 that the disconnection is proposed on the basis of

direction issued by the 5th respondent under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33-A</a>

of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974

and under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_3">Section 31-A</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. Inter alia, the petitioner seeks

direction for restoration of the electric connection.

</p><p id="p_2">     2.   Facts reveled in this writ petition indicates that,

the 5th respondent had issued Ext.R5 (k) letter to the

petitioner intimating that their request for grant of 'consent

to operate' can be considered only if the petitioner submits

detailed time bound proposal for establishment of an

effluent treatment plant, for treatment of effluents

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(c) No.26688/2013         -2-</span>


generated from the industrial unit. According to learned

counsel for the petitioner pursuant to Ext.R5 (k) letter the

petitioner      had  already  submitted     a  proposal   for

establishment of the effluent treatment plant, before the 5th

respondent, on 13-12-2013. It is for the 5th respondent to

consider such proposal if any submitted and to evaluate

adequacy of the proposal and also to take a decision with

respect to grant of the 'consent to operate'. According to

respondents 1 to 3 the disconnection was effected only on

the basis of direction issued by the 5th respondent and there

is no impediment in restoring the connection if the 5th

respondent give instructions to that effect.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.     Learned counsel appearing for the additional 6th

respondent contended that the plant in question is

functioning without providing any adequate measures for

treatment of effluents. Being an industry engaged in peeling

of marine products, the activity involves generation of

effluents, which is highly hazardous and toxic to the

environment. It emanates foul smell in the locality putting

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(c) No.26688/2013           -3-</span>


life of the 6th respondent and his family members miserable.

According to learned counsel for the 6th respondent, even

after disconnection of supply the industry in question is

running with the aid of a Diesel Generator, which is liable to

be prevented.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.     From the facts and circumstances revealed as

above, it is for the 5th respondent to take adequate

measures and effective steps to see that the industry in

question is not functioned in a manner causing pollution. It

is for the said respondent to take a decision considering the

detailed proposal if any submitted for establishment of the

effluent treatment plant, as to whether 'consent to operate'

need be given to the industry. Needless to observe that if

the 5th respondent decide to issue the 'consent to operate',

the said fact shall be intimated to the 4th respondent, and on

such event the 4th respondent should take effective steps for

restoration of supply, on the petitioner complying with the

required formalities. It is also observed that if the petitioner

continues operation of the industry in any manner violative

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(c) No.26688/2013            -4-</span>


of the relevant statute, it is left open to the 5th respondent to

take effective steps for stoppage of such functioning.

</p><p id="p_5">      5.     In the circumstances as mentioned above, the writ

petition is disposed of reserving liberty to the petitioner to

approach the 5th respondent seeking grant of 'consent to

operate' and also seeking directions to respondents 1 to 4

for restoration of electric supply. If any such approach is

made the 5th respondent shall take a decision in accordance

with the observations contained herein above.
