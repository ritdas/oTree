Hon'ble Ashok Bhushan, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">Hon'ble Virendra Singh, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      Heard Sri V.B. Singh, learned Senior Advocate, assisted by Sri
Shiv Sagar Singh for the petitioner in writ petition No. 27842 of
2010, Sri P.C. Srivastava for respondents no. 4 and 5, Sri Nandlal
Maurya for respondent no.6 and learned Standing Counsel
appearing for the respondents no. 1,2 and 3. Sri V.M. Zaidi, learned
Senior Advocate assisted by Sri S.M.G. Asghar has appeared for the
petitioner in writ petition No. 29760 of 2010, Sri P.C. Srivastava
appears for respondents no. 4 and 5, Sri Nand Lal Maurya, appears
for the respondent no. 2 and learned Standing counsel for
respondent no. 1. Both the writ petitions have been heard together
and are being disposed of with the consent of the learned counsel
for the parties.
</p>

<p id="p_3">      In writ petition No. 27842 of 2010, the petitioner has prayed
for a writ of mandamus restraining the respondents from interfering
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>

in any manner in the working of slaughter house at Kamela Road,
Saharanpur by the petitioner from a period of three months starting
from 22.3.2010, the date on which the respondent no. 5 granted
approval to run the slaughter house as well as directed to complete
installation of water purifier device.
</p>

<p id="p_4">      Brief facts necessary for deciding these writ petitions are that
a slaughter house at Kamela Road, Saharanpur is being run for the
last several years. Writ petition No. 62234 of 2009 was filed by
Akham challenging the order dated 21.2.2005, passed by U.P.
Pollution Control Board, Lucknow directing the Executive Officer,
Nagar Palika Parishad, Saharanpur to close down the slaughter
house being run without installation of appropriate water purifying
device. The said writ petition was disposed of on 26.11.2009,
permitting the petitioner to submit a comprehensive representation
before the respondent no. 2. In pursuance of the order dated
26.11.2009, the U.P. Pollution Control Board passed an order dated
29.1.2010 addressed to the Executive Officer, Nagar Palika,
Parishad, Saharanpur issuing various directions including the
direction to the Nagar Palika Parishad, Saharanpur to select a
suitable site for shifting of the existing slaughter house and after
selecting   the site obtain no objection certificate from the U.P.
Pollution Control Board. Further directions were issued with regard
to slaughter house in question pointing out various shortcomings
and irregularities. In view of the order dated 29.1.2010 of the U.P.
Pollution Control Board, the Nagar Nigam passed an order
permitting the petitioner Ahkam to run the slaughter house subject
to fulfilling the conditions and direction of the U.P. Pollution Control
Board. It was further indicated in the order that in the event the
directions of the U.P. Pollution Control Board are not followed, the
slaughter house shall be closed down. The petitioner Ahkam had
come up to this Court praying for a writ of mandamus that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>

respondents may not interfere in the running of slaughter house for
a period of three months from 22.3.2010. The aforesaid period of
three months have already expired.
</p>

<p id="p_5">       The Nagar Nigam has filed counter affidavit to the writ
petition of Ahkam in which it has been stated that for choosing a
new sites there are lot of objections by the local persons hence, a
decision has been taken to modernise the existing slaughter house
in an area of 4000 square meters at Kamela Road, Saharanpur. It is
further stated that a tender notice has been issued on 3.7.2010
asking for detailed project report for construction of modern
slaughter house. It is submitted by learned counsel for the Nagar
Nigam that process for constructing the modernised slaughter
house has been initiated. Learned Counsel for the U.P. Pollution
Control Board has submitted that for running the slaughter house,
the Nagar Nigam requires a permission and no objection certificate
from the U.P. Pollution Control Board as was indicated in the letter
dated 29.1.2010. We have no doubt that in view of the directions
issued by the U.P. Pollution Control Board dated 29.1.2010, the
Nagar Nigam shall obtain necessary permission and no objection
certificate.
</p>

<p id="p_6">       In the second writ petition filed by Ibrahim and others, the
order passed by the Nagar Ayukt dated 25.4.2010 has been
challenged by which the earlier order dated 24.4.2010 granting
permission to slaughter the animals has been recalled. It has been
further stated in the order dated 25.4.2010 that till the water
purifier device is not installed, no other person except Ahkam son of
Rizvan to whom permission has already been granted on 22.3.2010
in compliance of the order of this Court passed in writ petition No.
62234 of 2009, be permitted to slaughter the animals in view of the
public health.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   4</span>

<p id="p_7">      Sri V.M. Zaidi, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the
petitioner Ibrahim and others challenging the order dated 25.4.2010
contended that the petitioners have been slaughtering the animals
and for that purpose they were granted licence by the Nagar
Nigam. He submits that it is the duty of Nagar Nigam to install
necessary water purifier device as U.P. Pollution Control Board has
issued directions to the Nagar Nigam to take all steps to follow the
directions issued by the U.P. Pollution Control Board. He submits
that the petitioners have fundamental right to carry on their
business of slaughtering the animals in the slaughter house and the
order dated 25.4.2010 cannot be sustained.
</p>

<p id="p_8">      After having heard learned counsel for the parties and
perusing the records, the issue as to whether till the modernised
slaughter house is established at the place of existing slaughter
house with regard to which tender notice has already been issued
on 3.7.2010, the petitioner Ahkam and other petitioners have right
to carry on the business of slaughtering the animals at the existing
slaughter house. The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974 gives ample power to U.P. Pollution Control Board to
take necessary action with the object of checking water pollution
and to take appropriate action in that regard. <a href="/doc/35230679/" id="a_2">Sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_3">25</a> of
the Act gives ample power to U.P. Pollution Control Board         and
according to <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_4">section 25</a> no person is entitled to establish or take any
steps to establish any industry, operation or process, or any
treatment and disposal system without previous consent of the U.P.
Pollution Control Board, which is likely to discharge sewage or trade
effluent into a stream or well or sewer or on land. From
slaughtering of the animals in the slaughter house there is a
discharge of sewage into sewer and on land hence, the process of
slaughtering the animals in the slaughter house is clearly covered
by <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">section 25</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  5</span>

1974. With regard to existing place of slaughter house specific
shortcomings have already been pointed out by the U.P. Pollution
Control Board   in the order dated 29.1.2010 and it has issued
direction to the Nagar Nigam to shift the existing slaughter house
within three months after selecting a suitable site. It has come on
record that no other suitable site has been found out by the Nagar
Nigam except the existing site in the same locality where
construction of modernised slaughter house in an area of 4000
square meters has been undertaken. We express no opinion with
regard to the modernised slaughter house, which is in process as
stated by Nagar Nigam and it is for the U.P. Pollution Control Board
to consider the request of the Nagar Nigam after proper inspection
and permit running of the modernised slaughter house. Now we are
reverting to the issue as to whether the petitioners have right to
slaughter the animals at the existing slaughter house as noted
above.   The permission granted      by the Nagar Nigam     both to
Ahkam and Ibrahim have come to an end. The prayer of the writ
petitioner Ahkam was that a direction be issued to permit him for
slaughtering the animals for a period of three months starting from
23.3.2010 that period has already come to an end and virtually the
writ petition filed by Ahkam has become infructuous.
</p>

<p id="p_9">      The question as to whether the petitioner Ahkam and other
petitioners are entitled to carry on slaughtering the animals in the
old slaughter house, is a question which has to be gone into by the
Nagar Nigam after taking into consideration the directions and
necessary instructions of the U.P. Pollution Control Board. No one
including the Nagar Nigam has right to create pollution which may
endanger the public health. Nagar Nigam is duty bound to follow all
instructions of U.P. Pollution Control Board and take appropriate
steps to ensure that no pollution is caused by running of slaughter
house. Suffice it say that it will be open for the petitioners to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  6</span>

approach the Nagar Nigam by means of appropriate application
seeking permission to carry on their business of slaughtering the
animals and it is for the Nagar Nigam to ensure compliance of all
the directions and instructions issued by the U.P. Pollution Control
Board before granting any permission to run the slaughter house. It
is provided that the Nagar Nigam shall consider and take
appropriate decision on the applications of the petitioners within
three weeks from the date of making the application alongwith a
certified copy of this order.
</p>

<p id="p_10">      With the aforesaid observations, both the writ petitions are
disposed of.
