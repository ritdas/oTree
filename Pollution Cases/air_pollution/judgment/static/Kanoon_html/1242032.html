                    W.P.(C).No.32007 Of 2009
                       ----------------------
            Dated this the 7th day of October, 2010.

<p id="p_1">     Petitioner is the defendant in O.S.No.79 of 2004 on the file

of the Munsiff-Magistrate Court, Payyoli. Suit was decreed on

31.10.2005. Ext.P1 is the decree. The decreetal portion of the

judgment reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "It do hereby made clear that in the event of

       complying the measures suggested in Ext.C2 report

       by the 1st defendant, he can operate his flour mill

       notwithstanding the order of injunction".</blockquote><p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">     2.    The petitioner submits that in terms of the decree he

had complied with all the conditions laid down therein and he

started functioning the flour mill after passing of the decree. It is

said that he has taken all pollution control measures such as

covering the openings and ceiling by filter cloth, provided an

exhaust fan with arrangement of dust extraction system. He also

covered the front side opening by a masonry wall with glass

window covered the multi grinder with wooden planks.             on

compliance with all the conditions laid down in Ext.P1 decree it is

said that the sound emanating from the mill is within the

W.P.(C).No.32007 Of 2009

                                ::2::
</p>
<p id="p_4">permissible limits. Petitioner also obtained consent to operate

the mill under the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>

(hereinafter referred to as the Act).
</p>
<p id="p_5">      3.   The first respondent filed an execution petition as

E.P.No.224 of 2005 alleging non-compliance of conditions in

Ext.P1. It is said that the first respondent/plaintiff took out a

commission without notice to the petitioner. The petitioner was

not present in the premises.         It is said that the advocate

commissioner made the inspection on a holiday (4.12.2005)

when cleaning and maintenance work was done in the flour mill.

It is also averred in the writ petition that no notice was given

about the inspection.       The report filed by the advocate

commissioner on 2.1.2006 is marked as Ext.P2. The petitioner

filed Ext.P3 detailed objection to Ext.P2 report. In view of the

objection raised, the executing court called for a report from the

Environmental Engineer. The Environmental Engineer submitted

a report on 11.8.2005. He again inspected the site along with

the advocate commissioner on 31.3.2006.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      3.   Ext.P4 is the report submitted by the Environmental

Engineer and Ext.P5 is the advocate commissioner's report.

W.P.(C).No.32007 Of 2009

                                ::3::
</p>
<p id="p_7">Environmental Engineer reported in Ext.P4 report that the flour

mill is found functioning with satisfactory air and sound pollution

measures such as covering the openings and ceiling by filter

cloth, provided an exhaust fan with arrangement of dust

extraction system. It is reported that while working of the multi

grinder, sound level was measured at distance of one mete away

from the boundary of the premises and in the premises of the

shop owned by the plaintiff in the shop situated at south-east

side of the flour mill.     The Environmental Engineer further

reported that based on the monitoring of sound level it is

observed that the flour mill has provided the pollution control

measures satisfactorily in order to avoid any pollution problems

caused duet to operation of grinding machines and that the Board

has granted consent to operate the flour mill under the provisions

of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Act</a> after necessary verification of pollution control

measures provided in the flour mill.       The commissioner also

reported the same sound level as reported by the Environmental

Engineer. The report of the commissioner is more or less in tune

with the report submitted by the Environmental Engineer.

W.P.(C).No.32007 Of 2009

                                 ::4::
</p>
<p id="p_8">      4.   The plaintiff in the suit filed a petition to set aside the

commissioner's report and the report submitted by the

Environmental Engineer.      The trial court after referring to the

facts subsequent to the passing of the decree and also referring

to the report submitted by the commissioner and the

Environmental Engineer which are marked as Exts.P4 &amp; P5 held

that the Environmental Engineer reported that the judgment

debtor had complied with all the measures suggested by him and

at present the flour mill is functioning within the prescribed limit

of the sound level. It is also found that the judgment debtor had

taken precautions for avoiding air pollution and it is functioning

satisfactorily. The court also noted that the judgment debtor had

obtained the consent to operate his unit from the Pollution

Control Board under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air Act</a>. Based on the

materials which I have referred to in the preceding paragraphs

the executing court by order dated 11.7.2006 dismissed the

petition stating that there is absolutely no scope for another

report from another expert and that the present E.A is outside

the scope of execution petition and devoid of any merit. Ext.P6 is

the said order.
</p>
<p id="p_9">W.P.(C).No.32007 Of 2009

                                ::5::
</p>
<p id="p_10">     5.    In spite of the fact that the Environmental Engineer

and the commissioner reported that the flour mill is functioning

within the prescribed limits of sound level, the learned Munsiff in

the order dated 14.10.2009 in E.P.No.224 of 2005, marked as

Ext.P7, held that the petitioner/judgment debtor has been

running the mill in violation of the decree of injunction in

O.S.No.79 of 2004.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     6.    I have discussed the evidence on record produced by

the parties to the execution petition. The evidence on record

shows that the judgment debtor has not violated the conditions

stated in Ext.P1 decree. Learned Munsiff has not even referred to

Exts.P4 &amp; P5 reports submitted by the Environmental Engineer

and the advocate commissioner. Therefore, the findings of the

learned Munsiff in Ext.P7 order that the judgment debtor has

violated the decree of injunction in O.S.No.79 of 2004 is without

any basis and it is against the facts and evidence recorded in the

execution petition.   After finding that there is violation of the

decree, the learned Munsiff held that the judgment debtor had

disobeyed the decree wilfully and therefore the decree can be

enforced by detaining the petitioner in civil prison and attaching

W.P.(C).No.32007 Of 2009

                                ::6::
</p>
<p id="p_12">the   decree schedule property.      Since on facts, evidence and

circumstances, the finding that the judgment debtor has violated

the decree cannot stand legally, there is also no basis for the

order that the decree can be enforced by detaining the petitioner

in the civil prison for one month and by attachment of the decree

schedule property.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     7.     Learned counsel for the petitioner also referred to the

decision reported in Narayani v. Thankappan (1991 (2) KLT

</p><p id="p_14">704) in which it was held that Order XXI Rule 32 Code of Civil

Procedure is intended to enforce certain classes of decrees. One

such class is a decree for injunction.     Such a decree can be

enforced by detention of the disobeying party in civil prison or by

attachment of his property or by both. It is further held in the

said decision that Order XXI Rule 32 is not intended to punish a

contumacious party.      The said Rule can be invoked only for

enforcement of a decree. According to the learned counsel, the

execution petition filed for enforcement of the decree, for

detention of the judgment debtor in civil prison and for

attachment of his property is not maintainable. According to the

learned counsel, for violation of the order of injunction, the

W.P.(C).No.32007 Of 2009

                                ::7::
</p>
<p id="p_15">remedy open to the party is to move the court under the

provisions contained under Order XXXIX Rule 2A and not by filing

execution petition. In this case on merits also it was found that

the judgment debtor has complied with the conditions set out in

the decree itself. On the materials produced in the case there is

no violation of the decree of permanent injunction. So there is

no justification for passing an order by the court that too without

referring to the materials placed before the court to order arrest

and detention of the petitioner in civil prison and for attaching his

properties and further attachment of decree schedule property.

</p><p id="p_16">     In the result, Ext.P7 order is set aside. The writ petition is

allowed.
