AND 227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO
SET ASIDE AND QUASH THE CLOSURE ORDER DATED
03.07.2013 VIDE ANNEXURE-D PASSED BY THE FIRST
RESPONDENT.

     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS
THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                                    3

                               ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">D.H.WAGHELA, CJ (Oral)

</p><p id="p_2">1.    The petitioner is M/s.Devi Enterprises, represented by its

proprietrix Smt.Sukadi Devi ; and the prayer in the petition is to quash

the closure order dated 03.07.2013, which is annexed to the petition

as Annexure-D. That impugned order appears to have been

culmination of a complaint received on 05.02.2013.          M/s.Ambe

Polymers is described in the impugned order by adding to it : (New

Ownership operating in the name of M/s.Devi Enterprises) which

was engaged in manufacture of injection moulded components,

without obtaining the consent of the Karnataka State Pollution

Control Board (KSPCB). According to the impugned order, after

receipt of the complaint by the Board against the industry regarding

noise pollution, a copy thereof was forwarded to the office of the

Environmental Officer, KSPCB at Nisarga Bhavan, Bengaluru and

inspection of the unit was carried out on 14.02.2013. At the time of

inspection, the unit was not working since it had given a holiday to

the workers.     Thereafter, a show-cause notice was issued on

23.02.2013, which was neither replied nor complied. Then, another

complaint dated 12.03.2013 was made and received by the KSPCB on

15.03.2013. The officer of KSPCB again inspected the industry on

25.03.2013 and reported the observations that the industry was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   4</span>

operating and engaged in injection moulded components, without

valid consent of the Board and at the time of inspection, two

extruders were working out of six extruder machines. When the

industry was not in operation, the noise level inside the establishment

was 49 dB and outside the factory, it was 50 dB. Whereas, while the

industry was operating with only two extruders in operation, the noise

level outside the factory was upto 60 dB and the inspecting officer has

drawn a mahazar on the observations made.           In view of non-

compliance and the noise level crossing the standards fixed under the

Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, a notice

proposing to issue directions was issued on 04.04.2013 and the

industry was called for personal hearing on 16.04.2013, but no one for

the industry attended the personal hearing.      These facts lead the

Environmental Officer of KSPCB to believe that the industry was not

interested in complying with the directions of the Board, even though

sufficient time was granted and the industry was allowed to continue

to operate, whereby <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">Sections 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_2">26</a> of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 ('<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">Water Act</a>' for short) were also

violated. It was on such basis that the KSPCB issued directions for

closure of the industry under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_5">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act read with

Rule 34 of the Procedure Rules of KSPCB. Thus, by the impugned

order, the petitioner, operating under the new name of M/s.Devi
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   5</span>

Enterprises at No.96/A, Basappa Reddy Compound, Y.V.Annaiah

Road, Yelachenahalli, J.P.Nagar Post, Bengaluru, was directed to close

the industrial operation or process forthwith and until further orders.

Simultaneously, the Managing Director, Bengaluru Electricity Supply

Company (BESCOM) was directed to issue necessary directions to

the concerned Executive Engineer and Assistant Executive Engineer

to stop/cut-off power supply to the said industry "forthwith" and

until further orders. The Managing Director of Bengaluru Water

Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) was also directed to issue

necessary directions to the concerned Engineer not to give water

supply to the said unit forthwith and until further orders.       The

Commissioner, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) was

directed to withdraw the licence issued to the said unit forthwith and

until further orders.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2.     Before the petition could be heard on merits, after issuance of

notice on 05.11.2013, it was sought to be withdrawn, without inviting

any order by learned counsel Mr.Sabarish Gandhi.         None of the

respondents have cared, in the meantime, to file any affidavit-in-reply

or response to the petition. Upon a query being made to learned

counsel appearing on either side about implementation of the

impugned order, some shocking and surprising revelations are made
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   6</span>

by learned counsel for the respondents on instruction of the officers,

who have remained personally present in the Court. It is revealed by

Ms.Rekha .R, Environmental Officer of KSPCB that the industry of

the petitioner continued to operate for more than at least one month

after the impugned order, on account of the fact that the electricity

supply was not disconnected in terms of the order. It was revealed by

learned counsel for BESCOM, on instruction of Mr.R.Kumar,

Assistant Executive Engineer, BESCOM, that the impugned order

dated 03.07.2013 was received by BESCOM on 05.07.2013 and the

Managing Director had in fact instructed, on 17.07.2013, the Chief

Engineer to implement the order. Thereafter, the Chief Engineer

wrote a communication to the Superintendent Engineer on

24.07.2013. On 27.07.2013, the Superintendent Engineer wrote to the

Executive Engineer and the Executive Engineer in turn wrote to the

Assistant Executive Engineer on 02.08.2013 and such letter was sent

by post. Therefore, that letter dated 02.08.2013 was received by the

Assistant Electrical Engineer on 07.08.2013, which was not

immediately implemented and no reason or explanation is given

therefor. Ultimately, according to the Assistant Electrical Engineer,

one Assistant Engineer implemented the order on 22.08.2013.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    7</span>

</p><p id="p_5">3.    Learned counsel appearing for BWSSB was not informed

whether and when the Managing Director had issued any directions

not to give water supply to the petitioner and whether the water

supply was ever disconnected. The Commissioner of BBMP appears

to have issued a show-cause notice on 28.08.2013 and thereafter what

happened is not coming on record, as far as BBMP is concerned.


</p><p id="p_6">4.    It would be clear from the above record that the noise

pollution about which complaint was made in February, 2013 and

even the order to close down the industry was made on 03.07.2013, it

has not been given effect to either by the petitioner or the other

agencies despite usage of the word "forthwith" in the directions

issued to such authorities. The KSPCB, which is the body established

with the avowed objective of prevention and control of water and air

pollution and empowered with the necessary powers and saddled with

the duties to control water and air pollution, also failed in its duty of

even enforcing its own orders. Under the provisions of <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_6">Section 37</a> of

the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 ('<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air Act</a>' for

short), whoever fails to comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_9">Section 21</a> or

<a href="/doc/1038612/" id="a_10">Section 22</a> or directions issued under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">Section 31A</a>, shall, in respect of

each such failure, be punishable with imprisonment for a term which

shall not be less than one year and six months, but which may extend
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    8</span>

to six years, with fine. Cognizance of such offences could be taken

under <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_12">Section 43</a> of the Air Act, on a complaint made by the Board or

any officer authorized by it in that behalf. Similar provisions are made

in <a href="/doc/1330791/" id="a_13">Sections 41</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_14">44</a> and <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_15">49</a> of the Water Act. It was fairly conceded at

the bar that the KSPCB could have filed appropriate complaint before

the Court, but for reasons which are not disclosed, no steps were

taken to curb the delay in implementation of its own orders. Such

cases of non-enforcement of the mandatory orders are not rare and

therefore, it appears that the purpose of the stringent provisions

contained in <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_16">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and

the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_17">Air Act</a>s are defeated by the very agencies, which are

supposed to implement and enforce such orders.          It is therefore

necessary that the acts of the petitioner and the officers of the

respondents, which prima facie disclose not only dereliction of duty,

but serious criminal offences, are reported in the form of an

appropriate complaint before the Court of competent jurisdiction for

the purpose of prosecution and trial.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">5.    The right of clean environment, peaceful living, unpolluted air

and humane conditions of living are often read as part of the

fundamental right to life enshrined in the Constitution under Article

</p><p id="p_9">21. The air and noise pollution have not only attained sustained high
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      9</span>

level, but the plight of residents in the residential areas, patients in the

hospitals, children studying for their examinations and all the people

compulsorily exposed to high levels of noise and air pollution is

simply ignored even by the statutory agencies, by not preventing and

controlling such pollution. On the other hand, the other agencies,

through which the directions of the Board have to be implemented,

have openly displayed callous attitude in discharge of their duties and

even attempted to press into service their own rules of procedure and

requirements of issuing show-cause notices, while the activity

prohibited by the mandatory orders of the Board merrily continues in

flagrant violation of law, as it is found to have actually happened in

the facts of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">6.     Under the circumstances, the petition is dismissed with cost,

quantified at Rs.10,000/-, which the petitioner shall pay in equal

proportion to the respondents. Besides that, directions necessary in

the interest of justice and for ensuring the rule of law are issued to

KSPCB to file necessary complaint against all the officers concerned

of respondent Nos.2, 3 and 4, as well as the petitioner for not

implementing forthwith the impugned order dated 03.07.2013. The

Court is assured by learned counsel for KSPCB that, after following

the procedure required to be followed within the KSPCB for filing of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                    10</span>

the necessary complaint/s, the complaint shall be filed as early as may

be and preferably within a period of fifteen days, in respect of

violation of the impugned order dated 03.07.2013. In view of the

internal procedure brought in for filing of an appropriate complaint

with proper authorization of the officer, who should be the

complainant, and the decision being taken at the higher level within

the KSPCB, it is further directed that the decision taken by the Board

on the basis of this order and the copy of the complaint, if any, filed

by the KSPCB, shall be placed before this Court on 07.04.2015 and

the present matter shall be listed on that day for further orders, if any

are required.
