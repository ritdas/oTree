                        been filed by the sole petitioner seeking quashing of order dated

                        Control Board, filed a complaint against two accused as New India

                        Sugar Mills Ltd., through its Executive President and Executive Vice

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                       2</span>




the complaint petition that Sugar factory was established in the year

1934, subsequently, after constitution of the Board vide State

Government Notification No. 4796 dated 04.11.1974. The Board had

earlier given consent to the accused persons for discharging their trade

effluents and suffer for a period from 01.04.1987 to 31.03.1988 with

the condition inter alia that they are submitting a time bound

Programme for the treatment of their trade effluent by 15th of August

1987 and that analysis report of the effluent will made available to the

Board every month during crisis seasons, but, instead of nothing very

well that penal Clauses in the Act, the accused person directly did not

comply any of the aforesaid conditions, consequently order given was

cancelled and accordingly, information was given to the accused

persons vide letter dated 25.09.1987.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     4.                   In absence of consent the accused persons

discharged their trade effluent and sewage etc. and thus have

committed offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1330791/" id="a_7">Sections 41</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_8">43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_9">44</a> of the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_8">    5.                 The petitioners have come out with the case that

the treatment plant has already been starting functioning on

06.11.1989, this fact is not controverted in the counter affidavit and

during course of argument, it is also admitted that after installation of

such plant on regular basis, Board has been giving consent to the

industry.
</p>
<p id="p_9">   6.               Now it is to be seen whether this twenty two years

old proceeding should continue or not, specially under the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                        3</span>




circumstances when the period of violation was sought, no individual

has been named and the persons holding post of Executive President

and Vice President respectively are no more in the world which is also

undisputed.
</p>
<p id="p_10">   7.                  Even if the proceedings is permitted to continue

against accused no. 1 New India Sugar Mills Ltd., a juristic person for

the small period of two years, the punishment prescribed is fine

without disclosing any amount.
</p>
<p id="p_11">   8.                 My attention was drawn towards decision of this

Court by another Bench dated 25.3.2010 in Cr. Misc. No. 21109 of

2005 wherein almost similar circumstances, the proceeding has been

quashed. Taking into consideration, period lapses of twenty two years

and case remained pending without for any progress.

</p><p id="p_12">        9.           In the aforesaid case, as it appears all the accused

persons had come before this court seeking quashing of the

proceeding. But here simply the petitioner no. 1 being the Executive

President not holding said post at relevant period from 1987 to 1989

has come out. The learned counsel for the petitioner representing the

company, accused no. 1 in other cases submits that if the proceeding is

permitted to continue, it is not going to shown any effective purpose

instead of any amount may be ordered to be deposited to compensate

alleged violation of the provisions of the Act for a limited period.

Learned counsel representing the Opposite Party No. 2 also concedes

to the submission.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        10.          Taking into consideration, the nature of offence as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                               4</span>




                        prayed for and in order to expedite disposal of the cases and

                        submissions made above, this court finds that on deposit of a sum of

                        Rs. 5,000/- with District Legal Services Authority, Samastipur, the
