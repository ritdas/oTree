<p id="p_1">    1. This Original Application has been filed under <a href="/doc/175098716/" id="a_1">Section 18</a> of the National

       Green Tribunal Act, 2010 highlighting the problems arising out of running

       of marriage gardens, function halls and similar activities of holding parties

       etc. in such premises in and around the city of Bhopal resulting in pollution

       of the environment with particular reference to non-observance of the

       Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000 (in short

       referred to as MSW Rules) as well as violation of the provisions of the

       <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 (in short referred to as EP Act) and the

       Act</a>). The prayer made is for seeking a direction against the Respondents for

       strict implementation of the aforesaid statutory provisions and also

       regulating the aforesaid activity and bringing it within the jurisdiction and

       regulatory control of the Respondents as it is alleged that at present there are

       no clear-cut provisions for regulating the aforesaid activity or for issuance of

       licences for the aforesaid activity. It is submitted that such activities are

       going on throughout the city and in particular around the lakes of Bhopal

       city which often results in disposal of solid waste as well as sewerage from

       such gardens post event into the lakes in total violation of the provisions of

       the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water Act</a> as well as the MSW Rules and also the Wetlands

       (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2010 apart from other provisions.

</p><p id="p_2">   2. This Tribunal vide its order dated 23rd April, 2013 directed issuance of

       notice to all the Respondents. A Miscellaneous Application bearing number

       2/2013, was filed by the Applicant seeking interim orders restraining the

       owners of the marriage gardens from throwing waste generated in their

       premises located in the vicinity of upper lake and other lakes of Bhopal city


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Original Application No. 18/2013                                                    13</span>
        and from discharging such material without treatment and without

       permission in an unauthorised manner into the lakes in total violation of the

       laws. The Tribunal after hearing the learned counsel for the parties on 8th

       May, 2013 considered the matter and was of the opinion that since the

       enforcing agency is not the State Pollution Control Board and only the

       Municipal Corporation has the power and mechanism to enforce the

       regulatory and restraint orders, passed the following order : -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">               "............We are of the view that taking note of conduct of
               marriage halls in throwing waste into water bodies, the said
               conduct has to be put to an end in the interest of environment and
               protection of water course. However, the State Pollution Control
               Board is not the authority to carry out such directions. The
               Municipal Corporation has to do so. There shall be an order of
               interim     injunction    against    the     Respondent/Marriage
               Gardens/Barat Grihs from throwing any waste generated on their
               premises in the upper lake and other lakes and discharge any
               waste material into the lake. The Respondent No. 2/Bhopal
               Municipal Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the BMC) shall
               ensure the implementation of this order without fail".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">   3. On 23rd July, 2013, the learned counsel for the Applicant brought to the

       notice of the Tribunal that the interim order of injunction dated 8 th May,

       2013 quoted hereinabove, was being violated and the owners/management

       of the marriage gardens were still discharging the solid waste into the lakes.

       Though it was contended by the learned counsel for the BMC denying the

       aforesaid allegations based upon the reply submitted by it on 22nd July, 2013

       however the Tribunal felt that the reply of the BMC was not satisfactory and

       accordingly considered the matter to be of serious concern and vide its order

       dated 23rd July, 2013 thought it fit to direct for an inspection of the lake

       areas by a Committee consisting of the Member Secretary, Madhya Pradesh

       State Pollution Control Board (in short referred to as MPPCB) as Chairman

       along with Additional Commissioner, BMC and Deputy Director, Town &amp;

       Country Planning Department. The Tribunal also directed the Respondent

       Nos. 1 &amp; 3 to file a detailed report on the next date of hearing as to how
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Original Application No. 18/2013                                                    14</span>
        many such marriage gardens had been given permission and authorization

       and also whether any permissions for construction of structures have been

       given, if not, how many such marriage gardens had raised constructions

       without authorization and permission, in which event what action had been

       initiated against them in the past. On 23rd August, 2013, the report of the

       inspection carried out on 16th August, 2013 by the Committee as constituted

       by the Tribunal under its order dated 23rd July, 2013 was submitted. Some

       of the important observations found during the inspection as mentioned in

       the report are as follows : -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">               "a. The team inspected 24 marriage gardens/shadi halls as per
               the detailed format enclosed as Annexure-III, however during the
               inspection all the marriage gardens were not functional due to off
               season for marriages.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">               b.     Out of 24 marriage gardens/shadi halls, 2 located at
               Phatehgarh near Sadar Mazil, 02 at Khanugaon, 2 at Ahmdabad
               Palace, 3 at VIP road and 9 at Lalpur, Bhopal may be classified as
               critical for the reason of possibility of direct discharge of effluent
               into the lake water.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">               c.     The location of kitchen of these shadi halls was at the back
               yard where unhygienic conditions were observed. It was found that
               there is no regular lifting of kitchen waste even sewer lines of 3
               marriage gardens were found almost chocked. Lifting of
               MSW/plastic waste needs a proper system to segregate, collect and
               dispose of the same in environmentally safe manner.
               d.     Water samples of upper lake and nearby Nallahs were drawn
               and analyzed as shown in the attached sheet at Annexure-IV.
               e.     As per general observation, the kitchen of the marriage
               gardens were located at the back yard close to the upper lake and
               making all possibilities of discharge of domestic effluent by
               bypassing the existing arrangements of sewer connection.
               f.     The hygienic conditions of kitchens were not good. The
               kitchen waste and municipal solid waste was lying in the premises.
               The existing sewer lines were chocked.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">               g.     No marriage garden/shadi hall has so far obtained consent
               from MPPCB under Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
               1974 and Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and
               Authorization for DG-Set under Hazardous Waste (Management

</blockquote><p id="p_4">   4. Apart from recording the above specific observations in the inspection note

       it was submitted in the course of hearing that the aforesaid 24 marriage

       gardens were found to be polluting and violating the provisions of law to

        whom show-cause notices had also been issued to show-cause why action

       should not be taken against them.
</p>
<p id="p_5">   5. Some of the Respondents filed their reply and raised objections against the

       aforesaid inspection report. The objections were filed in the form of MA

       No. 71/2013 wherein inter alia the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the matter

       was also contested. It was also submitted that the Additional Commissioner

       who was a Member of the Inspection Committee was not present and

       appointed his representative who alone attended the inspection. It was also

       submitted that no prior notice was given to the owners of the management of

       the marriage gardens before carrying out the inspection. It was also stated

       that the Committee exceeded its jurisdiction by taking into consideration the

       problems as a result of there being no parking area which has no bearing

       with regard to the environmental issues. It was also alleged that the issues

       with regard to running of Diesel Generator sets (in short DG sets) was also

       beyond the scope of the Original Application and disposal of leftover food

       cannot in any manner be considered as hazardous waste so as to bring the

       matter within the purview of the Tribunal under the NGT Act of 2010. The

       aforesaid miscellaneous application was proposed to be disposed of while

       deciding this Original Application.
</p>
<p id="p_6">   6. On the other hand, the Applicant moved a miscellaneous application bearing

       No. 58/2013 with the prayer that since the inspection of only a limited

       number of marriage gardens had been carried out by the Committee,

       inspection should have also been carried out of remaining such premises in

       the city of Bhopal. It was also prayed that the BMC should be directed to

       submit a final report of such premises located zone-wise in the respective

       zones of BMC. It was also prayed that the Respondent Nos. 1 &amp; 3/State of

       Madhya Pradesh and the District Collector, Bhopal be directed to furnish a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Original Application No. 18/2013                                                 16</span>
        list of names of owners of such marriage gardens who are carrying on the

       aforesaid activity with or without permission/authorization of the Town &amp;

       Country Planning Department and should also provide the aforesaid

       information.
</p>
<p id="p_7">   7. Both the aforesaid M.As i.e. M.A. Nos. 58/2013 filed by the Applicant and

       M.A. No. 71/2013 filed by the Respondents, are now disposed of in the light

       of the developments that occurred during the further course of hearing

       before the Tribunal. On 20th September, 2013, a direction was issued to the

       BMC to place before the Tribunal the Rules/Byelaws which govern such

       activity and issuance of licenses/authorizations in the city of Bhopal and

       whether prior to such licenses/authorization, environmental issues were also

       taken into consideration particularly with reference to the disposal of solid

       waste, discharge of sewerage, checking of noise pollution and air pollution

       levels which are likely to be caused as a result of the use of DG sets for

       electrification and decoration in the premises of marriage gardens, traffic

       congestion on the roads due to non-availability of parking space within the

       premises resulting in traffic jams and consequential air pollution.

</p><p id="p_8">   8. Learned counsel for the BMC was also directed to inform the Tribunal what

       measures are put in place for disposal of solid waste post event from such

       premises. On the next date of hearing i.e. on 25 th September, 2013 learned

       counsel for the State of Madhya Pradesh Shri Sachin Verma submitted that

       the aforesaid activity with regard to running of marriage gardens is being

       dealt with and being carried out in terms of licenses issued to the owners of

       such premises under the provisions of the Town &amp; Country Planning statutes

       and the Municipal Bye-laws and it was submitted that in the conditions of

       granting the licenses, provision with regard to prevention of pollution finds

       place at condition No. 12. Condition with regard to providing mandatory


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Original Application No. 18/2013                                                 17</span>
        parking area also finds place so also regarding maintenance of green-belt

       and planting of trees. Provisions with regard to disposal of sewage have also

       been incorporated and that no sewerage or solid waste shall be discharged

       into the lakes by way of condition No. 25. It was submitted that the breach

       of any of these conditions results in revocation of the licence.        It was

       however conceded that most of the marriage gardens premises are running

       without obtaining any permission.
</p>
<p id="p_9">   9. Learned counsel for the Respondents, on the other hand, submitted that there

       are no specific Bye-laws regulating the aforesaid business of running

       marriage gardens within the municipal areas and that the permission of the

       Town &amp; Country Planning Department referred to by the learned counsel for

       the State, does not specifically mention running of marriage gardens but

       only refers to Resorts and Health Clubs and therefore it is not obligatory on

       their part to take such permission and licences and generally this lacunae is

       taken as shelter by most of the owners of such premises.

</p><p id="p_10">   10.The Tribunal, therefore, considered the matter from the point of

       environmental issues relating to water, air and noise pollution and directed

       that the Pollution Control Board shall take effective steps with the assistance

       of the District Administration and Police Authorities for enforcement of the

       existing provisions as may be applicable in the case of air, water and noise

       pollution respectively for prevention of the same and launch prosecutions

       against the defaulters wherever necessary. It was, however, felt that it was

       necessary looking to the increased number of such marriage gardens and

       similar activities within the city of Bhopal, that effective measures in the

       form of regulatory provisions be enacted by way of Bye-laws under the M.P.

       Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 for regulating the aforesaid activities




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Original Application No. 18/2013                                                   18</span>
        wherein provisions with regard to the environmental issues be also kept in

       mind.
</p>
<p id="p_11">   11. On subsequent date, the learned counsels for the State and the BMC

       informed the Tribunal that on the suggestion of the Tribunal, draft

       rules/Bye-laws are under preparation. Such draft rules were also placed for

       the perusal of the Tribunal to which several suggestions were made by the

       learned counsels appearing for the Respondents. In view of the above, on

       the suggestion of the Tribunal learned counsel for the State submitted that all

       the concerned stakeholders and persons interested would be invited for a

       meeting for discussing the aforesaid issues which would be convened on 6th

       November, 2013 in the conference hall of the Town &amp; Country Planning

       Department. It was also submitted that all those who are interested may

       attend the meeting to give their suggestions, both oral and written.

       Accordingly the said meeting was held wherein various persons gave their

       suggestions and in pursuance of the same draft rules were prepared and sent

       to the Government of Madhya Pradesh for approval in accordance with the

       provisions of the Municipal Corporation Act, 1956. Learned counsel for the

       State also brought to our notice that the Hon'ble High Court of Madhya

       Pradesh, Indore Bench had also issued certain directions in a writ petition

       decided by it for framing of rules with regard to running of marriage gardens

       in Ujjain city and had also in its judgment given certain directions in this

       behalf. It was further submitted before us that both the draft rules as well as

       the directions given by the Hon'ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh with

       regard to the aforesaid issue of regulating the business of running marriage

       gardens and grant of permissions was under active consideration of the State

       Government.

        of the counsel for the Respondent Nos. 9, 11, 12, 13 &amp; 15 to name a few and

       as such the Respondents were fully aware about the order having been

       passed for causing the inspection and submission of the report by the next

       date i.e. 23rd August, 2013. Thus, the Respondents cannot be heard to say

       that there was no prior intimation or notice given to them for conducting the

       inspection.     There is no merit in the aforesaid objection and the same

       accordingly deserves to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_15">   14.The objection with regard to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in dealing with

       the aforesaid question of regulating the activity of running of the business of

       the marriage gardens is concerned, we have confined ourselves to the issue

       with regard to the water, air and noise pollution in terms of the provisions of

       the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">Water Act</a>, 1974, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_12">Air Act</a>, 1981 and the EP Act and Rules, 1986 with

       special reference to the provisions contained in the rules with regard to the

       operation of DG sets and compliance of noise levels and ambient air quality

       standards as a result of running of such DG sets and the traffic congestion

       that is caused due to non-availability of sufficient parking space which

       results in air pollution from vehicular traffic and use of amplifiers and

       loudspeakers causing noise pollution. The submission of the Respondents in

       the aforesaid application that leftover food cannot be treated as hazardous

       waste is also without substance. The leftover food due to various reasons

       attracts vermin, gets infected with bacteria etc. which is liable to cause

       harm to humans as well as other living creatures and even the environment

       by spreading harmful diseases. If they are left untreated or not disposed of

       in a proper manner, such leftover food would definitely cause damage to the

       environment in the surroundings. It cannot be denied that discharge of

       such     waste into the     water   bodies   without   proper   treatment   of

        solid waste and sewerage results in pollution of the water and violates the

       provisions of the EP Act, 1986 along with its Rules and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_13">Water Act</a>, 1974.

</p><p id="p_16">   15. We, therefore, dismiss M.A. No. 71/2013 filed by the Respondents as being

       without merit and hold that this Tribunal has the jurisdiction in the facts and

       circumstances to deal with the aforesaid issues raised in this petition.

</p><p id="p_17">   16. With regard to M.A. No. 58/2013 filed by the Applicant which also

       remained pending regarding giving directions to the Respondents for

       carrying out the inspection of all the remaining marriage gardens in the city

       of Bhopal and to submit a final zonewise inspection report as also directing

       the Respondents to submit a report with regard to such marriage gardens

       giving a list of the same which may be under operation with or without valid

       licenses is concerned, it has already been stated by the learned counsel for

       the State that there are no specific rules or Bye-laws covering the aforesaid

       field as was stated before us on 25th September, 2013 and accordingly on the

       suggestion of the Tribunal the State has undertaken the exercise for framing

       the draft rules and the matter is pending before the State Government for

       consideration. Also necessary directions have already been issued by the

       Hon'ble High Court in the decision rendered on 14th November, 2013 in the

       case of Dheerendra Jain &amp; Ors. Vs. State of M.P. &amp; Ors.(supra).

</p><p id="p_18">   17.As far as the question of conducting regular inspection of such marriage

       gardens is concerned, it is expected that the State Pollution Control Board

       through its Regional Office will carry out such inspection wherever they find

       that provisions of the Air, Water and EP Act and notifications/rules issued

       thereunder, are being violated. In the light of the order, we find that no

       direction on the aforesaid is required to be issued separately and thus M.A.

       No. 58/2013 also stands disposed of. However, it is made clear that any

       interested person may submit a complaint to the Regional Officer of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">Original Application No. 18/2013                                                   22</span>
        Pollution Control Board or the Bhopal Municipal Corporation if there is any

       violation of the rules or conditions of the licence and the said authority shall

       within 24 hours of receipt of such complaint, carry out an inspection and

       take necessary action in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_19">   18. There is however one more issue which was brought to the notice of this

       Tribunal with regard to the non-compliance of the notice issued based on the

       inspection report, by the management of 24 marriage gardens and running

       the aforesaid marriage gardens in violation of the provisions of Air and

       <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_14">Water Act</a>s. So far as the aforesaid matter is concerned as was observed by

       the Tribunal in its order of 23rd August, 2013, that the concerned officer of

       Pollution Control Board, Regional Office, Bhopal after going through the

       report and the observations made thereunder shall proceed to give show-

       cause notices or if already issued shall conclude the matter to its logical end

       by taking suitable action against the defaulters. As we have already

       mentioned, it is the duty of all the Regional Officers of the State Pollution

       Control Board to carry out such inspections regularly and take action in

       accordance with law whenever such non-observance or violence of

       provisions of the Air, Water and EP Acts is found including imposing

       penalties, prosecution or closure of the establisher's unit. We have also been

       informed that such notices have been issued by Bhopal Municipal

       Corporation and in some cases replies have also been filed. We direct that

       the pending matters shall be decided latest by 10 th June, 2014 and

       compliance reported to this Tribunal.

<p id="p_20">   19.Shri Sachin Verma, learned Standing Counsel for the State has informed us

       that as soon as the draft rules are prepared and approved by the State

       Government, they shall be brought onto the Statute Book for

       implementation. He submits that the delay is only due to the ongoing

       enforce the provisions of the Water, Air and EP Act and various

       notifications issued thereunder with regard to the air, water and noise

       pollution as well as maintenance of National Ambient Air Quality Standards

       in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_22">   21.It is directed that while the owners/Managers of the Marriage/Party gardens

       and function halls shall comply with the provisions of the MSW Rules, 2000

       however it is often seen that use of plastic and disposal plates/tumblers and

       containers/bottles is resorted to by the organisers of such functions and the

       caterers and service providers. Case must be taken by the owners of such

       premises to ensure that such plastic waste is not mixed with other solid

       waste and the municipal authorities shall ensure that such plastic waste is

       disposed of separately in accordance with the provision of the Plastic Waste

       (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011 and more particularly rule 6

       thereof which deals with the responsibility of the municipal authorities in

       this behalf for (i) safe collection (ii) storage (iii) segregation (iv)

       transportation (v) processing and (vi) disposal of plastic waste and further

       ensuring that no damage is caused to the environment during this process.

       Thus while granting licences and permissions the Pollution Control Board

       and Municipal Authorities shall give necessary and Municipal Authorities

       shall give necessary guidelines in this regard and create necessary

       infrastructure for this purpose and if necessary, impose fee on the licencees.
