                           ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">        This petition is filed by the petitioner-plaintiff

requesting the Court to set-aside the order dated

26.09.2015 passed on I.A.NO.1 filed under Order XXXIX

Rule 1 and 2 of CPC in O.S.NO.712/2015 on the file of

III Addl. Civil Judge and JMFC, Tumakuru, produced as

per Annexure-A, and also the order dated 29.10.2015

passed in M.A.No.55/2015 on the file of II Addl. Senior

Civil Judge &amp; JMFC, Tumakuru, which is produced at

</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">        2.     Petitioner-plaintiff has filed the suit against

the respondents herein for the relief of permanent

injunction restraining the defendants, their agents,

servants or anybody acting under them from interfering

with the smooth running of the jelly crusher by the

plaintiff over the suit schedule property.        The plaint

schedule property is bearing Sy.No.30/3 measruing 2

acres        consisting of Jelly/Stone crusher situated at

Gerahally Village, Kora Hobli, Tumkur Taluk, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                4</span>



boundaries are also mentioned in the schedule. Along

with the plaint, plaintiff has also filed application

I.A.NO.1 under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of CPC

requesting the Court to grant ad-interim temporary

injunction order restraining the respondents and their

agents, servants or anybody acting under them from

interfering with the smooth running the jelly crusher by

the plaintiff over the suit schedule property.           Said

application was objected by the respondents by filing

the   objection   statement.       The   Trial   Court   after

considering the merits of the case, ultimately, rejected

the said application filed seeking temporary injunction.

Being aggrieved by the said order of rejection of the

application I.A.No.1 by the Trial Court, petitioner-

plaintiff has preferred an appeal before the appeal Court

in M.A.No.55/2015.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      The appeal Court also, after hearing the matter,

dismissed the appeal imposing the cost of Rs.1,000/-

and confirmed the order passed by the Trial Court.

Being aggrieved by the orders passed by the Trial Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              5</span>



as well as the appeal Court, petitioner is before this

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">     3.    Heard the arguments of the learned senior

counsel   appearing   for    the   petitioner-plaintiff,   the

arguments of the learned senior counsel appearing for

respondent No.1 and also the learned counsel appearing

for respondent Nos.2 to 8.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">     4.    Learned senior counsel for the petitioner-

plaintiff during the course of his arguments has

submitted that, plaintiff to run the stone crusher unit

has taken the consent and permission from the

competent authorities under the relevant provisions of

the Acts, and the said authorities, before granting such

permission to the said area, wherein the stone crushing

unit is to be carried on is considered as it comes under

the safer zone.   Even the Pollution Control Board has

also given its consent for carrying on the said unit. He

has submitted that initially the said consent was given
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              6</span>



by the Pollution Control Board was upto 30.06.2015,

but   subsequently,    the   same       was   renewed   upto

30.06.2016.    He has further submitted that the Trial

Court wrongly read the documents produced by the

petitioner and it has not all looked the consent renewed

by the Pollution Control Board and it has lost sight of

the said document.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">      5.    With    regard   to   the     other   documents

produced in the case and the observations made by the

Trial Court in its order that there are complaints by the

neighbours, school authorities, that there is noise and

the houses nearby the said area were having cracks in

the walls and the petitioner is using the explosives is

concerned, learned senior counsel has submitted that

the documents produced in the case shows that it is not

in respect of Sy.No.30/3 in which the stone crushing

unit is carrying on by the petitioner-plaintiff, but it is in

respect of Sy.No.31, which is not the subject matter of

the suit; hence, he has submitted that even with regard
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              7</span>



to this said aspect also Trial Court has wrongly

observed that there are so many complaints in respect

of carrying the stone crushing unit.      Learned senior

counsel for the petitioner has further submitted that

when there is a licence and the permission under the

relevant Acts, unless and until those permission and

licences were cancelled or revoked by the competent

authorities, petitioner is having every right to carry on

the said stone crushing unit.     He has also submitted

that if the other side is aggrieved, there is a provision

under the relevant Act to approach the authorities by

filing the appeal, which they have not invoked in this

case.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">        6.   Learned senior counsel for the petitioner has

further submitted that the public approached this Court

by filing the Public Interest Litigation making the

complaint about carrying the stone crushing unit in the

said area; the Division Bench of this Court, after

hearing the said Public Interest Litigation, disposed of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  8</span>



the same giving a direction to the petitioners therein to

approach the appropriate authorities in the matter.

Being    unsuccessful       in   the   said      Public   Interest

Litigation,    the   same   public     started    to   make   the

complaints only with a malafide intention to stall the

stone crushing activities carried on by the petitioner-

plaintiff.    It is further submitted that, even though all

these material aspects were brought to the notice of the

Trial Court, the Trial Court has not considered all these

aspects of the matter and wrongly read the documents

and wrongly interpreted about the factual aspects and

passed an illegal order.         He has also submitted that

when an appeal was preferred before the appellate

Court, the appellate Court also without appreciating the

materials placed on record and without examining

whether that in view of the facts and circumstances of

the case and production of the materials before the Trial

Court, the order passed by the Trial Court is legal or

not, but the appellate Court just endorsed its view to

that of the views taken by the Trial Court.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               9</span>



</p><p id="p_13">      7.       So far as concurrent findings of the Courts

below is concerned, learned senior counsel for the

petitioner has submitted that it is not that when there

are concurrent findings, this Court has no jurisdiction

to interfere into the said orders and if the petitioner is

able to show to the Court that there is material

irregularity    and   the   relevant   materials   were   not

considered by the Courts below, this Court can very well

interfere into the findings of the Courts below, even

though there are concurrent findings. In this regard, he

has relied upon the decision reported in (1997) 5 SCC

76 in the case of <a href="/doc/607991/" id="a_2">Achutananda Baidya vs. Prafullya

Kumar Gayen and others</a> and draw the attention of

this Court to paragraph Nos.9 and 11 of the said

decision.      Learned senior counsel has also submitted

that regarding the jurisdiction of the Courts are

concerned, the Court has to appreciate whether the

entire materials were considered by the Courts below or

not and in this regard, he has relied upon the decision

reported in AIR 1996 SC 906(1) in the case of <a href="/doc/1783573/" id="a_3">State of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                10</span>



Kerala     vs.    M.K.Kunhikannan            Nambair       Manjeri

Manikoth, Naduvil</a> (dead) and others. He has further

submitted that when there is patent illegality committed

by the Courts below, this Court has every right to

interfere into such findings also, to do justice to the

parties. Hence, he has submitted to allow the petition

and to set-aside the impugned orders passed by the

Trial Court as well as the appeal Court and to allow the

application I.A.No.1 filed before the Trial Court seeking

injunction as against the respondents herein.



</p><p id="p_14">      8.    Per    contra,    learned       senior   counsel    for

respondent No.1 during the course of his arguments

has   submitted     that     the    Trial   Court    has    rightly

appreciated the materials placed on record and rejected

the injunction application and hence, no illegality has

been committed by the Trial Court. It is no doubt true,

when the consent order given by the Pollution Control

Board initially, it was upto 31.06.2015 and it was the

decision of the Board, but the renewal of the said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                             11</span>



consent, which is relied upon by the petitioner is not by

the Pollution Control Board and it is only by an Officer

of the said Board. Therefore, it cannot be considered as

the consent in the eye of law. Hence, the Trial Court is

justified in ignoring the said document i.e., the renewal

of consent by the Pollution Control Board.



</p><p id="p_15">     9.    Learned senior counsel for respondent No1.

has further submitted that when the entire materials

was appreciated by the Trial Court and the injunction

application was rejected, which was confirmed by the

appellate Court, this Court i.e., in the writ jurisdiction,

cannot interfere into the said orders of the Courts

below, though such orders may be right or wrong. The

writ Courts are having limited jurisdiction and in this

connection, learned senior counsel has relied upon the

decision reported in AIR 1973 SC 76 in the case of The

Managing Director (MIG) Hindustand Aeronautics

Ltd., Balanagar, Hyderbad and another vs. Ajit

Prasad Tarway, Manager (Purchase and Stores)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                             12</span>



Hindustand Aeronautics Ltd. Balanagar, Hyderbad,

and the relevant paragraph No.5, AIR 1971 SC 2324 in

the case of M/s.D.L.F.Housing and Construction Co.(P)

Ltd. Vs. Sarup Singh and others relevant paragraph

No.8 and another decision of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court rendered in Civil Appeal No.678 of 2013 (arising

out of SLP (Civil) 31559 of 2012) and the relevant

paragraphs are 14 and 15.        Hence, he has submitted

that this Court cannot interfere into the orders passed

by the Courts below. He has also submitted petitioner

has not made out a case even on merits also to interfere

into the orders passed by the Courts below.       Hence,

submitted to reject the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">     10.   Learned counsel for respondent Nos.2 to 8</span>

during the course of his arguments has submitted that

with regard to the contention of the other side regarding

the permission and licence granted by the statutory

authorities cannot be set-aside by the Civil Court and

Civil Court has no jurisdiction and there is a Bar to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                               13</span>



entertain the same, he has submitted that it is not the

correct    position   and   the    Civil   Court   is   having

jurisdiction to cross-examine whether the permissions

and licences granted by the statutory authorities are in

accordance with the mandatory provisions of the

relevant Act or not.    In this connection, he has relied

upon the decision reported in AIR 1971 SC 71 in the

case      of   Sree    Raja        Kandregula      Srinivasa

Jagannadharao Panthulu Bahadur Guru (dead) by

his legal representatives vs. The State of A.P. and

others and the relevant paragraph No.7. Hence, he has

submitted that licences and permissions granted by the

Pollution Control Board and also the Authority under

the Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers Act 2011,

are not at all as per the requirements of the conditions

laid down in the said enactments.          Therefore, he has

submitted that these aspects were properly appreciated

and considered by the Courts below and hence, no

illegality has been committed by the Courts below in

coming to such conclusion. He has also submitted that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                             14</span>



there are concurrent findings by the Courts below. The

petitioner has not made out a case to interfere into the

orders passed by the Courts below and submitted to

dismiss the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">     11.    I have perused the grounds urged in the

petition, order passed by the Trial Court rejecting the

injunction application, the judgment and order passed

by the appellate Court, so also perused the pleadings of

the parties i.e., copy of the plaint as well as the written

statement, application I.A.No.1 filed before the Trial

Court along with the supporting affidavit and the

objections filed by respondents-defendants.



</p><p id="p_19">     12.    I have also perused the materials produced

in the     case. Petitioner-plaintiff has produced the

document i.e., the proceeding of the Karnataka State

Pollution Control Board, which is produced at page

No.181, and in the document produced at page No.183

it is mentioned that the consent is valid for the period
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                            15</span>



upto 30.06.2015 only.     The Trial Court taking into

consideration the said document i.e., proceeding of the

Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, interpreted in

its order that it was for the period upto 30.06.2015 only

and the    petitioner-plaintiff has not produced the

document to show the extension or renewal of the

consent by the said Board and which is also one of the

reason for the Trial Court for rejecting the injunction

application.   But perusing the document produced at

page No.184, which is dated 29.06.2015, which is styled

as "Consent for discharge of Emissions under the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, at the

bottom, it is mentioned that consent is granted for the

period upto 30.06.2016. The said document is signed

by the Environmental Officer, KSPCB, RO: Tumkur, for

and on behalf of the KSPCB. The Trial Court has not

looked into the said document and has lost sight of the

same while considering the case of the petitioner.

Though it is the contention of the respondents herein

that the consent of renewal is not from the Board and it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                            16</span>



is only from the Environmental Officer and hence, it

cannot be construed as the renewal of consent, but it is

not the observation by the Trial Court in its order that

the said document is not from the Pollution Control

Board and it is only from the Environmental Officer,

therefore, it is not going to accept the said document as

renewal of consent from the Pollution Control Board.

Hence, as I have already observed above, the said

document was not looked into by the Trial Court and it

snatched the attention of the Trial Court while passing

the order.
</p>
<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">     13.     So far as the contention of the learned

counsel for the petitioner that some of the documents,

which goes to the very root of the matter and on which

the entire case of the petitioner is depends, were not

looked into by the Trial Court and it proceeded to pass a

wrong order is concerned, with regard to the said

document that whether it is a valid document or not, it

is for the Trial Court to come to the right conclusion
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                  17</span>



during the course of trial, after recording the evidence of

both    sides,     but   while   dealing    with    the    interim

application, which are in the nature of aid to the main

relief claimed in the suit, the Court has to prima-facie

see the document and not supposed to conduct a mini-

trial at that stage to ascertain whether the said

document is a valid document or not.
</p>
<p id="p_22">

</p><p id="p_23">       14.    With regard to the other aspect i.e., the

complaints made by the public, so also the resolutions

passed by the Panchayat, I have perused the document

i.e., resolution passed by the Panchayat and also the

complaint made by the public in respect of carrying-on

the stone crushing unit by the petitioner.                Perusing

these documents, again the Trial Court has committed

serious error while appreciating the said documents

also, as the said documents are in respect of Sy.No.31,

whereas, the suit schedule property is bearing No.30/3,

wherein      the   petitioner-plaintiff    claims   that    he   is

carrying the stone crushing unit. Therefore, even with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                            18</span>



regard to this document, which is produced at page

No.277, the endorsement issued from the office of the

Deputy Director of Mines and Geology Department,

Gandinagar, Tumakuru, which is dated 27.04.2015, the

Trial Court has taken this document into consideration

and observed in its order that there are complaints from

the public at large in respect of carrying-on the stone

crushing unit by the petitioner-plaintiff and hence, the

serious objections are also one of the reason for the

Trial Court to reject the injunction application. I have

perused the said document, as I have already observed

above, the said document is pertaining to Sy.No.31 and

it is not pertaining to Sy.No.30/3. Therefore, even with

regard to this document also, the Trial Court has

misdirected itself to hold that the complaints from the

public are also pertaining to the suit schedule property,

which was also one of the reason for the Trial Court to

reject the injunction application.    The persons, who

have filed the said complaints, have also approached

this Court by filing the Public Interest Litigation in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                19</span>



W.P.NO.30447/2015(GM-MM-S-PIL). The first petitioner

is mentioned as Sri Anjaneyaswamy Yuvaka Raita

Sangha (R), if perused the endorsement document,

which is produced at page No.277, as I have already

made a reference above, the said endorsement was

addressed to Sri Rangaswamaiah Kunchagi, President of

Sri Anjaneyaswamy Yuvaka Raita Sangha.              Therefore,

learned counsel for the petitioner-plaintiff is justified in

submitting that as the said Sri Anjaneyaswamy Yuvaka

Raita Sangha was not succeeded in getting the orders in

the Public Interest Litigation, made such complaint

before the authorities. The documents produced by the

plaintiff also shows that the permission was granted by

the office of Deputy Commissioner, Tumakuru, holding

that the said stone crushing unit carried-on by the

petitioner-plaintiff   comes        under   the   safer   zone.

Therefore,    before   issuing       such   permission,    the

authorities    have    already       examined     about    the

consequences of giving the permission to carry-on such

stone crushing unit in the said area and at that time, it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                               20</span>



was their opinion that it comes under safer zone, hence,

there are no hurdles for issuing consent to carry-on the

said unit.
</p>
<p id="p_24">

</p><p id="p_25">     15.     The   factual   aspects   clearly   shows   that

permissions were granted by the competent authorities

to carry on the said unit under the Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and also under the

Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers Act, 2011 and

those licences and permissions are still in existence and

they were not cancelled or revoked by the said

authorities.   Therefore, as submitted by the learned

counsel for the petitioner-plaintiff, unless and until

those licences and permissions granted by the licencing

authorities and the other competent authorities, were

cancelled, the petitioner has got every right to carry-on

his stone crushing unit. Hence, these aspects were also

not properly appreciated by the Courts below.

</p><p id="p_26">     16.   With regard to the concurrent findings by

the Courts below, I have perused the decisions relied

upon by the learned senior counsel for respondent No.1,

which are referred above.
</p>
<p id="p_27">     In the decision reported in AIR 1971 SC 2324 in

the case of M/s.D.L.F.Housing and Construction Co.(P)

Ltd. Vs. Sarup Singh and others, paragraph No.8 of

the said decision, reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            8. The position thus seems be firmly
     established that while exercising the
     jurisdiction under section 115, it is not
     competent to the High Court to correct
     errors of fact however gross or even errors of
     law unless the said errors have relation to
     the jurisdiction of the Court to try the
     dispute itself. Clauses (a) and (b) of this
     section on their plain reading quite clearly
     do not cover the present case. It was not
     contended, as indeed it was not possible to
     contend, that the learned Additional district
     Judge had either exercised a jurisdiction not
     vested in him by law or had failed to exercise
     a jurisdiction so vested in him, in recording
     the order that the proceedings under
     reference be stayed till the decision of the
     appeal by the High court in the proceedings
     for specific performance of the agreement in
     question. Clause (c) also does not seem to
     apply to the case in hand. The words
     "illegally" and "with material irregularity" as
     used in this clause do not cover either errors
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                              22</span>



      of fact or of law they do not refer to the
      decision arrived at but merely to the manner
      in which it is reached. The errors
      contemplated by this clause may, in our
      view, relate either to breach of some
      provision of law or to material defects of
      procedure affecting the ultimate decision,
      and not to errors either of fact or of law, after
      the prescribed formalities have been
      complied with. The High Court does not
      seem to have adverted to the limitation
      imposed on its power under S. 115 of the
      Code. Merely because the High Court would
      have felt inclined, had it dealt with the
      matter initially, to come to a different
      conclusion on the question of continuing
      stay of the reference proceeding pending
      decision of the appeal, could hardly justify
      interference on revision under S. 115 of the
      Code when there was no illegality or material
      irregularity committed by the learned
      Additional District Judge in his manner of
      dealing with this question. It seems to us
      that in this matter the High Court treated
      the revision virtually as if it was an appeal.</blockquote><p id="p_29">

as the same which had been evolved by this
Court in Dorab Cawasji Warden Vs. Coomi
Sorab Warden and Others has come to be
firmly embedded in our jurisprudence. Paras
16 and 17 of the judgment in Dorab
Cawasji Warden (supra), extracted below,
may be usefully remembered in this regard:

</p><p id="p_35">        "16. The relief of interlocutory
  mandatory     injunctions    are   thus
  granted generally to preserve or restore
  the status quo of the last non-
</p><p id="p_36">  contested status which preceded the
  pending controversy until the final
  hearing when full relief may be granted
  or to compel the undoing of those acts
  that have been illegally done or the
  restoration   of   that    which    was
  wrongfully taken from the party
  complaining. But since the granting of
  such an injunction to a party who fails
  or would fail to establish his right at
  the trail may cause great injustice or
  irreparable harm to the party against
  whom it was granted or alternatively
  not granting of it to a party who
  succeeds or would succeed may
  equally cause great injustice or
  irreparable harm, courts have evolved
  certain guidelines. Generally stated
  these guidelines are:
</p>
<p id="p_37">        (1)      The plaintiff has a strong
  case for trial. That is, it shall be of a
  higher standard than a prima facie
  case that is normally required for a
  prohibitory injunction.
</p><pre id="pre_2">        (2)      It is necessary to prevent
  irreparable or serious injury which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                       25</span>



  normally cannot be compensated in
  terms of money.
       (3)      The     balance    of
  convenience is in favour of the one
  seeking such relief.

</pre><p id="p_38"> 17. Being essentially an equitable relief the
grant or refusal of an interlocutory
mandatory injunction shall ultimately rest in
the sound judicial discretion of the court to
be exercised in the light of the facts and
circumstances in each case. Though the
above guidelines are neither exhaustive nor
complete or absolute rules, and there may be
exceptional circumstances needing action,
applying them as prerequisite for the grant
or refusal of such injunctions would be a
sound exercise of a judicial discretion."

</p><p id="p_39">      15. In a situation where the learned
Trial Court on a consideration of the
respective cases of the parties and the
documents laid before it was of the view that
the entitlement of the plaintiffs to an order of
interim mandatory injunction was in serious
doubt, the Appellate Court could not have
interfered with the exercise of discretion by
the learned Trial Judge unless such exercise
was found to be palpably incorrect or
untenable. The reasons that weighed with
the learned Trial Judge, as already noticed,
according to us, do not indicate that the view
taken is not a possible view. The Appellate
Court,     therefore,    should     not    have
substituted its views in the matter merely on
the ground that in its opinion the facts of the
case call for a different conclusion. Such an
exercise is not the correct parameter for
exercise of jurisdiction while hearing an
appeal against a discretionary order. While
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                      26</span>



we must not be understood to have said that
the Appellate Court was wrong in its
conclusions what is sought to be emphasized
is that as long as the view of the Trial Court
was a possible view the Appellate Court
should not have interfered with the same
following the virtually settled principles of
law in this regard as laid down by this Court
in <a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_8">Wander Ltd. v. Antox India (P) Ltd. Para</a>
14 of the aforesaid judgment which is
extracted below would amply sum up the
situation:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "14. The appeals before the Division
    Bench were against the exercise of
    discretion by the Single Judge. In such
    appeals, the appellate court will not
    interfere with the exercise of discretion
    of the court of first instance and
    substitute its own discretion except
    where the discretion has been shown
    to have been exercised arbitrarily, or
    capriciously or perversely or where the
    court had ignored the settled principles
    of law regulating grant or refusal of
    interlocutory injunctions. An appeal
    against exercise of discretion is said to
    be an appeal on principle. Appellate
    Court will not reassess the material
    and seek to reach a conclusion
    different from the one reached by the
    court below if the one reached by that
    Court was reasonably possible on the
    material. The appellate court would
    normally not be justified in interfering
    with the exercise of discretion under
    appeal solely on the ground that if it
    had considered the matter at the trial
    stage it would have come to a contrary
    conclusion. If the discretion has been
    exercised by the trial court reasonably
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                              27</span>



         and in a judicial manner the fact that
         the appellate court would have taken a
         different   view    may     not    justify
         interference with the trial court's
         exercise of discretion. After referring to
         these principles Gajendragadkar, J. in
         <a href="/doc/1652410/" id="a_9">Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd. v. Pothan
         Joseph</a>: (SCR 721)
            "... These principles are well
         established, but as has been observed
         by viscount Simon in Charles Osenton
         &amp; Co. v. Jhanaton '...the law as to the
         reversal by a court of appeal of an
         order made by a judge below in the
         exercise of his discretion is well
         established, and any difficulty that
         arises is due only to the application of
         well settled principles in an individual

         seem to defer to this principle."</blockquote><p id="p_40">

</p><p id="p_41">       Looking to the decision of AIR 1973 SC 76, it is

observed at para 5 by Their Lordships that "It is not the

case that first appellate Court exercised its jurisdiction

either illegally or with material irregularity.       So it is

clear that if the First Appellate Court exercised its

jurisdiction either illegally or with material irregularity,

this   Court   can   interfere    even   though   there   are

concurrent findings by the Courts below. But looking to

the orders passed by the Courts below and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                              28</span>



discussion that I have made above, when the material

documents were not considered and some of the

documents were wrongly read by the Trial Court, about

which without making proper enquiry in the appeal,

when the appeal Court endorsed its view with that of

the Trial Court, clearly shows that the exercise of

jurisdiction by the Appellate Court is not in accordance

with law and there is material irregularity in exercise of

jurisdiction by the appellate Court.         Under such

circumstances, this Court can interfere into the orders

passed by the Courts below even though there are

concurrent findings by the Courts below. In this regard,

I refer to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

reported   in   (1997)   5   SCC   76   in   the   case   of

<a href="/doc/607991/" id="a_10">Achutananda Baidya vs. Prafullya Kumar Gayen

wherein it is held by Their Lordships as under:

     accept     such     contention     of     Mr.
     Bhattacharyya. In this case, the High Court
     has rightly held that the appellate authority
     came to the finding of non-existence of oral
     agreement     of    reconveyance      without
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                               29</span>



       considering the evidence on record. If the
       appellate authority does not consider the
       materials on record having a bearing on a
       finding of fact and makes the finding of fact,
       such finding of fact arrived without
       consideration of relevanat materials on
       record cannot be sustained in law. The High
       Court, in such circumstances, will be
       competent to consider the validity of the
       finding of fact assailed before it with
       reference to materials on record.

       fact is arrived at by inferior court or tribunal,
       such finding must be held to be perverse and
       lacking     in   factual     basis.   In    such
       circumstances, in exercise of the jurisdiction
       under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_11">Article 227</a>, the High Court will be

for the respondents that as there are concurrent
