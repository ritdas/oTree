<p id="p_9">Ltd., submitted that said Rajasthan Finance Bill, 2010 was enacted

into Act and it received the assent of His Excellency the Governor on

01.04.2010 and, therefore, the impugned Finance Bill, 2010 did not

survive thereafter. They also submitted that the validity of imposition

of similar levy known as 'Water Cess' under Section 3B of the

Act of 1962, was challenged by certain petitioners in a batch of writ

petitions before the Division Bench of this Court; and the Division

Bench by its judgment dated 14.07.2011 rendered in D.B. Civil Writ

Petition No.785/2010-Sangam (India) Ltd. Vs. The State of

Rajasthan &amp; Ors. including the Ajmer Vidut Vitran Nigam Ltd. and

Jodhpur Vidut Vitran Nigam Ltd., the Division Bench has up-held the

validity of said imposition of 'Water Cess' under Section 3B of the

same enactment i.e. Electricity (Duty) Act, 1962 inserted by

Rajasthan Finance Act, 2010 in that judgment dated 14.07.2011 in

the following terms and the relevant abstract of the said judgment is

reproduced herein below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">            "The submission of the petitioners is that before
      imposing cess in question, the Commission constituted vide the
      Act of 1999 ought to have been consulted and since the
      Commission was not consulted, the action of imposing cess is
      invalid. There is no force in the said submission. The
                                                           S.B.C.W.P. No.7606/2010

<p id="p_10">                                                     Common Order dt: 08/11/2011


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                4/8</span>
Commission is required to be consulted with respect to the
matters enumerated in Section 9, which provides the functions,
proceedings and powers of the Commission. Section 9 (1) (a)
empowers the Commission to determinate the tariff for
electricity in the manner provided in section 26. Section 26
deals with the determination of tariff by the Commission. The
Commission has power to determine the tariff in accordance
with the provisions of the Act of 1999. However, in our
opinion, cess in question is levy of tax on consumption of
energy and not a tariff of electricity. Consequently, there is no
encroachment on the power of the Commission.
</p><p id="p_11">       It is also submitted relying upon the water cess Act of
1977 that field is occupied by the Central legislation and
thus, the provisions of Section 3B of the Act of 1962
imposing cess could not have been enacted by the State
legislature without obtaining the assent of the President of
India. <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_1">The Cess Act</a> of 1977 is an Act to provide for the levy
and collection of the cess on water consumed by the persons
carrying on certain industries and by local authorities with a
view to augment the resources of the Central Board and State
Boards for the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution
constituted under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control) of
Pollution Act</a>, 1974. The cess Act of 1977 has totally a
different role to play. It occupies a totally different field. The
State Legislature has clearly inserted <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_3">Section 3B</a> in the Act of
1962 by way of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_4">Section 12</a> of the Finance Act of 2009. The levy
of cess is covered under Entry 53 of List II of Seventh
Schedule. It is a cess on consumption of electricity for
conservation of water. It is not a cess on water consumption.
Thus, in the light of applying the doctrine of pith and
substance laid down by the Apex Court in the case of
                                                           S.B.C.W.P. No.7606/2010

                                              Along-with connected 18 writ petitions.
</p><p id="p_13">                                                     Common Order dt: 08/11/2011


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                5/8</span>
Keshoram Industries Ltd. (supra), we are of the considered
opinion that there is no encroachment on the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_5">Cess Act</a> of
1977. <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_6">The Cess Act</a> of 1977 has totally a different field to
operate and that was not a tax imposed upon the consumption
of water. By mere fact that the State proposed to augment its
revenue for the purpose of conservation of water, it cannot be
said that there is any encroachment on the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_7">Cess Act</a> of 1977 or
field reserved to the Union List in any manner whatsoever.
</p><p id="p_14">       Thus, we are of the considered opinion that provisions
of <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_8">Section 3B</a> inserted in the Rajasthan Electricity (Duty) Act,
1962 by virtue of Section 12 of the Rajasthan Finance Act,
2009 imposing water conservation cess cannot in any maner
be said to be arbitrary or illegal or violative of Articles 14, 19
(1) (g), 265 and 300A of the Constitution. It is open to the
State Government to augment its revenue by imposing tax as
provided under various entries in List II of the Seventh
Schedule. We are not impressed by the submissions raised by
the petitioners that there is no co-relation of consumption of
energy with the water conservation and hence, provisions are
arbitrary. There is water crisis and conservation of water is
need of the day. The water conservation is necessary for
existence of human being and various activities which are
taking place. Thus, imposition of cess on consumption of
electricity for conservation of water cannot be said to be
arbitrary. It is within the legislative competence of the State.
The cess in question is in the nature of tax and not a fee as
suggested by the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_15">       Submission was also raised by one of the learned
counsel for the petitioners that provisions imposing cess were
enacted for the temporary measures for the Financial Year
2009 and thus, provisions have now come to an end. There is
                                                                S.B.C.W.P. No.7606/2010

      no force in the said submission. The provisions of <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_9">Section 3B</a>
      inserted in the Act of 1962 by virtue of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_10">Section 12</a> of the
      Finance Act, 2009 are not temporary one. They are not
      confined to the year in question. Merely by the fact that
      decision was taken in the finance policy introduced in 2009, it
      does not become temporary in nature.

<p id="p_19">3.          Learned counsel for the respondents, therefore, urged

that imposition of urban cess in the present matter providing for

funds of sanitation and maintenance and various other purposes by

the local bodies, also deserves to be upheld on the same grounds as

the Division Bench has done in Sangam (I) Ltd.'s case.
</p>
<p id="p_20">4.          Upon this, the learned counsel for the petitioners, Mr.

Pankaj Bohra, submitted that there are certain Supreme Court

decisions, which were not cited before the Division Bench while

rendering the judgment on 14.07.2011 in Sagam India Ltd.'s case and

also that the imposition of urban cess being for different objectives

but 'water cess' was for water conservation by the State, is a different

matter and, therefore, these writ petitions can be entertained by the

Single Bench whereas in the present cases also the validity of such

levy has been challenged and the enactment itself has been

challenged in the alternative.

<p id="p_21">5.          This Court is not impressed with the submissions made

by the learned counsel for the petitioners.

        water cess for water conservation, the levy of which has been up-held

        by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Sangam (I) Ltd.

        (Duty) Act, 1962 by Rajasthan Finance Act, 2010, which received the

        assent of His Excellency the Governor, on 01.04.2010, namely, the

        Rajasthan Finance Act, 2010 before the Division Bench of this Court

        on appropriate grounds if it choses to file such writ petition

        challenging vires of such levy of urban cess under <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_12">Section 3C</a> of the

        Act before the Division Bench.

        already raised and decided by the Division Bench of this Court, even

        on the levy of urban cess because the judgment of water cess under

        <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_13">Section 3B</a> applies with same force to the imposition of urban cess
