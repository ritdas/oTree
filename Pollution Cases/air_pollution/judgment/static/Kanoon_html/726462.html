<p id="p_1">1.	Draft
amendment granted.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_2">2.	The
petitioners herein have prayed for a declaration that the officials
of respondent no.2 have no authority or competence to take any action
against the petitioners having their units in the Kandla Special
Economic Zone in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1418099/" id="a_1">sections 21</a>, <a href="/doc/769548/" id="a_2">22</a>, <a href="/doc/1678546/" id="a_3">51</a> and <a href="/doc/97555/" id="a_4">53</a>
of the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005 and the Rules;  declaration
that the respondent no.3 and respondent no.4 are the competent
authorities for the purpose of regulating the imports/exports and/or
other transactions relating to or concerning the units located in
Kandla SEZ in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1423589/" id="a_5">Special Economic Zones Act</a>,
2005 and Special Economic Zones Rules, 2006; declaration that the
action of the respondent no.2 and its officials in detaining the
containers of the petitioners and other similarly placed persons in
Kandla SEZ since 5 months, rendering 5000 workmen jobless since last
5 months and incurrring/paying demurrage and other charges in crores
to the shipping companies in foreign exchange as being illegal,
arbitrary and unjust and other related prayers.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">3.	The
petitioners are private limited companies engaged in the business of
recycling of plastic scrap into plastic granules and agglomerates and
agro products at their units in the Kandla Special Economic Zone.
According to the petitioners, they are  governed by the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1423589/" id="a_6">The Special Economic Zones Act</a>, 2005 read with The Special Economic
Zones Rules, 2006. The respondent no.3 is the administrative head of
the  Special Economic Zones  and the respondent no.4 is the office of
the Custom based at KSEZ which is under the control of the respondent
no.1.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_4">4.	The
petitioners obtained consolidated approval from Gujarat Pollution
Control Board (GPCB) under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_7">Section 25</a> of the  Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,1974, <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_9">Section 21</a> of the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and authorisation
under Rule 3[c] and 5[5] of the Hazardous Waste (Management and
Handling) Rules, 1989, amendment Rules, 2000, amended Rules 2003
framed under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_11">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986. The said
approval is valid upto 2014.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_5">5.	The
petitioners imported certain materials covering Bills of Entry.
According to the petitioners the containers of the petitioners were
detained though the laboratory reports as per applicable policy is
positive by the officials of respondent no.2 who have no authority of
law or competence to take any such action in respect of the imports
made to KSEZ. The CIPET, Ahmedabad sent a report which is positive
and it is stated that the sample may be considered as free from any
kind of toxic/non-toxic contamination.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_6">6.	The
petitioners made representation to the Commissioner of Customs,
Kandla, stating that almost six weeks have passed and the goods were
not cleared. The petitioners also pointed out that the factories of
the petitioners are virtually closed for want of raw materials. The
petitioners also relied upon the clean report from CIPET Laboratory,
Ahmedabad and requested the authority to release the goods forthwith.
It also appears that the office of respondent no.3 has made
representation to the office of Commissioner of Customs, Kandla
pointing out that the action by the Kandla Customs Officials is
wholly without authority of law. However, no action was taken by the
authority and therefore the present petitions have been filed.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_7">7.	At
this stage it is required to be noted that the Government
Notification  dated 1.1.1997 pertaining to procedure related to
Import of  Plastic waste/scrap. Clause (vii) reads as under:
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_8"> (vii)	Before
the clearance of the plastic waste/scrap, all imported consignments
of such plastic scrap/waste shall be subjected to scrutiny and
testing of sample.  Custom authority shall for this purpose draw a
sample and send the same to the nearest laboratory/office of the
central institute of plastic engineering and technology (CIPET) with
a view to having same analyzed and verified that such imported
consignment, are in conformity with the description/definition as
given in sub para (I) and (ii) above. 
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_9">8.	The
petitioner has produced the  Test Certificate issued by Central
Institute of Plastic  Engineering and Technology at Annexure-H (page
</p><p id="p_10">75). Clause [c] at page 75 specially says that it is  Virgin .
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_11">This
shows that nothing is adverse as per the test conducted by the 
Central Institute of Plastic Engineering and Technology. If the goods
are in the category of recycle the test result would have shown the
same as  Recycle .
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_12">9.	At
this stage it is also required to  reproduce paras 4.28  and 4.31 of
the affidavit in reply filed by Deputy Commissioner of Customs, the
respondent no.2 herein:
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_13"> 4.28	I
say that the report of sample of plastic scrap/waste in CAPET
Ahmedabad is doubtful and the report of the Kandla Customs Laboratory
is contradictory.  It is noticed that in many cases similar samples
of plastic waste/scrap containing stickers/labels were tested at
CIPET, Chennai for various parties and they have stated that the same
are used ones.  Whereas CIPET Ahmedabad has stated that the samples
are virgin plastic waste. In fact, it has been admitted by the
authorized persons of CIPET Ahmedabad that in the last 5 years, they
haven ot given any adverse report for samples tested at their
laboratory. As a matter of precautions, similar samples are being
tested at other branch of CIPET and Customs House Laboratory, Kandla.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_14">4.31	and
4.32 I say that prior to August 2009, the officers of the respondent
no.2 were collecting samples of plastic waste/scrap for units in the
KASEZ. However, Ministry of Commerce vide their instruction No.34
dated 31-08-2009 has stated that no agency can carry out inspection,
search, seizure or investigation without approval of the D.C. of the
Zone concerned. Coy of the said instruction dated 31-8-2009 of the
Ministry of Commerce is anenxed herewith and marked as Annexure-V.
Accordingly it was not possible to collect samples for various
imported consignments in KASEZ... 
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_15">10.	Even
in the report of CIPET, Chennai, there are no adverse remarks. Clause
[b] produced at page 139 states as under:
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_16"> [b]	The
LLDPE and LDPE/LLDPE bag cut pieces are found to be printed and some
of them having stickers pasted on them. However, it does not give any
clue whether the packing material is generated as waste during
printing operation or otherwise except that the stickers pasted on
them giving indication of their usage as stickers are normally
affixed after packaging the product. 
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_17">11.	Even
the Clause (5) thereof states as under:
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_18"> Since
the cut pieces do not have any contamination it will not generate any
residue during recycling except the stickers and labels .
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_19">12.	Affidavit
in reply filed on behalf of the respondent nos.1 and 3. Para 9
thereof reads as under:
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_20"> 9.
  In reply to para 4.22 I state that Plastic Waste &amp; scrap
(non-hazardous) classified under ITC (HS) 39159090 is categorized as
restricted item for import into India. However, by virtue of Rules
27(1) of the Rules, 2006 restricted goods can be imported into a
Special Economic Zone. Plastic waste &amp; scrap import in domestic
tariff area is required to be regulated as per the public notice
no.392/92-97 issued by the DGFT. After the enactment of SEZ Act, All
Letters of Approval (LOA) issued by the office of the Development
Commissioner to the plastic waste importing units in KASEZ carried a
condition to comply with the provisions of the aforementioned Public
Notice. Hence, the bills of Entry filed in this office under Rule 
27/29 of SEZ Rules are passed provisionally subject to the compliance
of the aforementioned Public Notice. Rule 27(10) provides for
assessment on the basis of self declaration  of all routine
examination as restricted. The provisionally assessed Bills of entry
are presented to customs officer at the port of import as per Rule
29(2)(b) and since the plastic scrap are imported in containers, the
port customs transfer it to SEZ after verification of the Seal
without customs escort as provided in Rule 28(2) &amp; (5) read with
Rule 29(2)(c).  The customs authorities in KASEZ verify the seal and
allow entry of the consignment as per Rule 29(2)(e) &amp; (h). On
arrival of the goods, the appraiser assign posting to the Preventive
Officer (Authorized Officer) in terms of Rule 29(2)(e) &amp; (h) and
to draw representative samples in compliance of the Public Notice in
question (which is made applicable in the letter of Approval). These
samples are forwarded to the nearest CIPET Centre as provided in the
Public Notice  (in this case CIPET, Ahmedabad)  and test report is
received. If the said test report is in tune with the aforementioned
Public Notice, the goods can be put to use and the Bill of Entry is
also finally assessed.  (Emphasis supplied)
 

 


 

</p><p id="p_21">13.	The
test report shows that the the goods are  virgin . As stated
hereinabove if the test report is in tune with the aforementioned
public notice the goods can be put to use. Even the test report
produced at page 139 states that  it does not give any clue whether
the packing material is generated as waste during printing operation
or otherwise except that the stickers pasted on them giving
indication of their usage as stickers are normally affixed after
packaging the product.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_22">14.	In
the case of Special Civil Application No.504 of 2008, a Division
Bench of this Court  held as under:
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_23"> 5.	The
learned senior advocate for the petitioner relied upon a decision of
the Hon'ble the Apex Court in the matter of Whirlpool Corporation Vs.
Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai and others, reported in AIR, 1999 SC
</p><p id="p_24">22. The learned senior advocate for the petitioner invited attention
of the Court to para 10 and 11 and thereafter, paras 17 to 21. The
Court is of the opinion that the  present authority issuing Show
Cause Notice figures nowhere in the provisions of the SEZ Act.
Therefore, prima facie, the Court is of the opinion that the
authority has issued the Show Cause Notice without there being
jurisdiction for issuance of such notice. The matter requires closer
scrutiny.  Hence Rule. Ad interim relief granted earlier to continue.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_25">6.	.....
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_26">The
submission is prima facie, found to be not acceptable for the simple
reason that after SEZ Act, 2005 coming into force wherein specific
authorities are provided. The Court is of the opinion that the
Customs authorities seems to have been rendered functus officio so
far as the matter pertaining to the conduct of a unit situated in SEZ
is concerned.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_27">7.	In
view of the decision of the Hon'ble the Apex Court in the matter of
Whirlpool Corporation Vs. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai (supra)
until the authority issuing Show Cause Notice is able to satisfy the
Court about its 'locus standi' and its jurisdiction, authority cannot
be allowed to usurp the power to issue Show Cause Notice. Otherwise,
the entire object and purpose of establishment of Special Economic
Zone will stand frustrated. 
</p> 

 


 

 


 

<p id="p_28">15.		In
view of the above facts and circumstances of the case Rule returnable
on 26th February 2009.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_29">16.		In
the meantime ad interim relief is granted in terms of para 9(HH)
subject to the compliance of all the provisions and subject to
further orders by this court in respect of  any duty or tax payable
by the petitioners in case the petitions fail. Direct service is
permitted.
