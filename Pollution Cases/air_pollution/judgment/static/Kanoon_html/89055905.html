CC no.524317/2016              DPCC Vs. Narender Kumar                 Page 2 of 9
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  3</span>

is a matter of record that vide order dated 16.02.2000, a
charge was framed against the accused for the offences
punishable U/s 41, 42, 43 &amp; 44 of the Act. It is also a matter of
record that thereafter, matter was adjourned for CE. It is also
a matter of record that vide order dated 03.10.2002, case was
transferred to some other court by the order of Ld. CMM and
vide order dated 08.11.2002, the matter was adjourned for
pre-charge evidence. Although, the case should not have been
fixed for pre-charge evidence. Even otherwise, charge also
should not have been framed without leading pre-charge
evidence as it is a warrant trial case. But fact remains the
same that clock cannot be put back. It is also a matter of
record that vide order dated 01.11.2006 again the matter was
adjourned for post-charge evidence. It is also a matter of
record that again case was transferred on 02.06.2012 before
some other Court and vide order dated 03.07.2012, matter
was again adjourned for pre-charge evidence.

evidence. Thereafter, Sh. B.M.S.Reddy was examined and
discharged on 29.07.2013 and on that date, pre-charge
evidence was closed and matter was adjourned for arguments
on charge and on 23.08.2013, charge was again framed
against the accused. Hence, there are various technical
lacunas in the present case. However, none of the parties have

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                        4</span>

submissions advanced on behalf of the parties and have gone
through the relevant records. I have also gone through the
relevant provisions of Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution)

       be made on or before such date as may be
       specified by the State Govt. by notification in this
       behalf in the Official Gazette].
</p>

<p id="p_29">16.       Complainant has to prove that accused was engaged in
wet blue tanning and discharging trade effluent without any
treatment facility and accused has also not taken any
permission as required in the Act. Complaint has to further
prove that accused has also discharged sewage or trade
effluent into a strain or well or sewage.
</p>

<p id="p_30">17.       To support its case, complainant has examined two
witnesses i.e. Dr. B.M.S. Reddy Senior Environment Engineer
and Sh. P.S. Pankaj, Environment Engineer.
</p>

<p id="p_31">18.       CW-1 Sh. B.M.S. Reddy has duly proved the inspection
report dated 17.07.1998 and closer directions are Ex. CW-1/A.
An inspection dated 16.09.1998 which was carried out by him
is Ex. CW-1/B. This witness has also proved the complaint Ex.
CW-1/C. This witness has specifically deposed that CPCB has
also categorized the activity of accused unit as hazardous in
the criteria for industry classification. This witness has
specifically deposed that accused was engaged in the activity
of tanning of leather which is highly water polluting and was
placed under "H" category of Delhi Master Plan, 2001. This
witness has specifically deposed that unit of accused was in
operation without mandatory consent as required under the
Act.
</p>
<p id="p_32">CC no.524317/2016       DPCC Vs. Narender Kumar           Page 6 of 9
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   7</span>

</p><p id="p_33">19.       Another witness Sh. P.S. Pankaj has also corroborated
the testimony of Dr. B.M.S. Reddy. As per his testimony, an
inspection of NNK Leather was conducted on 17.07.1998 and
from the inspection, it was gathered that accused was carrying
on the activity of tannery and the said activity is categorized
as "H" category which is not permitted in Delhi.
</p>

<p id="p_34">20.       Hence, both witnesses have specifically deposed that
vide inspection dated 17.07.1998, the unit of accused was
found violating the provisions of the water Act. Hence, both the
witnesses are corroborating each other on material facts. Both
witnesses were cross-examined by the accused. Various
suggestions were given in the cross-examination which were
denied by the witnesses. Dr. B.M.S.Reddy has specifically
deposed in his cross examination that he had inspected the
unit of the accused which he found that unit was in operation.
This witness has specifically deposed in his cross-examination
that unit was found in operation without mandatory consent
under the Act. Sh. P.S. Pankaj has also specifically deposed in
his cross-examination that the unit was not having the
mandatory consent which is violation of provisions of Act and
unit was involved in activity of tannery which itself is highly
polluting activity and which falls under "H" category. It is to be
kept in mind that document speaks itself. Complainant has
duly proved the inspection dated 17.07.1998 which shows that
accused has violated the provisions of the water Act. Both
witnesses have passed the test of cross-examination. There is
no material contradictions in their testimonies. I do not find

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                   8</span>

any reason to disbelieve the statement of witnesses. Both
witnesses have duly supported the case of the complainant.
</p>

<p id="p_35">21.       In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it is
held that the complainant has proved its case beyond
reasonable doubt against accused. Accordingly, accused is
held guilty and convicted for offences punishable under
