Regular List               AT SHILLONG

PIL No. 4 of 2017
                                                   Date of order: 04.03.2020
In Re Sou Motu for Efficient Management
of Cleanliness &amp; Hygienic conditions in  Vs.      State of Meghalaya
Shillong City
Coram:
       Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Rafiq, Chief Justice
       Hon'ble Mr. Justice W. Diengdoh, Judge
Appearance:
For the Petitioner/Appellant (s) :    Mr. T.T. Diengdoh, Sr. Adv.

For the Respondent(s)            :    Dr. N. Mozika, Sr. Adv. with</pre>
<p id="p_1">                                      Mr. P.N. Nongbri, Adv. (For R 1&amp;3)
                                      Mr. S. P. Mahanta, Sr. Adv. (For R 4)
                                      Ms. A. Paul, ASG


       Considering the importance of the matter, we requested Mr. T.T.
Diengdoh, learned Senior counsel who is present in the Court to assist the
Court as Amicus Curiae and he has agreed.
</p><p id="p_2">       Let office provide a copy of complete papers of this file to him.
       Dr. N. Mozika, learned Senior counsel appearing for the State
submitted that the Supervisory Committee constituted vide notification dated
02.06.2017, held its last meeting in October, 2019 and thereafter no meeting
has been held. He therefore prayed that hearing of the matter may be
deferred for some time so as to enable the Supervisory Committee to make
further deliberations.
</p><p id="p_3">       The Supervisory Committee was constituted by this Court to oversee
the conditions of cleanliness and hygiene of the Shillong city. This Court
vide order dated 06.07.2017 required the Supervisory Committee to meet
once in a week. Thereafter when the matter was listed before the Court on
21.06.2017, this Court was informed that the weekly meetings are being held
by the Committee. This Court with a view of ensuring smooth functioning of
the Committee vide order passed on that date required that the
Commissioner &amp; Secretary, Urban Affairs may be designated as Co-
Chairman of the Committee, who may chair the meeting in absence of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      1</span>
 Chairman i.e., the Chief Secretary. This Court further directed that the
Member Secretary, State Legal Services Authority shall be co-opted as
member of the said Committee and left it open for the Committee to co-opt
one more member. It is however regrettable to note that despite specific
direction, meeting of the Committee has not been held for past five months.
</p><p id="p_4">       Having regard to the significance of the issue of cleanliness and
hygiene of the State capital Shillong, we deem it appropriate to make the
following directions:-
</p><p id="p_5">I.     That Mr. T.T. Diengdoh, learned Amicus Curiae and Member
Secretary, Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board shall be inducted as
members of the Supervisory Committee and the necessary notification for
reconstituted Committees in this behalf shall be issued.
II.    That the respondent State notify constitution of four sub-committees
of the Supervisory Committee; (1) for area falling under the jurisdiction of
the Shillong Municipal Board, with the Chief Executive Officer as a
member, (2) for area falling within the jurisdiction of the Shillong
Cantonment Board, with its Chief Executive Officer as a member, (3) for
area falling under the jurisdiction of the Khasi Autonomous District Council,
with its Secretary as a member and (4) for area falling under the jurisdiction
of the Hima Mylliem with its Syiem as a member who shall, along with
Member Secretary, Meghalaya State Legal Services Authority and learned
Amicus Curiae also as its members, shall constitute separate sub-committees
for each of these areas.
</p><p id="p_6">III.   That the aforementioned sub-committees shall conduct periodical
inspection of the areas falling under their jurisdiction at least once in a
month, as per the date and time fixed by Member Secretary of MSLSA, and
submit their report to the Supervisory Committee.
IV.    That the Supervisory Committee, upon consideration of the
suggestions/recommendations in the report of the respective sub-
committees, shall issue appropriate direction for immediate cleanliness of
the areas so as to restore the hygiene.
</p><p id="p_7">V.     That Member Secretary, Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board
shall have independent inspection of different parts of the city of Shillong

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          2</span>
 carried out and ensure compliance of various provisions of the Water

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and take appropriate action against the
defaulting person/party for violating of any provisions thereof. Member

suggestions for ensuring cleanliness and hygiene of the city.
VI.       That the Supervisory Committee shall hold its meeting, at least once
in a month, preferably in the last week of every month, on the date and time
fixed by its Chairman i.e., the Chief Secretary of the State.

week of the month for further consideration commencing from the month of
May, 2020.
