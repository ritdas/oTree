the State.
</p><p id="p_7">      In this application the prayer of the petitioner is for quashing the
entire criminal proceedings including the first information report which
had been instituted in connection with Kara P.S.Case No. 72 of 2013
corresponding to G.R Case No. 459 of 2013 registered for the offences
punishable under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_1">Sections 379</a> and <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_2">411</a> of the Indian Penal Code,

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p><p id="p_8">      The prosecution story in brief is that the informant who is the
Assistant Sub-Inspector of police was on petrolling duty in the evening
of 19.12.2013 observed that a Turbo Truck bearing Registration
No.JH01AR-6412 was passing by at a high speed. It was also alleged
therein that the said truck was apprehended and on inspection it was
found loaded with sand but no valid papers were produced by the
driver with respect to the sand loaded on the truck.
</p><p id="p_9">      After investigation the case having been found to be true,
charge-sheet was submitted pursuant to which cognizance for the
offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_7">Sections 379</a>/<a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_8">411</a> of the Indian Penal Code,

</p><p id="p_10">     Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he is the owner
of the vehicle and since the vehicle was under the custody of driver,
the owner cannot be directly made responsible for the offence as has
been alleged in the first information report. Learned counsel for the
petitioner has further submitted that institution of the criminal case
and taking cognizance subsequent thereto is bad in law in view of the
fact that Assistant Sub-Inspector of police is not empowered to
institute the first information report under the provisions of the Mines
and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_12">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 or under the
provisions of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p><p id="p_11">     In this context, he has referred to a judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/76417350/" id="a_14">State (NCT of Delhi) vs. Sanjay</a>
[(2014) 9SCC 772]        in which the Hon'ble Supreme Court while
considering the question as to whether the provisions contained in
<a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_15">Sections 21</a>, <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_16">22</a> and other sections of the Mines and Minerals
(Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_17">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 operate as a bar against the
prosecution of a person who has been charged with allegations which
constitutes offences under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_18">Sections 379</a>/<a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_19">411</a> of the Indian Penal code
and that in the light of the relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_20">MMDR Act</a>, vis a
vis<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_21"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure and<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_22"> the Indian Penal Code</a> had held
that the ingredients constituting the offence under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_23">MMDR Act</a> and
the ingredients of dishonestly removing sand and gravel from the
riverbed without sand which is the property of State is a distinct
offence under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24"> the Indian Penal Code</a>. It was further held therein that
for the commission of the offence under <a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_25">Section 378</a> of the Indian
Penal Code, on receipt of the police report, the magistrate having
jurisdiction can take cognizance of the said offence without awaiting
the receipt of the complaint that may be filed by the authorised officer
for taking cognizance in respect of violation of various provisions of
the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_26">MMDR Act</a>. Relevant paragraphs of the above noted judgment is
quoted herein under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "68. <a href="/doc/1540511/" id="a_27">In State of U.P. v. Babu Ram Upadhya</a>, while
       interpreting a particular statue as mandatory or
       directory this court observed: (AIR p. 765 para 29)
               "29. ... When a statute uses the word
               'shall', 'prima facie', it is mandatory, but
               the court may ascertain the real intention
               of the legislature by carefully attending
               to the whole scope of the statute. For
               ascertaining the real intention of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               3</span>
           legislature the court may consider, inter
          alia, the nature and the design of the
          statute, and the consequences which
          would follow from construing it the one
          way or the other, the impact of other
          provisions      whereby        the    necessity      of
          complying with the provisions in question
          is avoided, the circumstance, namely,
          that    the        statute     provides       for     a
          contingency of the non-compliance with
          the provisions, the fact that the non-
          compliance with the provisions is or is not
          visited by some penalty, the serious or
          trivial consequences that flow therefrom,
          and, above, all, whether the object of the
          legislation will be defeated or furthered."
</blockquote><p id="p_12">69. Considering the principles of interpretation
and the wordings used in <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_28">Section 22</a>, in our
considered       opinion,     the      provision   is   not     a
complete and absolute bar for taking action by
the police for illegal and dishonestly committing
theft     of   minerals      including     sand    from       the
riverbed. The Court shall take judicial notice of
the fact that over the years rivers in India have
been      affected      by     the      alarming    rate       of
unrestricted sand mining which is damaging the
ecosystem of the rivers and safety of bridges. It
also    weakens      riverbeds,        fish    breeding       and
destroys the natural habitat of many organisms.
If these illegal activities are not stopped by the
State and the police authorities of the State, it
will cause serious repercussions as mentioned
hereinabove. It will not only change the river
hydrology but also will deplete the ground water
levels.
</p><p id="p_13">70. There cannot be any dispute with regard to
restrictions imposed under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_29">MMDR Act</a> and
remedy provided therein. In any case, where
there is a mining activity by any person in
contravention of the provisions of <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_30">Section 4</a> and
other sections of the Act, the officer empowered
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                4</span>
        and authorised under the Act shall exercise all
       the powers including making a complaint before
       the Jurisdictional Magistrate. It is also not in
       dispute that the Magistrate shall in such cases
       take cognizance on the basis of the complaint
       filed before it by a duly authorised officer. In case
       of breach and violation of <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_31">Section 4</a> and other
       provisions of the Act, the police officer cannot
       insist   the   Magistrate    for    taking   alleging
       contravention of the said Act. In other words, the
       prohibition contained in <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_32">Section 22</a> of the Act
       against prosecution of a person except on a
       complaint made by the officer is attracted only
       when such person is sought to be prosecuted for
       contravention of <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_33">Section 4</a> of the Act and not for
       any act or omission which constitutes an offence
       under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_34"> the Penal Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_14">       71. However, there may be a situation where a
       person without any lease or licence or any
       authority enters into river and extracts sand,
       gravel   and   other   minerals    and   remove   or
       transport those minerals in a clandestine manner
       with an intent to remove dishonestly those
       minerals from the possession of the State, is
       liable to be punished for committing such offence
       under <a href="/doc/1280620/" id="a_35">Sections 378</a> and <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_36">379</a> of the Penal Code."
      Learned counsel for the State on the other hand, submits that so
far as cognizance with respect to the provisions under <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_37">MMDR Act</a> is
concerned, the same has been addressed in the judgment rendered
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as referred to above. He further
submits while relying on the aforesaid judgment with respect to the
offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_38">Sections 379</a> and <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_39">411</a> of the Indian Penal
Code that, the police does have the power to investigate the case
under the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_40"> of the Indian Penal Code</a> and that the learned
Magistrate is empowered to take cognizance and, therefore, the order
dated 5.8.2014 by which cognizance was also taken for the offences
punishable under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_41">Section 379</a>/<a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_42">411</a> of the Indian Penal Code does not
suffer from any infirmity.
</p><p id="p_15">      <a href="/doc/1492002/" id="a_43">Section 22</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Development and
<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_44">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 reads as follows:-

<p id="p_16">      It would appear from a plain reading of <a href="/doc/83054370/" id="a_45">Section 22</a> of the MMDR
Act as quoted above is that the court is precluded from taking
