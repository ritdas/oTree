                                    BEFORE
                       HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE UJJAL BHUYAN

                                           ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">Date : 15-05-2019

       Heard Mr. RK Talukdar, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. PJ Phukan, learned
Standing Counsel, Pollution Control Board, Assam for respondent Nos.1 and 2. Also heard Ms.
M Bhattacharjee, learned Government Advocate, Assam for respondent No.3 and Ms. P
Choudhury, learned counsel for respondent No.4.
</p><p id="p_2">      By filing this petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, petitioner seeks a
direction to the respondents, more particularly respondent No.2 i.e., Executive Engineer,
Golaghat Regional Office, Pollution Control Board, Assam to issue consent to operate in
favour of M/S Doyang Stone Crushing Industries owned by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      Petitioner is the proprietorship of M/S Doyang Stone Crushing Industries, which is
registered with the District Industries Centre, Golaghat as well as with the Chief Inspector of
Factories, Assam. Respondent No.2 had issued consent to operate to M/S Doyang Stone
Crushing Industries (petitioner's unit) under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1981 on 02.08.2016 for the period up-to 31.03.2017, which was thereafter extended up-to
31.03.2018. It is alleged that some people had lodged complaint alleging that petitioner's unit
was causing noise and air pollution. Acting on such public complaint, Sub-Divisional Officer
(Civil), Dhansiri, Sarupathar had suspended operation of the petitioner's unit vide order dated
08.08.2017. Subsequently, vide order dated 03.03.2018, such suspension of operation was
withdrawn. In the process, the period up-to 31.03.2018 expired. Petitioner applied afresh for
consent to operate under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1981. Since no decision was taken, petitioner submitted representation before respondent
No.2 on 25.06.2018. As there was no response, present writ petition came to be filed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      Notice in this case was issued on 30.08.2018.
</p><p id="p_5">                                                                                      Page No.# 3/3

         Respondent Nos.1 and 2 in their common affidavit have taken the stand that Pollution
Control Board had carried out air quality monitoring as well as noise level monitoring of the
petitioner's unit and found the same to be beyond permissible limit. However, Member
Secretary of Pollution Control Board had written to the Deputy Commissioner, Golaghat on
01.11.2018 to constitute a committee having representatives of different departments and to
examine the complaint whereafter report was to be submitted.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         Mr. Phukan, learned Standing Counsel submits that till date, no report has been
received from the Deputy Commissioner, Golaghat.
</p>
<p id="p_7">         After hearing learned counsel for the parties and on due consideration, Court is of the
view that power to grant consent to operate is specifically vested in the Pollution Control
Board. This power is to be exercised by the Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_8">         In such circumstances, it is for the Pollution Control Board and its authorities to take a
decision one way or the other regarding prayer of the petitioner to grant consent to operate
for the year 2018-19 and beyond.
</p>
<p id="p_9">         Let such decision be taken by respondent Nos.1 and 2 within a period of 4 weeks from
the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order. If consent to operate is granted to the
petitioner, it should be ensured that petitioner's unit conforms to permissible air quality and
noise level parameters.
</p>
<p id="p_10">This disposes of the writ petition.
</p>



<p id="p_11">                                                                                     JUDGE
