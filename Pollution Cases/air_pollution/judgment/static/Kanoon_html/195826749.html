        THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH

  M.Cr.C. No.5799/2018 (<a href="/doc/64153664/" id="a_2">Kowa Spinarse Ltd., &amp; Ors. vs. M.P. Pollution Board</a>)

                              and
                      M.Cr.C. No.5799/2018

Indore, Dated: 27/03/2018

            Shri Ashish Gupta, learned counsel for the applicants.
                               ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">            This common order shall govern the disposal of both
the M.Cr.C. Nos. 5785/2018 and 5799/2018.
</p><p id="p_2">02.         The applicants have preferred these miscellaneous
applications under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_3">Section 482</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 (for short 'The Code'), against orders dated 01/02/2018,
passed by Additional Sessions Judge, Dharampuri, District Dhar in
Cr. Revision No.10/2017 challenging the charges framed against
the applicant for offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_4">Section 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_5">26</a> of
Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and in
Cr.Revision No.53/2017, challenging the charges framed against
the applicant for offence under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_7">Section 21</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_8">37</a> of Air (Prevention
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
</p><p id="p_3">03.         On perusal of record it appears that after framing of the
charges against the applicants, the prosecution evidence has been
recorded by the trial Court and accused has also been examined
under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Section 313</a> of 'The Code'.             Now the case is fixed for
recording of defence evidence. Under these circumstances, the
case is likely to be on its conclusion, therefore, at this stage, no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                2</span>

        THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
  M.Cr.C. No.5785/2018 (<a href="/doc/64153664/" id="a_11">Kowa Spinarse Ltd., &amp; Ors. vs. M.P. Pollution Board</a>)
  M.Cr.C. No.5799/2018 (<a href="/doc/64153664/" id="a_12">Kowa Spinarse Ltd., &amp; Ors. vs. M.P. Pollution Board</a>)


interference is warranted against the order of framing of charge.
The reason that scope of consideration at the stage of framing of
charge is very limited, whereas the Court enjoys more latitude
after recording of evidence. This Court is absenting from making
observations on the merit of the case as the same may influence the
the trial Court.
</p><p id="p_4">04.         Before parting with the matter, it is pertinent to note
that on the request of the learned counsel for the applicant, the
present matter was listed on 26/03/2017 for early hearing of the
matter before this Court. On that date, counsel for the applicant
has submitted that on 20/03/2018, the trial Court has closed his
right to produce defence evidence and the case is fixed today for
pronouncement of judgment, therefore, he prayed for stay of
pronouncement of judgment. However, on the perusal of record, it
was found that no such order sheet has been produced by the
applicant to show that without giving sufficient opportunity, his
defence evidence has been closed. Therefore, the status of the trial
was called for from the trial Court, by which it came into the
knowledge of this Court that the case is still listed for defence
evidence on 28/03/2018.
</p><p id="p_5">05.         Thus this Court intends to place on record its dis-
pleasure with regard to this practice in which, without producing
copy of the order sheets, a prayer was made to stay the
pronouncement of the judgment and also the casual approach of
the learned counsel for the applicant, whereby he made a statement
before this Court that the case is fixed today for pronouncement of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                          3</span>

                  THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
            M.Cr.C. No.5785/2018 (<a href="/doc/64153664/" id="a_13">Kowa Spinarse Ltd., &amp; Ors. vs. M.P. Pollution Board</a>)

          judgment without verifying the current status of the case. This
          Court would not appreciate such practice and hope that the same
          shall not be repeated.
</p><p id="p_6">          06.         With the aforesaid observations, these miscellaneous
          applications filed by the applicants are hereby dismissed.
