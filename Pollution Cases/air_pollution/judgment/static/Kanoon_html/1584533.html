<p id="p_1">ORDER
 

Anil Dev Singh, J. 
</p> 

<p id="p_2">1.      These are applications on behalf of the petitioners under section  151 
CPC for seeking clarification of the order dated August 6, 1998 whereby the writ petitions filed by the applicants were disposed of. 
</p> 

<p id="p_3">2.   In the writ petitions, the petitioners had impugned order of the third respondent,  Delhi Pollution Control Committee dated May 25,  1998  whereby the petitioners were directed to stop functioning and operating their units in Delhi with immediate effect. The petitioners are manufacturers of rubber auto  tubes. According to the impugned orders, the industries of the  petitioners  manufacturing rubber auto tubes fall in category H(a) in  Annexure III to the Master Plan, 2001. It needs to be noticed that industries  falling in H(a) categories are hazardous in nature &amp; are consequently prohibited  to operate within the Union Territory of Delhi. The impugned orders  go on to recite that the Supreme Court in I.A.224/94 in Writ Petition  (Civil) No.46/77 has held that the manufacturing units falling in group H(a) cannot be  permitted to operate and function in Delhi and such Industries  may  be re-allocated to any other industrial estate in the National Capital Region. 
</p> 

<p id="p_4">3.   On  August  17, 1998 the following order was passed by this  Court  in C.W.Ps:- 
</p> 

<p id="p_5">     Mr.  Ishwar Singh appears for the Central Pollution Control Board.  He has  been apprised of the orders dated August 6, 1998 and August 14,  1998. He states that he will file an affidavit with regard to the question  which has  been  raised  and specified in order dated August 14,  1998.  Let  the affidavit be filed within five days. Rejoinder to the affidavit, if any, be filed  within  two days thereafter. In case the Central  Pollution  Control Board has not performed any tests in that event they should permit the writ petitioner  in Writ Petition No. 2947/98 to run the industry for  the  purposes of enabling the Central Pollution Control Board to perform the requisite  tests. It will also be open to the Delhi Pollution Control  Committee to  perform the tests. If the Delhi Pollution Control Committee is to  perform the tests it is clarified that the inspection by the Central Pollution Control Board and Delhi Pollution Control Committee will be made at one and the same time. 
</p> 

<p id="p_6">4.   This order was passed with the consent of the parties. By means of the instant  applications,  the applicants seek  re-call/clarification  of  the order  dated  August 6, 1998 on the ground that the  third  respondent  had orally  advanced the plea based on <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_1">section 21</a> of the Air(Prevention &amp;  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 on August 6, 1998 &amp; at the spur of the  moment petitioners' counsel was not able to cross check the plea. Under the  bonafide belief that the petitioners falls within the purview of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">section 21</a>  of the  Act, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner did not  raise  any objection  to the same. At this stage, it will be convenient  to  extract para 4 of the applications:- 
</p><p id="p_7">      "That  it is pertinent to mention here that since the above  mentioned  argument happened at the spur of the moment and that  too when  the  petitioner's counsel was not able to cross  check  the plea of the respondent No.3 because of the above mentioned  fact, herefore,  under the bonafide belief that the  petitioner  falls within the purview of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_4">section 21</a> of the said Act, the counsel for the petitioner could not raise any objection to the same." 
</p> 

<p id="p_8">5.   On  August  14,  1998 learned senior counsel for  the  petitioners  in support of the applications submitted that the petitioners were not  having any  industrial plant within the meaning of <a href="/doc/116131139/" id="a_5">section 2(k)</a> read <a href="/doc/152587107/" id="a_6">section  2(a)</a> 
of the Act and as such <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_7">section 21</a> thereof was not applicable. <a href="/doc/152587107/" id="a_8">Section 2(a)</a>, 
<a href="/doc/116131139/" id="a_9">2(k)</a> and <a href="/doc/75811073/" id="a_10">section 2(l)</a> read as follows:- 
</p>  

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     2(a) "air pollution" means any solid, liquid or gaseous substance (including noise) present in the atmosphere in such concentration as may be or tend to be injurious to human beings or other living creatures or plants or property or environment;
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     xx xx xx 
 

    2(k)  "industrial plant" means any plant used for any  industrial or trade purposes and emitting any air pollutant into the  atmosphere; 
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     xx xx xx 
 

     21(1). Restrictions on use of certain industrial plants-
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     Subject  to  the  provisions of this section,  no  person  shall, without  the  previous consent of the State Board,  establish  or operate any industrial plant in an air pollution control area: 
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     Provided that a person operating any industrial plant in any  air pollution  control  area immediately before the  commencement  of <a href="/doc/106204869/" id="a_11">Section 9</a> of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act, 1987, for which no consent was necessary prior to  such  commencement, may continue to do so for a period of three  months from such commencement or, if he has made an application for such consent within the said period of three months, till the disposal of such application. 
</blockquote> 

<p id="p_9">6.   It  was the submission of learned senior counsel for  the  petitioners that the industries of the petitioners were not emitting any air pollutants and therefore, the provisions of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_12">sections 21</a>, <a href="/doc/152587107/" id="a_13">2(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/116131139/" id="a_14">2(k)</a> of the Act were not attracted. In order to give a fair opportunity to the petitioners,  the Central  Pollution Control Board was directed to specify whether  they  had subjected the emissions from the industries of the petitioners to  Chemical tests. On August 17, 1998 the Central Pollution Control Board was  directed to perform tests in case it had not performed the same earlier. In order to enable the Central Pollution Control Board to perform the requisite  tests, the  writ petitioner in Writ Petition No.2947/98, was permitted to run  the industry.  On September 16, 1998 the Central Pollution Control  Board  presented its report. The report concludes as follows:- 
</p>  

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">     1.  The  high concentration of particulate  matter  (3604  microgramme/cum)  was observed in the compounding and  extruding  section. 
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     2.  The concentration of suspended particulate matter is  ambient air  (654 microgramme/cum) exceeds the limit (400 mg/Nm  3).  The height of stack connected to the boiler is to be increased to 11m based on minimum stack height regulations. 
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">     3.  The concentration of suspended particulate matter in  ambient air    (654    microgramme/cum)   exceeds    the    limit    (200 microgramme/cum). However, the concentration of Benzi (a)  preen in  ambient  air  (5.41 nanogramme/cum) was found  to  be  within limits (10 nanogramme/cum). </blockquote>
 

<p id="p_10">     4.  Benzi
</p><p id="p_11">  (a) preen and Benzi
</p><p id="p_12"> (e) preen were not  detected  in work zone area. 
</p> 

<p id="p_13">7.   As  is  evident from items No.1 to 3 above,  the  emissions  contained particulate  matter beyond the prescribed limits. It is not  disputed  that the factories are not located in residential areas. As per the Notification dated  April 11, 1994 issued by the Central Pollution Control  Board  under <a href="/doc/193811576/" id="a_15">section  16(2)(h)</a> of the Act, the National Ambient Air  Quality  Standards with regard to residential, rural and other areas are as follows:- 
</p><pre id="pre_1">      Pollutant           Time Weighted  Residential,Rural 
                    average        &amp; other areas 
      
     Sulphur Dioxide     Annual Average      60pg/m3 
     (SO 2)              24 hours            80pg/m3 
     Suspended Part-     Annual Average      140pg/m3
     iculate Matter      24 hours            200pg/m3
     (SPM) 
 

</pre><p id="p_14">8.   Thus  it  is obvious that the concentration of  suspended  particulate present  in ambient air at the time of the test far exceeds the  prescribed limits.  Though  the Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi  has  concluded that concentration of sulphur dioxide in the boiler emissions is within the prescribed limit the standards laid down in the above Notification show  to the contrary. It needs to be noticed that the results relating to  particulate matter and concentration of sulphur dioxide were obtained after  short run of the factory. Even during short run of the factory, the concentration of  sulphur dioxide and particulate matter were beyond the  standards  laid down by the Central Pollution Control Board. Thus the submission of learned senior  counsel for the petitioners that the industries of the  petitioners did  not fall within the purview of the <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_16">section 21</a> of the Act is  not  well 
founded.  As per <a href="/doc/116131139/" id="a_17">section 2(k)</a> of the Act, industrial plant means any  plant used  for any industrial or trade purposes and emitting any  air  pollutant into  the atmosphere. As per <a href="/doc/152587107/" id="a_18">section 2(a)</a>, air pollution  inter-alia  means any  solid, liquid or gaseous substance present in the atmosphere  in  such concentration as may be injurious to human beings or other living creatures or  plants  or property or environment. The National  Ambient  Air  Quality Standards  laid down by the Central Pollution Control Board  under  <a href="/doc/193811576/" id="a_19">section 16(2)(h)</a> of the Act are meant to preserve the environment. In case sulphur dioxide, suspended particulate, carbon monoxide etc. exceed the time weighted averages laid down in Notification obviously the industry releasing such emissions  will attract the provisions of <a href="/doc/152587107/" id="a_20">sections 2(a)</a>, <a href="/doc/116131139/" id="a_21">2(k)</a> and <a href="/doc/195059463/" id="a_22">21(1)</a>  of the  Act. Therefore, such an industry cannot be allowed to run without  the previous  consent  of the State Pollution Control Board. Thus there  is  no justification  for  the petitioners to ask for recall of  the  order  dated August 6, 1998. 
</p> 

<p id="p_15">9.   In  the  written submissions filed after the close of  arguments,  the petitioners  have submitted that the Ambient Air Quality  Statistics,  1995 reveal that particulate matter in ambient air is far in excess of 200  ug/m3 even  in residential areas of Delhi. The purport of the submissions of  the petitioners  appears to be that as in certain areas of Delhi, the  particulate  matter exceeds 200 micro grammes/cum, the particulate matter  emitted in excess by the industry should be over-looked. Obviously such an argument cannot be accepted as it will strike a death blow to the efforts to  eradicate  pollution. One cannot loose sight of the fact that the  concentration of suspended particulate matters are chiefly due to the emissions from  the factories,  which  have not taken measures for  installation  of  pollution control  devices, and vehicular traffic. The emissions must conform to  the standards  prescribed by law. The written submissions also  emphasise  that the  tests were performed for 370 minutes and for the purposes  of  working out the 24 hourly mean the readings for 370 minutes is to be calculated  as 
per below for arriving at the mean :- 
</p> 

<p id="p_16">     654 x 370 = 168 
  

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">    1400 </span>
 

</p><p id="p_17">10.  The petitioners do not seem to be correct in stating that the particulate  matter emitted at the time of test run of the industry was less  than the prescribed limits. When the unit was run for 370 minutes, the  particulate  matter emitted was to the tune of 654 ug/m3 at the top floor  of  the industry. The fugitive emission was as follows:- 
</p>  

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">     FUGITIVE  
      Compounding    500 - 1700     SPM       3604
               (120 mins.) 
     Curing(1)      1040 - 1240    SPM       2796
     Section        (120 mins.) 
     Curing (2)     305 - 1505     SPM 1     833
     Section        (120 mins.) 
     Curing (3)     1510 - 1710    SPM       1220
     Section        (120 mins.) 
 

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">     11.  Thus  it seems that even when the factory was running for  a lesser  period  of  time, the emission levels were  found  to  be beyond  the  prescribed limits. The emission  of  hazardous  substances  endangers life. If the poisonous gases  and  particulate matters are allowed to be thrown into the atmosphere, the  future of  ten  million inhabitants of Delhi would be  at  stake.  While industrial  growth is extremely important, more important is  the preservation of environment. It must be realised that the  industry should strive for sustainable growth which is compatible with environment. 
</blockquote> 

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">     12.  Learned  senior counsel for the petitioners  also  submitted that the manufacturing of auto tubes cannot fall under category H (a)  in Annexure III to the Master Plan. Learned counsel for  the Central  Pollution  Control Board has drawn my attention  to  the decision of the Supreme Court rendered in M.C. Mehta Vs. Union of India and others,  in which it was held that as per  the mandatory provisions of the Master Plan,  the  hazardous and noxious industrial units falling in category H(a) can not  be permitted  to  operate in Delhi. The Supreme  Court  observed  as follows:- 
</blockquote>  

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">    "There  is no doubt that the H(a) industries have been  operating in  Delhi illegally during the last about three years. They  must stop  operating in Delhi and relocated themselves to  some  other industrial estate in the NCR. We are further of the view that the concerned  officers of the Delhi Administration are  equally  responsible for continuous illegal operation of the H(a) industries in  the city of Delhi. The Chief Secretary, Delhi  Administration shall  hold  an  inquiry  and  fix  the  responsibility  of   the officers/officials who have been wholly re-miss and negligent  in the  performance of the statutory duties entrusted to them  under the Master Plan." 
</blockquote> 

<p id="p_18">13.  The  Delhi  Pollution Control Committee filed a  list  of  industries, which  were categorised as H(a) and H(b) before the Supreme Court. In  this list some of the industries manufacturing tyres and tubes also figure. By subsequent  order  dated September 6, 1996 in the case of  <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_23">M.C.  Mehta  vs. Union of India</a> the Supreme Court noted that the Committee after considering the objections of the units, which were given public/individual notices  to show  cause  why they be not declared as category H(a) or  H(b)  industries under the Master Plan, had classified 532 units as falling in 'H' category. These included 443 units which did not respond to the public notices and 89 units whose objections were rejected by the Committee after due  consideration.  It  also noticed that the Committee dealt with yet another  290  'H' category industries consisting of 240 brick kilns, 43 electric furnaces and 1 forging unit. Therefore, a total of 822 industries were classified by the Committee as falling in category 'H'. These industries were directed to  be reallocated. As already pointed out that some of the units producing rubber tyre and tubes were classified as falling under H(a) category. The names of these  industries are: M/s.Asiatic Rubber Industries,  M/s.Calcutta  Rubber Factory,  M/s.Jupiter Rubber Products and M/s.Ray Industry. Therefore,  the question  is  when the lists of industries were filed  before  the  Supreme Court and the industries falling therein were classified as H(a) Industries and  were directed to be reallocated, it is not for this Court  to  examine the  question as to whether or not these industries fall in  category  (H). When  this  aspect of the matter was brought to the notice of  the  learned counsel  for the petitioners, he stated that he  will  take  appropriate steps to seek clarification from the Apex Court. 
</p> 

<p id="p_19">14.  For  the  aforesaid reasons, the order dated August 6, 1998  does  not require any clarification. Accordingly, the applications are dismissed.
