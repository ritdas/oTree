                             JUDGEMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">PER HON'BLE MR. I.J. KAPOOR, TECHNICAL MEMBER

     Chhattisgarh State Power Distribution Company Limited, Raipur is

     the Appellant in the present Appeal No. 75 of 2015 filed under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_1">section

     111</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003 against the Impugned Order dated

     02.01.2015 passed by the Chhattisgarh State Electricity Regulatory

     Commission (hereinafter referred to as "State Commission"-

     Respondent No. 1) in Petition No. 77/2013(D) whereby the State

     Commission has adjudicated upon the claim of Jindal Power and

     Steel Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Respondent No.2") as

     regards captive status of its 4x135 MW power plant situated at

     Raigarh.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.   The Appellant is the distribution company in the State of

     Chhattisgarh. In this Appeal, Chhattisgarh State Power Distribution

     Company Limited being the State Transmission Utility in Chhattisgarh

     is Respondent No. 3.

     Electricity Act, 2003 against the same Impugned Order dated

     Chhattisgarh and in this Appeal, the Respondent No. 1, Respondent

     No.2 are the same as that in the case of Appeal No. 75 of 2015,

     however, Chhattisgarh State Power Distribution Company Limited is

     the Respondent No.3.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.   Since the issues involved in both the Appeals are same and against

     the same Impugned Order dated 02.01.2015 passed by the State

     Commission, we shall be deciding both the above appeals by the

     Appellants by the common order.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     Respondent No.2 has set up a power plant consisting of 4 units of

     135 MW each i.e. 540 MW situated at Dongamahua, Raigarh

     (Chhattisgarh) (hereinafter referred to as "DCPP") which is claimed

     to be captive in entirety.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.   Respondent No.2 is engaged in the business of manufacture of steel

     and has steel plant in Raigarh alongwith a captive power plant of 286

     MW capacity for meeting the power requirement of its steel plant and

     has been availing power import connection from the Appellant

     at 220 KV.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.   In addition to this 286 MW power plant, the Respondent No.2 has

     also set up 4x135 MW power plant (DCPP) at the same location

     which it claims to be captive in its entirety.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                            Page 3 of 29</span>
</p><p id="p_8">                                                            Appeal Nos. 75 &amp; 69 of 2015




</p><p id="p_9">7.   286 MW captive power plant of the Respondent No.2 is connected to

     the steel manufacturing plant, which in turn, is connected to the State

     grid through 220 KV station of the Respondent No.3 at Raigarh.

</p><p id="p_10">8.   As far as 540 MW of DCPP is concerned, as per the Appellants, its

     two units i.e. unit 1 &amp; 2 are connected to this steel plant under the

     captive mode, however, the other 2 units i.e. unit 3 &amp; 4 are not

     connected with the industrial load of the Respondent No.2 and are

     connected to the switchyard of the power plant of the M/s. Jindal

     Power Ltd., a subsidiary company of Respondent No.2 which, in turn,

     is connected to the regional grid through 400 KV line with inter

     connection line at Raipur. As per the Appellants, units 3 &amp; 4 of DCPP

     are not in captive mode but maintaining a merchant Status.

</p><p id="p_11">9.   The State Commission in its Impugned Order dated 02.01.2015 in

     Petition No. 77/2013(D) has decided to accord the captive status to

     all the 4 units of 135 MW of DCPP which in the opinion of the

     Appellants ought to have been for only unit 1 &amp; 2 of DCPP and not for

     unit 3 &amp; 4 of DCPP and unit 3 &amp; 4 of DCPP should have been treated

     as merchant power rather than categorizing the same under captive

     use resulting into loss of revenue to the Appellants on account of

                                                             Appeal Nos. 75 &amp; 69 of 2015




      non-recovery of cross subsidy surcharge since the same would not

      be applicable to the captive units.
</p>
<p id="p_12">10.   The Appellant is functioning as distribution licensee in the

      Chhattisgarh State and is performing all functions and duties

      pertaining to distribution of electricity. The Appellant is entitled to

      recover such charges from generator and other persons as are

      admissible and leviable under the provisions of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_3">Electricity Act</a>, 2003

      and the Regulations framed by the State Commission which has

      been set up under the provisions of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_4">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 to perform all

      such functions as are enjoyed upon it under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_5">Section 86(1)</a> of the

      Electricity Act, 2003, including adjudication of disputes between

      licensees and the generating companies.
</p>
<p id="p_13">11.   The main issue in the present Appeal is regarding grant of captive

      status to all the 4 units of 135 MW each of DCPP by the State

      Commission to Respondent No.2 which has resulted in loss of

      revenue on account of non-recovery of cross subsidy surcharge by

      the Appellants from the Respondent No.2 in respect of units 3 &amp; 4

      consisting of 135 MW each of DCPP.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12.   The Appellants submit that cross subsidy surcharge is leviable on all

      consumers for balancing of cost of supply between subsidizing


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                               Page 5 of 29</span>
                                                             Appeal Nos. 75 &amp; 69 of 2015




      consumers and subsidized consumers of the distribution licensees

      which is under universal supply obligation under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_6">Section 43</a> of the

      Electricity Act, 2003 which mandate supply of electricity on request to

      consumers of the State and the above balance between the

      subsidizing and subsidized consumers cannot be disturbed otherwise

      it would result into an enhanced tariff for the subsidized consumers.

      The Appellants further state that the cross subsidy surcharge is

      recovered from the consumers who are not availing supply from the

      distribution licensees and the only exception being a captive use for

      which cross subsidy surcharge is not payable.

</p><p id="p_15">13.   The Appellants submits that under the prevailing Regulations of the

      State Commission, grant of connectivity is necessarily to be sought

      for injecting power by a captive generating plant into intra state

      transmission system and a detailed procedure is prescribed for

      seeking such connectivity by filing of application to the nodal agency

      i.e. State Transmission Utility (STU) or the transmission licensee or

      the State Load Despatch Centre (SLDC) in the prescribed format and

      on receipt of the application, the nodal agency in consultation and

      through coordination with other agencies involved in bilateral

      transactions, shall process the application and carry out the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                               Page 6 of 29</span>
                                                            Appeal Nos. 75 &amp; 69 of 2015




      necessary inter connection study. The Appellants made a reference

      of Regulations 10(5) of the State Commission's Regulations, 2011

      which states that intra state user in case of expansion of capacity

      including captive generating plant has to make a fresh application for

      modification in connectivity arrangements and the Regulations do not

      permit that if any unit of generating plant has obtained connectivity

      with the grid, the other unit added subsequently at the same location

      can also get automatically connected with the grid without obtaining

      separate permission, as such the Appellants alleged that only unit 1 &amp;

      2 of DCPP were given connectivity by the STU under the captive

      category and subsequently additional units 3 &amp; 4 at DCPP for which a

      separate permission has not been sought by the Respondent No.2

      from STU/SLDC ought not to be considered under captive use.

</p><p id="p_16">14.   In support of the above arguments of the Appellants, they have cited

      the relevant extracts of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_7">Electricity Act</a>, 2003, State Commission's

      prevailing Regulations,<a href="/doc/8161741/" id="a_8"> Grid Code</a> etc.

</p><p id="p_17">15.   The issue in question in both the above Appeals is whether the

      State Commission in its Impugned Order dated 02.01.2015 erred

      in considering the 4 units     of 135 MW      each of DCPP under

      active use instead of only first 2 units of 135 MW each of DCPP?


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                              Page 7 of 29</span>
</p><p id="p_18">                                                             Appeal Nos. 75 &amp; 69 of 2015




</p><p id="p_19">16.   We have heard at length Ms. Suparna Srivastava, Learned Counsel

      for both the Appellants, Ms. Sanjay Sen, Learned Sr. Counsel for

      Respondent No.2 and Mr. C.K. Rai, Learned Counsel for the

      Respondent No.1 and considered their written submissions and

      arguments put forth by the rival parties during the hearing before us

      and our observations are detailed herein as under.

</p><p id="p_20">17.   As alleged by the Appellants that the State Commission erred in

      holding the entire plant of DCPP comprising of all the 4 units of 135

      MW each being treated as captive for the relevant years even when

      the admitted position on record before the State Commission has

      been that it is only two units of DCPP i.e. units 1 &amp; 2 which are

      connected to the steel plant (the captive load) and as such, it is only

      the first two units of DCPP which can be considered having captive

      status. The main grievance of the Appellants as described in the

      above Appeals is that when the other two units of DCPP i.e. units 3

      &amp; 4 are not connected to the steel plant and have not gained

      connectivity with the system of Respondent No. 3 as mandatorily

      required under the Connectivity Regulations and<a href="/doc/8161741/" id="a_9"> the Grid Code</a> but

      generated from these units and supplied to the steel plant does not

      qualify as captive use and as such, attracts levy of cross-subsidy

      surcharge as mandated under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_10">section 42</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003.

</p><p id="p_21">18.   The main allegation of the Appellant is that the cross-subsidy

      surcharge has wrongly been denied by the State Commission to the

      Appellants by treating the said unit 3 &amp; 4 of DCPP also as being for

      captive use, thereby causing grave financial loss to the Appellants.

      That too in light of the fact that under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_11">Electricity

      Act</a>, 2003, cross-subsidy surcharge has been maintained so as to

      benefit various classes of consumers of the distribution licensees on

      account of recovery of cross-subsidy surcharge and in their view, any

      denial of rightful recovery of cross-subsidy surcharge would ultimately

      adversely affect these subsidized consumers of the distribution

      licensees.

<p id="p_22">19.   The Appellants further submitted that as per the provisions of the

      Connectivity Regulations notified by the State Commission, it is

      essentially required as per the Regulation 10(3) that a captive

      generating plant is to mandatorily seek connectivity with the

      Appellants' system for injecting power in the transmission system by

      making an application in the prescribed form detailing therein the

      quantum of power to be injected in the system.          In case of any

      enhancement for injection, a fresh application for modification in

      connectivity arrangement is required and in view of this for each

      generating unit of a captive generating plant which is desirous of

      connecting to the State Grid(the Appellant's system), separate

      connectivity is necessarily to be obtained.      The Appellants further

      state that the prescribed Regulations do not permit that if any unit of

      the generating plant has obtained connectivity with the State grid, the

      other units can also be connected with the grid without obtaining

      separate connectivity and the State Grid code also prescribed the

      connectivity conditions and criteria for users connected to or seeking

      connection to intra-State transmission system.

      examined and as per the certified generation of energy data for unit s

      3 &amp; 4 of DCPP obtained from the Chief Electrical Inspector, Raipur, it

      was observed that the generation from unit 3 was also fed to steel

      State grid without obtaining connectivity as mandatorily required

      under the State Commission's Regulations, 2011.         The Appellants

      further stated that during the matter was heard by the State

      Commission, the Appellants brought to the notice of the State

      Commission the Judgment dated 30.04.2013 of this Tribunal passed

</p>
<p id="p_27">      "Pre-identification of the unit/units is also essential from
      prevention of gaming aspect as illustrated by the following
      example:
</p>
<p id="p_28">      Two units at a generating station of 100 MW and 200 MW
      produced say 1000 MU and 2000 MU in a year respectively. The
      Captive user consumed around 2000 MU in a particular year.
      Consumption of 2000 MU is more than 51% of total generation of
      two units, therefore the captive user would claim total
      consumption as captive identifying both units as captive
      generators. Suppose captive user could consume only 1100
      MU, it would identify Unit B as captive and claim full 1100 MU as

captive consumption. Whereas consumption of 1100 MU, being
less than 51% of total generation from both units, would not
have qualified to be captive if both the units were identified as
captive generators. Further, assume in a particular year the
captive generator could consume only 900 MU. It would identify
Unit A as captive and claim 900 MU as captive consumption
which it could not have, if both the units or unit B was identified
as captive generator."
</p>
<p id="p_29">It is clear from the above discussion that a captive consumer may

indulge in gaming and identify any unit as captive depending upon its

own consumption during the relevant year. Such an arrangement

would frustrate the very purpose of law.
</p>
<p id="p_30">In light of the above judgment, the Appellants alleged that the present

case of the Respondent No.2 is gaming with the ulterior motive of

claiming undue benefit of exemption from payment of cross-subsidy

surcharge and the Appellants pleaded before the State Commission

that the Respondent No.2 is necessarily to be directed to pay cross-

subsidy surcharge and the Appellants be allowed to claim the same

under the Supplementary Bill, however, the State Commission has

failed to appreciate the allegations put forth by the Appellants and

considered the units 3 &amp; 4 of DCPP under captive use without

realizing that for units 3 &amp; 4 of DCPP, the Respondent No. 2 has not

obtained necessary connectivity from the concerned authority as

required in law.

      Respondent No.2 suffers from serious legal infirmity and as such, is

      liable to be set aside.

      the line diagram indicating therein the existing connectivity status of

      all the 4 units of DCPP &amp; claimed that the same was approved by the

      Chief Electrical Inspector and further stated that all the 4 units from

      the stage of inception i.e. DPR stage itself have been envisaged to be

      for captive use and unit 1 &amp; 2 are connected to unit 3 &amp; 4 through

      Auxiliary Bus and the generation from unit 1 &amp; 2 of DCPP is meant to

      final authority in terms of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_12">Section 162</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003.

      Respondent No. 2 further submitted that the Appellant has not

      questioned these findings of the Chief Electrical Inspector and as

      such this line diagram has attained finality.

      will not connect more than 2 units of 135 MW at any point has not

      been violated in any manner. The surplus power from unit 3 &amp; 4 are

      sold to third party on short term basis through CTU system which is

      maintained by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and in the

      event of outages of unit 1 &amp; 2 of DCPP, the generation from unit 3 &amp;

      4 is used for supply of power to the captive load of its steel plant.

      STU after taking appropriate approval from the State Load Despatch

      Centre and units 3 &amp; 4 of DCPP are connected to Inter-State

      Transmission system of CTU after taking appropriate approval from

      CTU.    At any point of time only two units of DCPP would be

      taken into consideration for determining the status of CPP and it

      further stated that since twin test for determining CPP status was fully

      passed in the present case, the State Commission very rightly vide its

      earlier orders dated 01.07.2013 and 05.03.2013 upheld the captive

requirement of its steel plant and surplus power after captive usage

was proposed to be sold in the national market for which it has

availed connectivity with the CTU and in support of the same, the

relevant portion of the Central Commission's Order dated 09.05.2011

passed in Petition No. 105 of 2010 relating to application for grant of

Inter-State Transmission license is reproduced below:-

      (JPL) has set up a generating station of 1000(4x250) MW
      Thermal Power Plant at Tamnar in Raigarh District of
      Chhattisgarh. As part of the generation project, JPL has
      established 258 km dedicated transmission line i.e. 400 kV
      D/C Transmission Line from JPL, Tamnar Power Plant to
      Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL)
      substation at Kumhari in Raiapur District of Chhattisgarh
      for evacuation of power from the place of generation to the
      interconnection point for onward inter-State Transmission.
      The applicant has further submitted that Jindal Steel and
      Power Limited (JSPL) is engaged in the business of
      manufacture of steel and steel products.         JSPL has
      independently established captive power plants at Raigarh
      for an aggregate capacity of 358 MW and is in the process
      of commissioning an additional 540 MW at Dongamahua,

     Raigarh District. The power units of JSPL are connected to
     the swtichyard of the generation project of JPL. JSPL has
     some surplus generation from time to time which it is in a
     position to sell to third parties subject to applicable laws
     and regulations.

<p id="p_63">5.   The applicant vide its affidavit dated 19.04.2011 has
     submitted that the Jindal Steel and Power Limited (JSPL)
     vide Power of Attorney dated 5.11.2008 authorised it to do
     all such acts as was necessary for obtaining long-term
     open access with Central Transmission Utility (CTU) for
     evacuation of its power. It has been further submitted that
     in pursuance of the said Power of Attorney, long term open
     access was applied by the applicant on behalf of JSPL for
     transmission of 400 MW though PGCIL line and the
     applicant vide its letters dated 16.09.2009 and 29.09.2009
     brought to the notice of PGCIL that the said 400 MW would
     comprise:-

     Transmission Agreement (BPTA) was signed on 24.2.2010
     between the JPL and PGCIL for 400 MW of power with
     bifurcation of 225 MW from 4x135 MW captive power plant
     at Dongamahua of JSPL and 175 MW from existing 4x250
     MW Tamnar Thermal Power Station of JPL. Even though
     the name of JSPL is missing in the LTOA granted by PGCIL
     and BPTA signed on 24.2.2010, it is evident that JSPL has
     already obtained Long Term Open Access from PGCIL for
     transmission of 225 MW power from its captive power plant
     at Dongamahua.      It has been further submitted that
     considering that JSPL has already authorised JPL to
     obtain LTOA on its behalf and also that there is no change
     in the location of plant nor change in the quantum of
     power, the application already made should be treated as
     having been made on behalf of JSPL"

           As mentioned above, the connectivity with the CTU sought by

           the Respondent No.2 for 225 MW was from the 4 x 135 MW

           captive power plant of DCPP and the grant of transmission

<p id="p_68">34.   The Learned Counsel for the State Commission stated that the State

      Commission in the present Petition has reiterated its earlier decision

      made in various petitions (including period under dispute) and held

      that 4x135 MW power plan of Respondent No.2 is maintaining

      captive status and, therefore, levy of cross-subsidy surcharge for said

      period will not be applicable, however, parallel operation charges will

      be leviable as per prevailing Rules &amp; Regulations.

</p><p id="p_69">35.   The State Commission also stated in the Impugned Order that if there

      is any allegation for violation of grid code etc., the State Commission

      was of the view that the said issue has to be decided separately and

      can not become subject matter of levy of cross-subsidy surcharge on

      the ground that on account of connectivity with CTU, unit No. 3 &amp; 4 of

      DCPP have lost their CPP status.

</p><p id="p_72">36.   After having gone through the submissions as made above, we do

      not find any ground to consider units 3 &amp; 4 of DCPP not under captive

      status even considering the fact that the Respondent No.2 has

      obtained open access to sell the electricity in the market through CTU

      network. In light of the fact that the DCPP was from the inception

      itself developed as CPP and has passed twin test laid down in the

      statute i.e. the Respondent No.2 having equity share of more than

      26% and electricity consumption for captive use not less than 51% of

      the total generation from such plant and in our observation, the

      Respondent No.2 has maintained captive status of all the four units of

      DCPP in the past years under question.

      documents submitted by the Respondent No.2 to the State

      Commission have been perused by the State Commission while

      concluding the matter    and the relevant extracts of the Impugned

      Order dated 02.01.2015 is reproduced below:-

      "48. Under the provisions of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_19">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 connectivity of
           TG-3 and TG-4 with CTU does not make them as IPP. As
           per the Electricity Rules, 2005 which provides a twin test
           for classifying a CGP. According to which the consumer of
           electricity must own at least 26% of the ownership of the
           CGP. Further, it must consume minimum 51% of the net
           generation of the CGP. In the present case, it is beyond
           doubt that the petitioner owns 100% share of TG-3 and TG-

    4 and is consuming more than 51% of the net generation
    from the CGPs as has been accepted by the report of the
    Chief Electrical Inspector.
</p>
<p id="p_75">49. The Commission in its previous orders of determination of
    captive status of various CPPs in the State for the year
    2010-11 and 2011-12 has admitted TG-3 and TG-4 of DCPP
    as a part of petitioner CGP and therefore it don't needs
    further elaboration. The respondent plea that TG-3 and TG-
    4 are connected to the CTU, it is deemed to be an IPP is
    entirely misplaced because the status of IPP/ CGP is not
    based on connectivity but as per the Electricity Rules, 2005
    it is based on ownership and consumption criteria alone,
    which is very clear from the reading of the above rules.

</p><p id="p_76">50. During the arguments, the petitioner was advised to
    explain whether he has taken all possible steps in
    declaring TG-3 and TG-4 as captive units. In response, the
    petitioner through its petition and rejoinder also relied on
    the affidavit dated 15.05.2014 has enclosed additional
    documents which, inter alia, relied on the following:-

    "3.   That the issue in the instant petition is with regard to
          the captive status of JSPL's 4x135 MW power plant at
          Dongamahua, in particular with regard to unit 3 and

<p id="p_96">52. From the various submissions made by the petitioner
    and respondent, at no stage, it is observed that JSPL
    is operating its plant in the two systems parallelly.
    Further, the ability to switch from the CTU to the STU
    system was done with the full knowledge and
    approval of the Chief Electrical Inspector as is
    evidenced in the approved line diagram. The Chief
    Electrical Inspector while computing/ certifying the
    energy data for the year 2010-11 and 2011-2 was fully
    aware of the fact that JSPLs TG-3 and TG-4 was
    supplying power through the CTU and also self
    consuming power during the period when TG- 1 and
    TG-2 were in outage. At no stage has the Chief
    Electrical Inspector placed any objection to the said
    arrangement or issued any show cause notice to
    JSPL. Even if there is an allegation of violation<a href="/doc/8161741/" id="a_22"> of Grid

      the captive status to all the four units of DCPP and they have been

      consistent in maintaining the same stand even in the earlier orders

      issued by them and very rightly so.
</p>
<p id="p_98">39.   In our opinion, the DCPP has been envisaged as captive power plant

      right from the inception and meets both the stipulated conditions

      discussed above for obtaining captive status irrespective of the fact

      that it is besides connected to STU is also connected to CTU, it would

      retain its status as captive so long as it passes twin test as laid down

      in the law.
