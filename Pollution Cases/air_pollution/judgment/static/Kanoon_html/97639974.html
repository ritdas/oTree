Coram:      Hon'ble Sudhanshu Dhulia, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">            Hon'ble Ramesh Chandra Khulbe, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">            This petition is a public interest petition filed by
a practicing lawyer before this Court. He has raised concern
about violations of environmental laws, at the hands of the
private respondents, as well as violations of the orders of
this Court as well as of Allahabad High Court, which were
for the protection of "bugyals" in Uttarakhand. These
orders, inter alia restricted human activities on a "bugyal"
in Uttarakhand. We will shortly discuss as to what is a
"bugyal".
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.          The cause of action for filing the PIL according to
the   petitioner,     came      because       the    Government           of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>


Uttarakhand had given permission to respondent nos. 12
and 13 to hold wedding ceremonies of their sons at "Auli",
in District Chamoli, Uttarakhand. The case of the petitioner
is that where the wedding ceremonies, reception and a
whole lot of other activities are to take place, is a "Bugyal"
and activities of this nature, at such a large scale, cannot
be permitted on a Bugyal, which is an eco sensitive place.
"Bugyal" is the name given in Uttarakhand for Alpine
meadows. A "bugyal" is a soft grass cover on land, high up
in the mountains, beyond the tree lines, and is an
ecosystem in itself.
</p>


<p id="p_4">3.         It is true that what was to take place at "Auli", or
rather what eventually took place there was not a simple
wedding or a ceremony. It was a mega wedding of members
of a billionaire non-resident Indian family, and as per the
newspaper reports it was in all a Rs. 200 crore lavish
wedding event, or series of events, spread over a period of
an entire week. It was to be attended by a large numbers of
guests, including Movie celebrities.
</p>


<p id="p_5">4.         Respondent nos. 12 and 13 are members of a
super rich Indian family ("Gupta family", for short), which
has business interests in South Africa. It seems that the
Gupta family was looking for an exotic destination for the
wedding of their children and finally settled for "Auli",
which is a remote mountain resort, known for skiing in
winters. In their counter affidavit they have justified
organising this Mega event at "Auli", inter alia, on ground
that this "wedding event", at "Auli" in Uttarakhand, will give
a much needed boost to tourism in Uttarakhand and will
bring Uttarakhand on the world tourist map! The State
Government seems to be only supporting this view.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              3</span>




<p id="p_6">5.        There is no specific prayer before this Court for
stopping the ceremony or the weddings. Following were the
prayers made by the petitioner:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                     "a. Issue appropriate writ, rule, order
               or    direction   appropriate     in   nature

               all effective steps for preserving the
               Environment      and    Eco    balance    and
               atmosphere at Auli and its vicinity in terms
               of environmental law and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Pollution Control

               all steps to prevent any type of pollution at
               Auli and its vicinity by proposed marriage
               ceremony      organized   by    the    private
               respondents and also to declare any type of
               permission contrary to the law and direction
               of the Court is void, arbitrary and illegal
               and further to remove any type of
               construction of activities which is running
               contrary to the law, so the fragile ecosystem
               of Auli Bugyal (meadow) and its vicinity not
               to be affected keeping in view the fact
               highlighted in the body of the petition or to
               mould the relief appropriately in view of the
               facts and circumstances of the case.

               can be utilized for the betterment of
               environment in Auli Bugyal.

                norms prescribed by the Hon'ble Court."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_7">6.         Whether "Auli" forms a "Bugyal" or an "Alpine
Meadow", we will shortly consider, but "Auli" is in any case
in high mountains, nearly 3000 mts. above sea level, and
the first question which comes to our mind is as to why
would anyone want to hold a wedding at such a huge scale,
on a remote mountain top. More importantly why at all was
this permission granted, for holding this grand wedding!
This had never been done in the past. "Auli" is after all a
sports and adventure destination. It has snow covered
gentle slopes suitable for skiing, and the limited activity
here is skiing during winters. It is also a difficult terrain,
and although there is a single 14 Km motorable road to
"Auli", from the nearest town called "Joshimath", which is
open during summers, but for most parts "Auli" is not an
easily accessible place. It barely has a couple of hotels and
for anyone to plan a wedding here at such a grand scale,
meant that he had to overcome heavy logistical and
practical challenges. In the petition it has been stated that
a large number of state of the art all weather tents, toilets,
and huge 'shamianas' have been constructed. Apart from
this, more than one helipads are also under construction at
"Auli" to ferry the wedding guests at "Auli".
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.         In short the entire event, or set of events,
planned at "Auli" is apparently at odds with the calm and
quiet, environment of high mountains.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5</span>




<p id="p_9">8.        This writ petition was filed in the Registry of the
High Court on 14.06.2019, and first came before the Court
on 17.07.2019. The wedding ceremonies were to start the
next day itself. There were a number of events organised
along with the wedding, which included lavish lunches and
dinners, entertainment programmes and 'shows'. The entire
programme was spread over a period of one week, from
June 17 to June 23, 2019. Whereas the wedding of
Suryakant son of Ajay Gupta (respondent no.12), was to
take place from June 18 to 20, marriage of Shashank S/o
Atul Gupta (Respondent No.13) was to be held between
June 20 to 22. By the time the writ petition was taken up
by the court invitation cards had already been sent and
major formalities had been completed by the parents of the
bridegrooms and their event organisers i.e. respondent nos.
12, 13 and 14, respectively.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.        The first order of the Division Bench of this
Court, is of 17.06.2020, where the private respondents
denied that the wedding is taking place over a "Bugyal".
"Auli" is not a "Bugyal" they said. Nevertheless the Court's
observations were as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                "6. Even if, as is contended by Sri Arvind
          Vashisth, learned Senior Counsel, the subject
          lands are meadow-lands, and are not covered by
          the aforesaid judgment of the Division Bench, the
          State Government and its instrumentalities must
          ensure that these mindless pursuits of holding
          large scale marriage celebrations at exotic
          locations in such a large scale, and at places
          where such mega-events have never been
          conducted earlier, do not result in irreparable
          environmental degradation of the said area."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                6</span>


<p id="p_11">10.         The Court gave its reasons for not passing an
interim order to restrict the events at that belated stage and
said as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                   "7. While it is debatable whether the
            authorities were justified in granting such
            permissions, interdiction by this Court, at this
            belated stage when the events are scheduled to
            commence today i.e. 17.06.2019, may result in
            the marriage being called off, causing irreparable
            injury to the families concerned. While that, by
            itself, may not justify the private respondents
            being permitted to damage the sensitive ecology
            of the upper Himalayas, where Auli is situated,
            the least that must be done is to minimize any
            adverse effect which this large-scale event may
            have on the fragile ecosystem at Auli."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_12">11.         The Court did not stay the ceremonies or the
events, but the concern raised by the petitioner as well as
the counsel for the Environmental Pollution Control Board,
which were also a party before this Court, are reflected in
the Court's order dated 17.06.2019 and 18.06.2019. The
Court had directed respondent nos. 12 and 13 to deposit an
amount of Rs. 3,00,00,000/- (Rupees Three Crores only),
out of which     Rs. 1,50,00,000/- (Rupees One Crore Fifty
Lakh only) was to be deposited by 19.06.2020 and the
remaining Rs. 1,50,00,000/- (Rupees One Crore Fifty Lakh
only) by 21.06.2019 with the District Magistrate, Chamoli,
Uttarakhand. The amount as directed by this Court was
deposited by respondent nos. 12 &amp; 13, and the orders of
this Court, complied.
</p>


<p id="p_13">12.         Meanwhile the respondents were restrained from
opening or operating new helipads, in or around "Auli", as
the organisers had earlier planned,though the guests were
permitted    to use     the existing nearest helipad, after
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               7</span>


obtaining the requisite permissions from the concerned
authorities. There were some other restrictions as well
imposed by the court. The respondent State Pollution
Control Board was directed to apprise this Court as to what
pollution has resulted in "Auli", due to the event in areas
such as -(a) solid/plastic waste generation; (b) sewage
generation; (c) air/noise pollution due to DG set and fire
crackers; and (d) noise pollution due to band/orchestra.
</p>


<p id="p_14">13.       On    17.07.2019,    the   Member    Secretary    of
Uttarakhand State Pollution Control Board was present
before this Court and he submitted the details regarding
total waste generation of the event. This was as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                "The total waste generated, during the
          subject event, was around 32.6 tons, of which
          15.41 tons related to non-bio-degradable waste,
          consisting mostly of plastic waste; the remaining
          quantity of 17.23 tons of bio-degradable waste
          was shifted to the dumping yard of the
          Joshimath Nagar Palika; pits were dug for
          dumping sewage; these pits were covered with
          plastic liners and the sewage waste was
          deposited there; subsequently sewage was
          collected from these pits and transported to the
          sewerage treatment plants; while, in the plains,
          bio-degradable waste is composted within a span
          of 2 to 3 months, in Auli, which is at a higher
          altitude, it would take much longer for
          completion of this process; efforts are being made
          to segregate non-bio-degradable waste into
          plastic and non-plastic non-bio-degradable
          waste; necessary steps would be taken to have
          the plastic waste recycled through registered
          recycling units in the State; the plastic waste
          generated at the event is lying with the
          Joshimath Nagar Palika, and would be
          transported through vehicles to Haridwar, where
          these plastic recycling units are located."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                              8</span>


<p id="p_15">14.        Subsequently a report was submitted before this
Court by the District Magistrate, Chamoli, the reference of
which is found in the order dated 04.12.2019, which states
that the administration has incurred an expense of Rs.
46,94,823/- (Rupees Forty Six Lakh Ninety Four Thousand
Eight Hundred Twenty Three only), which includes a
payment of Rs. 27,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Seven Lakh
only) to the Uttarakhand State Pollution Control Board.
This Court vide its order dated 04.12.2019 thereafter
directed that an amount of Rs. 2,50,00,000/- (Rupees Two
Crore Fifty Lakh only) be returned to respondent nos. 12
and 13 by way of an account payee cheque and the
remaining amount of Rs. 3,05,177/- (Rs. Three Lakh Five
Thousand One Hundred Seventy Seven only) be retained
with the District Magistrate, Chamoli pending further
orders of this Court.
</p>


<p id="p_16">15.        At this stage, the matter came up before this
Court on 10.02.2020. By this time the wedding ceremonies
were over. Pollution as is evident, was caused due to the
week long wedding ceremonies and events, as is clear from
the report of the Secretary, State Pollution Control Board,
given before this Court on 17.07.2019. Pleadings have been
exchanged in this case and the matter was hence heard
finally.
</p>


<p id="p_17">16.        As far as wedding is concerned, it has taken
place and nothing further needs to be done on that score.
The pollution has been caused by the event, for which a
cost has been paid, to some extent at least, by the
respondents (Nos.12 and 13) which is also evident from the
order dated 04.12.2019 passed by this Court.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                          9</span>


<p id="p_18">17.           Nevertheless,         a   much       larger      question   still
remains before this Court which is whether the nature of
event, with which we are presently concerned, and which
has taken place at "Auli", should ever be allowed in future,
and what needs to be done.
</p>
<p id="p_19">What is a Bugyal

</p><p id="p_20">18.            Beyond a certain height in the mountains trees
do not grow. The land beyond the treeline is called the
"Alpine zone" and the soft green grass or forb cover on the
land is called meadows or Alpine meadows. "Bugyal" is the
local name given to Alpine meadows in Uttarakhand. The
word "Bugyal" is derived from the word "bug" or "bugi"
which are the local name of the kind of grass which grows
in the high mountains1. It is a "Pahari" name given to these
treeless herbaceous meadows, of the mountains. It is
similar to what is called in Kashmir as "marg" (Gulmarg for
example), or "Kanda" in Himachal Pradesh. Although the
word "bugyal" is a close approximation for the word "Alpine
meadow", but the two may not exactly be the same.

<p id="p_21">19.           The present available study on Alpine meadows
in Uttarakhand is the work of Professor G.S. Rawat called
"Alpine meadows of Uttaranchal". According to Professor
Rawat out of the total geographical area of Uttarakhand,
which is 53,485 KM2, 24.11% consists of "Alpine Zone". But
the entire Alpine Zone is not "Bugyal". This is so because
many parts of Alpine Zone are permanently under snow
cover, and some are rocky, broken and unstable slopes,
which do not qualify as quality meadows. According to
Professor Rawat's estimate, "only about 50% of the total

alpine vegetation in Uttaranchal may be under the category
of Bugyal". The botanical name of "Bugyal" is Herbaceous
meadows. Professor G.S. Rawat describes "Bugyal" as "the
herbaceous plants in the meadows usually bear attractive
flowers and exhibit a peculiar perennial annual growth
habit.   The    meadows      comprise        a   large   number   of
herbaceous communities"2.
</p>

<p id="p_24">20.        "Bugyal", according to Prof. Rawat is a collective
term in Uttaranchal for several dwarf forbs and grass which
grow in great profusion in the meadows. "Some of the
typical Bug species are (i) Euphorbia stracheyi (Dudh Bug),
a nutritious herb yielding milky latex, (ii) Trachydium roylei
and Chamaesciadium garhualicum (Dhanja Bug), dwarf
herbs with coriander like leaves, (iii) Saussurea graminifolia
(Bus Bug), dwarf herb with grass likes leaves and waxy
coat, and (iv) Kabresia species (Mamla bug), a dwarf sedge
forming pure stands on higher slopes. Depending upon the
prominence of these species and other associated plant
communities various Bugyal types can be recognized in the
alpine region."3


</p><p id="p_25">21.        Professor Rawat then goes on to mention the
intimate relationship between the local inhabitants of the
area with "Bugyals". Stating the intimate relationship of
local people with "Bugyal", Prof. Rawat also raises concerns
about the dangers to "Bugyal". He says as under:-

                   grounds by a large number of migratory and
                   local pastoral communities. Since the lower
                   altitude grazing lands are limited in extent,
                   summer migration to higher altitudes and
                   alpine meadows has become a practice as a
                   means to sustain the large livestock
                   populations. However, increase in number
                   of livestock and overuse of certain pastures
                   has let to degradation of high altitude
                   grasslands. A large number of rare and
                   endangered with fauna e.g. snow leopard
                   (Uncia uncial), blue sheep (Pseudois
                   nayaur), Himalayan rahr (Hemitragus
                   jemlahicus) among others inhabit the

</p><p id="p_28">                   Besides, Bugyals are also regarded as
                   repositories of a large number of medicinal
                   and aromatic plants (MAPs) which are used
                   in local medicine as well as for sale to the

</p><p id="p_29">22.           Not only is a "Bugyal" an eco sensitive system
but it is also a rich source of our "biodiversity resources",
particularly Medicinal and Aromatic Plants or MAPs as they
are called.
</p>
<p id="p_30">23.           In case "Auli" is a "Bugyal", then undoubtedly
organising such an event and the grant of the permission
for such an event would be in clear violation of at
least two orders of the High Courts. The first order
which we may refer to is of this High Court and the other is
an earlier order of Allahabad High Court i.e. of the
year, 1997, when the present Uttarakhand was a part
of     the    erstwhile     State     of     Uttar    Pradesh.   Heavy

of pre fabricated tourist lodging houses, on a "Bugyal" in
Chamoli district. This construction was being done by none
other than a Government tourist Company called Garhwal
Mandal Vikas Nigam. The court ordered the structures to
be removed, holding such constructions to be in violation of
environment as a "Bugyal" is an ecosystem in itself. This is
what the court said about a "Bugyal" in its order dated
28.10.1996:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                          "The bugiyal belongs to the people. It

                   it. It is not for man to erode the sanctity of
                   this area. It must be returned to nature to
                   provide for whom it was meant; the sheep,

                   the turf and in the shrubs at that altitude.
                   Clearly, putting a tourist lodging house on a

                "14. But       there      is   another      dangerous
          phenomenon to be tackled. It is the scattering of
          plastics     deep   in    the   higher   reaches       of    the
          mountains. There, retrieving it for recycling may be
          a difficult exercise. In this context steps need to be
          taken as a matter of urgency. This strewing of
          plastic on the higher reaches of the mountains and
          the valleys, either by tourists or by residents of
          hamlets      and    villages    as   a   result   of        mass
          consumption is gradually and slowly creating an
          ecological     imbalance.       Layers   of    plastic       get
          sandwiched between falling leaves and forest
          biodegradable materials. Plastic prevents nature
          from returning to earth nutrients which enrich it.
          It prevents rain water from percolating into the
          ground and preventing the trees from receiving it
          and natural streams and springs from being born.
          This delicate mountain ecological balance is being
          lost by an alien phenomenon of consumerism."

          It appears some where down the line the views of
          the hill people were not understood or were
          misunderstood when they complained that the
          bugiyal (meadow) as a concept has to be accepted
          and respected as part of the ecological balance of
          nature. Erroding a Himalayan bugiyal is a matter
          which has been made an issue in this petition. The

              encroached upon. Rather to pass a direction today,

              Vikas Nigam to present a plan to the Court without
              causing inconvenience to the tourists of this
              season, so that these meadows and pasture lands
              remain in their natural state for the purpose for
              which nature carved it out. These suggestions will
              be     presented      to    the   Court   by    the   two

followed, or otherwise the permission should not have been
granted to respondent nos. 12 and 13 to hold the mega

<p id="p_40">30.        "Auli" is sometimes confused with "Aali bugyal",
which is one of the major "bugyals" in Uttarakhand and
which lies in the same district as "Auli", i.e. district
Chamoli. All the same, it is not uncommon in Uttarakhand
even to refer to "Auli" as a "Bugyal". People very often add
"Bugyal"    when they are referring to "Auli". "Auli" is

"bugyals" listed in his book7.

based his case on grounds that "Auli", which is a "Bugyal"
is being polluted and ecologically threatened by holding of
events such as the marriage ceremony, like the one which
was held at "Auli" in June, 2019 and argues that this
should never have been allowed by the Government. It was
asserted that the marriage and the numerous ceremonies
and the lavish parties, etc. which are part of the two
weddings, are being held on a land which is a "Bugyal". The
private respondents, particularly 12, 13 and 14 though
have denied this claim and have asserted that "Auli" is not
a "bugyal".

<blockquote id="blockquote_20">                      "Auli area does not fall under "Bugyal"
                as it lies much below the natural Treeline in
                the Western Himalaya. This area can be
                categorized        under      forest     blank    where
                traditionally cattle camping and currently
                tourism and other recreational activities
                have been promoted. The slope does not
                have typical "bugi" species as found in
                "Bugyals". Instead, it has seedlings and
                saplings of woody species/trees which, if
                protected, will lead to forest formation in
                due      course.        According   to    one    of   the
                important scientific document on "Alpine
                meadows of Uttaranchal" by Rawat) 2005,
                pp. 11-13, 82 major "bugyals" have been
                listed    in   whole        of   the     Uttarakhand.
                However, Auli is nowhere listed as "Bugyals"
                in it, thus indicating that Auli camp area is
                not a bugyal."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_51">36.       We have gone through the two reports. As far as
the report of Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology is
concerned, it is a very generalised kind of report, which
does not give any detail explanation as to why "Auli" is not
a "Bugyal". The only reason assigned is that above "Auli" is
below a tree line there and hence "Auli" is not a "Bugyal".
</p>


<p id="p_52">37.       The report of G.B. Pant National Institute of
Himalayan Environment &amp; Sustainable Development, is
again substantially based on the study of Professor G.S.
Rawat, which we have already referred to in the preceding
paragraphs of this order. The reports mention that Prof.
Rawat has listed 82 existing "Bugyals" in Uttarakhand, but
"Auli" is not one of them. Therefore "Auli" is not a "bugyal".
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                               20</span>


<p id="p_53">Professor Rawat's study, we must remember, is a study of
"Alpine meadows" in Uttaranchal, Although alpine meadows
in Uttarakhand are locally referred to as "bugyals", and
though they may very much be so, yet "Bugyal" is the local
name given by the local communities to the nature of the
land, because of the grass or the forb it is covered with.
"Bug" is a kind of grass or a forb, which grows in alpine as
well as sub-alpine meadows. It is not uncommon for "bug"
or "bugi" grass to grow in sub-alpine meadows as well.
"Bugyal" or "bug" grows in both sub-alpine pasture as well
as alpine pasture. Prof. G.S. Rawat has not mentioned
"Auli" as a "Bugyal" in his study simply because "Auli" is
not an Alpine meadow and the study of Professor G.S.
Rawat was confined to Alpine meadows and did not cover
sub-Alpine meadows. As Professor Rawat has defined in his
book, "Bug" or "Bugi" is a collective term in Uttarakhand for
several dwarf forbs or grass. It is not uncommon for a "Bug"
or "Bugi" to be found in sub Alpine meadows as well.
</p>

<p id="p_54">38.         The Alpine meadows studied and documented by
Professor Rawat and his team, are the ones which were on
their survey route, which was above 3300 meters above sea
level. This is also generally the altitude of Alpine meadows
3200 meters and even better 3300 meters a.s.l. "Auli" on
the other hand lies between 2800 mts to 2900 mts a.s.l. So
definitely "Auli" is not an Alpine meadow. But then "Auli"
may still be a "bugyal" or partially a "bugyal", if it has the
growth of grass and forb locally called "Bug" or "Bugi". It
would not be a bugyal if it is rocky and grassless. But it is
true, we do not have any such study before us. To the
contrary the reports before us show that "Auli" is not a
"Bugyal".
</p><p id="p_55">T




</p><p id="p_56">39.         We may have to say that "Auli" does not qualify
as a "bugyal". Yet the larger question from the point of view
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                            21</span>


of    environment            and      pollution         would          still     remain,
irrespective of the status of "Auli" as a "Bugyal".
</p>

<p id="p_57">40.            We say this for the reasons that "Auli" lies in
extreme close proximity to one of the most well known and
environmentally             sensitive       "Bugyals"            called        "Gaurson
Bugyal". There is only a brown Oak forest stretching 4-5
kilometers between "Gaurson Bugyal" and "Auli". More
importantly, "Auli' falls in the "Dhauli Ganga Catchment
Area" of "Nanda Devi Forest Division". Dhauli Ganga is one
of the six main tributaries of river Ganges. This river has a
confluence         with      Alaknanda          river     at      a     place     called
"Vishnuprayag" near "Joshimath". The entire catchment
area of Dhauli Ganga is a rich source of medicinal and
aromatic plants and herbs, i.e. MAPs, and is thus a rich
biodiversity site of the State and the nation8.
</p>

<p id="p_58">41.            "Auli" also lies in the periphery of the famous
"Nanda Devi National Park" or "Nanda Devi Biosphere
Reserve", which was notified as a national park way back in
the year 1982. Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve has also been
declared as a world heritage site by UNESCO.
</p>

<p id="p_59">42.            "Auli" is not an "Alpine meadow" and may not
be a "bugyal", but it is still a sub-Alpine meadow.
Moreover, being a part of Dhauli Ganga Catchment area,
and in the periphery of "Nanda                                 Devi            Biosphere
Reserve",        it    is     a    rich      reserve        of        our      biological
resources, particularly of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants or

from excessive tourist inflow, over exploitation of its
biodiversity, culture and fragile environment. We may also
state here that the directions given by the Division Bench of
this Court in Writ Petition (PIL) No. 123 of 2014 were not
confined to Alpine meadows alone but to sub-Alpine
meadows as well.
</p>



<p id="p_62">43.         We require to conserve and protect our biological
resources. India is one of the 12 Mega diversity rich
countries in the world. Himalaya mountains is one of the
main repository of the Biodiversity wealth of the country,
and "Auli" lies in a sub-alpine region of Himalayas, in the
catchment area of Dhauli Ganga basin. The importance of
"Auli" and its surrounding areas has to be seen primarily
from this aspect. "Auli" can never be viewed as an exotic
tourist destination or a wedding destination.

<p id="p_92">54.          Having heard the learned counsels of all the
parties, we have absolutely no doubt in our mind that the
State Government should have never given its permission
for holding this large event at "Auli". This petition is not
against the wedding, but against the week long large
congregation and gathering in the high mountains which
happens to be an eco-sensitive place. The argument is
against large gatherings in an eco sensitive place; not
against the wedding. The State Government has defended
its stand of granting permission for the "event" on grounds
that it will boost tourism in Uttarakhand. Tourism certainly
needs to be encouraged and in a State like Uttarakhand
tourism industry can also be an important source of
revenue for the State and an area which has huge potential
for generating employment. But a balance has to be made.
Worldwide tourism is now being seen as "sustainable
tourism", which is another name for "responsible tourism".
Tourism has to be handled very carefully. In a Handy
Booklet11 (which is a user's manual on CBD Guidelines),
foreword has been written by Jochen Flashbarth, who is an
environmentalist which is worth mentioning here. He
writes:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">                            "Tourism is like fire: you can cook
                            your food with it, but if you are not
                            careful, it could also burn your house
                            down! Or to put it another way:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_33">                            tourism     offers    opportunities   for
                            economic,      social   and    ecological
                            development, but only if the risks
                            involved are not overlooked."</blockquote>

Managing   Tourism   &amp;   Biodiversity   (User's Manual   on   CBD   Guidelines   on
Biodiversity and Tourism Development)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                               30</span>


</p><p id="p_94">55.       There is a no law against holding a wedding
ceremony at "Auli". But there is definitely a law against
environment pollution. There is also a law, presently
enforce in the State of Uttarakhand, which mandates the
State to conserve and protect its biodiversity and make it
more sustainable. Any event, activity, plan or scheme which
violates these provisions comes in conflict with the law.
</p>

<p id="p_95">56.       While      developing    tourism     sector,      the
environmental aspect and the social and aesthetic needs of
the   people, where these tourism centres are to be
developed, has to be taken into account. For alpine and sub
alpine meadows, which are rich in biological diversity such
as "Auli", which is in close proximity and periphery of
"Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve", the Government should
have been more circumspect before giving its approval for
this mega wedding.
</p>

<p id="p_96">57.       What is the "carrying capacity" of "Auli", has still
not been determined. It ought to have been done by now,
considering that the State seeks to develop "Auli", which is
in an eco sensitive zone, as a place for adventure and sport
tourism. In fact the State Government must immediately
undertake a study and fix the "carrying capacity" of "Auli",
and all other such places which are set to be tourist
destinations in the State of Uttarakhand.
</p>
<p id="p_97">58.       There has been no previous planning, scheme or
even a standard procedure with the Government to hold an
event of this nature in an eco-sensitive area. To give just
one example, and as has already been referred above, there
is no provision yet to restrict the number of tourists at
"Auli" since the "Carrying Capacity" of "Auli" has not been
fixed as yet. A Division Bench of this Court (<a href="/doc/147330564/" id="a_16">In Aali-Bedini
Bagzi   Bugyal     Sanrakshan      Samiti    vs.   State     of
Uttarakhand</a>) had directed to set a limit of 200 tourists for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                31</span>


all     meadows/sub       alpine     meadows/Bugyals,        in
Uttarakhand. This has clearly not been done.
</p>

<p id="p_98">59.        This event left a long trail of waste and garbage,
which is 32.6 Tons. Out of this 15.41 is non-biodegradable
waste. This is the result of just one single event at "Auli". In
case such events are permitted by the State in future, what
level of garbages and waste will that result is not difficult to
imagine. We say this as we are also aware that there are no
scientific mechanisms available at "Auli" or nearly in
Chamoli district, which has the capacity to recycle this
large quantity of waste. There is also no mechanism in
place to prevent water and air pollution which result as a
consequence of the kind of activity, we are presently dealing
with.
</p>


<p id="p_99">60.        This Court has been informed that out of
Rs. Three Crore deposited by respondent nos. 12 and 13,
Rs. 46,94,823/- (Rupees Forty Six Lakh Ninety Four
Thousand Eight Hundred Twenty Three only) have been the
expenses. Rs. 2,50,00,000/- (Rupees Two Crore Fifty Lakh
only) has been returned to respondent nos. 12 and 13 vide
order dated 04.12.2019 of the Division Bench of this Court.
The remaining amount left with the District Magistrate is
Rs. 3,05,177/- (Rupees Three Lakh Five Thousand One
Hundred Seventy Seven only). This amount shall not be
given to respondent nos. 12 and 13 or any of the private
respondents, immediately, but this Court leaves it to the
Government to hear all the concerned parties in case of any
further damage and expenses are involved, this amount be
adjusted accordingly, and the remaining, even any, is
recovered. If there are no other deductions to be made, then
this amount be returned to respondent nos.12 and 13.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                               32</span>


<p id="p_100">61.        It is clear that the Government was in grave error
in granting its approval to this mega event without having
any kind of assessment of waste and garbage which would
be generated due to the event. It failed to have any checks
for the collateral damage caused by the event to the
environment. But for the intervention of this Court which
had set up a condition of depositing Rs. Three Crore there
was hardly any mechanism in place either with the State
Government or its authorities which could have recovered
this amount from the private respondent nos. 12 and 13.
This Court has no intention to discourage tourism in
Uttarakhand but as cautioned above by Jochen Flashbarth
the State Government must remember that "tourism is like
fire: you can cook your food with it, but if you are not
careful it can also burn your house down". Tourism should
not be seen merely as a development activity or as a
revenue   earning   sector.   Tourism    means    "sustainable
tourism". We can afford to ignore this principle only at the
cost of our environment. We should keep high mountain
terrains in their pristine glory and beauty. "Bugyals" belong
to the people, as was so eloquently stated by the Division
Bench of Allahabad High Court (<a href="/doc/1859293/" id="a_17">Om Prakash Bhatt v.
State of U.P. and others</a>, AIR 1997 Allahabad 259).
"Nature has tailored it. It is not for man to erode the
sanctity of this area. It must be returned to nature to
provide for whom it was meant; the sheep, the shepherd,
the wild flowers, the micro-orgams and the plant and insect
life below the turf and in the shrubs at that altitude." What
has been said by the Allahabad High Court was for the
"Bugyals", but it applies equally to "Auli" since "Auli" too is
an eco sensitive place. Lastly we may remind ourselves of
the gentle warning and wisdom of an African proverb,
which sums up everything. It says: "The earth is not ours,
it's a treasure we hold in trust for future generations".

<p id="p_101">62.        We therefore propose to dispose of the petition,
with the following directions:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">           1.    The State Government shall constitute an
      expert Committee within four weeks of this order. This
      Committee will undertake the exercise and examine
      whether there is a need to identify biodiversity
      heritage sites in Uttarakhand and if it comes to a
      conclusion that it needs to be done then the exercise
      of identifying these sites be taken under Section 37 of
      the Biodiversity Act. The expert Committee shall
      consist of Secretary Tourism, Secretary Forest and
      Secretary Environment. The Committee shall co-opt at
      least two experts with them.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">      2.   The      Ministry    of    Tourism,    Government    of
      Uttarakhand shall get the carrying capacity of "Auli"
      determined by the same expert Committee, within four
      weeks of this order. The expert body shall examine all
      the relevant aspects and fix a carrying capacity of
      "Auli" within 3 months thereafter. The Government
      may also undertake the same exercise for all such
      "tourist destinations" which lie in a biodiversity
      sensitive zone, such as "Auli".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">      3.   Rs. 3,05,177/- (Rs. Three Lakh Five Thousand
      One Hundred Seventy Seven only) which has been left
      out of Rupees Three Crore deposited by respondent
      nos.12 and 13 shall be deposited with the State
      Government Treasury. The State Government shall
      thereafter determine as to what amount is still needed
      for repair of the damages caused, and the unutilised
      amount be returned to respondent nos.12 and 13.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_37">      4.   "Auli"    is   the    only    skiing   destination   in
      Uttarakhand, for sports and adventure lovers. It is
      also the place which holds winter games. It is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                   34</span>


          necessary therefore that the Government limits its
          activities in "Auli" only in the field of sports and
          adventure tourism, and not to venture in any other
          activities which are not compatible with the principles
          of "Sustainable tourism". The       Government must
          remain focused in these areas. "Auli" should never be
          a destination for large events, the kind we have just
          witnessed.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_102">63.            With the above observations and directions, the
petition stands disposed of. Let a copy of this order be sent
to the Secretary, Tourism and the Secretary, Forest,
Government         of   Uttarakhand    for   onward   compliance.
Registrar General of this Court is directed to do the needful.
