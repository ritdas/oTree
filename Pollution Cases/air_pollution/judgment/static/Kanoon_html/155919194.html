      THIS WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
14.11.2019, ALONG WITH WP(C).29689/2019(I), THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY
DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
 WP(C).Nos.29689 &amp; 30316 OF 2019

                                        3




                              JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       I am considering these two writ petitions on account of the

  analogous nature of the factual circumstances presented therein and

  because the reliefs to be granted in one will certainly influence the

  reliefs to be granted in the other.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2.    Among the two writ petitions W.P.(C)No.29689/2019 has

  been filed by Sri.T.P.Gopalakrishnan and another asserting that the

  3rd respondent - Unit is being run without obtaining necessary

  licences and consents and that it is causing unbearable pollution to

  the residents of the area.      The petitioners allege that the Unit is

  being run in violation of law and that the      pollution caused is not

  merely to air but that it is causing severe contamination of all ground

  water sources in the said area. They, therefore, pray that the 1 st

  respondent - Secretary of the Grama Panchayat be directed to take

  immediate action to stop functioning of the 3rd respondent - Unit.

</p><p id="p_3">       3.    While so, W.P.(C)No.30316/2019          has been filed by

  Sri.Anto T.K., who is the Managing Partner of the 3 rd respondent -

  Unit in W.P.(C)No.29689/2019, impugning Ext.P9 communication

  issued by the Pollution Control Board withdrawing their Consent to

  Operate on the allegation that the Unit had unauthorisedly burnt

  sawdust and had allowed to escape the smoke emanated therefrom
 WP(C).Nos.29689 &amp; 30316 OF 2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     4</span>




  except through the chimney.       Interestingly, the petitioner herein

  concedes that the factual statements contained in Ext.P9 are true

  but explains that this was done solely on account of the fact that the

  bricks had to be dried on an urgent basis using sawdust on account

  of the heavy and continuous rains this year that this had never been

  done in the past. He says that he has, therefore, approached the

  Pollution Control Board seeking that Ext.P9 be withdrawn and that

  his Consent to      Operate be restored. He adds to the afore by

  submitting that, going by the provisions of <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_1">Section 22</a> of Air

  (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, as long as the smoke

  is within the permissible limits of the pollutants as envisaged

  therein, Ext.P9 could not have been issued. He says that the said

  order has been, however, issued without any consideration of these

  aspects.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       4.     The learned Standing Counsel for the Pollution Control

  Board submits that the order impugned in W.P.(C)No.30316/2019 has

  been issued finding that the Unit was unauthorisedly burning

  sawdust and that smoke was emanating through all the orifices of

  the Unit and not merely from the chimney, as is permitted under the

  Consent to Operate.       He says that, to make matters worse, this

  burning of the sawdust was, in fact, done in an unauthorised

  building,   which   did    not   have   the   requisite   infrastructural
 WP(C).Nos.29689 &amp; 30316 OF 2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      5</span>




  requirements; and prays that therefore, this Court may not interdict

  Ext.P9.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       5.    When I consider the afore submissions, it becomes

  ineluctable that the Pollution Control Board has found that the Unit

  had illegally burned sawdust in another building and had allowed

  smoke to flow through channels other than the chimney, thus being

  in violation of the Consent to Operate issued by them. Hence, even if

  the petitioner asserts that the pollutants released through the smoke

  are within the limits of the afore mentioned Act, I cannot find the

  action of the Unit in having burnt sawdust in an unauthorised

  building and in having allowed the smoke to emanate in such fashion

  to be deserving favour of this Court. Therefore, notwithstanding the

  technical objections raised by Sri.Rajit - learned Counsel for the

  Unit, I do not think that this Court will be justified in interfering with

  Ext.P9, produced along with W.P.(C)No.30316/2019 in a writ petition

  filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, since I cannot

  enter into the factual realm to assess the truth of the allegations.

</p><p id="p_6">       6.    Perhaps, sensing my mind as afore, Sri.Rajit submits that

  if this Court is not inclined to quash Ext.P9, then the Pollution

  Control Board may be directed to hear his client and take a decision

  as to whether the Consent to Operate can be reinstated on

  appropriate conditions.
</p><p id="p_7"> WP(C).Nos.29689 &amp; 30316 OF 2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        6</span>




</p><p id="p_8">       7.    The   afore     submission      of   Sri.Rajit   is   opposed    by

  Sri.T.N.Manoj,   learned    counsel       for   Sri.T.P.Gopalakrishnan     and

  another, asserting that the Unit cannot be allowed to have the

  Consent to Operate in future because of the illegal action already

  committed and therefore, prays that W.P.(C)No.29689/2019 be

  allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       8.    The undisputed facts available before this Court clearly

  indicate that the Pollution Control Board has found objectionable

  action from the part of the Unit          in variance with the conditions

  imposed in the Consent to Operate; and have therefore, taken a

  decision to set aside the Consent to Operate. Pertinently, I am not

  told of any action having been initiated by the Unit to impugn Ext.P9

  order before the competent Statutory Appellate Authority but they

  have chosen to approach this Court asserting that the said order is

  untenable in law and also that the situation noticed at the time when

  the same was issued has now improved.
</p>
<p id="p_10">         I am, therefore, of the view that this is a matter that the

  Pollution Control Board themselves should consider, leading to a

  decision as to whether the Unit's Consent to Operate can be

  reinstated, subject to requisite conditions, as are permissible in law.

</p><p id="p_11">       Resultantly, I order W.P.(C)No.29689/2019 and direct the 3 rd

  respondent therein not to operate the Unit unless their Consent to
 WP(C).Nos.29689 &amp; 30316 OF 2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       7</span>




     Operate is reinstated by the Pollution Control Board; and I

     consequentially, dispose of W.P.(C)No.30316/2019, directing the

     Pollution Control Board to hear the petitioner therein as also to the

     petitioners in W.P.(C)No.29689/2019 and       take a decision as to

     whether the Consent to Operate earlier issued by them to the Unit

     can be reinstated and if so, on what terms.
</p>
<p id="p_12">           The afore exercise shall be completed by the Pollution Control

     Board as expeditiously as is possible, but not later than two months

     from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgement; and I

     reiteratingly clarify that until such time as the Consent to Operate is

     reinstated, the Unit shall not be allowed to operate and that the

     official respondents will make sure that these orders are complied

     with implicitly.
