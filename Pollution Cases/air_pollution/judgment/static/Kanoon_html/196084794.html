    thereafter, it had given its clearance on 7th April, 2005.  This clearance 
                          
    was  granted in  mechanical manner.     Dissatisfied by the action, the 
                         
    Petitioners   approached   Grampanchayat   raising   their   protest   but 

    nothing much could be done about the same at that level and finally 
      

    the Petitioners led a Morcha on 27th  October, 2007 as the Authorities 
   



    have   violated   the   provisions   of   <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment   Act</a>.     Vide   their   letter

    letter   stating   therein   various   violations   of   the   conditions   and   also 

    requested for revocation of the clearance granted.       In reply thereto,

    2008, a meeting was convened by the Collector wherein the members 

    of the Petitioners organization were present.   In the said meeting, it 

    was   concluded   that   a   joint   visit   of   the   Government   officials   and

    be carried out.   Thereafter, on 25th May, 2008 a meeting was convened 
                         
    wherein representatives of the Petitioner Organization along with their 
                        
    two advocates were present but Respondent Nos.8 to 10 did not listen 

    to anything and in the compelled circumstances, the Petitioners walked 
      

    out of the said meeting.       The villagers of the village Rajpuri even 
   



    assaulted the advocates.     These  incidents were also covered by the 

    newspapers.   In November, 2008, operation of blasting of rocks and 





    hills was undertaken by Respondent No.6, as a result of which serious 

    damages and cracks were caused to the houses of the villagers.  Various 

    protests raised by the Petitioners inviting attention of the Authorities 





    but   could   not   persuade   the   authority   to   act   and/or   withdraw   the 

    clearance granted on 30th  September, 2005.     Aggrieved against this 

    inaction on the part of the Respondents, the Petitioners claimed that

    as   the   doctrine   of   public   trust   has   been   violated   as   it   places   an

    greater section of the society.   The expression 'public interest' means

    public purpose. There is thus much in common between public interest 

    and public purpose.  The expression 'public purpose' is not capable of 

    precise definition and has not a rigid meaning.  It can only be defined 




                                                         
    by   a   process   of   judicial   inclusion   and   exclusion   (State   of   Bihar   v 

    Kameshwar Singh, AIR 1952 SC 252). However, a broad test has been 




                                           
    formulated and it is that "whatever furthers the general interest of the 
                          
    community,   as   opposed   to   the   particular   interest   of   the   individuals, 
                         
    must be regarded as a public purpose".   The expression "interest of the 

    general   public"   embraces   public   security,   public   order   and   public 
      

    morality. (Emperor v Jeshingbhai Ishwarlal Dhobi, AIR 1950 Bom 363).

<p id="p_28">    It will not be out of place to mention here something about "public 

    policy".     Public   policy   is   a   principle   of   judicial   legislation   or 





    interpretation founded on the current needs of the community.   The 

    interest of the whole public must be taken into account. (Murlidhar  

    Agarwal   v   State   of   U.P,  (1974)   2   SCC   472).     (Reference   :   "The

                  litigation   came   to   be   filed   on   19.5.1999   knocking 
                  the doors of the High Court when it was closed for 
                  summer vacation. The High Court felt that the issue 
                        
                  raised in the petition calls for its attention. Notices 
                  were issued to CIDCO and other respondents.  By an 
                  interim   order   proceedings   for   acceptance   of   the 
                  tenders   and   thereafter   were   directed   to   remain 
      

                  stayed.  The High Court soon realized that the issue 
                  of public interest raised in the writ petition required 
   



                  the conduct of the case not to be left in the hands of 
                  the writ petitioner alone, and therefore, by its order 
                  dated   7.12.1999   appointed   an   amicus   curiae   to 
                  assist   the   Court.     However,   a   little   later   it   was 





                  brought   to   the   notice   of   the   High   Court   that   the

                  High Court chose to proceed with the hearing of the 
                  petition dispensing with the assistance of the amicus 





                  curiae.     The   fact   remains   that   the   litigation   had 
                  assumed the character of a public interest litigation 
                  of wider scope, not necessarily confined to grievance

      has to be careful to avoid.   It is also necessary for 
      the   court   to   bear   in   mind   that   there   is   a   vital 
      distinction   between   locus   standi   and   justifiability 
      and it is not every default on the part of the State or 
      a public authority hat is justiciable.  The court must 




                                             
      take care to see that it does not overstep the limits 
      of its judicial function and trespass into areas which 
      are reserved to the executive and the legislature by 
      the Constitution.  It is a fascinating exercise for the 




                               
      court to deal with public interest litigation because 
      it is new jurisprudence which the court is evolving, 
             
      a   jurisprudence   which   demands   judicial 
      statesmanship   and   high   creative   ability.     The 
      frontiers of public law are expanding far and wide 
            
      and new concepts and doctrines which will change 
      the complexion of the law and which were so far as 
      embedded in the womb of the future, are beginning 
      to be born".

<p id="p_48">                    The   courts   while   exercising   jurisdiction 
   



      and deciding a public interest litigation have to take 
      great care, primarily for the reason that this wide 
      jurisdiction should not become a source of abuse of 
      process of law by a disgruntled litigant.  The courts 





      have also held that no efforts should be spared in 
      fostering   and   developing   the   laudable   concept   of 
      PIL and extending its long arm of sympathy to the 
      poor,   the   ignorant,   the   oppressed   and   the   needy 
      whose   fundamental   rights   are   infringed   and 





      violated and whose grievances go unnoticed.  It has 
      to be a genuine litigation, unmotivated and imposes 
      an obligation upon a litigant to come to the court 
      with   true   facts   and   clean   hands.     Public   interest 
      litigations result in taking large court's time, which 
      could  not  be   used  by  the  court  for  the   benefit  of

    that it will be more appropriate for the Courts to reject the Petition on

    without leave of the competent authority and in fact are acting contrary 
   



    to law.  This is disturbing the ecological and aesthetic qualities of sea

<p id="p_65">    The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, vide its Office Order dated 

    15th October, 1994 in compliance of Notification No.318(E) dated 10th 




                                                      
    April,   1997   of   Ministry   of   Environment   and   Forests,   Government   of 

    India had constituted a panel for examining the objections in relation 




                                          
    to Dighi Port project, Exhibit 2, to the reply of Respondent No.5.  The 
                         
    learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner suggested that this was 
                        
    not   a   properly   constituted   panel   inasmuch   as   representative   of 

    Maharashtra Maritime Board was not to be a member of the Panel in 
      

    terms of the Officer Order dated 15th  October, 1994.     The essential 
   



    requirement   of   the   panel   is   that   a   representative   from   Environment 

    Department   and   Maharashtra   Pollution   Control   Board   have   to   be 





    members of the panel which is to be chaired by a District Collector. 
</p>
<p id="p_66">    Even if for the sake of argument it is assumed that the representative of 

    Maharashtra Maritime Board was not to be a member of the panel, it 





    can hardly be said that his inclusion in the panel would have caused 

    prejudice of any kind.  According to the Respondents and as stated in 

    their reply affidavits, it heard the objections after giving due notice at 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:45:41 :::</span>

    public places including the office of Panchayat of Village Dighi.  Then 




                                                                                 
    the   objections   were   heard   and   finally   Notification   dated   30th 




                                                         
    September, 2005 was issued.   In the declared Notification, Clause 3 

    which deals with the composition of the public hearing panel uses the 

    expression 'may' and explains various persons who could be members 




                                                        
    of the panel.   Member of the local bodies, Municipalities, Panchayat 

    could be members. Representative of the State dealing with the subject 




                                           
    and representatives of the Pollution Control Board in addition to the 
                         
    District Collector or his nominee were also to be in the panel.   The 
                        
    expression 'may' has to be given its true and correct meaning and not a 

    strict   meaning   which   would   render   the   provision   inapplicable.     The 
      

    panel that was constituted by the Ministry itself, in our opinion, does 
   



    not suffer from any legal infirmity inasmuch as the representative of 

    the   local   bodies,   senior   citizens   and   the   Government   and   Pollution 





    Control Board representatives were also there in the panel.  Thus, there 

    is   substantial   compliance   to   this   provision   and   would   not   call   for 

    interference by the Court on that account.

<p id="p_67">    21.          The   concept   of   public   hearing   is   intended   to   achieve   a

    projects.  As already noticed, there is no dispute raked up before us by 

    any party that grant of public hearing was necessary.  In fact, according 

    to the Petitioner, this was done cosmetically, while, according to the 




                                                        
    Respondents, they had strictly complied with the said requirement of 

    public   hearing   in   accordance   with   law.     With   reference   to   the 




                                           
    provisions afore-indicated, the intent of the framers appear to be that 
                          
    the public hearing should be granted at the site or the nearby places in 
                         
    close   proximity.     The   purpose   is   to   enable   particularly   the   affected 

    persons to put forward their suggestions and objections which must be 
      

    treated very objectively by the authorities concerned.   It is not public 
   



    hearing of objections but is public consultation.  The expression 'public 

    consultation'   conveys   a   meaning   of   taking   public   into   confidence   to 





    ensure that the environment or ecology of the area is not so disturbed 

    that it would adversely affect persons living around the area.  From the 

    reply affidavits filed by the respective Respondents, it appears that the 





    above hearing did not take place at the site or in the areas nearby but 

    at the district headquarters.   In fact, the public hearing was held at 

    Collector's office in Raigad-Alibag which we are informed is nearly 100

    kms away from the site in question or village Dighi.   This appears to us 




                                                                                 
    not proper compliance to the requirements of law.  It would have been 




                                                         
    more appropriate for the authorities to hear the people on the site in 

    terms  of  the   above  provisions  or  at  best  in  the   public   places  of  the 

    village concerned or at a place which was not so far away from the site.

<p id="p_68">    Public consultation would not only include hearing objections but even 

    the suggestions which may be made by the affected persons or even 




                                           
    any other person having an interest.  It is not strange or unusual that 
                         
    public spirited persons connected with environment and ecology of the 
                        
    area could make suggestions which may prove useful and would help 

    in implementation of the project with better results ensuring greater 
      

    protection   to   environment.       After   such   hearing,   the   clearance 
   



    notification was issued.  There is some irregularity in compliance with 

    the   provisions   of   public   consultation   but   that   essentially   would   not 





    violate the final Notification issued by the authorities as the Petitioners 

    were  heard in  the  year  2004 and, firstly they cared to come  to the 

    courts   in   the   year   2009   and,   secondly,   no   prejudice   has   been 





    demonstrated   in   the   Writ   Petition   which   has   resulted   from   this 

    particular irregularity.  The irregularity is not per se an illegality so as 

    to vitiate the final order inasmuch as admittedly hearings were held

    these conditions have not been adhered to and no provisions have been 

    made for supplying the water to the village in question.  According to 
                        
    the   Respondents,   they   are   providing   water   by   tankers   without   any 

    payment from the villagers and would finally provide for the scheme 
      


    for regular and permanent supply of water in the village.    Thus, they 
   



    have every intention of complying with the conditions imposed in the 

    impugned clearance.  It may be noticed that in the public consultation 





    of public hearing held on 2nd November, 2004, one Shri Baban Surve, 

    Wadavali, had raised this issue.  The water and electricity problem of 





    the village was discussed at in some details and he stated that he was 

    aware of the water scarcity in the village and that there was a proposal 

    to   bring   water   by   tankers   from   outside   sources   during   construction
