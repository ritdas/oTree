                    Cr. M.P. No.280 of 2011
      Mahboob Alam @ Md. Mehboob Alam                ...     ...    Petitioner

      For the respondents       : Mr. A.K. Pandey, J.S.P.C.B.
                          -----
02/06.02.2012</pre><p id="p_1">:      Heard learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and learned
      counsel appearing for the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board.
</p><p id="p_2">                   This application is directed against the order dated 09.03.2007
      passed by the then learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Chaibasa in
      Nowamundi P.S. Case No.46 of 2006, corresponding to G.R. No.494 of 2006
      whereby cognizance of the offence under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_1">Section 37</a> of the Air (Prevention and
      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, has been taken against the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_3">                   It does appear that one Manikant Prasad, the then Regional
      Officer, Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board, Adityapur, Jamshedpur
      lodged a case before the Officer-in-Charge, Nowamundi Police Station,
      alleging therein that M/s New India Minerals, Nawamundi, Jharkhand, to which
      the petitioner is the Proprietor, without having consent to establish its factory
      and without taking consent for its operation, was running a factory in violation
      of the provision as contained in <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of
      Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, which is punishable under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_5">Section 37</a> of the said Act.
</p><p id="p_4">                   The police having investigated the case, did find the allegation to
      be true and hence, submitted charge sheet, upon which cognizance of the
      offence was taken on 09.03.2007, which is under challenge.
</p><p id="p_5">                   Mr. B. N. Singh, learned Sr. Counsel appearing for the petitioner
      submits that the order taking cognizance is bad for the simple reason that
      under <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_6">Section 43</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981,
      cognizance of the offences can be taken only on a complaint made by the
      Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board       or any officer, authorized in this
      behalf or by any person, who has given notice of not less than sixty days in the
      manner, as prescribed under sub-section (b) of <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_8">Section 43</a> of the said Act. But
      here in the instant case, cognizance has been taken on a charge sheet
      submitted by the Police and hence, any order taking cognizance, on the basis
      of the charge sheet, is quite bad, in view of the provision as contained in
      <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_9">Section 43</a> of the said Act.
</p><p id="p_6">                   As against this, Mr. A.K. Pandey, learned counsel appearing for
      the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board submits that Mr. Manikant Prasad,
      the then Regional Officer of the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board had
      been authorized by the then Member Secretary to lodge FIR and since, the
 FIR had been lodged by an authorized officer, the order taking cognizance can
never be said to be bad.
</p><p id="p_7">             Having heard learned counsel appearing for the parties, it does
appear that there has been no dispute that the then Regional Officer of the
Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board had lodged a case, wherein it has
been alleged that the petitioner had contravened the provision of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_10">Section 21</a> of
the said Act, which is punishable under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_11">Section 37</a> of the Air (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p><p id="p_8">             The Police, on finding the allegation to be true, submitted charge
sheet ,on the basis of which cognizance of the offence has been taken vide
impugned order. The question does arise as to whether the order taking
cognizance is in accordance with law?
</p><p id="p_9">             In this context, provision as contained in <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_13">Section 43</a> of the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 be referred to, which reads as
follows:-
</p><p id="p_10">              43. Cognizance of Offences-(1) No court shall take cognizance
of any offence under this Act except on a complaint made by--
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       (a) a Board or any officer authorized in this behalf by it; or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (b) any person who has given notice of not less than sixty days, in the
          manner prescribed, of the alleged offence and of his intention to make
          a complaint to the Board or officer authorized as aforesaid,
and no court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial
Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence punishable under this Act.</blockquote>

<p id="p_11">             Thus, the aforesaid provision, does stipulate that only on the
basis of the complaint lodged by the Board or any other officer, as mentioned
in sub-section (a) or by the person as mentioned in sub-section (b), the
cognizance of the offence can be taken.
</p><p id="p_12">             Here in that instant case, cognizance of the offence has been
taken, not on the basis of the complaint lodged by the Officer as mentioned in
sub-section-a &amp; b of <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_15">Section 43</a>, but on the basis of the charge sheet submitted
by the police, which is never in consonance with the provision as enshrined in
<a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_16">Section 43</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_17">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 .
</p><p id="p_13">              At this stage, I may state that the offences under the aforesaid
Act seems to be punishable upto six years and in that view of the matter, the
offences being cognizable can be investigated upon by the Police for which
there has been no doubt about it but the cognizance, as per the provision, as
contained in <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_18">Section 43</a>, needs to be taken on the basis of the complaint made
by the officer as mentioned above.
</p><p id="p_14">             Admittedly, the word "complaint" has not been defined in that Act
but the <a href="/doc/31000761/" id="a_19">Section 54</a> does stipulate about the manner in which cognizance would
be taken and in that event, sub-section 2 of Section 4 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, would come into play, which provides that all the offences under
