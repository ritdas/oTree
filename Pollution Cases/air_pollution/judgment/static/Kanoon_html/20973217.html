<div class="doc_title">Vundela Prasad Reddy, vs Union Of India, on 11 December, 2018</div><div class="doc_bench">Bench: Thottathil B.Radhakrishnan, S.V.Bhatt</div>

<pre id="pre_1"> HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE SRI THOTTATHIL B. RADHAKRISHNAN
                             AND
               HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE S.V. BHATT

                    WRIT PETITION No.31165 of 2018

ORDER:    (per SVB, J)




      Heard Sri Y. Srinivasa Murthy, learned counsel for the

petitioner and learned Assistant Solicitor General for respondent</pre>

<p id="p_1">No.1, learned Government Pleaders for General Administration;
</p>
<p id="p_2">Industries; Mines &amp; Geology and Revenue (AP) for respondent

Nos.2; 3; 4 and 5 &amp; 7, respectively, Sri G. Ramachandra Rao,

learned Standing Counsel for the Andhra Pradesh Pollution

Control        Board     appearing      for     respondent        No.6       and

Sri O. Manohar Reddy, learned counsel for respondent No.8.
</p>

<p id="p_3">      The petitioner prays for the following relief:
</p>

<p id="p_4">      "For the reasons stated in the accompanying affidavit, it is
      therefore just and essential that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased
      to issue a writ, order or directions more particularly one in the
      nature of the writ of Certiorari calling for the records relating to
      the order passed by the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal,
      Principal Bench, New Delhi, on 01.08.2018, in Application
      No.384 of 2018 to quash the same and to consequently direct the
      respondent officials to protect the water body popularly known as
      KUMMARA KUNTA, situated in Survey No.1043 of Niduzuvvi
      Village, Yerraguntla Mandal, YSR Kadapa District, Andhra
      Pradesh."
</p>

<p id="p_5">      The National Green Tribunal through the order under

challenge has held that:
</p><pre id="pre_2">                                      2                                   HCJ &amp; SVB, J
                                                                 W.P. No.31165 of 2018




</pre><p id="p_6">"The Learned Counsel for Respondent No. 8 puts in appearance
and submitted that subject matter of this Original Application is
the same which has been raised before the Hon'ble High Court of
Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Further, he submits that the High
Court had passed an interim order on 26th July, 2018 in W.P. (PIL)
No: 130 of 2018 which reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_7">    "Learned Assistant Solicitor General appears for respondent nos.1,
 6, 7 and 8; learned Government Pleader for Revenue (AP) appears for
 Respondent nos.2, 3, 9 and 11; learned Government Pleader for Mines
 and Geology (AP) appears fro respondent nos.4 and 5; learned
 Standing Counsel for Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board
 appears for respondent No.10; and learned Counsel Sri O. Manohar
 Reddy appears for respondent no.12.
</p><p id="p_8">    Learned counsel for respondent No.12 has placed before us the
 endorsement     of    the   Tahsildar,    Yerraguntla     Mandal,      with
 N.Dis.No.26/2018, dated 23.06.2018, which identifies the Kummara
 Kunta. The purpose of issuing that endorsement is in connection with
 protection of Kummara Kunta along with Buffer Zone of 15 metres
 radius.
</p><p id="p_9">    For the time being, respondent No.11 - District Collector, is
 directed to ensure that no construction activity whatsoever, including
 of placing any boundary wall, shall be carried out in relation to the
 said parcel, which is identified as Kummara Kunta along with Buffer
 Zone of 15 metres radius and that the said water body is maintained in
 as is where is condition as on today for a period of four weeks.
  The respondents may place their counter affidavits, if so advised,
within that period. Post after four weeks."
 We have also been informed that the said Writ Petition is still
pending and would be listed after four weeks.
  On perusal of the order of the High Court dated 26th July, 2018
and the present Original Application, it is crystal clear that the
subject matter of the two Applications is substantially the same
except the individual Petitioners. Further, it is noteworthy that
before the High Court, it had been asserted that:
</p><p id="p_10">           "Without noticing the compliance of mandatory provisions
 of the relevant statutes by the State and its instrumentalities as illegal,
                                        3                                 HCJ &amp; SVB, J
                                                                 W.P. No.31165 of 2018




    arbitrary and unconstitutional and violative of the Statutory provisions
    of the enactments of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, Water
    (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, the Air (Prevention
    and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, Mines and Minerals (Development and
    <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_4">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957, Mineral Concession Rules, and consequently
    direct respondents 1 to 11 to cancel all the approvals, permissions,
    grants etc., made in favour of the 12th respondent."
     In the aforesaid circumstances, we are of the considered opinion

   that by name change of Petitioner is not permissible for filing of

   Petitions before two different forums when the subject matter and

   relief sought are exactly same. Filing parallel proceedings cannot

   be entertained or permitted. The instant case before the High Court

   was in the name of PIL and here in the name of Section 14 of the

   NGT Act. The controversy raised, the issue involved and the

   prayer sought does not have substantial difference.
</p>
<p id="p_11">         Consequently, Original Application No.384 of 2018 stands

   disposed of."
</p>

<p id="p_12">     To-day by a separate order in WP (PIL).No.130 of 2018 is

disposed of. Having regard to the order in WP (PIL).No.130 of

2018, the very basis for the present impugned order is removed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">Hence, the order under challenge is set aside having regard to the

order passed in WP (PIL).No.130 of 2018. The petitioner is given

liberty to workout the remedy before the National Green Tribunal

and to obtain orders as may be necessary in the appeal the

petitioner files in this behalf. It is needless to observe that

National Green Tribunal can take independent view in all the
                                     4                         HCJ &amp; SVB, J
                                                      W.P. No.31165 of 2018




interlocutory applications filed by the petitioner before it and

passes orders as may be available.
</p>

<p id="p_14">       Pending miscellaneous petitions, if any, shall also stand

closed. No order as to costs.
</p>
