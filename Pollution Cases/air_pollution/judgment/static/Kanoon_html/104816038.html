            Mr. Pawan Girdhar, Advocate
            for respondent no.1-HSPCB.
</p>
<p id="p_3">ANIL KSHETARPAL, J(Oral)

            Petition has been filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the Code of

Criminal Procedure for quashing of a criminal complaint filed by the

"Haryana State Pollution Control Board" against the petitioners herein

under <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_2">Section 39</a> of The Air (Prevention &amp; Control of Pollution), Act, 1981

(hereinafter referred to as 'the Act of 1981') and the order of summoning

passed on the same day by the Court thereon.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            Allegations against the petitioners are that they have indulged

in burning of stubble of wheat crop in violation of directions issued in

April, 2016. As per the case of the prosecution a complaint was received on

CM window dated 25.04.2016 on which a joint team inspected the land and

found that the allegations made in the complaint are correct. The complaint

was presented in Court on 16.11.2017. It has been pleaded in the complaint,

filed before the learned Judicial Magistrate, that the Committee submitted a

 CRM-M-46880-2019 (O&amp;M)                                            -2-
</p>
<p id="p_5">detailed report to the Chairman, Haryana State Pollution Control Board on

18.05.2016 and thereafter process was initiated for getting sanction which

was ultimately granted on 12.08.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              Learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the complaint

as instituted is barred under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_3">Section 468</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,

1973. For offence punishable with imprisonment for a period of upto 3

months, the period prescribed is one year for taking cognizance. Even if the

period spent for getting sanction, is excluded, still the complaint would be

barred.
</p>
<p id="p_7">              On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for the Pollution

Control Board does not dispute this factual position. However, he submits

that under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Section 473</a> Cr.P.C., the Court can extend the period of limitation

in certain cases. He, hence, submitted that this court should not exercise

jurisdiction at this stage.
</p>
<p id="p_8">              With the able assistance of learned counsels for the parties, this

Court has gone through the criminal complaint filed, Annexure P-9.

</p><p id="p_9">              From the reading of the complaint, it is apparent that no reason

for extension of time as required under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">Section 473</a> Cr.P.C. has been given.

Still further, no separate application under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">Section 473</a> Cr.P.C. has also

been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_10">              It is also undisputed that the maximum imprisonment

prescribed under the Act of 1981 is 3 months. Hence, the maximum period

within which the cognizance could be taken by the Court is one year. Even

if the date of filing of the complaint is taken as date of cognizance, still bar

as provided under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">Section 468</a> Cr.P.C. applies.

</p><p id="p_11">              Although, learned counsel for the petitioner has pressed various



                                       2 of 3

</p>
<p id="p_12">other points, however, this court is not required to go into the aforesaid

issues particularly when the complaint is prove to have been instituted after

the prescribed period.
</p>
<p id="p_13">            Keeping in view the facts, Complaint No.18 filed under <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_8">Section

39</a> read with <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_9">Section 43</a> of The Air (Prevention &amp; Control of Pollution),

Act, 1981 and the consequential proceedings arising therefrom are ordered

to be quashed, however, qua the petitioners only.

</p><p id="p_14">            Resultantly, with the above-said observations made, the instant

petition stands allowed.
