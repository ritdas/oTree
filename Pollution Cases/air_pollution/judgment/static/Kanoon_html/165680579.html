             Justice A.S. Naidu (Judicial Member)
               Dr. G.K. Pandey (Expert Member)

                                               Date: 11th October, 2011



                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       All the aforesaid (13) thirteen applications involve same
facts and point of law. The respondents in each of the case are
also one and the same and as such by consent of Learned
Counsel appearing for the parties all the cases were heard
together and are disposed of by this common judgment.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.     All these Original Applications have been filed by different
fabric bleaching and dyeing units situated at TIRUPUR in the
State of Tamil Nadu and are hosiery exports. In other words the
applicant units are involved in hosiery industry.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            3</span>
<p id="p_3"> 3.     Alleging that the units engaged in Dyeing and Bleaching
works at TIRUPUR area are discharging the industrial effluents
into river NOYYAL thereby creating water pollution to the extent
that the water of the river has become neither fit for irrigation nor
potable, and that the pollution has adversely affected the tanks
and channels situated nearby the river, a Public Interest
Litigation was filed before the Hon'ble High Court of Madras and
was registered as Writ Petition No. 29791 of 2003. In the said
writ application directions were sought for to the extent that the
dyeing units would clean the river water stored at Orathapalyan
Dam within a stipulated time with its own expenses and as an
interim measure shall not discharge their industrial effluents into
the river NOYYAL.      The case was contested by the present
applicant's as well as the State Government and the Board.
After hearing parties, the High Court of Madras passed an interim
order on 26th December, 2006. Being aggrieved the applicants
filed a petition to review the order, The Review Petition was
dismissed by the High Court on 27th December, 2007. The said
order was assailed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Civil
Appeal No. 6776 and 6777 of 2009.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.     By order dated 18th May, 2007, the Hon'ble Supre Court
stayed the order passed by the Madras High Court to the extent
that the directions to close down the industries would not be
given effect from 31st July, 2007. The said interim order was
extended time and again. The Supreme court also directed the
Board to inspect the NOYYAL River and find out whether any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            4</span>
 pollution is caused by the factories (units) in question.   After
perusing the report and considering all other materials the
Supreme Court observed as follows in para-26 of their judgment
reported in AIR 2010 Supreme Court 3645 (TIRUPUR Dyeing
Factory Owners Assocn. V/s/ Noyyal River Ayacutdars
Protection Assocn.)


       "In view of the above fact that this matter is pending
       before this Court for more than two and a half years and
       the members of the appellant Association had been
       permitted to continue their business, it is desirable that
       the members of the appellant Association should ensure
       the compliance of all the directions including the payment
       of dues etc. issued by the Court within a period of three
       months from today. They shall ensure that no pollution is
       caused to the river or dam and if cleaning operation has
       not yet been completed, it shall be completed within the
       said stipulated period".
</p>


<p id="p_5">5.     While matter stood thus two contempt petitions were filed
by NOYYAL River Ayacutdars in Madras High Court which were
registered as contempt Petition No.1013 of 2010 and 1068 of
2010 alleging non-compliance of the directions issued by the
Division Bench of the said Hon'ble High Court. The contention of
present applicant's before the Madras High Court was that they,
have in the meanwhile fulfilled the orders and directions issued
by the Division Bench by installing ultra modern equipments and
the Pollution Control Board having been satisfied with the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                          5</span>
 compliance, have issued consent to operate. The process it was
submitted being a technical process involving chemical action,
immediate and instantaneous results cannot be achieved and the
system has to settled down, for which reasonable time has to be
granted.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.     The Madras High Court in their order dated 4th January,
2011 issued following directions:
</p>
<p id="p_7">i)     All the CETPs/IETPs Bleaching &amp; Dyeing units in
       TIRUPUR area shall be closed down forthwith by the
       Pollution Control Board and the Electricity supply shall be
       disconnected.
</p><p id="p_8">ii)    Such CETPs/IETPs/Units shall not be permitted to
       operate unless and until they achieve zero liquid
       discharge as per the directions issued paragraph no.
       30(a)(ii) of the order of the Division Bench dated
       22.12.2006.
</p><p id="p_9">iii)   All CETPs/IETPs/units shall be individually inspected by a
       team of officers nominated by the Tamil Nadu Pollution
       control Board along with the members of the Monitoring
       committee and a detailed report shall be prepared
       individually for each CETPs/IETPs/Units.
</p><p id="p_10">iv)    The report shall be the sole basis to assess as to whether
       the CETPs/IETPs/Units should be granted permission to
       commence operations;
</p><p id="p_11">v)     If the CETPs/IETPs/Units are deficient or have not
       achieved the required parameters, they shall not operate
       and be directed to rectify the deficiencies and report to
       the Pollution control Baord for fresh inspection by the
       team of officers of the Board and the Monitoring
       Committee;
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                           6</span>
<p id="p_12"> vi)     In respect of the CETPs/IETPs/Units, who have fulfilled all
        the conditions, it would be open to the Tamil Nadu
        Pollution control Board to issue orders of consent to
        operate and such units shall be continuously and closely
        monitored in order to ensure strict compliance of the
        orders;
</p><p id="p_13">vii)    For the purpose of trial run for testing the efficiency of the
        equipments, the Pollution Control Board is entitled to
        issue temporary authorization to the Electricity Board for
        temporary electricity supply.          While such testing
        operations are being carried out it shall be done in the
        presence of an official of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control
        Board.
</p><p id="p_14">viii)   During the course of inspection of these CETPs/Units, if
        any extra machinery has been found to be installed or any
        pipelines have been laid, they shall be forthwith removed
        and such units shall be directed to remove that additional
        machinery from precincts of the factory premises.
</p><p id="p_15">ix)     Division Bench granted time to the units till 31.07.2007,
        failing which directed closure. This portion of the order
        was stayed by the Supreme Court and the stay remained
        in force till 06.10.2009. The Supreme Court did not
        interfere with a direction passed by the Division Bench
        and granted extension of time to comply with the
        condition by three months, this extended period came to
        an end in January, 2010. Such of those units, who have
        failed to comply with the directions of the Division Bench,
        inspite of the extension of time granted by the Supreme
        Court shall be liable to pay fine at the rates fixed in
        paragraph 30(a) (i) of the order passed by the Division
        Bench dated 22.12.2006.
</p><p id="p_16">x)      As against, the CETPs/IETPs/Units which have flouted
        the order and direction issued by this Court and
        conditions stipulated by the Tamil Nadu Pollution control
        Board and continued to cause pollution and failed to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             7</span>
        rectify the defects despite the show cause notice issued
       by the Board, shall initiate the criminal prosecution
       against such CETPs/IETPs/Units.
</p><p id="p_17">xi)    The Board shall also furnish the list of names of the
       officers of the Pollution Control Board who were in charge
       of the affairs of the Board during the relevant time when
       those CETPs/IETPs/Units failed to comply with the orders
       of this Court and the directions issued by the Pollution
       Control Board so that appropriate actions may also be
       taken against them.
</p>


<p id="p_18">7.     It appears that the contempt petitions are still pending
before the High Court of Madras. According to the applicant's,
they have installed ultra modern machineries and have also
undertaken expensive renovations/augmentation of their unit
w.r.t. pollution control measures so as to achieve 'zero liquid
discharge'.    They have approached the Tamil Nadu Pollution
Control Board (TNPCB) seeking permission to permit them to
commence operation of their plants, but then the TNPCB is
maintaining stony silence and is not granting any permission
consequently they are subjected to un-surmountable hardship
and loss. A prayer is made before this Tribunal, to direct the
respondents to permit different Applicants to commence
operation of their units as they have achieved zero liquid
discharge level, and complied with other directions set forth by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_19">8.     After    receiving   notice   the   respondents   entered
appearance and submitted their affidavits which are self

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            8</span>
 explanatory.    In course of hearing Mr. Gautam Narayan and
Anish Shah, Learned Counsel appeared on behalf of some of the
villagers and made their submissions.
</p>
<p id="p_20">9.      We heard the Counsel appearing for different parties
diligently.     We also perused the pleadings and different
documents/judgment filed by the parties meticulously.              Fact
remains there are about 754 dyeing and bleaching industries
situated in and around TIRUPUR Town.              The trade effluent
discharged by different units was admittedly treated through its
conventional treatment system but the said system does not
satisfy the total dissolve solids (TDS) limit of 2100 mg. per litre.
(mg/l) prescribed by Tamil Nadu Pollution control Board. The
sudden and rapid growth in textile sector in the Town TIRUPUR
started deteriorating the environment in as much as the trade
effluent either treated or partially treated and sometimes
untreated find its course into NOYYAL River either directly or
indirectly. Thus polluting the water of the river, ground water
and the land lying in the vicinity, leading to filing of Public Interest
Litigation in the High Court of Madras seeking directions for
prevention of pollution of NAYYAL River.           The issue, had a
chequered carrier and has travelled upto the Supreme Court and
almost attained finality, in the meanwhile, in view of different
directions issued by Hon'ble Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_21">10.     The only grievance of the applicant before this Tribunal is
with regard to the dilli dally tactics adopted by the Tamil Nadu
Pollution Control Board in not permitting the Applicants to re-
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                             9</span>
<p id="p_22"> commence operation of their units for the concentrated capacity
of 5000 kld as the applicant's have claimed to have achieved
'zero liquid discharge' by installing modern pollution control
devices.
</p>
<p id="p_23">11.    In course of hearing, however, it is found that the
applicants have only approached the District Environment
Engineer, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and requested the
said Authority to inspect their unit and permit the applicant to
resume operation.     It is well settled that the District Environment
Engineer is not the Competent Authority to grant any permit to
recommence operation of any unit. For the said purpose the
Applicant's   have    to   approach    the   Competent      Authority
individually under the Water (Prevention Control &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Pollution) Act</a>,
1974 and other Acts which are applicable to the subject matter.
The Applicant's having not approached the Competent Authority
till today, nor brought to its notice with regard to the facts that by
installing ultramodern pollution control equipments, they are able
to achieve zero discharge level, it is not possible for us to issue
any direction, to Respondent No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_24">12.    In view of the discussions made above, we dispose of all
the above applications with an observation that if the Applicant's
file suitable applications, individually seeking permission to
commence their units, before the Competent Authorities, under
the provisions of appropriate Law in vogue, the said Authority
shall consider the said applications separately conduct such
inspections as deemed just proper and necessary and if satisfied

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                            10</span>
 that the Applicant's or any of them have complied with the
directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as
Hon'ble High Court of Madras and also satisfy all the
requirements of law, pass such order/orders/direction as deemed
just proper and in accordance with the law as well the
counter/affidavit filed before this Tribunal. It is needless to say
that the units are lying closed for quite sometime and for the sake
of ends of justice and equity, warrants that the competent
Authority shall take the decision on the applications to be filed by
the Applicants, individually as expeditiously as possible.
</p>
<p id="p_25">13.     With the aforesaid observations/directions all the original
applications are disposed of.
